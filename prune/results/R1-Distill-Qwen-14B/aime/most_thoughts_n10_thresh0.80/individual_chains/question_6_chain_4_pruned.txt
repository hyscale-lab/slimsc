Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. This probably means their graphs will have some V-shape or maybe multiple V-shapes because of the nested absolute values.

Let me try to sketch or visualize f(x) and g(x).

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, which shifts it down by 1/2. So the graph of |x| - 1/2 would cross the x-axis at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. Taking the absolute value of that shifts any negative parts back up. So if |x| - 1/2 is negative, which happens between -1/2 and 1/2, the absolute value makes it positive. So f(x) would be a W-shaped graph, symmetric about the y-axis, with vertices at x=-1/2, x=0, and x=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Following the same logic, the inner |x| - 1/4 shifts the V down by 1/4. So when |x| is less than 1/4, the expression becomes negative, and taking the absolute value flips it up. So g(x) will have a similar W-shape but with vertices at x=-1/4, x=0, and x=1/4.

So f(x) has a wider W compared to g(x), which is narrower.

Now, both functions are being composed inside another function. The first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me parse that.

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, we pass this through f(x). Since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, let's see what f(sin(2πx)) would look like.

Since sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1, |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. Then, subtracting 1/2 gives |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. The absolute of that would be | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Let me denote this as f(sin(2πx)).

So f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Then, g of that would be g(f(sin(2πx))) = || f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |. Wait, no, g is ||x| -1/4|, so it's || f(...) - 1/4 |.

But then, this is multiplied by 4 to get y. So y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). So both equations involve similar compositions but with sine and cosine functions, and swapped variables.

Wait, the functions are nested like that, so perhaps I can analyze the ranges and periodicities.

Let me think about the inner functions first.

Let's consider f(sin(2πx)). Since sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, and f is symmetric, f(sin(2πx)) will also be periodic with period 1.

Similarly, cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3 in y. So, f(cos(3πy)) will have a period related to that, perhaps 2/3 as well.

But perhaps it's better to consider the composition step by step.

First, let me analyze f(sin(2πx)).

f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Let me compute this for different values.

When sin(2πx) is in [0,1], |sin(2πx)| is the same as sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) becomes | sin(2πx) - 1/2 |.

This is a V-shaped function that has a minimum at sin(2πx) = 1/2, where f is 0. The function increases as you move away from 1/2.

Similarly, when sin(2πx) is in [-1,0], |sin(2πx)| = -sin(2πx), so f(sin(2πx)) becomes | -sin(2πx) - 1/2 | = | -(sin(2πx) + 1/2) | = | sin(2πx) + 1/2 |.

So f(sin(2πx)) is a function that varies between 0 and 3/2, right? Let me check:

When sin(2πx) is 1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When sin(2πx) is 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When sin(2πx) = -1, f(-1) = | -1 - 1/2 | = 3/2.

Wait, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, when sin(2πx) is 1, |sin(2πx)| =1, so f(1)= |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When sin(2πx) is 0, |0|=0, so f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When sin(2πx) is -1, |sin(2πx)| = 1, so f(-1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, because when sin(2πx) is negative, f(sin(2πx)) is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |, which is the same as when it's positive. So f(sin(2πx)) always produces | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. So the maximum value occurs when |sin(2πx)| is as large as possible, but subtracting 1/2. Wait, but when |sin(2πx)| is 1, the expression is |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is 0, it's |0 - 1/2
