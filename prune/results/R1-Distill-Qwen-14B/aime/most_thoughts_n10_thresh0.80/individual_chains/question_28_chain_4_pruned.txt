Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, what do I know about the tetrahedron? The edges are given in a symmetric way: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. So, this seems like a symmetrical tetrahedron, maybe a kind of "isohedral" one, but not necessarily regular.

Hmm, perhaps this is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons are called "equifacial" or maybe "isosceles tetrahedrons." In such cases, there are properties that can help compute volume and surface area.

I recall that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c² - d²)(a² + c² - b² - d²)(b² + c² - a² - d²)))/72

Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths a, b, c opposite each other, there might be a formula involving the edges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this tetrahedron in coordinate space. Maybe assign coordinates to the vertices such that the symmetries are maintained, making the calculations easier.

Let me try that approach.

Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D coordinate system. Let me assume that the tetrahedron has vertices at points A, B, C, D.

Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can position the points such that the coordinates are symmetric.

Let me consider that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide, which is a property of isosceles tetrahedrons. So, perhaps I can set the coordinates such that the centroid is at the origin.

Alternatively, maybe set the points as follows:

Let me denote the coordinates as:
A = (x, y, z)
B = (-x, -y, z)
C = (-x, y, -z)
D = (x, -y, -z)

This way, the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to all axes. Let me see if this works.

So, let's compute the distances.

AB: distance between A and B.
A = (x, y, z), B = (-x, -y, z)
AB = sqrt[(x - (-x))² + (y - (-y))² + (z - z)²] = sqrt[(2x)² + (2y)² + 0] = 2√(x² + y²)
Given that AB = √41, so 2√(x² + y²) = √41 => √(x² + y²) = √41 / 2 => x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, compute AC: between A = (x, y, z) and C = (-x, y, -z)
AC = sqrt[(x - (-x))² + (y - y)² + (z - (-z))²] = sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = 2√(x² + z²)
Given AC = √80, so 2√(x² + z²) = √80 => √(x² + z²) = √80 / 2 = (4√5)/2 = 2√5, so x² + z² = (2√5)^2 = 20.

Similarly, compute AD: between A = (x, y, z) and D = (x, -y, -z)
AD = sqrt[(x - x)^2 + (y - (-y))^2 + (z - (-z))^2] = sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2√(y² + z²)
Given AD = √89, so 2√(y² + z²) = √89 => √(y² + z²) = √89 / 2 => y² + z² = 89/4.

So, now I have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4
2. x² + z² = 20
3. y² + z² = 89/4

I can solve these equations for x², y², z².

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4 => z² - y² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.

Similarly, equation 3 is y² + z² = 89/4.

So, let me write:

From equation 2 - equation 1: z² - y² = 39/4. Let's call this equation 4.

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

Add equation 3 and equation 4: (z² - y²) + (y² + z²) = 39/4 + 89/4 => 2z² = 128/4 = 32 => z² = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4.

Since we are dealing with coordinates, the sign doesn't matter; the distance is the same. Let's take z = 4.

Then, from equation 4: z² - y² = 39/4 => 16 - y² = 39/4 => y² = 16 - 39/4 = (64/4 - 39/4) = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or y = -5/2.

Similarly, from equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4 => x² + 25/4 = 41/4 => x² = (41 -25)/4 = 16/4 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2.

So now, we have x = 2, y = 5/2, z = 4.

So, the coordinates are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)
B = (-2, -5/2, 4)
C = (-2, 5/2, -4)
D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me confirm that:

From our initial setup, A = (x, y, z) = (2, 5/2, 4)
B = (-x, -y, z) = (-2, -5/2, 4)
C = (-x, y, -z) = (-2, 5/2, -4)
D = (x, -y, -z) = (2, -5/2, -4)

Yes, that looks consistent.

Now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.

The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates is:

V = |( (B - A) · (C - A) × (D - A) )| / 6

So, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, actually, it's the scalar triple product of vectors from point A to B, C, D.

So, vectors:

AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 -4) = (-4, -5, 0)
AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)
AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

So, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8)

Now, compute the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD).

First, compute the cross product AC × AD.

Let me compute that.

AC × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4   0   -8
              0   -5   -8

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*( (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ) + k*( (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 )

Compute each component:

i-component: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40

j-component: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [ 32 - 0 ] = -32

k-component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB = (-4, -5, 0)
Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):

(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, the scalar triple product is 320.

Therefore, the volume V = |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, V = 160/3.

Now, I need to compute the total surface area S. Each face is a triangle, and since the tetrahedron is symmetrical, all faces are congruent? Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me check.

Wait, in our setup, each face is a triangle with edges of lengths √41, √80, √89, but no, each face is a triangle with sides from the given edges.

Wait, actually, each face is opposite to a set of edges. Wait, perhaps each face has edges of different lengths. Let me verify.

In our coordinate setup, each face
