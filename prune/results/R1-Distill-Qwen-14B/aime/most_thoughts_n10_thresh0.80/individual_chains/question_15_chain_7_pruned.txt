Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, so the total number of steps is 16. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction, which is C(16,8). But this problem adds a twist: they must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean? I think it means that the path alternates between moving right and up, and the number of times it switches from right to up or up to right is four. Let me clarify.

In a grid path, each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or vice versa. So, if a path starts by moving right, the first change would be to up, the second change back to right, and so on. Each change counts as a switch in direction.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that affect the structure of the path? Let me think. Each direction change would split the path into segments. For example, if you start by moving right, then up, then right, then up, and so on. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or upwards.

The number of segments would be the number of direction changes plus one. So, four changes would mean five segments. Since you can start either right or up, that affects the number of segments in each direction.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, do you have the same number of right and up segments? Because you have to end at the upper right corner, so maybe it depends on whether you start with right or up.

Let me think: suppose the path starts with a right move. Then the segments alternate between right and up. Since there are five segments (from four direction changes), the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with up, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up. So three up segments and two right segments.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, the total right steps are 8 and the total up steps are 8. So, for the case where you have three right segments and two up segments, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the up segments must be 8.

Similarly, if you have three up segments and two right segments, the same applies.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the 8 right steps into 3 segments and the 8 up steps into 2 segments, plus the same but with right and up swapped.

So, let's model this. For each case (starting with right or starting with up), we'll compute the number of paths and then sum them.

Case 1: Starting with right, ending with right.
