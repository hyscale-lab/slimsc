Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So N is a four-digit number, the largest such number, with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, and so on, each of which should be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q and R where N = 1000Q + R, and sum Q and R.

Alright, let's start by thinking about N. It's a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We're looking for the largest N, so ideally, N is as close to 9999 as possible, but it needs to satisfy that condition about changing any digit to 1.

Let me consider how a number changes when a digit is replaced by 1. Each digit is in a specific place, so changing a digit affects the number by a certain amount. For example, changing the thousands digit from, say, 9 to 1 reduces the number by 8000. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit from 9 to 1 would reduce it by 800, and so on.

But the important part is that after this change, the number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit, the number N minus the change (which is the digit minus 1 times the place value) must be a multiple of 7.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as N minus some delta equals 7k, where delta is the amount we subtract when we change a digit to 1.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose N is a four-digit number, N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change the thousands digit to 1, we get 1bcd, which is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. For this to be divisible by 7, we have:

1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1: a1cd = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing the tens digit: ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Changing the units digit: abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Alternatively, since N is the original number, when we change a digit to 1, the difference between N and the modified number is (digit - 1) * place value. For example, changing the thousands digit: N' = N - (a - 1)*1000. Similarly, for other digits.

We can write each condition as N - (digit - 1)*place ≡ 0 mod 7. Because N' = N - (digit - 1)*place, and N' must be 0 mod 7.

Wait, let's see. When we change a digit, say the thousands digit, to 1, the new number is N' = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. So N' = N - (a - 1)*1000.

So N - (a - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly for other digits:

- Changing hundreds digit: N - (b - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

- Changing tens digit: N - (c - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

- Changing units digit: N - (d - 1)*1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So each of these four expressions must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, for all four digits:

1. N - (a - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. N - (b - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. N - (c - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. N - (d - 1)*1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these gives a congruence condition on N.

Alternatively, we can write:

1. N ≡ (a - 1)*1000 mod 7.

2. N ≡ (b - 1)*100 mod 7.

3. N ≡ (c - 1)*10 mod 7.
