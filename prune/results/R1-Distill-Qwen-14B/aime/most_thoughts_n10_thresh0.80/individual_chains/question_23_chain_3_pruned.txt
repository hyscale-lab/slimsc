Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, I think BD is one of the diagonals, right?

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Okay.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. The hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so the center is at (0,0). So, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which makes sense because the rhombus is centered there.

Let me denote the points A, B, C, D as being on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals are the lines AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, and similarly for B and D.

So, let's say point A is (x1, y1), then point C would be (-x1, -y1). Similarly, point B could be (x2, y2), then point D would be (-x2, -y2). So, all four points are determined by two pairs of points: A and C, B and D.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe we can use that property.
