Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me first make sure I understand it correctly.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing line AD, which intersects the circumcircle again at P. We need to find AP.

First, I think I should find some properties of triangle ABC. Maybe compute its circumradius because it might come in handy later. To find the circumradius, I can use the formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)

Where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. Let me compute the area first using Heron's formula.

The sides are a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

Compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Area, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12(12 - 9)(12 - 10)(12 - 5)] = sqrt[12 * 3 * 2 * 7]

Compute this: 12 * 3 = 36, 36 * 2 = 72, 72 * 7 = 504. So sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt[504]. Let's see: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31.5 is 504, but perhaps better to factor it into primes.

504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 is 126, divided by 2 is 63. 63 is 7 * 9, which is 7 * 3^2. So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt[504] = sqrt[2^3 * 3^2 *7] = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, sqrt[2^3 * 3^2 *7] = 2^(3/2)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, correct because (sqrt(14))^2 is 14, and 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14), so 6*sqrt(14). So area is 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Let me rationalize the denominator: 75√14 / (4 * 14) = 75√14 / 56.

So R = 75√14 / 56. Hmm, not sure if this is correct. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, a=9, b=10, c=5. So product is 9*10*5=450. The area is 6√14, so 4*Δ is 24√14. So R = 450/(24√14) = (450/24)/√14 = (75/4)/√14. Then, multiply numerator and denominator by √14: 75√14 / (4 * 14) = 75√14 / 56. Yes, correct.

But maybe there's another way to approach this problem without directly computing the circumradius. Hmm.

I remember that for a point outside a circle, the tangent from that point to the circle has equal lengths. So, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, then DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC.

Also, point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps on some other significant line. Alternatively, D is the exsimilicenter or something else.

Alternatively, I might think about using power of a point. The point D lies outside the circle ω, and DB and DC are tangent to ω. So, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC².

Also, since AD intersects ω again at P, then AP * AD = power of A with respect to ω? Wait, no. Wait, power of point A with respect to ω is zero because A is on ω.
