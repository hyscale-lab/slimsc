Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B. The value of r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. Find p+q."

Alright, so the problem is about finding the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the square of the radius of the smallest such sphere, express it as a reduced fraction, and then add the numerator and denominator.

Hmm, okay. So, rectangular boxes have length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. So, for each box, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the box completely, so the sphere's diameter must be at least as long as the box's diagonal. Therefore, the radius r would be half of that diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. So, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, our goal is to find the minimum possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, but actually, we need the maximum of x² + y² + z² because the sphere must contain all such boxes. Wait, no, the sphere has to contain each box, but the sphere's radius is determined by the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, we need the maximum possible value of the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), hence the maximum x² + y² + z², because the radius is half of that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, no. Because the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes." So, the sphere must be big enough to contain every box in B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) across all boxes in B, and then take half of that as the radius.

But wait, is that correct? Wait, if we have multiple boxes, each with different x, y, z, each satisfying the surface area and volume constraints, the sphere must contain all of them. So, the sphere must have a radius equal to the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B divided by 2. So, the sphere's radius is determined by the box with the largest space diagonal.

Wait, but perhaps not. Maybe the sphere must contain all boxes regardless of their orientation. Hmm, but no, the sphere's position is fixed relative to the box, since the box is centered at the sphere's center. So, the sphere's radius must be at least the maximum of (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need the minimal r such that r is at least (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2 for all boxes in B. Therefore, r must be equal to the maximum of (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2 over all boxes in B.

So, in order to find r, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x
