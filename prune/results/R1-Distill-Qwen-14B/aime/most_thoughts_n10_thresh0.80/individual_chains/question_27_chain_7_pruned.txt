Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius of the torus is 6, and the minor radius is 3. Got that.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Finally, I have to find m + n.

Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and the minor radius r (radius of the generating circle). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they're tangent along another circle. I think this tangency implies that the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus is equal to the sum or difference of their radii, but I might need to think more carefully about it.

Wait, the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is a surface, not a solid, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's radius will be larger than the torus's "size". But how exactly does their tangency work?

Let me consider the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, touching along a circle. The point of tangency must lie on both surfaces. So, perhaps the center of the sphere and the center of the generating circle of the torus must lie along the same line, and the distance between their centers is equal to 11 minus some distance related to the torus.

Hmm, I remember that the equation for a torus can be written in 3D coordinates, but maybe there's a simpler way without getting into that. Maybe using geometry.

Let me think about the cross-section. If I take a cross-section through the axis of the torus, I'll see a circle of radius R (which is 6) with another circle of radius r (3) rotating around it. Wait, actually, in cross-section, it's a square-like shape, but maybe better to think in terms of the maximum and minimum distances from the center.

The maximum distance from the center of the torus to any point on the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9. The minimum distance is R - r = 6 - 3 = 3.

So, if the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11. The distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must be such that the farthest point of the torus from the sphere's center is exactly 11.

Wait, no, because when the torus is tangent internally, the sphere's surface touches the torus at a circle. So, the maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is exactly 11. But the torus's points vary in their distance from the torus's center.

Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O, and the center of the generating circle of the torus as point C. The distance between O and C is, let's call it d. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the farthest point on the torus from O is 11. The farthest point on the torus from O would be along the line connecting O and C, at a distance of d + R + r = d + 6 + 3 = d + 9.

But wait, that point must be exactly 11, because that's the sphere's radius. So, d + 9 = 11. Therefore, d = 2.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If the sphere is centered at O, and the torus's center is at C, which is at distance d from O. The torus has points that are R + r away from C, so in the direction away from O, the maximum distance would be d + R + r = d + 9. Since this must equal the sphere's radius, which is 11, so d is 2. Similarly, if the torus were on the outside, the closest point would be d - R + r = d - 3, but wait, no, perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, when the torus is externally tangent, it's outside the sphere. So, in that case, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be exactly 11. The closest point on the torus would be in the direction towards O, which is along the line connecting O and C. The distance from O to that closest point is d - (R + r) = d - 9. But since the torus is externally tangent, this distance must equal the sphere's radius, 11. Wait, that can't be, because d - 9 = 11 would imply d = 20, which seems large, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, no. When the torus is externally tangent, the sphere is inside the torus, right? Or is it the other way around? Wait, actually, when the torus is on the outside, meaning it's enclosing the sphere. So, the sphere is inside the torus, touching it at a circle. So, the sphere's radius would be smaller, but wait, the sphere has a fixed radius of 11.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me clarify: the torus can rest on the inside of the sphere, meaning it's entirely inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Or it can rest on the outside of the sphere, meaning it's outside, touching along a circle. But the sphere's radius is 11, which is fixed.

Wait, no, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent. So, the torus is inside the sphere, touching along a circle. Conversely, when it rests on the outside of S, the torus is outside the sphere, touching along a circle. So, in both cases, the sphere remains fixed, and the torus is either inside or outside, touching it.

Wait, that might be the case. So, the sphere is fixed, radius 11, and the torus can be placed either inside or outside, tangent along a circle. So, in the internal case, the torus is inside the sphere, and the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the sphere and torus touch at a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, but the sphere is fixed, so how does that work?

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the torus can be placed such that it is tangent to the sphere either from the inside or the outside, regardless of the sphere's fixed position.

So, in the internal tangent case, the torus is inside the sphere. The distance between the centers (O and C) must be such that the torus just touches the sphere. Similarly, in the external tangent case, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11. So when the torus is inside, the sphere's center is at O, and the torus's center is at C. The maximum distance from O to any point on the torus is 11. That maximum distance would be along the line connecting O and C, in the direction away from O. So, the point on the torus farthest from O would be in the direction away from O, at a distance of OC + R + r. But since that's equal to 11, OC + 6 + 3 = 11. So, OC = 11 - 9 = 2. So, the center of the generating circle of the torus is 2 units away from the sphere's center.

Similarly, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, the minimum distance from O to the torus is 11. The closest point on the torus to O would be along the line towards C, at a distance of OC - (R + r). But wait, if the torus is outside, then actually the closest point would be OC - (R - r), no, wait. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me model the torus as a surface of revolution. The equation of the torus can be written in 3D as:

((√(x² + y²)
