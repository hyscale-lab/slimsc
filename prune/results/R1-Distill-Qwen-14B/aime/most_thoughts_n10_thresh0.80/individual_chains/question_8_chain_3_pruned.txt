Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I notice that the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, so the variables sum up to 300. The second equation, though, is quadratic and involves products of the variables. That makes me think that maybe there's a way to factor or simplify it.

Looking at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, I can try to factor it. Let me see... Each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, maybe I can factor by grouping.

Let me group the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So putting it all together:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, I remember that sometimes in symmetric equations, it's helpful to use symmetry or substitute variables. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express some terms in terms of the sum.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

So, in each of the grouped terms, for example, (b + c) is equal to S - a, because a + b + c = S. Similarly, (a + c) = S - b, and (a + b) = S - c.

So substituting these into the expression:

a²(S - a) + b²(S - b) + c²(S - c)

Which simplifies to:

S(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So the second equation becomes:

S(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

But we know S is 300, so substituting that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that seems a bit cleaner. So the equation is now:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate this equation to the original sum a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S and other symmetric sums.

I recall that for symmetric sums, there are formulas that relate sums of powers to each other. Let me try to recall them.

First, the square of the sum S = (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, we can write a² + b² + c² = S² - 2(ab + ac + bc). Since S is 300, let's compute that.

So, a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc). Let me denote the sum ab + ac + bc as Q for simplicity. So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q.

Similarly, for the sum of cubes, a³ + b³ + c³, there's a formula as well. I think it's (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So, substituting S and Q:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3abc. Since S is 300, that becomes 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3abc.

Let me compute 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3abc.

Now, going back to the equation we had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting the expressions in terms of Q and abc:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me calculate each part:

First term: 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

Second term: 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3abc.

Putting it all together:

[27,000,000 - 600 Q] - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600 Q + 900 Q = 300 Q.

So, left with:

300 Q - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100 Q - abc = 2,000,000.

So now, we have a new equation:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so the equation simplifies to 100Q - abc = 2,000,000.

Now, we have variables a, b, c, nonnegative integers, such that a + b + c = 300, and 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

This seems a bit more manageable, but still not straightforward. Maybe I can find a substitution or think of it differently.

Let me denote t = abc. Then, 100Q = t + 2,000,000. So, Q = (t + 2,000,000)/100 = t/100 + 20,000.

But I also know that Q = ab + ac + bc, and since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can find a relationship between Q and t.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a cubic equation in terms of a, b, c. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps some of them have to be zero or take specific values.

Wait, another approach: perhaps assume two variables are equal or fix one variable and see if the equation holds.

Alternatively, maybe consider substituting variables. Let me think.

Wait, if I let x = a, y = b, z = c, then x + y + z = 300, and 100(xy + xz + yz) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Is there a way to factor this?

Alternatively, perhaps factor the equation 100(xy + xz + yz) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange:

xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm. Maybe factor this expression.

Wait, perhaps factor it as (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to factor this expression. Let's see:

Let me consider the equation:

xyz - 100(xy + xz + yz) + 2,000,000 = 0.

I think this can be rewritten by adding and subtracting 1,000,000.

Wait, let me think about it: Maybe express it as (x - 1
