Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to be exactly length 16. Wait, that makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so to go from one corner to the other, you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights and 8 ups.

But the twist here is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out how many such paths exist. The examples shown probably have four direction changes, but since I don't have the examples, I'll have to think abstractly.

First, let me clarify what a direction change means. In a grid path, you can only move right or up. So each time you switch from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So the number of direction changes is the number of times you switch between right and up moves.

For example, if you start by moving right multiple times, then switch to up, that's one change. If you then switch back to right, that's another change, and so on. So for a path with exactly four direction changes, how does that structure look?

Let me think about the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So if a path has four direction changes, that means there are five runs in total. Because each direction change starts a new run. For example, if you have R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, R, that's four direction changes and five runs.

Wait, but in this case, the path starts at the lower left corner, which is a corner, so the first move is either right or up. Similarly, the last move has to be the other direction because the upper right corner is the destination. So for an 8x8 grid, the path must start with right and end with up, or start with up and end with right. Wait no, actually, the path can start with either direction, but it's constrained by the grid. Because the grid is square, but the starting point is the lower left, which is (0,0), and the endpoint is (8,8). So to get from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right and 8 up moves, but the order can vary.

But regardless, the number of direction changes is four. So the number of runs is five. Now, each run alternates between right and up. So if the first run is right, the second is up, third is right, fourth is up, fifth is right. Or the first run could be up, then right, then up, then right, then up.

Wait, but in either case, the number of runs is five, and the number of direction changes is four. So the number of runs is direction changes plus one.

Now, for such a path, the number of runs is five, and each run alternates directions. So let's model this.

Each path with four direction changes must consist of five runs, alternating between right and up. Each run has a certain number of steps—right or up. So the total number of right steps is 8, and the total number of up steps is 8.

So, depending on whether the first run is right or up, the runs alternate. So let's suppose the first run is right. Then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. Each of these runs has a certain number of steps. Let me denote the lengths of these runs as r1, u1, r2, u2, r3.

Similarly, if the first run is up, the runs are U, R, U, R, U, with lengths u1, r1, u2, r2, u3.

In both cases, the sum of the runs for right steps is 8, and the sum for up steps is 8.

So, for the first case, starting with right:

r1 + r2 + r3 = 8

u1 + u2 = 8

Similarly, for the case starting with up:

u1 + u2 + u3 =8

r1 + r2 =8

But since the number of runs is five, which is odd, starting with right and ending with right, or starting with up and ending with up. Wait, but in our problem, the path must end at (8,8), so if we start with right, the last run is right, which would require that the last step is right. Similarly, if we start with up, the last step is up.

But from (0,0) to (8,8), you can end with either right or up because both would land you at (8,8). So both starting with right and starting with up are possible.

Wait, but in the grid, each step is either right or up. So regardless of the starting direction, the path can end with either direction. But for starting with right, the path would end with right if there's an odd number of runs, i.e., five runs. Because starting with right, each pair of runs adds a right and up. So five runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So the last run is R. Similarly, starting with up and five runs would end with U.

Wait, but (8,8) can be reached by a path that ends with either right or up. So both starting with right and ending with right, or starting with up and ending with up are possible.

So, in both cases, the total number of steps is 16, as required.

But in our problem, the number of direction changes is four, which results in five runs. So the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to partition the right steps into runs and the up steps into runs, depending on whether we start with right or up.

So, the first case: starting with right, ending with right. So runs: R, U, R, U, R.

Each of these runs must have at least one step. Because you can't have a run of zero; that would mean no movement in that direction, which contradicts the need to reach (8,8). So each run must have at least one step.

Therefore, for the right runs: r1, r2, r3 ≥1, sum to 8.

Similarly, for the up runs: u1, u2 ≥1, sum to 8.

The number of ways to partition the right steps into 3 runs (since 5 runs starting with R, ending with R, so 3 R runs and 2 U runs) is equal to the number of compositions of
