Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. That is, compute the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) mod 1000.

Hmm, first, I should recall what roots of unity are. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots, right? So, ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct 13th roots of unity.

Wait, but ω^0 is 1, right? So when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Hmm, so the first term in the product is 1. That's a good start because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.

So, the product simplifies to 1 * ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Now, I need to compute this product for k=1 to 12.

Let me think about the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of something else.

Hmm, let me see. Let's consider that ω^k is a root of the equation x^13 = 1. So, maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are these ω^k, and see if the given expression can be related to that.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}... that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me rewrite it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. So, it's equal to ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Is there a way to factor this quadratic? Let me try to factor it.

Let me denote x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. Let's see if this factors. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, it factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1 - i)(x - 1 + i).

So, substituting back x = ω^k, we have ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2 = (ω^k - 1 - i)(ω^k - 1 + i).

So, now, the product becomes ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - 1 - i)(ω^k - 1 + i).

Hmm, so that product is equal to [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - 1 - i)] * [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - 1 + i)].

So, that's the same as [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that for roots of unity, the product over k=1 to n-1 of (x - ω^k) is equal to the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x), but wait, no—actually, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive nth roots of unity. For prime n, like 13, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But in this case, we have products over all the roots except 1, so ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k) = Φ_13(x). Because the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots is degree 12, and that product is exactly Φ_13(x). So Φ_13(x) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But wait, no. Wait, Φ_p(x) for prime p is (x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + ... + x + 1), correct.

So, in this case, ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k) = Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

So, if I set x = 1 + i, then ∏_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - ω^k) = Φ_13(1 + i). Similarly, ∏_{k=1}^{12} (1 - i - ω^k) = Φ_13(1 - i).

Wait, but actually, in our earlier step, we have ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} ( -(1 + i - ω^k) ) = (-1)^{12} ∏_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - ω^k) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (1 + i - ω^k). Since (-1)^12 is 1.

Similarly, ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (1 - i - ω^k).

So, the product becomes Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i).

So, now, I need to compute Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i).

But Φ_13(x) is (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / i.

Similarly, Φ_13(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute Φ_
