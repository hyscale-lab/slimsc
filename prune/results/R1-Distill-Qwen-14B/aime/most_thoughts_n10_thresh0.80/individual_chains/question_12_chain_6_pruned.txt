Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. First, when reading the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when reading the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. Let me try to understand why that example works.

In the example, reading left to right, the top number is 008, which is 8, and the bottom number is 991. Adding them together gives 8 + 991 = 999, which matches the first condition. For the second condition, reading top to bottom, the first column is 0 and 9, which makes 09 or 9. The second column is 0 and 9, making 09 or 9 again. The third column is 8 and 1, making 81. Adding those together: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which fits the second condition.

So, the grid has three columns and two rows. Each column contributes to one digit of the vertical numbers, and each row contributes to the horizontal numbers. Let me denote the grid as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row forms the number abc, and the bottom row forms def. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. Additionally, the vertical numbers are ad, be, and cf, and their sum should be 99.

Starting with the horizontal condition: abc + def = 999. Since abc and def are both three-digit numbers (except if they start with zero, but they can be considered as three-digit numbers with leading zeros, like 008 as in the example), their sum is 999.

Similarly, the vertical condition: ad + be + cf = 99. Each of ad, be, and cf are two-digit numbers, perhaps with leading zeros, so they can be from 00 to 99.

I need to find the number of possible assignments of digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) such that both conditions are satisfied.

Let me break down the problem into equations.

First, let's express abc and def numerically. The number abc is 100a + 10b + c, and def is 100d + 10e + f. So the first condition is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, the vertical numbers ad, be, and cf are:

ad = 10a + d,
be = 10b + e,
cf = 10c + f.

Their sum is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me write both equations:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, so I have two equations with six variables. Let me see if I can find a way to relate these equations.

Looking at Equation 1 and Equation 2, maybe I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate some variables.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Calculating the left side:

100a -10a + 10b -10b + c -10c + 100d -d + 10e -e + f -f.

Simplify each term:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d + 9e + 0f.

So, 90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900.

Factor out 9:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

So that's Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, interesting. Now, I have Equation 3 and Equation 2. Let me write them again.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

I wonder if I can express some variables in terms of others. Let's see.

From Equation 3: 10a +11d + e - c = 100.

I can write this as (10a + d) + 10d + e - c = 100.

Wait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express e in terms of 10a -c +11d.

From Equation 3: e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

So e = (c -10a) + (100 -11d).

Hmm, I can substitute this into Equation 2. Let's try that.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Substitute e:

10a + d + 10b + (100 -10a + c -11d) + 10c + f = 99.

Let me expand this:

10a + d +10b +100 -10a + c -11d +10c + f = 99.

Simplify term by term:

10a -10a = 0.

d -11d = -10d.

10b remains.

100 remains.

c +10c =11c.

f remains.

So, overall:

0 + (-10d) +10b +100 +11c +f = 99.

Which simplifies to:

-10d +10b +11c +f +100 =99.

Subtract 100 from both sides:

-10d +10b +11c +f = -1.

Hmm, that's Equation 4: -10d +10b +11c +f = -1.

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can rearrange it.

Equation 4: 10b +11c -10d +f = -1.

Wait, the left side is 10b +11c -10d +f. Hmm, perhaps rearrange to get f in terms of others.

f = -1 -10b -11c +10d.

But f must be a digit between 0 and 9, so the right side must be between 0 and 9.

Hmm, so f = 10d -10b -11c -1.

Wait, that's f = (10d -10b) - (11c +1).

Hmm, let's write f = 10(d - b) -11c -1.

Since f is a digit, 0 ≤ f ≤9.

Therefore:

0 ≤ 10(d - b) -11c -1 ≤9.

Let me note that.

So 10(d - b) -11c -1 must be ≥0 and ≤9.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find another way.

Let me think about the digits. Each digit is from 0 to 9, so perhaps I can find possible ranges for variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the original equations and think about the digits in terms of their contributions.

Starting with the horizontal equation: abc + def = 999.

Since abc and def are three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, each of abc and def can be from 000 to 999. But when added together, they give 999.

Similarly, the vertical sum is ad + be + cf =99, which is a two-digit sum for each column.

Wait, 99 is the sum of three two-digit numbers. So each of ad, be, and cf can be from 00 to 99, and their sum is 99.

Hmm, maybe I can think about the vertical sum first.

Let me denote:

ad + be + cf =99.

Each of ad, be, cf is a two-digit number, so each can be from 00 to 99. So, their sum can be up to 297 (99+99+99). But in this problem, their sum is 99. So, the average per column is about 33. So, each of ad, be, cf is likely a two-digit number less than, say, 50.

But perhaps more importantly, since they add up to 99, maybe we can consider all possible triples (ad, be, cf) such that their sum is 99, and then see how that affects the horizontal equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a system of equations and find variables step by step.

Let me think about the horizontal equation: abc + def =999.

This can be written as (100a +10b +c) + (100d +10e +f) =999.

Which simplifies to 100a +10b +c +100d +10e +f =999.

Which can be written as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm, 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 +9.

So, if I let S1 = a + d,

S2 = b + e,

S3 = c + f.

Then, 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

Which implies:

100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

Which means, S1, S2, S3 are digits? Wait, S1 is a + d, where a and d are digits (0-9), so S1 can be from 0 to 18.

Similarly, S2 and S3 can be from 0 to 18.

Wait, but 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 must be exactly 999.

So, let's look at the thousands place: 100*S1 must contribute to the thousands place, but 999 is less than 1000, so 100*S1 must be less than 1000. Since S1 is up to 18, 100*18=1800, which is more than 999, but in our case, 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3=999.

So, let's think about 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999.

We can write this as:

(100*S1) + (10*S2) + S3 = 999.

Which can be broken down into digits:

- The units digit comes from S3, which must be equal to the units digit of 999, which is 9.

So, S3 ≡9 mod 10, which implies that S3 can be 9 or 19, but since S3 = c + f, and c and f are digits (0-9), their sum can be at most 18. So S3 can only be 9 or 19, but 19 is possible only if c + f =19, which requires c=9 and f=10, which is impossible because f is a digit.

Wait, wait, hold on. c and f are digits, so their maximum sum is 9+9=18. So, S3 can only be 9 or 19, but 19 is not possible. So S3 must be 9.

Therefore, S3=9.

So, c + f =9.

So, that's a key point. Now, moving up to the tens place.

In the equation, 10*S2 is contributing to the tens place, but we also have any carry-over from S3.

Wait, but wait, since 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3 =999, and S3=9, then 100*S1 +10*S2 +9=999.

Which implies 100*S1 +10*S2 =990.

Dividing both sides by 10: 10*S1 + S2 =99.

So, 10*S1 + S2 =99.

This is another equation.

Similarly, 10*S1 + S2=99.

Again, S1 and S2 are sums of digits, so S1 can be from 0 to 18, S2 from 0 to 18.

We can write this as 10*S1 + S2 =99.

Which implies that S2 =99 -10*S1.

But since S2 must be a non-negative integer, 99 -10*S1 >=0.

So, 10*S1 <=99 => S1 <=9.9. Since S1 is integer, S1 <=9.

Similarly, S1 >=0.

So, S1 can be from 0 to9.

Additionally, S2 must be equal to 99 -10*S1, and since S
