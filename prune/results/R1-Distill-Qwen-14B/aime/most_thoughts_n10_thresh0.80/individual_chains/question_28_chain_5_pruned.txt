Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, and then express that distance in a certain form and find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the inradius in a triangle. So, this point I is the incenter, and the distance is the inradius.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is related to the volume of the tetrahedron and its surface area. The formula for the inradius (r) is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Wait, is it 3V over the surface area? Yeah, because in 3D, the volume can be thought of as the sum of the volumes of four smaller tetrahedrons, each with the inradius as their height and the face areas as their bases. So, V = (1/3) * r * (sum of face areas). Therefore, r = 3V / (sum of face areas).

So, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A, which is the sum of the areas of all four triangular faces.

First, let me note down the edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41
AC = BD = √80
BC = AD = √89

So, the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal. That suggests that it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it's a "balanced" tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron might have some properties that make it easier to compute volume and surface area.

I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, this is a disphenoid. I remember that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If opposite edges are equal, does that make the faces congruent?

Wait, each face is a triangle with edges of different lengths: For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC with lengths √41, √89, and √80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: √41, √80, √89. So, yes, all faces have edges of the same lengths, so the four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Therefore, the area of each face is the same. So, the total surface area A is 4 times the area of one face.

That's a useful simplification.

So, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's choose triangle ABC. The sides are a = √41, b = √89, c = √80.

To compute the area, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute s:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

Wait, that's going to get messy. Maybe there's a smarter way since all the edges are squared numbers? Let's see:

Wait, 41, 80, 89. Hmm, 41 is prime, 80 is 16*5, 89 is prime. Hmm, not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe these triangles are right-angled? Let's check if a² + b² = c² for any permutation.

Check for triangle ABC:

AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80.

Check if 41 + 80 = 89?

41 + 80 = 121, and 89² is 7921, which is way larger than 121. So, no.

Wait, 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². But the third side is √89, which is approximately 9.43, and 11 is much bigger. So, no, not a right triangle.

Wait, maybe another combination? Maybe 41 + 89 = 130, which is not a square. 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13². Oh! So, 80 + 89 = 169. So, in triangle ABC, sides √80, √89, and √41. Wait, but 80 + 89 is 169, which is 13², but in the triangle, the sides are √80, √89, and √41. So, the sum of √80² + √89² is 80 + 89 = 169 = 13². But the third side is √41, which is much smaller. Hmm, so that would not make it a right triangle.

Wait, maybe I misapplied. The triangle sides are √41, √80, √89. So, if we square them, we get 41, 80, 89. Now, 41 + 80 = 121 = 11², but 89 is less than 11². Hmm, so that doesn't help.

Alternatively, 41 + 89 = 130, which isn't a square. 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13². Wait, so in the triangle, the sides squared are 41, 80, 89. So, 80 + 89 = 1
