Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different walking speeds and the time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let me parse the information step by step. First, when she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours is 240 minutes. Hmm, but the problem says t minutes, so maybe I should convert everything into hours or minutes to be consistent.

Wait, maybe better to work in hours for the walking time and add t minutes at the end. Let me think: when she walks at s km/h, the time she spends walking is 9/s hours, right? Because time equals distance divided by speed. Then, she spends t minutes in the coffee shop, which is t/60 hours. So the total time is 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. The coffee shop time is still t minutes, so the total time is 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Wait, 2 hours and 24 minutes is
