Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We’re given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize the problem first. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents? Wait, tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the exsimilicenter or the point where the two tangents meet. Point D is outside the circle, right?

Then, line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, starting from A, going through D, and intersecting the circle at P.

We need to find AP. So, AP is a segment from A to P on the circle, passing through D.

Let me think about what theorems or properties I can use here. Since we have tangents to a circle, maybe the power of a point would be helpful. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the tangent from D to ω. Since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB² = DC². So, DB = DC, right?

Wait, that makes sense because if two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, their lengths are equal. So, DB = DC. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Hmm, but how does that help me? Maybe I can use the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Wait, because AD passes through the circle at A and P, so by power of a point, DA * DP
