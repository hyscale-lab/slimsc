Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length and with equal angles between them. 

First, I need to visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon, so it's quite a complex shape. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. Now, when the problem talks about rectangles, it's referring to four-sided figures with all angles being right angles (90 degrees). So, the sides of the rectangle must lie along the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to have rectangles formed by connecting non-adjacent vertices. For instance, in a square, which is a regular 4-gon, you can obviously form a rectangle (the square itself). But in a regular hexagon, which is a 6-gon, can you form rectangles? Let me thinkâ€”yes, because you can connect every other vertex to form a rectangle. So, perhaps similar logic applies here for the dodecagon.

Wait, but a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is much more than 6, so there are more possibilities for forming rectangles. I think the key here is to find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Since a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, each pair having the same length.

In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the sides connect adjacent vertices, while diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, up to 5 vertices because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction.

Wait, actually, in an n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is (n(n-3))/2. But for a dodecagon, n=12, so number of diagonals is (12*9)/2=54. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. Each diagonal can be represented as a vector from one vertex to another, and if two such vectors are equal and opposite, they can form sides of a rectangle.

But maybe another approach is better. In a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be thought of as chords of the circumscribed circle. The lengths of these chords depend on the angle they subtend at the center. For a regular dodecagon, each side subtends an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees at the center.

So, the length of a side is determined by the central angle, and so are the diagonals. For example, a diagonal that skips one vertex subtends 2*30=60 degrees, skips two vertices: 3*30=90 degrees, skips three: 4*30=120 degrees, and so on, up to skipping five vertices, which subtends 150 degrees (since skipping six would bring us back to the original point, effectively the diameter, but in a 12-gon, skipping six vertices would give a diameter).

Wait, but in a 12-gon, the diameter would be a diagonal that connects two opposite vertices. For example, vertex 1 to vertex 7, which is exactly six steps apart. So, the diameter is a diagonal that skips five vertices (since from 1, you skip 2,3,4,5,6 to reach 7). So, the diameters are the longest diagonals.

So, for each vertex, there are diagonals of different lengths: skipping 1,2,3,4,5 vertices. Each of these corresponds to chords with different central angles (60, 90, 120, 150, 180 degrees).

Now, for a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, it should have four sides lying on these chords. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Since a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, the sides must be pairs of equal and parallel chords. Moreover, for the sides of the rectangle to be chords of the circle, the angles they subtend must be such that their lengths are equal in pairs.

So, perhaps the key is to find all possible pairs of parallel chords that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle, and then count how many such rectangles can be formed.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, two chords are parallel if the angles they subtend are equal or supplementary. Because in a circle, chords subtended by equal angles are congruent and can be parallel if they are in the same orientation.

But in a regular polygon, if two chords are congruent and lie in the same rotational position, they are parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of rectangles can be determined by choosing two distinct pairs of parallel chords that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles. So, to form a rectangle, we need two sets of parallel sides, each pair forming right angles with each other.

Another approach: in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting four vertices such that the sides of the rectangle are chords of the circle, each
