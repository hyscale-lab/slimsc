Okay, so I need to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The goal is to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays. Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Alice goes first, and each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The person who takes the last token wins. So, if a player can make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position, they can force a win.

I remember in these types of games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite: no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, for this problem, we need to determine the losing positions because Bob can only win if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. Because Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can always respond in a way that keeps Alice in losing positions until she can't move, and Bob takes the last token.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a position as a number of tokens n. We can think recursively about whether each position is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, the game is over. So, the player who just moved took the last token and wins. So, n=0 is a losing position because the current player can't move.
But wait, wait. When n=0, the game is over, so the player to move loses because they can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position (W).
n=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. Or take 1 token again? Wait, no, you can only take 1 or 4. So, from n=2, possible moves are to n=1 (if you take 1) or you can't take 4 because 2-4 is negative. So, the only move is to n=1. Since n=1 is a winning position for the next player, that means the current player at n=2 can only move to a W position for the opponent. So, n=2 would be a losing position (L). Because no matter what you do, you leave the opponent in a winning position.

Wait, but wait. If n=2 is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) can't force a win. Hmm.

Wait, let's clarify: A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. So, if all possible moves from n lead to W positions for the opponent, then n is L.

Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to an L position for the opponent.

So, let's think again.

n=0: L (losing)
n=1: possible moves to n=0. Since n=0 is L, then n=1 is W (since you can force opponent into L).
n=2: possible moves are n=1 (W). So, all moves lead to W for the opponent. So, n=2 is L.
n=3: possible moves are n=2 (L) and n=-1 (invalid). So, you can move to n=2, which is L. So, n=3 is W.
n=4: possible moves are n=3 (W) or n=0 (L). So, you can move to n=0, which is L. So, n=4 is W.
n=5: possible moves are n=4 (W) and n=1 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So, n=5 is L.
n=6: possible moves are n=5 (L) and n=2 (L). So, you can move to either n=5 or n=2, both L. So, n=6 is W.
n=7: possible moves are n=6 (W) and n=3 (W). So, all moves lead to W. So, n=7 is L.
n=8: possible moves are n=7 (L) and n=4 (W). So, you can move to n=7 (L). So, n=8 is W.
n=9: possible moves are n=8 (W) and n=5 (L). So, you can move to n=5 (L). So, n=9 is W.
Wait, wait, because n=5 is L, so moving to n=5 gives opponent a losing position. So, n=9 is W.
n=10: moves are n=9 (W) and n=6 (W). So, all moves lead to W. So, n=10 is L.
n=11: moves are n=10 (L) and n=7 (L). So, can move to L, so n=11 is W.
n=12: moves are n=11 (W) and n=8 (W). So, all moves lead to W. So, n=12 is L.
n=13: moves are n=12 (L) and n=9 (W). So, can move to L, so n=13 is W.
n=14: moves are n=13 (W) and n=10 (L). So, can move to L, so n=14 is W.
n=15: moves are n=14 (W) and n=11 (W). All moves lead to W. So, n=15 is L.
n=16: moves are n=15 (L) and n=12 (L). So, can move to L, so n=16 is W.

Hmm, looking at the pattern so far:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
W/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W

Wait, let me list the positions where n is a losing position so far: 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15,...

Looking for a pattern. Let's see the differences between them:

2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3, etc. So it's alternating between adding 2 and 3.

So the losing positions are numbers that are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, etc.

Wait, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let me check.

Wait, 0 mod 5 is 0, 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, 17 mod5 is 2, etc. So yes, it's numbers where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me confirm with n=15: 15 mod5 is 0, and yes, it's a losing position. n=17: 17 mod5 is 2, losing.

n=20: 20 mod5 is 0, losing.

So, the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, if n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then it's a losing position. So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, Alice must start at a losing position. So n must be ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait: let me recheck the earlier positions.

Wait, n=5: 5 mod5=0. Losing. Correct.

n=2: 2 mod5=2. Losing.

n=7: 7 mod5=2. Losing.

n=10: 10 mod5=0. Losing.

n=12: 12 mod5=2. Losing.

Yes, seems consistent.

Wait, wait another moment. Let me check n=1. 1 mod5=1. Winning.

n=3: 3 mod5=3. Winning.

n=4:4 mod5=4. Winning.

n=6:6 mod5=1. Wait, but earlier I thought n=6 was W.

Wait, n=6: when you take 1 token, you go to n=5 (L), so n=6 is W.

But 6 mod5=1. Hmm.

Wait, so the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5. So, n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...

So, the number of losing positions up to n is the number of integers ≤n where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, for each 5-number block, there are 2 losing positions.

For example, 0,1,2,3,4: losing at 0,2.

5,6,7,8,9: losing at5,7.

10,11,12,13,14: losing at10,12.

So, in each 5-number block, two losing positions.

So, for n up to 2024, how many such numbers are there?

Let me calculate:

Total number of complete blocks of 5 in 2024: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions: 404 *2=808.

Then, the remaining numbers: 2024=5*404 +4, so the incomplete block is 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Wait, 5*404=2020, so 2020 is the last number in the 404th block. Then the next numbers are 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Within this incomplete block, check which numbers are losing positions.

Losing positions are 2020+0=2020, 2020+2=2022.

Wait, for the next block (2021-2025), losing positions would be 2025 (mod5=0) and 2023 (2023 mod5= 2023-2020=3, so mod5=3? Wait, no, 2023 divided by5: 5*404=2020, 2023=2020+3, so 2023 mod5=3. Hmm, no.

Wait, wait, in the next block after 2020, the losing positions would be 2020 +0 +5=2025, which is beyond 2024, and 2020+2+5=2027, which is also beyond.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think.

Wait, the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, in the next numbers after 2020:

2021 mod5=1 (2021=5*404 +1)
2022 mod5=2 (yes, 2022 is a losing position)
2023 mod5=3
2024 mod5=4

So, in the incomplete block from 2021 to 2024, only 2022 is a losing position.

So, the incomplete block contributes 1 more losing position.

So, total losing positions up to 2024 is 404 *2 +1= 809.

Wait, but let me double-check. The last complete block is up to 2020, which has two losing positions:2020 and2022? Wait, no, 2020 is the end of the 404th block. The next losing positions would be 2020+5=2025 (out of range) and 2020+7=2027, also out of range. But in the incomplete last block, the numbers are 2021,2022,2023,2024.

So, 2022 is the only losing position in this last incomplete block.

So total is 404 *2 +1=809.

Wait, but wait: 404 complete blocks (each with 5 numbers) gives 404*5=2020 numbers. Then, the last 4 numbers are 2021,2022,2023,2024. So within these, 2022 is a losing position. So, total losing positions: 404*2 (from complete blocks) +1 (from incomplete)=809.

But wait, initially, the first block is 0-4, which has two losing positions:0 and2. Then 5-9:5 and7. So, up to n=9, we have 4 losing positions.

Wait, but n=0 is a losing position, but the problem says positive integers n ≤2024. So, n must be at least1. So, do we include n=0? No, because the problem says positive integers. So, n=0 is excluded.

Hmm, important point. So, in our initial calculation, we included n=0, which is outside the problem's scope. So, we need to adjust.

So, the counts of losing positions from n=1 to n=2024.

Earlier, we thought the losing positions are n≡0 or2 mod5, starting from n=0. But for n≥1, the losing positions start at n=2,5,7,10,12, etc.

So, let's recalculate.

Number of losing positions from 1 to 2024:

Each 5-number block contributes 2 losing positions, but starting from n=2.

Wait, for n=1-5: losing positions are 2,5.

n=6-10: 7,10.

n=11-15:12,15.

So, each 5-number block has 2 losing positions.

But in the first block, n=1-5: 2,5.

So, the total number of complete blocks in 2024 is 2024 divided by5=404.8. So, 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions: 404 *2=808.

But wait, the last block may not be complete. The last complete block ends at n=2020 (since 5*404=2020). The next block is 2021-2025, but n only goes up to2024.

In the last block (2021-2025), the losing positions would be 2022 and2025. But 2025 is beyond 2024, so only 2022 is in the range.

So, the last block contributes 1 losing position.

So, total is 404 *2 +1=809.

But wait, let's see: the first block (n=1-5) has 2 losing positions (n=2,5), the next block (n=6-10) has 2 losing positions (n=7,10), and so on.

Each block of 5 numbers contributes exactly 2 losing positions.

Now, the total number of blocks from n=1 to n=2024:

Each block is 5 numbers. So, 2024 //5=404 blocks, each with 5 numbers, so 404*5=2020 numbers. Then, the remaining 4 numbers are 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Each complete block contributes 2 losing positions, so 404 blocks contribute 808 losing positions.

Now, the last 4 numbers:2021,2022,2023,2024.

Check which of them are losing positions:

2021 mod5=1→ no.

2022 mod5=2→ yes.

2023 mod5=3→ no.

2024 mod5=4→ no.

Only 2022 is a losing position.

So, add 1 more.

Total losing positions: 808+1=809.

But wait, n=5 is a losing position. Let me check:

n=5: 5 mod5=0→ yes.

So, all the losing positions are correctly calculated.

Therefore, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but I should double-check my reasoning.

Because the problem states that Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens. The last to remove a token wins.

So, the player who is forced to move when n is a losing position will lose, given that the opponent plays optimally.

So, if n is a losing position, the current player cannot win.

Now, since Alice starts first, if n is a losing position, Bob can force a win. So, the count of n which are losing positions (for Alice) is the answer.

Thus, the number of n ≤2024 where n is a losing position is 809.

So, the final answer is 809.

Wait, but let me just check again: n=1 is a winning position, n=2 is losing, n=3 is winning, n=4 is winning, n=5 is losing.

Yes, so for each 5 numbers, two are losing. So, 2024 numbers: 2024/5=404.8.

404 full blocks, each with 2 losing: 808.

Then, in the last partial block, 2021-2024: n=2022 is a losing position. So, 808+1=809.

Yes, that seems correct.


Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \( n \) tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's play.

To solve this, we classify each position \( n \) as a winning (W) or losing (L) position. A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

By analyzing the game, we find that the losing positions are those where \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). This pattern repeats every 5 numbers, with two losing positions in each block of 5.

To count the number of losing positions up to 2024:
1. Each complete block of 5 numbers contributes 2 losing positions.
2. There are \( \lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \rfloor = 404 \) complete blocks, contributing \( 404 \times 2 = 808 \) losing positions.
3. In the incomplete block from 2021 to 2024, only 2022 is a losing position.

Thus, the total number of losing positions is \( 808 + 1 = 809 \).

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
