Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from S = {1,2,3,…,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the chosen ones. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But wait, actually, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize requires that all four numbers are chosen, which certainly means at least two are chosen. So A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, our goal is to compute P(A) / P(B), where A is the event she wins the grand prize, and B is the event she wins a prize.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!)) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, 210 possible combinations.

Jen picks 4 numbers. Let's denote her set as J. The lottery draws 4 numbers, say L. She wins the grand prize if J = L. She wins a prize if |J ∩ L| ≥ 2.

So, P(A) is the probability that J and L are the same. Since there is only one such combination (the one she picked), the probability is 1 / 210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, i.e., that |J ∩ L| is at least 2. So we need to compute the number of 4-number combinations L such that L shares at least two numbers with J, and then divide by 210.

Wait, actually, since J is fixed, we can compute the number of favorable outcomes for B.

Wait, but in probability terms, since we're considering all possible L, the probability that |J ∩ L| ≥ 2 is equal to the number of L with |J ∩ L| ≥ 2 divided by 210.

So, let me compute that.

First, the total number of possible L is 210. To compute how many L have |J ∩ L| ≥ 2, we can think in terms of combinations.

She has picked 4 numbers, J. The remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not in J.

So, the possible intersections between L and J can be 2, 3, or 4. We need to sum the number of L's with 2, 3, or 4 common numbers with J.

Let me compute each case.

Case 1: |J ∩ L| = 2.

Number of ways: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because we choose 2 numbers from J and 2 numbers from the remaining 6 not in J.

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90.

Case 2: |J ∩ L| = 3.

Number of ways: C(4,3)*C(6,1). Choosing 3 from J and 1 from the rest.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24.

Case 3: |J ∩ L|=4.

Number of ways: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, the total number of favorable L is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 divides by 5, 115/5=23, 210/5=42. So 23/42. So P(B)=23/42.

Wait, but let me double-check the math:

90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes. 115/210 is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complementary probability and subtract from 1.

Total probability is 1. The complementary event of winning a prize is having 0 or 1 numbers in common.

So, number of L with |J ∩ L| < 2 is equal to the number of L with 0 or 1 common numbers.

Compute that:

Case 0: |J ∩ L|=0. All 4 numbers from the 6 not in J. So C(6,4)=15.

Case 1: |J ∩ L|=1. Choose 1 from J and 3 from the rest. C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

Total complementary =15+80=95. So, the number of L not giving a prize is 95.

Therefore, the number of L giving a prize is 210 -95=115, same as before.

So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

Now, P(A) is the probability of grand prize, which is when |J ∩ L|=4. As we calculated, only 1 such L exists. So P(A)=1/210.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Because in the problem, Jen picks 4 numbers, and the lottery picks 4 numbers. So the probability that L equals J is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

So, P(A)=1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize." So, given that she won a prize (i.e., |J ∩ L| ≥2), what is the probability that she won the grand prize (i.e., |J ∩ L|=4).

So, in terms of counts, it's the number of L's where |J ∩ L|=4, divided by the number of L's where |J ∩ L| ≥2.

Which is 1 / 115. So the probability is 1/115.

But let me write this as m/n, where m and n are coprime. 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1 and n=115. Then m + n=116.

Wait, but that seems too low. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing P(B). Let me verify.

Wait, the total number of possible L is C(10,4)=210.

Number of L with |J ∩ L| >=2 is 115, as I computed earlier. So P(B)=115/210=23/42.

P(A)=1/210.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So, m/n=1/115, m+n=1+115=116.

But let me think again: If I have 115 possible L's that give a prize, and only one of them gives the grand prize, then yes, the probability is 1/115.

Wait, that seems correct, but 1/115 is a very small probability. That seems reasonable because winning the grand prize is quite rare.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of hypergeometric distribution.

The problem is similar to drawing without replacement, and the probability of a certain number
