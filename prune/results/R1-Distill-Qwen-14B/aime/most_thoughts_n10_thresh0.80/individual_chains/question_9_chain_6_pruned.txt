Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The given conditions are that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. I think I can use logarithm properties to simplify these equations and find relations between x and y.

Let me start by recalling some logarithm rules. Remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, maybe I can apply that here.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, so that's x multiplied by log base x of y equals 10. But wait, log base x of y is the same as log(y)/log(x) in natural logarithms, right? Or maybe I can represent it differently. Let me denote log_x(y) as something, say, let's call it a. So, a = log_x(y) which means x^a = y. That might be helpful later.

From the first equation, x * a = 10. So, a = 10/x.

Now, since a = log_x(y), and we have a in terms of x, maybe I can express y in terms of x. Because a = log_x(y) = 10/x, that would mean y = x^{10/x}.

Okay, so y is equal to x raised to the power of 10 over x. Got that.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the logarithm power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Let me denote log_y(x) as b. So, b = log_y(x). Then, the equation becomes 4y * b = 10, which implies b = 10/(4y).

But wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1/(log_a(b)). Since a = log_x(y), then log_y(x) = 1/a. So, b = 1/a.

From earlier, a = 10/x, so b = x/10.

But we also have b = 10/(4y). So, setting these equal: x/10 = 10/(4y).

Let me write that down:

x/10 = 10/(4y)

Multiply both sides by 10:

x = (100)/(4y)

Simplify 100/4: 25. So, x = 25/y.

Hmm, so x times y equals 25. That's interesting because the question is asking for xy. So, if x = 25/y, then xy = 25. Wait, is that the answer? Let me double-check.

Before that, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, from the second equation, I had 4y * log
