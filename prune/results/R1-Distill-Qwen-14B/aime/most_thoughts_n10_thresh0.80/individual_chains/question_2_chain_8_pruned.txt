Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments PQ, each of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. I need to find a point C on AB, not being A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from this family except AB. Then, compute OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. O is the origin. A is halfway between O and (1,0), since 1/2 is the x-coordinate. B is somewhere on the y-axis, at (0, sqrt(3)/2). That's approximately 0.866, so a bit less than 1. AB is the line segment connecting A and B. 

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Since PQ is in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

So for any such segment PQ, the equation of the line can be found. Let me recall that the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. Since the length is 1, p² + q² = 1.

But wait, since PQ is of length 1, that's the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q). So the distance formula: sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. Got it.

Now, the problem says that point C is on AB, not A or B, and it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, all other points on AB are on some PQ from F, except for C, which isn't on any other PQ except AB.

So I need to find the point C on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through it, except AB itself. Then find OC².

Hmm, so perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to some envelope of these PQ segments. Because for each PQ, it's a line, and the envelope would be the boundary where these lines just touch. So the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these lines.

Alternatively, C is the point on AB that is the closest to the origin, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, no, because the envelope might not necessarily be the closest point.

Wait, maybe I should parametrize the segment AB first. Let me find the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c → c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, in parametric terms, AB can be expressed as t*(1/2, 0) + (1 - t)*(0, sqrt(3)/2) for t from 0 to 1. So parametric equations: x = (1/2)t, y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t). So any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t)) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, for point C to lie on PQ, which has equation x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

So, if point C is on AB and also on PQ, then substituting the coordinates of C into PQ's equation should satisfy it.

So, [(1/2)t]/p + [(sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t)]/q = 1.

But since p² + q² = 1, we can relate p and q.

Wait, but for each p, q, the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q =1.

So if I fix t, then for each t, the point C is ((1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t)). For this point to lie on PQ, we have the equation:

( (1/2)t ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t) ) / q = 1.

But since p² + q² =1, we can parameterize p and q as cos(theta) and sin(theta), since p² + q² =1.

So, set p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), since both are positive in the first quadrant.

Then the equation becomes:

( (1/2)t ) / cos(theta) + ( (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - t) ) / sin(theta) = 1.

So:

( t / 2 ) sec(theta) + ( sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2 ) csc(theta) = 1.

Hmm, that's an equation involving theta and t.

But since we have a point C on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB, that must mean that for point C, the equation above has exactly one solution theta (i.e., the case when AB itself is PQ). So for all other PQs, except AB, the equation will have no solution or multiple solutions. But in this case, we want C to lie on AB and only AB, so the equation above should have exactly one solution theta.

Wait, but AB is also a segment PQ in F, right? Because AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's verify: the distance from A to B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/
