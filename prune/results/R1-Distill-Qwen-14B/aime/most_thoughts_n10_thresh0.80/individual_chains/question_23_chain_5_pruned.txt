Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². 

The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals of the rhombus pass through the origin. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, wait—actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other.

Given that, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes because the center is the origin, and the diagonals are along the coordinate axes.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the points can be considered as reflections over the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite vertex C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, the other two points B and D would be reflections over the origin as well.

So, the rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular, but the hyperbola is symmetric, so the rhombus must be such that each vertex lies on the hyperbola.

So, suppose diagonal AC is along the x-axis and BD is along the y-axis, but wait, not necessarily. Because the hyperbola is symmetric over both axes. Alternatively, the diagonals could be along any lines through the origin, but they must be perpendicular.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so if the diagonals are not along the coordinate axes, but are perpendicular, then the rhombus is rotated.

But the hyperbola is symmetric along both the x and y axes, but if the rhombus is rotated, its vertices will lie on different points. Hmm.

But perhaps, to simplify, we can assume that the diagonals are along the coordinate axes. Let me check.

If the diagonals are along the x and y axes, then points A and C would lie on the x-axis, but the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1 doesn't pass through the origin. So, the points on the hyperbola on the x-axis would be where y=0, so x²/20 =1, so x=±√20, which is ±2√5. So, points A and C could be (2√5, 0) and (-2√5, 0). Similarly, points B and D would be on the y-axis: the hyperbola at x=0 would require y²/24 =1, so y=±√24=±2√6. So, points B and D would be (0, 2√6) and (0, -2√6).

But in that case, the rhombus would have vertices at (2√5,0), (0,2√6), (-2√5,0), (0,-2√6). But is that a rhombus? Let's see.

Compute the sides: distance between (2√5,0) and (0,2√6) is sqrt[(2√5)^2 + (2√6)^2] = sqrt(20 + 24) = sqrt(44) = 2√11. Similarly, all sides would be equal, so yes, it's a rhombus.

But wait, in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, with lengths 4√5 and 4√6, respectively. So, BD^2 would be (4√6)^2=16*6=96. But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, perhaps this is a specific case, but maybe BD² can be larger?

Wait, but in this case, the diagonals are along the axes, but maybe if the rhombus is rotated, so the diagonals are not along the axes, then BD² could be larger or smaller?

Wait, actually, in the case where the diagonals are along the axes, BD is along the y-axis, so BD² is (4√6)^2=96.

But suppose we rotate the rhombus, so the diagonals are not along the axes. Then, perhaps BD² can be made larger or smaller? Hmm.

I think to solve this, we need to parameterize the rhombus.

Let me denote the diagonals as vectors. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, let me consider one diagonal along a vector (a, b) and the other along (-b, a), to make them perpendicular.

Wait, actually, since diagonals are perpendicular, if one diagonal is along (p, q), the other should be along (-q, p), so that their dot product is zero.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, any pair of perpendicular vectors through the origin would work.

But in this case, the four points of the rhombus would be the endpoints of the diagonals. So, if one diagonal is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), and the other diagonal is from (r, s) to (-r, -s), with (p, q)·(r, s)=0.

Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoints are the same, which is the origin in this case.

So, if points A, B, C, D are the four vertices, then A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors OA and OB (if A and B are adjacent vertices) must be perpendicular? No, wait.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but the sides are not necessarily aligned with the axes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the points.

Let me consider that the diagonals are vectors d1 and d2, which are perpendicular. So, d1·d2=0.

Since the rhombus is centered at the origin, the four vertices are at (d1/2 + d2/2), (-d1/2 + d2/2), (-d1/2 - d2/2), (d1/2 - d2/2), or something like that.

Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the vertices can be written as ( (d1 + d2)/2, etc.) but I'm getting a bit
