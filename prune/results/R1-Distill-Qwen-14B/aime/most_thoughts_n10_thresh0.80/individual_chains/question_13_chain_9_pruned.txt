Okay, let me try to solve this problem. Hmm, so Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes. Now, we need to find how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + ½ km/h, including t minutes.

Wait, so the problem is about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. So, the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time, which is t minutes. But t is the same in both scenarios.

Let me try to write down the equations.

First, when she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But that's 4 hours including t minutes. So, the actual walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes, right? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should convert everything into the same units.

Wait, 4 hours is 240 minutes, right? Because 4 * 60 = 240. Similarly, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, when she walks at s km/h, the total time is 240 minutes, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the time she spends walking is 240 - t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 144 minutes, so the walking time is 144 - t minutes.

But the distance she walks is the same, 9 km.

So, using the formula: distance = speed * time.

But time needs to be in hours, right? Because speed is km per hour. So, let me convert the walking time into hours.

So, for the first case:

Walking time = (240 - t) minutes = (240 - t)/60 hours.

Distance = s * (240 - t)/60 = 9.

Similarly, for the second case:

Walking time = (144 - t)/60 hours.

Distance = (s + 2) * (144 - t)/60 = 9.

So, now I have two equations:

1) s * (240 - t)/60 = 9

2) (s + 2) * (144 - t)/60 = 9

I can write these as:

1) s*(240 - t) = 540

2) (s + 2)*(144 - t) = 540

So, simplifying equation 1:

s*(240 - t) = 540 → 240s - s t = 540 → equation (1a)

Equation 2:

(s + 2)*(144 - t) = 540 → s*(144 - t) + 2*(144 - t) = 540 → 144s - s t + 288 - 2t = 540 → equation (2a)

So, now I have two equations:

1a) 240s - s t = 540

2a) 144s - s t + 288 - 2t = 540

Let me write both equations:

Equation 1a: 240s - s t = 540

Equation 2a: 144s - s t + 288 - 2t = 540

I can subtract equation 2a from equation 1a to eliminate some variables.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps subtracting 2a from 1a.

Wait, let's see:
