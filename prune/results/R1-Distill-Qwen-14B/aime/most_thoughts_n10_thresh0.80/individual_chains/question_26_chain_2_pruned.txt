Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. 

The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we have to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. This must be a scalene triangle. There's a circumcircle ω around it. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, point D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. Then, line AD is drawn from A through D and intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is a part of this line.

I remember that in circle geometry, the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I can find the center O of the circle ω, then OB is perpendicular to the tangent at B, and OC is perpendicular to the tangent at C. Since D is the intersection of these two tangents, OB and OC are radii, and BD and CD are the tangents.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use some properties here. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, BD = DC because the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. So, triangle BDC is isoceles with BD = DC.

But how does that help me? Maybe I can find the length BD and DC using the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω is equal to DB² = DC², which is also equal to DA * DP, since D lies outside the circle, and AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P. So, using the power of point D, we have:

DB² = DA * DP.

But wait, I don't know DA or DP yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to find the coordinates of all these points. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let's see.

Let me place the triangle ABC on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Since the triangle has sides 5, 9, 10, it might be helpful to place point C at the origin (0,0), point A on the x-axis at (10, 0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can find the coordinates of B using the distance formula.

So, let's do that. Let me let C be (0,0), A be (10,0). Then, point B is somewhere such that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

Wait, actually, if AC is 10, then A is at (10,0) and C is at (0,0). Then, point B must satisfy the distances AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10 (which is already satisfied). So, let's find the coordinates of B.

Let me denote B as (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C (0,0) is 9, so:

√(x² + y²) = 9 → x² + y² = 81.

The distance from B to A (10,0) is 5, so:

√((x -10)² + y²) =5 → (x -10)^2 + y² =25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x-10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 -81 → x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x=7.8. Then, from the first equation, x² + y² =81 → (7.8)^2 + y² =81.

Calculating 7.8 squared: 7.8*7.8 = (7 + 0.8)^2 = 7^2 + 2*7*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 49 + 11.2 + 0.64 = 60.84.

So, 60.84 + y² =81 → y²=81-60.84=20.16 → y=√20.16.

Calculating √20.16: 20.16 is 2016/100, which is 504/25. So, y = √(504/25) = (√504)/5. Simplify √504: 504 =16*31.5 → wait, 504 factors: 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31.5=504. But 16 is a square, so √504=4√31.5? Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, factor 504: 504=16*31.5 is not correct. Let's factor 504:

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷2 =126

126 ÷2 =63

63 ÷3=21

21 ÷3=7

So, 504=2^3 * 3^2 *7. So, √504=√(2^3 *3^2 *7)=2^(1.5)*3*√7= 2√2 *3 *√7= 6√(14).

Wait, wait, let me compute:

√504 = √(16 * 31.5) → Wait, that
