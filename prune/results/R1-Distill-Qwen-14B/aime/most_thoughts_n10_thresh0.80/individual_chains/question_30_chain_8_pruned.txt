Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1 and it's a root of unity of order 13. So, ω^13 = 1, and the powers of ω from k=0 to 12 give all the distinct 13th roots of unity.

The expression given is a product over k=0 to 12 of terms of the form (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks a bit like a polynomial evaluated at ω^k. Maybe I can think of each term as evaluating a certain polynomial at each root of unity and then taking the product over all roots.

Wait, let me write down the terms more carefully. For each k, the term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can factor this or express it in a different way. Maybe factor out something common.

Looking at 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, I notice that 2 - 2ω^k is 2(1 - ω^k), so maybe that's helpful. So, the term becomes 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe thinking of it as a quadratic in ω^k.

Alternatively, perhaps think of each term as a function of ω^k, so perhaps a quadratic equation. Let me denote x = ω^k. Then each term is 2 - 2x + x². So, each factor is x² - 2x + 2. So, the product is the product from x=ω^0 to x=ω^{12} (since as k ranges from 0 to 12, x cycles through all 13th roots of unity) of (x² - 2x + 2).

Wait, so since x runs through all the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Because the product over (x - a_i) for all roots a_i of some polynomial gives the polynomial evaluated at x. But here, each term is (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for a polynomial P(x) whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity, which is x^13 - 1. So, if I can relate the product I'm looking at to that polynomial, perhaps I can find a way to compute it.

Alternatively, the product over all (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, since that's the cyclotomic polynomial for the 13th roots of unity. But in my case, each term is (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at each ω^k, so the product would be the product over all ω^k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps think of the product as the product over all ω^k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me denote that as the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe I can write this as the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^{k})^2 - 2ω^k + 2.

Alternatively, perhaps factor each term as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see if 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be factored
