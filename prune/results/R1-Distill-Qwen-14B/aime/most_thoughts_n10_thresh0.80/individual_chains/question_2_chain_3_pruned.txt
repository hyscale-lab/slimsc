Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out where point C is on segment AB such that it doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB itself. Then, I have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer will be a fraction p/q, and I need to find p + q where p and q are coprime.

First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, at (0, sqrt(3)/2). That makes sense.

Then, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ has P somewhere on the positive x-axis, Q somewhere on the positive y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1.

So, any such PQ is a line segment in the first quadrant, starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, and having length 1. The family F is all such possible segments.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, except for points A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Let me check.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). What's the distance between A and B? Let's compute it.

Distance AB = sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is a segment of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis, so AB is in the family F.

So, AB is one such segment in F. Now, there's another point C on AB such that no other segment from F passes through C except AB. So, C is unique in that sense. So, if I can find such a point, that's the point I need.

Then, I need to compute OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C.

So, how do I find this point C?

I think I need to parameterize AB and then find a point on AB that is not on any other segment from F. So, perhaps AB is tangent to some curve related to the family F, and the point of tangency is C.

Alternatively, since C is not on any other PQ except AB, it must be that for any other PQ in F, the point C doesn't lie on PQ. So, C is the only point on AB that lies on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

Wait, but how do I find such a point?

Maybe I can parametrize AB and then find the point C where for some t, C is on AB, and for any other PQ in F, the equations don't satisfy for C.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where AB is the only segment from F that passes through it, so maybe C is the point where all other segments from F avoid it.

Another approach: the family F consists of all segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ = 1. So, each PQ can be represented as the line connecting (p, 0) to (0, q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, the equation of such a line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, any segment PQ is a line x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 =1, and p, q >0.

So, all such lines are in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and p² + q² =1.

Now, the point C lies on AB, so let's parametrize AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Let me find the parametric equations for AB.

Let me set t from 0 to 1, with t=0 at A and t=1 at B.

So, x(t) = (1/2)(1 - t)
y(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, point C is ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, I need to find t such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

That is, for C = (x,y), there exists no (p,q) with p² + q² =1, p≠1/2 or q≠sqrt(3)/2 (since that would be AB itself) such that x/p + y/q =1.

Wait, but actually, for a point (x,y), being on a segment PQ means that x/p + y/q
