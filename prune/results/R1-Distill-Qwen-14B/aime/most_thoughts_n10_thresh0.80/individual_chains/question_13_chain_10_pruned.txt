Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. I need to figure out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find how many minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Alright, so the key here is to find out the time taken for the walk at the new speed, s + 1/2 km/h. But to do that, I think I need to figure out the values of s and t first. Because without knowing s and t, I can't directly compute the time at the new speed.

Let me jot down what I know.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
- This includes walking time and t minutes in the coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = (2*60) + 24 = 144 minutes
- Again, this includes walking time and t minutes.

So, for both scenarios, the walking time plus t minutes equals the total time given.

Let me denote:
- Walking time when speed is s: T1
- Walking time when speed is s+2: T2

Then,
T1 + t = 240 minutes
T2 + t = 144 minutes

But since both walks are 9 kilometers, I can express T1 and T2 in terms of s.

I know that time = distance / speed. So,

T1 = 9 / s hours
T2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours

But T1 and T2 are in hours, and t is in minutes. I need to convert everything to the same units to avoid confusion. Let me convert T1 and T2 into minutes.

Since 1 hour = 60 minutes,

T1 (minutes) = (9 / s) * 60
T2 (minutes) = (9 / (s + 2)) * 60

So now, substituting back into the equations:

(9*60)/s + t = 240
(9*60)/(s+2) + t = 144

Hmm, that gives me two equations with two variables, s and t. Let me write those equations clearly.

Equation 1: (540)/s + t = 240
Equation 2: (540)/(s+2) + t = 144

Now, I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate t.

(540/s + t) - (540/(s+2) + t) = 240 - 144

Simplify the left side:

540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96

Factor out 540:

540 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 96

Let's compute 1/s - 1/(s+2):

= (s+2 - s) / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s+2)]

So now, the equation becomes:

540 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):

540 * 2 = 96 * s(s+2)

Compute 540 * 2 = 1080
So,

1080 = 96 s(s+2)

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s+2)

Compute 1080 divided by 96. Let me see, 96 * 11 = 1056, 1080 - 1056 = 24, so that's 11 + 24/96 = 11.25.

So, 11.25 = s(s+2)

Which is:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, let's write this as a quadratic equation:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

I can solve this quadratic for s. Let me use the quadratic formula.

s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D) = 7

Thus,

s = [-2 ± 7]/2

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

So, s = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that's interesting. So her original speed is 2.5 km/h. Then, her speed when she increases by 2 km/h is 4.5 km/h.

Wait, but in the problem, we need to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. So, her new speed is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

But before that, let me verify if s = 2.5 is correct by plugging back into the equations.

Let me check Equation 1: 540/s + t = 240

So, 540/2.5 = 216 minutes. Because 2.5 km/h * t = 9 km, so t = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 216 minutes.

So, 216 + t = 240 => t = 24 minutes.

Let me check Equation 2: 540/(s+2) + t = 144

s+2 = 4.5 km/h. So, 540 /4.5 = 120 minutes.

120 + t = 144 => t = 24 minutes.

Perfect, so t is 24 minutes. So, that checks out.

Now, the question is: what is the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h?

s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, the walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Convert that into minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the total time is walking time plus t.

In this case, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, and t is 24 minutes. So total time is 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because in the first two scenarios, t is included in the total time. So, when she
