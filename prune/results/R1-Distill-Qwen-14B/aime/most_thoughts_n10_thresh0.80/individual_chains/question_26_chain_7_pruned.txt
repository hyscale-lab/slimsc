Okay, I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a secant from A through P, which is another point on the circle.

I remember that when dealing with tangents from a common external point to a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, from D, the tangent segments DB and DC should be equal. That might come in handy.

I think I should start by finding some key properties of triangle ABC. Maybe using the Law of Cosines to find some angles or other sides. Wait, but we know all three sides, so maybe we can compute the circumradius first. Because if we know the circumradius, perhaps we can relate it to other parts.

The formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

First, let me compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The sides are 5, 9, 10.

Compute the semi-perimeter, s: s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, the area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 factors into 16*31.5, wait, no, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 9 * 8. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(7 * 9 * 8) = 3 * sqrt(56) = 3 * sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So Δ = 6√14.

So the area is 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Maybe rationalize the denominator: 75√14 / (4*14) = 75√14 /56. So R = 75√14 /56.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculation:

a=5, b=9, c=10.

So a*b*c = 5*9*10=450.

4*Δ = 4*6√14=24√14.

So R=450/(24√14)= (450 ÷ 6)/(24 ÷6 √14)=75/(4√14). Yes, same as before.

Then, rationalizing: 75√14 / (4*14) = 75√14 /56. So R=75√14/56.

Alright, so now we know the circumradius.

Now, moving on. The point D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So D lies on the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle ω. As per the tangent properties, DB=DC.

I remember that in such cases, the point D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Hmm, but maybe that's going a bit too far. Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry or some properties of harmonic division.

Alternatively, perhaps use power of a point. Since D lies outside the circle, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP, since AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P.

Wait, power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Yes, that seems correct.

So, if I can find the length DA, maybe I can find DP, and then AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, because AP is the length from A to P, and AD is from A to D, so AP is part of AD. Since P is between A and D, AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, hold on. If AD intersects the circle again at P, then A is outside the circle, and P is between A and D? Or is A
