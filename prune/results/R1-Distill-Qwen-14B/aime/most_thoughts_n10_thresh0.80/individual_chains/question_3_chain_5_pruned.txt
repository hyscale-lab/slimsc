Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is "winning the grand prize" and event B is "winning a prize." Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has won a prize (because she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of having at least two correct), the intersection P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. So, P(A|B) is equal to P(A) divided by P(B).

So, first, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers correct). Then, I can compute the conditional probability.

Let's start with P(A). Since Jen is picking 4 numbers out of 10, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers. The number of possible ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time.

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total number of possible lottery draws is 210.

Now, the number of ways she can pick 4 numbers that exactly match the lottery's 4 numbers is just 1, because there's only one specific set of 4 numbers she needs. So, the probability P(A) is 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers match the lottery's numbers. This is a bit more involved. It's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., she has fewer than two matches) and subtract that from 1.

So, let's compute the probability that she has 0 matches or 1 match, then subtract that from 1 to get P(B).

Let me denote C(n,k) as combinations again.

First, compute the number of ways she can have 0 matches. That means none of her 4 numbers are in the lottery's 4 numbers. So, the lottery has 4 numbers, which leaves 10 - 4 = 6 numbers that are not in the lottery. She needs to pick all 4 numbers from these 6. The number of ways is C(6,4).

C(6,4) is 15.

Next, compute the number of ways she can have exactly 1 match. That means one of her 4 numbers is in the lottery's 4, and the other 3 are not. So, the number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). 

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, the number of ways is 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of losing combinations (0 or 1 matches) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she can win a prize is total possible combinations minus losing combinations: 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, hold on. Let me verify that.

Total combinations: 210

Number of 0 matches: C(6,4) = 15

Number of 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80

So, 15 + 80 = 95 losing combinations. So, the number of winning combinations is 210 - 95 = 115.

Thus, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210.

But wait, let me double-check that. Because the problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have 2, 3, or 4 matches. So, alternatively, I could compute the number of ways directly.

Alternatively, compute for exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4 matches and sum them.

Which might be another way to compute it, just to confirm.

Compute exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2).

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) =1*1=1.

So, adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, same as before. So, 115 winning combinations, so P(B) = 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Earlier, we found that P(A) is 1/210.

But wait a second, no, that's not quite right. Because P(A) is the probability of exactly 4 matches, which is 1/210.

But in the conditional probability formula, P(A|B) is P(A and B)/P(B). But since if A happens, B must happen, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) )= 1 / 115.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115. So, that's the probability.

Wait, but 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115, m +n=116.

But wait
