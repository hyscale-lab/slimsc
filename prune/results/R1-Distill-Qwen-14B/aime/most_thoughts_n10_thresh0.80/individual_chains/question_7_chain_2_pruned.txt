Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem involving a regular octagon with vertices colored red or blue. The goal is to find the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored either red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each coloring is independent and equally probable. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex has 2 choices.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon so that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, this is essentially saying that after some rotation, every blue vertex in the new configuration was red in the original. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another way to think about it is that the coloring after rotation must be the complement of the original coloring. Because if blue moves to red positions, then effectively, the new positions of the blues were red before, which means that the blues have swapped places with the reds in some rotational sense.

So, another way to phrase it: the coloring is such that when you rotate it by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's an octagon), the blue and red vertices swap places. So, the coloring must be symmetric in a way that allows it to map onto its complement via a rotation.

Hmm, interesting. So, the problem becomes about colorings that are rotationally symmetric in a certain way. Let me think about group theory here. The octagon's symmetry group is the dihedral group D4, which includes rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, and reflections. But maybe for this problem, we only need to consider rotations.

Wait, but the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated", so we're only considering rotations, not reflections. So, the dihedral group's rotation subgroup, which is cyclic of order 8.

So, perhaps I should model this using Burnside's lemma or something similar, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe think about the colorings that are fixed under some rotation, but in this case, it's about the colorings that can be rotated to their complement.

Wait, let me think of it as follows: for a given coloring C, we're looking for a rotation r such that r(C) is the complement of C. So, r(C) = C', where C' is the coloring where red and blue are swapped.

So, how many such colorings C are there where there exists a rotation r such that r(C) = C'? And then the probability is that number divided by 256.

So, perhaps the key is to count the number of colorings C for which there exists a rotation r such that r(C) is the complement of C.

Hmm. Another approach: for each rotation r, consider the set of colorings fixed by r. But in this case, we're looking for colorings where applying r gives the complement. So, it's a bit different.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a kind of symmetry. For each rotation r, define a relation where r(C) = C'. So, we need to find all colorings C such that for some r, applying r to C gives the complement.

Alternatively, for each rotation r, we can consider the set of colorings C where r(C) is the complement of C. Then, the total number would be the union over all r of these sets. But we have to be careful because some colorings might satisfy this condition for multiple rotations.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem by considering that the colorings must form a certain type of orbit under rotation.

Wait, but maybe I can think in terms of cycle decomposition. Since a rotation by k positions (for some k) would correspond to a cyclic permutation of the vertices. So, the colorings that are fixed under some rotation would have periodicity corresponding to the rotation's order
