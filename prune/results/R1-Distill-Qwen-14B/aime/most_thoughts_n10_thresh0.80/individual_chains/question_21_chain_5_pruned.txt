Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me make sure I understand what that means. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 and 3, right? So 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. So, the goal is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number would be of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. But since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, and both a and c have to be less than b. So, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

So, n = a*b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c, and this must equal sqrt(n). So, the equation is a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this somehow or express it in terms of a and c. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of a and c. Let's try that. From the original equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

So, solving for b:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Let me simplify that numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

I can split this into terms:

b = (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a

Simplify each term:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Hmm, so for b to be an integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer as well because a, 2c, and b are all integers. So, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. 

Let me think about this. So, for each base b, we can have a and c such that n is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of the digits is sqrt(n). So, for each b, we need to find all pairs (a, c) where a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and (c^2 - c) is divisible by a.

Wait, but since b is determined by a and c, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible a and c and find the corresponding b. But our goal is to find the smallest b for which there are more than ten such numbers n.

So, perhaps I can model this as for each possible b, count how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the condition that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c), where a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1.

Alternatively, using the equation b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, we can see that for each a and c, b must be equal to that expression. But since b is fixed, perhaps for a given b, we can find all possible a and c that satisfy the equation.

Wait, maybe another approach is better. Let me think about n. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b <= n < b^2. Also, the sum of the digits, a + c, equals sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c, which means n = (a + c)^2. 

So, n must be a perfect square. That's an important point. So, n is equal to (a + c)^2, and it's also equal to a*b + c. So, we have:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Which can be rearranged as:

(a + c)^2 - c = a*b

So, b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Which we had earlier.

So, for each possible a and c, we can compute b. But since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, we need [(a + c)^2 - c] to be divisible by a.

Moreover, since a is the first digit in base b, a must satisfy 1 <= a < b. Similarly, c must satisfy 0 <= c < b.

But wait, n is a two-digit number in base b, so a must be at least 1 and less than b, and c must be at least 0 and less than b.

So, for each a and c, we can compute b and see if the conditions on a and c are satisfied for that b.

But perhaps a better approach is to fix b and then find all possible a and c pairs that satisfy the equation for that b.

Let me think. So, for a given b, n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1, inclusive. Also, n must be a perfect square, equal to (a + c)^2, where a and c are digits in base b.

So, the steps are:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. Enumerate all two-digit numbers in base b, which are from b to b^2 - 1.
   b. For each n in this range, check if n is a perfect square.
   c. If n is a perfect square, compute its square root s = sqrt(n).
   d. Express n in base b as a two-digit number, giving digits a and c.
   e. Check if a + c = s.
   f. Count how many such n exist for each b.
2. Find the smallest b for which the count exceeds 10.

But this approach could be computationally intensive if done manually. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Wait, since n = (a + c)^2 and n = a*b + c, we can write:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me let s = a + c, so n = s^2. Then the equation becomes:

s^2 = a*b + c

But c = s - a, so substituting:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Which simplifies to:

s^2 = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = a*b - a

Factor a on the right side:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 -
