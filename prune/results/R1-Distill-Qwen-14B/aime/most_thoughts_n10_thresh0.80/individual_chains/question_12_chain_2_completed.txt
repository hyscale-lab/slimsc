Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It's about placing digits in a 2x3 grid such that two conditions are satisfied. Let me paraphrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.

We have a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will contain a single digit (0-9). When we read the numbers formed by each row from left to right, their sum should be 999. Additionally, when we read the numbers formed by each column from top to bottom, their sum should be 99. 

The example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Here, the first row is 008 which is 8, and the second row is 991. Adding those, 8 + 991 = 999. For the columns, the first column is 09, which is 9; the second column is 09, which is 9; and the third column is 81. Adding those together: 9 + 9 +81=99. So this example satisfies both conditions.

I need to find how many such arrangements are possible. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to model this.

First, let's denote the grid cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the first row is the number formed by a, b, c. Since it's a 3-digit number, but the first digit a could be zero. Similarly, the second row is d, e, f, forming another 3-digit number. So, the sum of these two numbers is 999.

Similarly, each column is a 2-digit number. The first column is a followed by d, so the number is 10a + d. The second column is b followed by e, which is 10b + e. The third column is c followed by f, which is 10c + f. The sum of these three 2-digit numbers is 99.

So, the two main equations are:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I need to find all possible digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) where each is between 0 and 9, inclusive, that satisfy both equations.

Let me rewrite these equations for clarity.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that gives me any useful information.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99
Simplify the left side:

100a -10a + 10b -10b + c -10c + 100d -d +10e -e + f -f = 900
Which simplifies to:

90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900

I can factor out a 9 from all terms on the left:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me note that as Equation 3:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100

So now I have Equation 3 and Equation 2. Let me write them again:

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others using these equations.

Looking at Equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100

Let me think about this. Since a, c, d, e are digits (0-9), I can try to find possible values for a, c, d, and e that satisfy this equation.

Wait, but 10a is a term that can range from 0 to 90 (since a is 0-9). Similarly, 11d can be from 0 to 99, since d is 0-9. So 10a - c + 11d + e is equal to 100. Let's see the maximum and minimum possible values.

The maximum of 10a is 90, 11d is 99, so 90 + 99 = 189. e can add up to 9, so max is 198. The minimum, when a=0, d=0: 0 +0 -9 +0= -9. So, it's possible to reach 100.

But given that 10a - c +11d +e=100, let's see what possible combinations can give 100.

Let me denote:

10a +11d = 100 + c - e

Since c and e are digits (0-9), c - e can range from -9 to 9.

So 10a +11d = 100 + k, where k is between -9 and 9.

Therefore, 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

So now, 10a +11d must be between 91 and 109. Let me find possible (a, d) pairs that satisfy this.

Let me write down the possible values for 10a +11d:

a can be from 0 to 9, d from 0 to 9.

Compute 10a +11d for each a and d, and see which ones fall between 91 and 109.

Alternatively, since 10a +11d is between 91 and 109, let me express it as 10a = 91 -11d + k, where k is c - e, which is between -9 and 9.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to fix possible values for a and d, such that 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

Let me list possible (a, d) pairs:

Let me consider d from 0 to 9, and a from 0 to 9, and compute 10a +11d.

Let's see:

For d=0: 10a must be between 91 and 109. But 10a can be 0,10,...,90. So 91 is too much. So d=0 is not possible.

d=1: 11*1=11. So 10a must be between 91-11=80 to 109-11=98. So 10a is between 80 and 98. Thus, a can be 8,9. Because 10*8=80, 10*9=90.

So possible (a,d)=(8,1) and (9,1). Let me compute 10a +11d for these:

10*8 +11*1=80+11=91

10*9 +11*1=90+11=101

So both are within 91-109.

d=2: 11*2=22. So 10a must be between 91-22=69 to 109-22=87. So 10a from 69 to 87. Thus, a can be 7,8,9.

10a=70 (a=7) → 70+22=92

a=8 → 80+22=102

a=9 →90+22=112 → which is above 109. So only a=7,8.

So (a,d)=(7,2),(8,2). Let me compute 10a+11d:

70+22=92

80+22=102

d=3: 11*3=33 → 10a between 91-33=58 to 109-33=76.

10a must be 58-76. So a can be 6,7,8 (since 60,70,80). But 58 is not a multiple of 10, but 10a must be 60,70,80.

So for a=6: 60+33=93

a=7:70+33=103

a=8:80+33=113>109. So only a=6,7.

So (a,d)=(6,3), (7,3). 60+33=93; 70+33=103.

d=4: 11*4=44 → 10a between 91-44=47 and 109-44=65.

So 10a must be 50,60. So a=5,6.

Check:

a=5:50+44=94

a=6:60+44=104

So (a,d)=(5,4), (6,4). 94,104.

d=5: 11*5=55 → 10a between 91-55=36 and 109-55=54.

So 10a must be 40,50. So a=4,5.

So:

a=4:40+55=95

a=5:50+55=105

Thus, pairs (4,5), (5,5).

d=6:11*6=66 → 10a between 91-66=25 and 109-66=43.

So 10a can be 30,40. So a=3,4.

a=3:30+66=96

a=4:40+66=106

So (3,6), (4,6).

d=7:11*7=77 → 10a between 91-77=14 and 109-77=32.

So 10a can be 20,30. So a=2,3.

a=2:20+77=97

a=3:30+77=107

So (2,7), (3,7).

d=8:11*8=88 → 10a between 91-88=3 and 109-88=21.

So 10a must be 10,20. So a=1,2.

a=1:10+88=98

a=2:20+88=108

So pairs (1,8), (2,8).

d=9:11*9=99 → 10a between 91-99= -8 and 109-99=10.

So 10a must be 0,10. So a=0,1.

a=0:0+99=99 → which is less than 91? Wait, 99 is within 91-109? 99 is within that range.

Wait, 91 ≤ 10a +11d ≤ 109 → 10a +99 must be ≥91? 99 is 99, which is ≥91.

But 10a=0 when a=0, so 0+99=99. 99 is within 91-109.

Similarly, a=1:10+99=109, which is within the range.

So (a,d)=(0,9), (1,9).

So now, let me collect all possible (a,d) pairs:

d=1: (8,1), (9,1)
d=2: (7,2), (8,2)
d=3: (6,3), (7,3)
d=4: (5,4), (6,4)
d=5: (4,5), (5,5)
d=6: (3,6), (4,6)
d=7: (2,7), (3,7)
d=8: (1,8), (2,8)
d=9: (0,9), (1,9)

So that's a total of 2 pairs for each d, except perhaps for d=1 and d=9, but no, all d have 2 pairs except maybe d=0, which isn't considered here.

Wait, d=0 wasn't possible because 10a would need to be ≥91, but 10a can only be up to 90, so no.

So for each d from 1 to 9, there are two possible a's. So total of 9*2=18 possible (a,d) pairs.

Now, for each such pair, the equation 10a -c +11d +e=100 holds, which can be rewritten as:

e = 100 -10a +c -11d

But e is a digit, so 0 ≤ e ≤9.

So for each (a,d), c must be chosen such that e is a digit.

So e = 100 -10a +c -11d.

Let me rearrange:

c = e +10a -100 +11d

But since c is a digit (0-9), this puts constraints on e.

So, for each (a,d), c can be expressed in terms of e as:

c = e +10a -100 +11d

But c must be between 0 and 9.

So, let's write that:

0 ≤ e +10a -100 +11d ≤9

Which can be rewritten as:

100 -10a -11d ≤ e ≤ 9 -10a +100 -11d

Wait, that might not be the clearest way. Alternatively, rearranged:

e must satisfy:

100 -10a -11d -9 ≤ e ≤ 100 -10a -11d

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, c = e +10a -100 +11d

We have 0 ≤ c ≤9, so:

0 ≤ e +10a -100 +11d ≤9

Subtract 10a and add 100 -11d to all parts:

100 -10a -11d ≤ e ≤ 9 -10a +100 -11d

Wait, no, perhaps I should separate the inequalities.

From 0 ≤ e +10a -100 +11d:

=> e ≥ 100 -10a -11d

And from e +10a -100 +11d ≤9:

=> e ≤ 9 -10a +100 -11d

So,

100 -10a -11d ≤ e ≤ 9 -10a +100 -11d

Simplify:

100 -10a -11d ≤ e ≤ 109 -10a -11d

Wait, 9 +100=109, so yes.

Now, since e is a digit, 0 ≤e ≤9, so the lower bound must be ≤9, and the upper bound must be ≥0.

So, for each (a,d), the allowable e's must satisfy both:

100 -10a -11d ≤ e ≤ min(109 -10a -11d,9)

and

e ≥ max(100 -10a -11d, 0)

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to compute e for each (a,d) and see what possible c's can be.

Wait, but perhaps another way. Let me compute for each (a,d) pair, compute the value of (10a -11d). Then, since 10a -c +11d + e=100, rearranged as e = 100 -10a +c -11d.

So, e = (100 -10a -11d) + c

But e has to be between 0 and 9. So:

0 ≤ (100 -10a -11d) + c ≤9

Which can be rewritten as:

(10a +11d -100) ≤ c ≤ (10a +11d -91)

Wait, that seems a bit tricky, but perhaps I can compute (10a +11d) for each (a,d) pair, then find c in terms of that.

Wait, but earlier I had 10a +11d = 100 + c -e. Hmm, perhaps another approach is to note that for each (a,d), the value of 10a +11d is known, and from equation 3, 10a +11d = 100 + c -e.

But 10a +11d is known for each (a,d) pair, so let me compute that.

Wait, for each (a,d) pair, 10a +11d is between 91 and 109, as established earlier.

So 10a +11d = 100 + c - e → c - e = (10a +11d) -100

So, c - e = (10a +11d -100)

But c and e are digits, so c - e can be from -9 to 9.

But 10a +11d is known for each pair, so let me compute (10a +11d -100) for each (a,d) pair.

Let me make a table for each (a,d) pair and compute (10a +11d -100):

Let's go through each d and a.

d=1:

(a,d)=(8,1): 80 +11=91 →91-100= -9 → c - e = -9 → c = e -9

But since c must be ≥0, e must be at least 9. So e=9, c=0.

Similarly, (9,1): 90 +11=101 →101-100=1 → c -e=1 → c = e+1

Since c is a digit (0-9), e can be 0-8. So e can be from 0 to8, c would be 1-9.

Wait, but let's compute the possible e for each pair.

Starting with d=1:

Case 1: a=8, d=1.

c - e = 10*8 +11*1 -100 =80 +11=91 -100= -9 → c = e -9.

But c ≥0, so e must be ≥9. Since e is a digit, e=9, so c=0.

So only one possibility: e=9, c=0.

Case 2: a=9, d=1.

c - e = 10*9 +11*1 -100=90+11=101-100=1 → c = e+1.

Since c ≤9, e can be from 0 to8, but also e ≥0, so e can be 0-8, c=1-9.

So for this case, e can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → 9 possibilities.

Wait, but let me check if c is allowed. Since c=e+1, when e=8, c=9, which is valid. So 9 possible e's.

So for d=1:

(a,d)=(8,1) →1 possibility.

(a,d)=(9,1) →9 possibilities.

Next, d=2:

(a,d)=(7,2): 70 +22=92 →92-100= -8 →c -e= -8 →c=e-8

c must be ≥0 → e ≥8. Since e is a digit, e=8 or9. So:

e=8→c=0

e=9→c=1

So two possibilities.

Similarly, (8,2):80+22=102 →102-100=2 →c -e=2 →c=e+2

So e can be from 0 to7, since c must be ≤9.

So e=0→c=2

e=1→c=3

...

e=7→c=9

So 8 possibilities.

So for d=2:

(a,d)=(7,2):2 possibilities.

(a,d)=(8,2):8 possibilities.

d=3:

(a,d)=(6,3):60+33=93 →93-100= -7 →c=e-7

c ≥0 →e ≥7. So e=7→c=0; e=8→c=1; e=9→c=2.

So 3 possibilities.

(a,d)=(7,3):70+33=103 →103-100=3 →c=e+3

e can be from0 to6 (since c ≤9).

So e=0→3, e=1→4,... e=6→9. So 7 possibilities.

So for d=3:

(a,d)=(6,3):3 possibilities.

(a,d)=(7,3):7 possibilities.

d=4:

(a,d)=(5,4):50+44=94 →94-100= -6 →c=e-6.

e must be ≥6.

e=6→c=0

e=7→c=1

e=8→c=2

e=9→c=3

So 4 possibilities.

(a,d)=(6,4):60+44=104 →104-100=4 →c=e+4

e can be 0-5, since e+4 ≤9 →e≤5.

So e=0→4

e=1→5

...

e=5→9.

So 6 possibilities.

So for d=4:

(a,d)=(5,4):4 possibilities.

(a,d)=(6,4):6 possibilities.

d=5:

(a,d)=(4,5):40+55=95 →95-100= -5 →c=e-5.

e must be ≥5.

e=5→c=0

e=6→c=1

...

e=9→c=4.

So 5 possibilities.

(a,d)=(5,5):50+55=105 →105-100=5 →c=e+5

e can be 0-4 (since e+5 ≤9 →e ≤4).

So e=0→5

e=1→6

e=2→7

e=3→8

e=4→9

So 5 possibilities.

So for d=5:

(a,d)=(4,5):5 possibilities.

(a,d)=(5,5):5 possibilities.

Total for d=5:5 +5=10.

d=6:

(a,d)=(3,6):30+66=96 →96-100= -4 →c=e-4.

e must be ≥4.

e=4→c=0

e=5→c=1

...

e=9→c=5.

So 6 possibilities.

(a,d)=(4,6):40+66=106 →106-100=6 →c=e+6

e can be 0-3, since e+6 ≤9 →e≤3.

So e=0→6

e=1→7

e=2→8

e=3→9

So 4 possibilities.

So for d=6:

(a,d)=(3,6):6 possibilities.

(a,d)=(4,6):4 possibilities.

d=7:

(a,d)=(2,7):20+77=97 →97-100= -3 →c=e-3.

e must be ≥3.

e=3→c=0

...

e=9→c=6.

So 7 possibilities.

(a,d)=(3,7):30+77=107 →107-100=7 →c=e+7

e can be 0-2, since e+7 ≤9 →e ≤2.

So e=0→7

e=1→8

e=2→9

So 3 possibilities.

So for d=7:

(a,d)=(2,7):7 possibilities.

(a,d)=(3,7):3 possibilities.

d=8:

(a,d)=(1,8):10+88=98 →98-100= -2 →c=e-2.

e must be ≥2.

e=2→c=0

...

e=9→c=7.

So 8 possibilities.

(a,d)=(2,8):20+88=108 →108-100=8 →c=e+8

e can be 0-1, since e+8 ≤9 →e ≤1.

So e=0→8

e=1→9.

So 2 possibilities.

So for d=8:

(a,d)=(1,8):8 possibilities.

(a,d)=(2,8):2 possibilities.

d=9:

(a,d)=(0,9):0 +99=99 →99-100= -1 →c=e-1.

e must be ≥1.

e=1→c=0

e=2→c=1

...

e=9→c=8.

So 9 possibilities.

(a,d)=(1,9):10+99=109 →109-100=9 →c=e+9.

But c must be ≤9, so e+9 ≤9 →e=0.

So e=0→c=9.

Only 1 possibility.

So for d=9:

(a,d)=(0,9):9 possibilities.

(a,d)=(1,9):1 possibility.

So now, for each (a,d) pair, I can list the number of possible e and c combinations.

Let me summarize:

d=1:

(8,1):1

(9,1):9

Total:10

d=2:

(7,2):2

(8,2):8

Total:10

d=3:

(6,3):3

(7,3):7

Total:10

d=4:

(5,4):4

(6,4):6

Total:10

d=5:

(4,5):5

(5,5):5

Total:10

d=6:

(3,6):6

(4,6):4

Total:10

d=7:

(2,7):7

(3,7):3

Total:10

d=8:

(1,8):8

(2,8):2

Total:10

d=9:

(0,9):9

(1,9):1

Total:10

Wait, each d from 1 to9 has 10 possibilities for (a,d) and e,c. So 9 d's ×10=90.

Wait, that can't be right because for each (a,d) pair, the number of possibilities varies.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in summing. Let me recount for each d:

d=1:

(8,1):1

(9,1):9 → total 10.

d=2:

(7,2):2

(8,2):8 → total 10.

d=3:

(6,3):3

(7,3):7 → total 10.

d=4:

(5,4):4

(6,4):6 → total 10.

d=5:

(4,5):5

(5,5):5 → total 10.

d=6:

(3,6):6

(4,6):4 → total 10.

d=7:

(2,7):7

(3,7):3 → total 10.

d=8:

(1,8):8

(2,8):2 → total 10.

d=9:

(0,9):9

(1,9):1 → total 10.

So, each d contributes 10 possibilities. Since there are 9 d's, that's 9×10=90 possible combinations for a, d, e, c.

Wait, but is that correct? Because for each (a,d) pair, e and c are determined, but perhaps some of these are overlapping or not feasible.

Wait, no, because for each (a,d) pair, the number of possible (c,e) pairs is as computed. So for d=1, we have 10 possibilities, etc. So 9×10=90.

But wait, in the example given, all the digits are 0-9, and it works. So perhaps 90 is the total.

But let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let's see.

Once we have determined a, d, c, e, we still need to find b and f.

From Equation 2:

10a + d +10b + e +10c +f =99

We can rearrange this to express f:

f =99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c

Since f must be a digit (0-9), the right side must be between 0 and9.

So,

0 ≤ 99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c ≤9

Which can be rearranged as:

99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c ≥0 →10a +d +10b +e +10c ≤99

and

99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c ≤9 →10a +d +10b +e +10c ≥90

So, 90 ≤10a +d +10b +e +10c ≤99.

But since 10a +d +10b +e +10c is the same as the left side of Equation 2, which equals 99. So that seems redundant. Wait, but actually, Equation 2 is 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f=99. So f must be such that 99 - (10a +d +10b +e +10c) =f.

Since f is a digit, 0≤f≤9, so 10a +d +10b +e +10c must be between 99-9=90 and 99.

So, 90 ≤10a +d +10b +e +10c ≤99.

But from Equation 3, we have 10a -c +11d +e=100.

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation.

Wait, let me try to express 10a +d +10b +e +10c in terms of known quantities.

But perhaps I can find 10a +d +10b +e +10c from equation 2, which is 99 -f.

But f is between0 and9, so 10a +d +10b +e +10c=99 -f, which is between90 and99.

But how does this help? Maybe not too much.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of other variables.

Wait, we have:

Equation 2: 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f =99.

We can rearrange for b:

10b =99 -10a -d -e -10c -f

So,

b = (99 -10a -d -e -10c -f)/10

But b must be an integer between0 and9.

So the expression (99 -10a -d -e -10c -f) must be divisible by10, and the result must be between0 and90 (since 10b can be up to90).

But since 10a, d, 10c, e, f are known in terms of a, d, e, c, and f.

Wait, but f is determined by f=99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, let me note that 10a +d +10b +e +10c +f =99.

We can write this as:

(10a +10c) + (d +e) +10b +f =99.

But 10a +10c =10(a +c), so:

10(a +c) + (d +e) +10b +f =99.

But I'm not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 10a +d +10c +e = (10a +d) + (10c +e) = N.

But no, maybe it's better to consider that for each possible (a,d,e,c), we can compute the required 10b +f = 99 - (10a +d +e +10c).

So, 10b +f =99 - (10a +d +e +10c).

Let me denote S =10a +d +e +10c.

So, 10b +f =99 - S.

But 10b +f must be a two-digit number, since b is a digit and f is a digit. So, 10b +f can be from0 to99.

But since 99 - S must be equal to10b +f, and S is 10a +d +e +10c.

So, 99 - S must be between0 and99.

But also, 99 - S must be equal to10b +f, which is a number where b is the tens digit and f is the units digit.

So, 99 - S must be a number between0 and99, which it is, since S is between... Hmm, let's see.

What's the possible range of S=10a +d +e +10c.

We know that a can be 0-9, d 0-9, e 0-9, c 0-9.

So:

Minimum S: a=0, d=0, e=0, c=0 →0+0+0+0=0.

Maximum S: a=9, d=9, e=9, c=9 →90+9+9+90=198.

Wait, but in our case, since S is part of 10b +f =99 - S, which must be ≥0 and ≤99.

So, 99 - S ≥0 → S ≤99.

And 99 - S ≤99 → S ≥0.

So S must be between0 and99.

But S=10a +d +e +10c.

Given that a and c are digits, 10a and10c can each be up to90, so combined up to180, but with d and e up to9 each, so S can be up to 180+9+9=198.

But in our case, S must be ≤99, because 99 - S must be ≥0.

So, 10a +d +e +10c ≤99.

So for each (a,d,e,c), S must be ≤99.

But given that a and c are digits, let's see.

What is the maximum possible a and c such that 10a +10c ≤99.

10a +10c =10(a +c) ≤99 →a +c ≤9.9 →a +c ≤9.

So a +c must be ≤9.

But let me see, given that a and c are digits (0-9), a +c can be from0 to18, but in our case, to have S ≤99, a +c must be ≤9.

So, a +c ≤9.

So, for each (a,d,e,c), a +c must be ≤9.

But wait, considering that in our earlier analysis, for each (a,d) pair, c is determined as c = e +10a -100 +11d.

Wait, perhaps I can find a +c constraints.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting bogged down here. Let me try a different approach.

Once I have (a,d,e,c), which comes from the 90 possibilities (as earlier determined), I can compute S=10a +d +e +10c.

Then, 10b +f =99 - S.

So, 10b +f must be a two-digit number, or zero.

So, for each (a,d,e,c), compute S. If 99 - S is between0 and99, then 10b +f =99 - S.

But 10b +f is a number where b is the tens digit and f is the units digit.

So, for 99 - S to be a valid two-digit number (including single-digit with leading zero), 99 - S must be between0 and99, which is always true because S can be up to99.

Wait, but wait, S can be up to99, so 99 - S can be 0.

So, 10b +f can be 00 to99.

Which is fine because b and f are digits (0-9).

So, for each (a,d,e,c), if S ≤99, then 99 - S is the value of 10b +f.

But S=10a +d +e +10c.

So, for each (a,d,e,c) with S ≤99, we can compute 10b +f =99 - S.

Then, b is the tens digit, f is the units digit.

So, for example, if 99 - S=5, then 10b +f=05 →b=0, f=5.

If 99 - S=23 →b=2, f=3.

So, for each (a,d,e,c), as long as 99 - S is a valid two-digit number (including leading zero), we can find b and f.

But wait, 99 - S must be non-negative, which it is because S ≤99.

So, for each (a,d,e,c) with S=10a +d +e +10c ≤99, we can compute b and f uniquely.

So, the question is: how many of the 90 (a,d,e,c) combinations satisfy S ≤99?

Because for each such combination, there is exactly one (b,f) pair that satisfies the equation.

So, the total number of valid grids is equal to the number of (a,d,e,c) combinations where S=10a +d +e +10c ≤99.

Wait, but earlier I thought there are 90 such combinations, but perhaps not all of them satisfy S ≤99.

So, I need to find how many of these 90 (a,d,e,c) combinations have S ≤99.

Let me take a closer look.

In our earlier analysis, for each (a,d) pair, we found the possible (c,e) pairs. Now, for each of these, I can compute S=10a +d +e +10c and check if it's ≤99.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a condition on a and c such that 10a +10c ≤99 - (d +e).

But since d and e are digits (0-9), d +e can be up to18.

So, 10a +10c ≤99 - (d +e).

But since d +e can be as low as0, 10a +10c ≤99.

Which is the same as a +c ≤9.9, so a +c ≤9.

So, for each (a,d) pair, and for each (c,e) pair, we need a +c ≤9.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, for each (a,d), c was determined by e via c = e +10a -100 +11d.

So, perhaps a +c can be expressed in terms of a and e.

Wait, let me express a +c:

a +c =a + (e +10a -100 +11d)

= a +e +10a -100 +11d

=11a + e +11d -100

But from equation 3, 10a -c +11d +e=100.

We have c = e +10a -100 +11d.

So, a +c = a + e +10a -100 +11d =11a +e +11d -100.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can think differently.

Given that S=10a +d +e +10c, and we have c = e +10a -100 +11d.

So, substituting c into S:

S=10a +d +e +10*(e +10a -100 +11d)

=10a +d +e +10e +100a -1000 +110d

= (10a +100a) + (d +110d) + (e +10e) -1000

=110a +111d +11e -1000

So, S=110a +111d +11e -1000.

We need S ≤99.

So,

110a +111d +11e -1000 ≤99

→110a +111d +11e ≤1099

Divide both sides by11:

10a + (111/11)d + e ≤1099/11

Which is approximately:

10a +10.09d +e ≤99.909

But this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as:

11*(10a +10d + e) + d ≤1099.

Wait, maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S for each (a,d,e,c) and check if it's ≤99.

But given that there are 90 combinations, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.

Wait, but I can note that:

S=110a +111d +11e -1000

We can factor 11:

S=11*(10a +10d + e) + d -1000.

But perhaps this isn't useful.

Alternatively, maybe evaluate S for each (a,d,e,c) combination.

But that would be tedious. Perhaps it's better to see what's the maximum possible S.

Wait, but S=110a +111d +11e -1000.

We can think of S as:

S = 11*(10a +10d +e) +d -1000.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for each (a,d), 10a +11d is known.

From equation 3, 10a +11d = 100 + c -e.

So, 10a +11d =100 + (c -e).

But we also have S=10a +d +e +10c.

So, S = (10a +10c) + (d +e).

=10(a +c) + (d +e).

But from equation 3, 10a +11d +e =100 +c.

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of 10a +11d.

From equation 3, 10a +11d =100 +c -e → c =10a +11d -100 +e.

Substituting into S:

S=10a +d +e +10c =10a +d +e +10*(10a +11d -100 +e)

=10a +d +e +100a +110d -1000 +10e

=110a +111d +11e -1000.

So, S=110a +111d +11e -1000.

We need S ≤99.

So,

110a +111d +11e ≤1099.

Divide both sides by11:

10a + (111/11)d + e ≤99.909.

But 111/11 is approximately10.09.

So, 10a +10.09d +e ≤99.909.

Since a, d, e are integers, this is roughly:

10a +10d +e ≤99.

Because 10.09d is approximately10d +0.09d, and 0.09d is less than1 for d<12, which it is.

So, approximately, 10a +10d +e ≤99.

But 10a +10d +e =10(a +d) + e.

We can denote this as T=10(a +d) + e.

We need T ≤99.

Since a and d are digits (0-9), a +d can be from0 to18.

But T=10(a +d) +e, with e being 0-9, so T can be from0 to 189.

But we have T ≤99.

So,

10(a +d) +e ≤99.

Which implies that a +d ≤9, because if a +d=10, then 10*10=100, and even with e=0, T=100, which is >99.

So, a +d ≤9.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, for each (a,d) pair, a +d could be anything, but here, to satisfy T ≤99, a +d must be ≤9.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, when we looked at equation 3, 10a +11d =100 +c -e.

But to have a +d ≤9, considering a and d are from 0-9, but earlier we saw that for d=1, a=8, which gives a +d=9, which is allowed.

Similarly, for d=2, a=7, a +d=9.

This seems to fit.

So, the condition a +d ≤9 must hold.

Therefore, for each (a,d) pair, a +d must be ≤9.

So, let's go back to our (a,d) pairs and see which ones satisfy a +d ≤9.

From earlier:

d=1:

(a,d)=(8,1): a +d=9 → allowed.

(9,1): a +d=10 → not allowed, since a +d must be ≤9.

So, for d=1, only (8,1) is allowed.

d=2:

(7,2):7+2=9 → allowed.

(8,2):8+2=10 → not allowed.

So only (7,2).

d=3:

(6,3):6+3=9 → allowed.

(7,3):7+3=10 → not allowed.

So only (6,3).

d=4:

(5,4):5+4=9 → allowed.

(6,4):6+4=10 → not allowed.

Only (5,4).

d=5:

(4,5):4+5=9 → allowed.

(5,5):5+5=10 → not allowed.

Only (4,5).

d=6:

(3,6):3+6=9 → allowed.

(4,6):4+6=10 → not allowed.

Only (3,6).

d=7:

(2,7):2+7=9 → allowed.

(3,7):3+7=10 → not allowed.

Only (2,7).

d=8:

(1,8):1+8=9 → allowed.

(2,8):2+8=10 → not allowed.

Only (1,8).

d=9:

(0,9):0+9=9 → allowed.

(1,9):1+9=10 → not allowed.

Only (0,9).

So, for each d, only one (a,d) pair satisfies a +d ≤9.

So, for d=1: (8,1)

d=2: (7,2)

d=3: (6,3)

d=4: (5,4)

d=5: (4,5)

d=6: (3,6)

d=7: (2,7)

d=8: (1,8)

d=9: (0,9)

So, that's 9 (a,d) pairs where a +d ≤9.

Wait, but earlier for each d, there were two (a,d) pairs, but only one satisfies a +d ≤9.

So, for each d from1 to9, only one (a,d) pair is valid.

Now, for each such (a,d), let's find the possible (c,e) pairs and check if S=110a +111d +11e -1000 ≤99.

But perhaps it's easier to compute S for each (a,d) pair.

Let me compute S for each valid (a,d) pair.

But first, for each (a,d) pair, we have the possible (c,e) pairs.

Wait, let me go through each (a,d) pair:

1. d=1, a=8:

From earlier, (a,d)=(8,1) → c -e =-9 →e=9, c=0.

So, c=0, e=9.

Compute S=10a +d +e +10c=80 +1 +9 +0=90.

Which is ≤99. So valid.

2. d=2, a=7:

(a,d)=(7,2): c -e= -8 → e=8, c=0; e=9, c=1.

So possible (c,e):

(c=0,e=8) and (c=1,e=9).

Compute S for each:

- c=0, e=8: S=70 +2 +8 +0=80 ≤99 → valid.

- c=1, e=9: S=70 +2 +9 +10=91 ≤99 → valid.

So both are valid.

Wait, but earlier I thought each (a,d) pair had certain possibilities, but now I'm seeing that for d=2, a=7, we have two (c,e) pairs, both valid.

Wait, but earlier I thought only one (a,d) pair per d is valid, but it seems that each (a,d) pair may have multiple (c,e) pairs, and some of them may satisfy S ≤99.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in limiting to a +d ≤9. Because S=110a +111d +11e -1000 ≤99.

But perhaps even when a +d=10, it's possible that S ≤99.

Wait, but let's take an example where a +d=10.

Take d=1, a=9:

From earlier, for d=1, a=9, c = e +1.

So, e can be 0-8, c=e+1.

So, compute S=10a +d +e +10c=90 +1 +e +10*(e+1)=90+1 +e +10e +10=101 +11e.

We need S ≤99 →101 +11e ≤99 →11e ≤-2 → impossible, since e ≥0.

So, no solutions for d=1, a=9.

Similarly, for d=2, a=8:

c = e +2.

So S=80 +2 +e +10*(e+2)=82 +e +10e +20=102 +11e.

We need S ≤99 →102 +11e ≤99 →11e ≤-3 → impossible.

So, for a +d=10, no valid solutions.

Thus, only (a,d) pairs where a +d ≤9 are valid.

So, for each d from1 to9, only one (a,d) pair is valid, where a +d=9.

So, for each of these 9 pairs, let's compute the possible (c,e) pairs and see if S ≤99.

Wait, but earlier, for d=2, a=7, we had two (c,e) pairs, both leading to S=80 and91, which are ≤99.

So, perhaps for each (a,d) with a +d=9, the possible (c,e) pairs may lead to S ≤99.

Let me go through each (a,d) pair where a +d=9:

1. d=1, a=8:

(c=0,e=9). S=80 +1 +9 +0=90 ≤99 → valid.

Only 1 possibility.

2. d=2, a=7:

(c=0,e=8): S=70 +2 +8 +0=80.

(c=1,e=9):70 +2 +9 +10=91.

Both ≤99 → valid. So 2 possibilities.

3. d=3, a=6:

From earlier, for (6,3): c -e= -7 →e=7→c=0; e=8→c=1; e=9→c=2.

So, (c=0,e=7); (c=1,e=8); (c=2,e=9).

Compute S for each:

- c=0,e=7:60 +3 +7 +0=70 ≤99.

- c=1,e=8:60 +3 +8 +10=81 ≤99.

- c=2,e=9:60 +3 +9 +20=92 ≤99.

So all 3 possibilities are valid.

4. d=4, a=5:

For (5,4): c -e= -6 →e=6→c=0; e=7→c=1; e=8→c=2; e=9→c=3.

So, (c=0,e=6); (c=1,e=7); (c=2,e=8); (c=3,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=6:50 +4 +6 +0=60.

- c=1,e=7:50 +4 +7 +10=71.

- c=2,e=8:50 +4 +8 +20=82.

- c=3,e=9:50 +4 +9 +30=93.

All ≤99 → valid. So 4 possibilities.

5. d=5, a=4:

For (4,5): c -e= -5 →e=5→c=0; e=6→c=1; e=7→c=2; e=8→c=3; e=9→c=4.

So, (c=0,e=5); (c=1,e=6); (c=2,e=7); (c=3,e=8); (c=4,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=5:40 +5 +5 +0=50.

- c=1,e=6:40 +5 +6 +10=61.

- c=2,e=7:40 +5 +7 +20=72.

- c=3,e=8:40 +5 +8 +30=83.

- c=4,e=9:40 +5 +9 +40=94.

All ≤99 → valid. So 5 possibilities.

6. d=6, a=3:

For (3,6): c -e= -4 →e=4→c=0; e=5→c=1; e=6→c=2; e=7→c=3; e=8→c=4; e=9→c=5.

So, (c=0,e=4); (c=1,e=5); (c=2,e=6); (c=3,e=7); (c=4,e=8); (c=5,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=4:30 +6 +4 +0=40.

- c=1,e=5:30 +6 +5 +10=51.

- c=2,e=6:30 +6 +6 +20=62.

- c=3,e=7:30 +6 +7 +30=73.

- c=4,e=8:30 +6 +8 +40=84.

- c=5,e=9:30 +6 +9 +50=95.

All ≤99 → valid. So 6 possibilities.

7. d=7, a=2:

For (2,7): c -e= -3 →e=3→c=0; e=4→c=1; e=5→c=2; e=6→c=3; e=7→c=4; e=8→c=5; e=9→c=6.

So, (c=0,e=3); (c=1,e=4); (c=2,e=5); (c=3,e=6); (c=4,e=7); (c=5,e=8); (c=6,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=3:20 +7 +3 +0=30.

- c=1,e=4:20 +7 +4 +10=41.

- c=2,e=5:20 +7 +5 +20=52.

- c=3,e=6:20 +7 +6 +30=63.

- c=4,e=7:20 +7 +7 +40=74.

- c=5,e=8:20 +7 +8 +50=85.

- c=6,e=9:20 +7 +9 +60=96.

All ≤99 → valid. So 7 possibilities.

8. d=8, a=1:

For (1,8): c -e= -2 →e=2→c=0; e=3→c=1; e=4→c=2; e=5→c=3; e=6→c=4; e=7→c=5; e=8→c=6; e=9→c=7.

So, (c=0,e=2); (c=1,e=3); (c=2,e=4); (c=3,e=5); (c=4,e=6); (c=5,e=7); (c=6,e=8); (c=7,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=2:10 +8 +2 +0=20.

- c=1,e=3:10 +8 +3 +10=31.

- c=2,e=4:10 +8 +4 +20=42.

- c=3,e=5:10 +8 +5 +30=53.

- c=4,e=6:10 +8 +6 +40=64.

- c=5,e=7:10 +8 +7 +50=75.

- c=6,e=8:10 +8 +8 +60=86.

- c=7,e=9:10 +8 +9 +70=97.

All ≤99 → valid. So 8 possibilities.

9. d=9, a=0:

For (0,9): c -e= -1 →e=1→c=0; e=2→c=1; e=3→c=2; e=4→c=3; e=5→c=4; e=6→c=5; e=7→c=6; e=8→c=7; e=9→c=8.

So, (c=0,e=1); (c=1,e=2); (c=2,e=3); (c=3,e=4); (c=4,e=5); (c=5,e=6); (c=6,e=7); (c=7,e=8); (c=8,e=9).

Compute S:

- c=0,e=1:0 +9 +1 +0=10.

- c=1,e=2:0 +9 +2 +10=21.

- c=2,e=3:0 +9 +3 +20=32.

- c=3,e=4:0 +9 +4 +30=43.

- c=4,e=5:0 +9 +5 +40=54.

- c=5,e=6:0 +9 +6 +50=65.

- c=6,e=7:0 +9 +7 +60=76.

- c=7,e=8:0 +9 +8 +70=87.

- c=8,e=9:0 +9 +9 +80=98.

All ≤99 → valid. So 9 possibilities.

So, for each (a,d) pair where a +d=9, the number of valid (c,e) pairs is as follows:

d=1:1

d=2:2

d=3:3

d=4:4

d=5:5

d=6:6

d=7:7

d=8:8

d=9:9

So, the total number of valid (a,d,e,c) combinations is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45.

So, 45 valid combinations.

Now, for each of these 45 combinations, we can compute f=99 - S -10b, where S=10a +d +e +10c.

Wait, no. From equation 2:

10b +f=99 - S.

So, for each (a,d,e,c), compute S, then 10b +f=99 - S.

Since S=10a +d +e +10c, which we've already computed, and it's ≤99, 99 - S will be between0 and99.

But 10b +f must be a two-digit number where b is the tens digit and f is the units digit.

So, for each (a,d,e,c), 10b +f=99 - S.

Which gives us unique values for b and f, since b = (99 - S) //10, and f = (99 - S) %10.

So, for each of the 45 (a,d,e,c) combinations, we have exactly one (b,f) pair.

Thus, the total number of valid grids is 45.

Wait, but let me check with the example given.

In the example:

a=0, b=0, c=8,

d=9, e=9, f=1.

Compute S=10a +d +e +10c=0 +9 +9 +80=98.

Then, 10b +f=99 -98=1 →b=0, f=1.

Which is correct.

Another example:

Take d=2, a=7, c=1, e=9.

S=70 +2 +9 +10=91.

10b +f=99 -91=8 →b=0, f=8.

So, the grid would be:

7 0 1

2 9 8

Wait, no, wait: a=7, b is 0, c=1.

d=2, e=9, f=8.

Wait, no, a=7, d=2: second row starts with d=2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in variable assignment.

Wait, the grid is:

a b c

d e f

So, a=7, b=0, c=1

d=2, e=9, f=8.

So the grid is:

7 0 1

2 9 8

The sum of rows:701 +298=999.

Sum of columns:72 +09 +18=72+9+18=99.

Yes, that works.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the total number of valid grids is 45.


The number of valid ways to fill the grid is 45.

\boxed{45}
