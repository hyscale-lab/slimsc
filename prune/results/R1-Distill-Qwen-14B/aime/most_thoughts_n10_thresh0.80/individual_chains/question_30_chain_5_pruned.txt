Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use that here. The product given is over all the 13th roots of unity except ω=1, right? Because k goes from 0 to 12, but ω^0 is 1, which is excluded since ω ≠ 1. Wait, actually, the problem says ω ≠ 1, but we're taking k from 0 to 12. So actually, ω^k will be 1 when k=0, but the product includes that term. Hmm, maybe I need to handle that term separately.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The product is from k=0 to 12, which would include all 13th roots of unity as ω^k for each k. But since ω is a primitive 13th root (because it's a root and not equal to 1), the product is over all the 13th roots of unity. So maybe I can express this product in terms of some cyclotomic polynomial.

But the expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor 2 - 2ω^k as 2(1 - ω^k), so the term becomes 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Wait, maybe I can factor this expression differently. Let me see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term in the product is x² - 2x + 2, where x is a 13th root of unity.

So the entire product is the product over x ≠ 1 of (x² - 2x + 2). Wait, but x is a 13th root of unity, so x^13 = 1. So x runs over all the roots except x=1? No, when k=0, x=1 is included, right? So the product includes x=1 as well.

Wait, so when k=0, x = ω^0 = 1. So the term for k=0 is 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is 1, so it doesn't affect the product. So the product is
