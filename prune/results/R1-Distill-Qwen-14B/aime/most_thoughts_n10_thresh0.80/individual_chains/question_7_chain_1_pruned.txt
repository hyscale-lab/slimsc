Okay, I'm going to try to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

So, each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So, essentially, after coloring, we want to see if there's some rotation (by 0째, 45째, 90째, etc.) such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. That means the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, in other words, the blue vertices are a translate (rotationally equivalent) of the red vertices.

Wait, but since the octagon is regular, all rotations are symmetries. So, the coloring must be such that the blue set is a shifted version of the red set. But all vertices are colored either red or blue, so the number of red and blue vertices must be the same, right? Because if you rotate, the red and blue counts must remain the same. Wait, no, actually, that's not necessarily true. Because if the number of red and blue vertices is the same, then the rotation can potentially map reds to blues. But if the counts are different, then such a rotation is impossible.

Wait, so the first thing I should check is whether the number of red and blue vertices is the same. Because if not, the probability would be zero. But hold on, in the problem statement, each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability. So, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

But, the question is about the probability that such a rotation exists. So, if the number of red and blue vertices is not equal, then the probability is zero because you can't have a rotation mapping reds to blues if their counts are different. Therefore, only colorings with exactly 4 red and 4 blue vertices are relevant for this problem.

So, the first step is to figure out how many such colorings have exactly 4 red and 4 blue vertices. That would be C(8,4) = 70 colorings. So, the total possible favorable colorings would be a subset of these 70.

Wait, but not all colorings with 4 red and 4 blue satisfy the condition that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, we need to find how many colorings have this property.

So, how can the blue set be a rotation of the red set? That is, the red and blue sets are translates (rotated versions) of each other.

In other words, the coloring is such that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, for each possible rotation, we can check if such a coloring exists.

But since the octagon has rotational symmetry, perhaps these colorings are related to each other through rotation. So, maybe the colorings we're interested in are those which are fixed under some rotation.

Wait, perhaps the number of such colorings is equal to the number of orbits under the rotation group. Hmm, maybe Burnside's lemma could be useful here.

Wait, Burnside's lemma relates the number of orbits to the average number of fixed points. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a necklace counting problem, where we want colorings fixed under some rotation.

Wait, but in this problem, we don't require the coloring to be fixed under a rotation, but rather that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the coloring can be transformed into its complement by a rotation.

So, for a given coloring, if there exists a rotation that maps the blue vertices to the red vertices, then that coloring is counted. So, how many such colorings are there?

Alternatively, for each coloring with 4 red and 4 blue, we can check if the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, so perhaps another approach is to consider that the coloring must be such that the blue set is a cyclic shift (rotation) of the red set. So, for some k, shifting the octagon by k positions maps reds to blues.

But since the octagon has 8 positions, the possible rotations are by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions. Each rotation by k positions is equivalent to a rotation of 45째 * k.

So, for a given coloring, if it's possible that shifting the octagon by some k positions will turn reds into blues, then that coloring is counted.

So, the problem reduces to counting colorings with 4 red and 4 blue where the blue set is a shift of the red set by some k.

So, how many such colorings are
