Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that ω is not equal to 1, and it's a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1, right? So for a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime. So, that might be useful later.

Now, the product we're given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern or something. Let me see.

Looking at the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), I wonder if it can be rewritten or factored. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that's like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic.

Wait, the quadratic is in terms of ω^k. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the term becomes z² - 2z + 2. Let me see if that factors. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over real numbers, but maybe over complex? Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to the minimal polynomial of ω. Since ω^13 = 1, any polynomial in ω can be reduced modulo Φ₁₃(x). But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Wait, another thought: since we're taking the product over all k from 0 to 12, each term is evaluated at different roots of unity. Maybe the product is a resultant or something related to polynomials evaluated at roots of unity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product as a product over all ω^k, which are all the 13th roots of unity. So, the product is over k=0 to 12, which is over all roots, since each ω^k is a distinct root.

Wait, but in the expression, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), and we're multiplying all these together. Let me think of this as evaluating a certain polynomial at each root of unity and taking the product.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product over k=0 to 12 of (a - b
