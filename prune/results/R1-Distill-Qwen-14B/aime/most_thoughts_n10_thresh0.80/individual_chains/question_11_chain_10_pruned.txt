Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that for a complex number z, if its magnitude is given (|z| = 4 in this case), then z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z could also be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but using the exponential form might make things easier because it relates directly to the magnitude and angle.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since the magnitude of 1/z is 1/|z| = 1/4, and the angle is the negative of z's angle.

Now, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, multiply (75 + 117i) by 4:

75*4 = 300
117*4 = 468
So, (75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i

Similarly, (96 + 144i) multiplied by (1/4) is:

96*(1/4)=24
144*(1/4)=36
So, (96 + 144i)*(1/4) = 24 + 36i

So the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I can express each complex number in terms of their real and imaginary parts multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}.

I recall that any complex number a + bi can be written as r e^{iφ}, where r is the magnitude and φ is the angle. But maybe it's better to expand e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ} into their cosine and sine components.

So, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ
e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ

Let's substitute these into the expression:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Now, I need to multiply each term. Let me do each multiplication step by step.

First, expand (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

= 300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

Since i^2 = -1, that becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Now, group the real and imaginary parts:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

So, the first term is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Similarly, expand the second term (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, since i^2 = -1:

= 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

So, the second term is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Now, adding the two results together, the overall expression is:

[ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) ] + i[ (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) ]

Let me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real part:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary part:

300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
= (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, we need to find the maximum value of the real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, but that's a real function of θ. So, the real part is a linear combination of cosθ and sinθ, which can be written in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude, and φ is a phase shift.

I remember that any expression like a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and φ = arctan(b/a) if a is positive. Or maybe it's R cos(θ + φ), depending on the exact formula.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard identity is a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ = arctan(b/a). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as R sin(phi + theta), depending on the convention.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as R sin(theta + phi) or R sin(theta - phi). Hmm. Maybe I should compute R as sqrt(a² + b²), and then express it as R cos(theta - phi), where tan phi = b/a.

Wait, in our case, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, that's of the form a cosθ + b sinθ, where a = 324 and b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2 )

Compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So (300+24)^2= 90000 + 14400 +576 = 105, 14400 is 14,400; 90000 +14400 = 104,400; 104,400 +576=104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2=160,000; 32^2=1,024; and 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000 +25,600=185,600;
