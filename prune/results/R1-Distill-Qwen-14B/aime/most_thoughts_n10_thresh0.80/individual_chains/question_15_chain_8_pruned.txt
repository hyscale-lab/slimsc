Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right (east) and 8 steps up (north). So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense why the path length is 16. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, starting from the lower left, the first move is either right or up. Each change in direction increments the count. So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

If a path changes direction four times, how many segments does it consist of? Well, each direction change marks the end of a segment. So, starting with the initial direction, each change adds a new segment. So, four changes would mean five segments. Wait, that makes sense. If I have four changes, the number of straight segments is four plus one, which is five.

So, for example: right, up, right, up, right. That's four changes and five segments.

Now, each of these segments must consist of at least one step. Because you can't have a zero-length segment. So, each segment must have at least one step, either right or up.

Since there are five segments, and we have a total of 8 steps right and 8 steps up. So, we need to distribute the 8 right steps into some of the five segments, and the 8 up steps into the others. But each segment can only be either right or up, not both. Because once you change direction, you switch to the other.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each segment alternates between
