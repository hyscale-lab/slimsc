Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's draw a rough sketch to visualize the problem. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. Points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So, probably, the rectangles are placed next to each other along that line. 

Wait, ABCD: Let's note the sides. BC is 16, which is one of the sides. AB is 107. So, in rectangle ABCD, sides AB and CD are 107, and sides BC and AD are 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG is 17, EF is 184. So, EF and GH are 184, FG and EH are 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line is probably the base for both rectangles. So, maybe ABCD is sitting above this line, and EFGH is sitting below, or something like that. Alternatively, they could be on the same side. Hmm.

Wait, but A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, four points from both rectangles lie on a single circle. That suggests that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe the circle is the circumcircle of quadrilateral ADHG.

Let me think. Let's assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (16,0), because BC is 16. Wait, no, wait. If D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, AD is vertical. So, AB is 107, so moving from A to B is 107 units. Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates step by step.

Let me set coordinate system: Letâ€™s assume point D is at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, with D at (0,0), then point C would be at (length BC, 0) which is (16, 0). Then, point B would be at (16, AB) which is (16, 107). Point A would be at (0, 107). So, ABCD has coordinates A(0,107), B(16,107), C(16,0), D(0,0).

Now, rectangle EFGH: points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line DC is from (0,0) to (16,0). So, points D, E, C, F lie along the x-axis. So, point E must be to the left of D or to the right of C. Similarly, point F must be on the same line. Wait, but D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0). So, if E and F are on the same line, which is the x-axis, then E and F could be on either side.

But since A, D, H, G are on a circle, let's see. Point A is at (0,107), D is at (0,0). So, point H must be somewhere, and G must be somewhere such that all four are on a circle.

Let me figure out the coordinates of EFGH. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are on the x-axis. Let me assume that E is to the left of D, so at (x, 0), and F is to the right of C, at (16 + y, 0). Then, since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17.

Wait, but wait, EF is 184, which is the length along the x-axis. So, the distance between E and F is 184. If E is at (a, 0) and F is at (b, 0), then |b - a| = 184. Also, the sides FG and EH are 17, which would be the vertical sides of the rectangle. So, point G is at (b, 17), and point H is at (a, 17). Because from F, moving up 17 units to G, and from E, moving up 17 units to H.

Wait, but in the rectangle EFGH, EF is the base, so if E is at
