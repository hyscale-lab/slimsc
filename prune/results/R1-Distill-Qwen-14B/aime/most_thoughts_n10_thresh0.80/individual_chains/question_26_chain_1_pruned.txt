Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to visualize the problem first based on the Asymptote figure provided.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's jot down what we know:

- Triangle ABC with sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.
- ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.
- Tangents at B and C meet at D.
- AD intersects ω again at P.
- Find AP.

First, I should recall some properties of tangent lines and circles. The tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

But since we don't know where O is, maybe that's not the immediate way to go. Alternatively, I remember that the point where two tangents intersect (like D here) has some properties related to the triangle.

Wait, D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. So, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to ω? Or is it the ex-tangent point? Hmm, maybe I should recall that D is the exsimilicenter or something related to triangle ABC.

Wait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the point D is the ex-tangent point opposite to A. Because the tangents at B and C meet at D, which is outside the triangle. So maybe D is the exsimilicenter of the circle ω with respect to BC.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to ω. So, Power(D) = DB^2 = DC^2.

Yes, that's correct. Since DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω, so DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, but how does that help me? Maybe I can find some relation between the sides of triangle ABC and the lengths related to D.

Alternatively, since AD intersects the circle again at P, maybe I can use power of point A with respect to ω. But A is on ω, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, but maybe if I consider point D. The power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2 = DP * DA. Because AD passes through P, which is another intersection point. So, Power(D) = DB^2 = DP * DA.

That's an important relation.
