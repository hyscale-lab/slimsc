Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we have to find m + n.

Alright, so we're dealing with conditional probability here. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "winning the grand prize" and event B is "winning a prize." But wait, if you win the grand prize, you automatically win a prize because having all four numbers match means you have at least two. So A is a subset of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is just A.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

So I need to compute the probabilities of A and B.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers from S, which has 10 numbers. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is C(10,4). Let me compute that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So the total number of possible outcomes is 210.

Now, event A: winning the grand prize. That means all four of Jen's numbers are picked. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is just 1 (only one combination matches exactly her numbers). So P(A) is 1/210.

Next, event B: winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

We can compute the number of favorable outcomes for B by calculating the number of ways to choose 2, 3, or 4 numbers from her 4 and the remaining from the other 6 numbers in S.

Wait, let me think. So, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. The number of favorable outcomes for B is the sum of:

1. Choosing exactly 2 of Jen's numbers and 2 from the remaining 6.

2. Choosing exactly 3 of Jen's numbers and 1 from the remaining 6.

3. Choosing exactly 4 of Jen's numbers (which is only 1 way).

So, let's compute each of these:

1. Exactly 2: C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So 6*15=90.

2. Exactly 3: C(4,3) * C(6,1). C(4,3)=4 and C(6,1)=6. So 4*6=24.

3. Exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So event B has 115 favorable outcomes, so P(B)=115/210.

Wait, let me confirm that. So, the number of ways to have at least two matches is 115, so P(B)=115/210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So 23/42. So P(B)=23/42.

And P(A)=1/210.

So, the probability we're looking for is P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.

So, P(A) is definitely 1/210, since there's only one winning combination for the grand prize.

For P(B), we have at least two matches, which is exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Calculating the number of ways:

Exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.

Exactly 4: 1.

Total is 90+24+1=115. That seems correct.

So P(B)=115/210=23/42.

Then, the conditional probability is P(A|B)=P(A)/P(B)= (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, but 1/115 is m/n where m=1 and n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them.

So m=1, n=115, so m + n=116.

But wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, another way to compute conditional probability is to consider the number of favorable outcomes for A given B, over the number of favorable outcomes for B.

In this case, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, and the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115. So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Alternatively, since we know that when A occurs, B must occur, so the probability is the ratio of the number of A outcomes to B outcomes, which is 1/115.

Alternatively, let's think about it in terms of hypergeometric distribution.

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is the same as the probability that she has 4 matching numbers given that she has at least 2 matching numbers.

In terms of the hypergeometric formula, but perhaps it's the same as what we've already done.

Alternatively, let me model the problem as follows:

Total possible lottery draws: C(10,4)=210.

Number of draws where Jen wins a prize: 115.

Number of draws where Jen wins the grand prize:1.

Therefore, conditional probability is 1/115.

Wait, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, perhaps I should compute it another way.

Alternatively, since we're given that she won a prize, which is at least
