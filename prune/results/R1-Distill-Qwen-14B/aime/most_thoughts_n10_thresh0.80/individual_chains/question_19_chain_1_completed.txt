Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. We need to find AB·AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's jot down what we know:

1. Triangle ABC has a circumradius (R) of 13. So, the circumcircle has radius 13.
2. The inradius (r) is 6. So, the incircle has radius 6.
3. The incenter I is such that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

Our goal is to find AB multiplied by AC, which is written as AB·AC or AB × AC.

I think I should recall some properties about triangle centers and relations between inradius, circumradius, and other elements.

First, the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. But since we don't know the sides yet, maybe that's not directly helpful.

The inradius r is related to the area A and the semiperimeter s by r = A/s. So, since r is given as 6, that tells us A = r * s = 6s.

Also, I remember that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. I think it's OI^2 = R(R - 2r). So, OI = sqrt[R(R - 2r)]. Let me verify that.

Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, with R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI.

OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Alright, so OI is sqrt(13). Now, we also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Wait, no, it's not necessarily vectors, but their lines are perpendicular. So, maybe we can use some coordinate geometry here? Or perhaps use some triangle properties.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry could help. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point O at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point I is somewhere else, but we know the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Let me denote the coordinates of I as (h, k), so that h^2 + k^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 = 13.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. Vector IA would be from A to I, but wait, in coordinates, if A is at some point, then vector IA is (h - x_A, k - y_A). Vector OI is (h, k). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero because they're perpendicular.

So, the dot product is (h - x_A)*h + (k - y_A)*k = 0. Expanding that, h^2 - h x_A + k^2 - k y_A = 0.

But since h^2 + k^2 = 13, substitute that in:

13 - (h x_A + k y_A) = 0 => h x_A + k y_A = 13.

So, the dot product of vectors OA and OI is 13.

But OA is the vector from O to A, which is just the coordinates of A, (x_A, y_A). So, OA · OI = h x_A + k y_A = 13.

But OA is a point on the circumcircle of radius 13, so OA has length 13. So, OA = (x_A, y_A) with x_A^2 + y_A^2 = 13^2 = 169.

So, the dot product of OA and OI is 13, and the magnitude of OA is 13, and the magnitude of OI is sqrt(13). So, using the dot product formula:

OA · OI = |OA| |OI| cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OA and OI.

So, 13 = 13 * sqrt(13) * cos(theta). Therefore, cos(theta) = 13 / (13 * sqrt(13)) ) = 1/sqrt(13).

So, theta, the angle between OA and OI, is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).

Hmm, that might be useful later.

Alternatively, maybe we can find some relations using trigonometric identities or triangle properties.

Let me also recall that in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. The formula for the length of IA is 2R sin(A/2). So, IA = 2R sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think the formula is IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me check.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A. Alternatively, another formula is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me confirm.

I think yes, IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, there's a formula IA = 2R sin(A/2). Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's better to derive it.

In triangle ABC, let me denote the inradius as r, and the exradius opposite A as r_a. But I might be mixing things up.

Wait, considering the inradius formula, I think the distance from I to A is not straightforward. Maybe we can use trigonometric relationships.

Alternatively, since we know that IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can represent this in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Wait, another approach: Let's recall that in triangle ABC, the Euler line connects O and I, but in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI, which might suggest that triangle AIO is right-angled at I.

So, triangle AIO is right-angled at I. So, AO^2 = AI^2 + IO^2.

We know AO is the circumradius, which is 13. IO is sqrt(13), so AO^2 = 13^2 = 169, IO^2 = 13, so AI^2 = AO^2 - IO^2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, AI = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, AI is 2*sqrt(39). Hmm. Now, I can use this information.

Earlier, I thought about the formula for IA. Let me see if I can find a formula that relates IA to other triangle parameters.

I found a formula online before that IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me confirm that.

Wait, thinking about the inradius and exradius... Alternatively, in triangle AIF, where F is the point where the incircle touches BC, AI is the angle bisector, and maybe we can express AI in terms of the sides.

Wait, another formula: AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)). So, if that's the case, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But we found AI = 2*sqrt(39). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, angle A/2 has sine equal to sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, angle A/2 is arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Hmm, let me compute cos(A/2) as well, because that might come in handy.

Since sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (sqrt(39)/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Alright, now, I want to relate this to the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the sides opposite angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So, BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

We know that r = 6, and A = r * s = 6s.

Also, the area can be written using the formula A = (abc)/(4R). Since R=13, A = (a b c)/(4*13) = (a b c)/52.

But A is also 6s, so 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities with angles.

We can express sides in terms of the circumradius. Remember that a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.

Wait, since R = 13, a = 2*13*sin A = 26 sin A, same for others.

So, sides are proportional to the sine of their opposite angles.

Hmm, so if I can find angle A, perhaps I can find the sides.

Given that we have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe we can find sin A and cos A.

Using the double-angle formula, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) ) = 2*(sqrt(39 * 130))/169.

Compute sqrt(39 * 130): 39 * 130 = 5070. sqrt(5070) = let's see, 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13². So sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13²) = 13 * sqrt(30).

So, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Therefore, side a = 26 sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).

So, BC = a = 4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, but we need AB * AC, which is c * b.

Given that b = 26 sin B and c = 26 sin C, so b * c = (26)^2 sin B sin C.

So, b*c = 676 sin B sin C.

Hmm. So, if I can find sin B sin C, I can find b*c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find angles B and C.

Let me think about the sum of angles in a triangle. A + B + C = 180 degrees.

We know sin(A) = 2 sqrt(30)/13. Let me compute cos A as well.

cos A = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 169 = 7/13.

Wait, wait, that's one formula for cos A.

Alternatively, cos A = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = 91/169 = 7/13.

Alternatively, using the double angle formula: cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 91/169 = 7/13.

So, cos A is 7/13.

Alternatively, from sin A and cos A, we can find tan A.

But maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, let's think about the area.

We have A = 6s, and also A = (a b c)/(4R) = (a b c)/(52), as earlier.

But a = 4 sqrt(30), and R =13.

So, A = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52 = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

But A is also 6s.

So, 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

Hmm, but we don't know b and c, or s.

Alternatively, maybe we can find s in terms of the sides.

s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, 6s = 3(a + b + c).

From the area, 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

So, 3(a + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

But a = 4 sqrt(30). So,

3(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find another equation.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for r, which is r = (A)/s = 6.

We have A = 6s, so 6s = (sqrt(30)/13)*b c.

Wait, but another formula for area is A = r*s = 6s.

So, 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

That gives b c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for cos A.

We have cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2 b c).

We know cos A is 7/13, a = 4 sqrt(30), so a² = 16*30 = 480.

So,

7/13 = (b² + c² - 480)/(2 b c).

Multiply both sides by 2 b c:

(14/13) b c = b² + c² - 480.

So,

b² + c² - (14/13) b c = 480.

Hmm, that's one equation.

Another equation we have is from the area.

Earlier, we had 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So,

6 * [ (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ] = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

Simplify left side:

3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) * b c.

So,

12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

Let me write that as:

(sqrt(30)/13) b c - 3b - 3c - 12 sqrt(30) = 0.

Hmm, that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps let me denote x = b and y = c.

So, we have two equations:

1. (14/13) x y = x² + y² - 480.

2. (sqrt(30)/13) x y - 3x - 3y - 12 sqrt(30) = 0.

Hmm, that's two equations with two variables, x and y.

This might get messy, but perhaps we can find a way to solve it.

Let me write equation 2 as:

(sqrt(30)/13) x y = 3x + 3y + 12 sqrt(30).

Let me multiply both sides by 13/sqrt(30):

x y = (39/sqrt(30)) x + (39/sqrt(30)) y + 156.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe we can express equation 1 in terms of x y.

Equation 1: (14/13) x y = x² + y² - 480.

So,

x² + y² = (14/13) x y + 480.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps express equation 2 in terms of x y and substitute.

Wait, equation 2: (sqrt(30)/13) x y = 3x + 3y + 12 sqrt(30).

Let me denote equation 2 as:

x y = [3x + 3y + 12 sqrt(30)] * (13)/sqrt(30).

So,

x y = (39/sqrt(30)) x + (39/sqrt(30)) y + (156)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, this seems complicated because of the sqrt(30) terms.

Wait, perhaps rationalize the denominators.

39/sqrt(30) = (39 sqrt(30))/30 = (13 sqrt(30))/10.

Similarly, 156/sqrt(30) = (156 sqrt(30))/30 = (26 sqrt(30))/5.

So, equation 2 becomes:

x y = (13 sqrt(30)/10) x + (13 sqrt(30)/10) y + (26 sqrt(30))/5.

Hmm, still not very helpful.

Wait, maybe I can let u = x + y and v = x y.

Then, equation 1 can be written as:

v = (14/13) v + 480.

Wait, no, equation 1 is x² + y² = (14/13) v + 480.

But x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = u² - 2v.

So,

u² - 2v = (14/13) v + 480.

So,

u² = (14/13) v + 480 + 2v = (14/13 + 2) v + 480.

Compute (14/13 + 26/13) = 40/13.

So,

u² = (40/13) v + 480.

Equation 2: v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) x + (13 sqrt(30)/10) y + (26 sqrt(30))/5.

But x + y = u, so equation 2 becomes:

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30))/5.

So,

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (52 sqrt(30)/10).

So,

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30)/5).

Hmm, now we have:

From equation 1,

u² = (40/13) v + 480.

And from equation 2,

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30)/5).

So, we can substitute v into equation 1.

Let me write:

u² = (40/13)[ (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30)/5) ] + 480.

Let's compute this:

First, 40/13 multiplied by the terms inside:

= (40/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (40/13)*(26 sqrt(30)/5).

Simplify each term:

First term: (40/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) u = (40/10)*sqrt(30) u = 4 sqrt(30) u.

Second term: (40/13)*(26 sqrt(30)/5) = (40 * 26)/(13*5) ) * sqrt(30) = (40*2)/5 * sqrt(30) = (80/5) sqrt(30) = 16 sqrt(30).

So, putting it together:

u² = 4 sqrt(30) u + 16 sqrt(30) + 480.

So,

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - 16 sqrt(30) - 480 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in u. Let's write it as:

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - (16 sqrt(30) + 480) = 0.

We can solve for u using the quadratic formula.

Let me denote the equation as:

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - C = 0, where C = 16 sqrt(30) + 480.

The quadratic formula gives u = [4 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))^2 + 4C ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant D:

D = (4 sqrt(30))^2 + 4C = 16*30 + 4*(16 sqrt(30) + 480) = 480 + 64 sqrt(30) + 1920 = (480 + 1920) + 64 sqrt(30) = 2400 + 64 sqrt(30).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution into equation 1.

From equation 2: v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30)/5).

Equation 1: u² = (40/13) v + 480.

So, substitution gives:

u² = (40/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10 u + 26 sqrt(30)/5) + 480.

Compute each term:

(40/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10 u) = (40/13)*(13/10) sqrt(30) u = (40/10) sqrt(30) u = 4 sqrt(30) u.

(40/13)*(26 sqrt(30)/5) = (40*26)/(13*5) sqrt(30) = (80/5) sqrt(30) = 16 sqrt(30).

So yes, correct.

So, u² = 4 sqrt(30) u + 16 sqrt(30) + 480.

So, the quadratic is correct.

So, solving for u:

u = [4 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))^2 + 4*(16 sqrt(30) + 480) ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(4 sqrt(30))^2 = 16*30 = 480.

4*(16 sqrt(30) + 480) = 64 sqrt(30) + 1920.

So, D = 480 + 64 sqrt(30) + 1920 = 2400 + 64 sqrt(30).

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe factor out 16?

Wait, 2400 = 16*150, and 64 sqrt(30) = 16*4 sqrt(30). So, D = 16*(150 + 4 sqrt(30)).

So, sqrt(D) = 4*sqrt(150 + 4 sqrt(30)).

Hmm, but sqrt(150 + 4 sqrt(30)) is still not a nice number. Maybe we can approximate it, but perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let's go back.

Wait, when I expressed equation 1, I had:

x² + y² = (14/13) x y + 480.

But x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = u² - 2v.

So,

u² - 2v = (14/13) v + 480.

Which simplifies to:

u² = (14/13 + 2) v + 480.

But 2 is 26/13, so 14/13 + 26/13 = 40/13. So,

u² = (40/13) v + 480.

Then, equation 2 is:

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10) u + (26 sqrt(30)/5).

But maybe I can factor out 13 sqrt(30)/10 from the terms:

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10)(u + 2).

Because 26 sqrt(30)/5 is (26 sqrt(30)/5) = (52 sqrt(30)/10) = 2*(26 sqrt(30)/10) = 2*(13 sqrt(30)/5). Wait, maybe I should just express it as:

v = (13 sqrt(30)/10)(u + 2).

So, substituting into equation 1:

u² = (40/13) * [ (13 sqrt(30)/10)(u + 2) ] + 480.

Simplify:

= (40/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) (u + 2) + 480.

= (40/10 * sqrt(30)) (u + 2) + 480.

= 4 sqrt(30)(u + 2) + 480.

So,

u² = 4 sqrt(30) u + 8 sqrt(30) + 480.

Thus,

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - 8 sqrt(30) - 480 = 0.

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Because I think I miscalculated the substitution.

Wait, let me compute (40/13) * [ (13 sqrt(30)/10)(u + 2) ].

40/13 * 13 sqrt(30)/10 = (40/10)*sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).

So, (40/13)*v = 4 sqrt(30) (u + 2).

So, equation 1 becomes u² = 4 sqrt(30) (u + 2) + 480.

Which is u² = 4 sqrt(30) u + 8 sqrt(30) + 480.

So,

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - 8 sqrt(30) - 480 = 0.

So, the quadratic is:

u² - 4 sqrt(30) u - (8 sqrt(30) + 480) = 0.

So, discriminant D is [4 sqrt(30)]^2 + 4*(8 sqrt(30) + 480).

Compute D:

(4 sqrt(30))^2 = 16*30 = 480.

4*(8 sqrt(30) + 480) = 32 sqrt(30) + 1920.

So, D = 480 + 32 sqrt(30) + 1920 = 2400 + 32 sqrt(30).

Wait, that's still not a nice number. Maybe factor:

2400 + 32 sqrt(30) = 32 sqrt(30) + 2400.

Hmm, perhaps factor out 16:

16*(150 + 2 sqrt(30)).

So sqrt(D) = 4 sqrt(150 + 2 sqrt(30)).

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not use substitution but think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities again. Since angle A is known, perhaps we can express angles B and C in terms of A, then find the sides.

We know angle A, and that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so B + C = 180° - A.

Also, since a = 4 sqrt(30), which is 2R sin A, as we found before.

Wait, another thought: Maybe use the formula for the product of sides b and c.

We know that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle.

Wait, the area is (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not help directly.

Wait, but in this case, we have A = 6s, and also A = (1/2)ab sin C. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, the product bc can be expressed as 2A / sin A, but wait, let me think.

Wait, formula for area A is (1/2)ab sin C, but I'm looking for bc.

Wait, perhaps using the formula A = r s, which is 6s. Also, A = (a b c)/(4 R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52 = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

So,

6s = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

But s is (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So,

6*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

Simplify:

3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

Which is the same as equation 2 we had earlier.

So, I'm going around in circles here.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that the triangle is such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Maybe there's a property or theorem related to this condition.

Wait, I found a resource that says when IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle satisfies a certain condition. Let me recall.

I think in this case, the triangle is such that the inradius r and the distance OI relate in a specific way.

Wait, but I already used Euler's formula to find OI = sqrt(13). And IA is 2 sqrt(39).

Wait, another approach: Maybe using coordinates.

Let me try to model this.

We set O at (0,0), and I at (h, k), with h² + k² =13.

Point A is somewhere on the circumcircle, so x_A² + y_A² =169.

We also have that IA is perpendicular to OI, so the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular.

Vector IA is (h - x_A, k - y_A).

Vector OI is (h, k).

Their dot product is zero:

(h - x_A)h + (k - y_A)k = 0.

Which simplifies to h x_A + k y_A = h² + k² =13.

So, OA · OI =13.

But OA is (x_A, y_A), and OI is (h, k). So, OA · OI =13.

But OA has length 13, OI has length sqrt(13), so the dot product is |OA||OI|cos(theta) =13*sqrt(13)*cos(theta)=13.

Thus, cos(theta)=1/sqrt(13), as we found earlier.

Which tells us that the angle between OA and OI is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).

Hmm, but I don't know if that helps.

Wait, another idea: The vector OA can be expressed in terms of OI and some other vector perpendicular to OI.

Wait, since OA · OI =13, and |OI|=sqrt(13), |OA|=13.

So, OA = (1/sqrt(13)) OI + something perpendicular.

Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps express OA in polar coordinates.

Let me consider OI as a vector of length sqrt(13), and OA as a vector of length 13, with the angle between them being theta where cos(theta)=1/sqrt(13).

So, OA can be expressed as:

OA = |OA| * [ (OI / |OI| ) * cos(theta) + v_perp * sin(theta) ],

where v_perp is a unit vector perpendicular to OI.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps using vector projection.

The projection of OA onto OI is (OA · OI)/|OI| =13/sqrt(13)=sqrt(13).

So, the projection is sqrt(13).

Since |OI|=sqrt(13), the projection of OA onto OI is equal to OI itself.

Wait, that's interesting. Wait, the projection of OA onto OI is sqrt(13), which is exactly the length of OI.

Which would mean that OI is the projection of OA onto OI.

Hmm, so that would imply that OA is equal to OI plus a vector perpendicular to OI.

So, OA = OI + w, where w is a vector perpendicular to OI.

So, |OA|² = |OI|² + |w|².

Which gives,

13² = (sqrt(13))² + |w|² => 169 =13 + |w|² => |w|²=156 => |w|=sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39).

Which is consistent with AI =2*sqrt(39), since AI is the length of w.

Hmm, so that suggests that vector w is equal to vector AI, which is consistent with AI being perpendicular to OI.

So, that makes sense.

So, OA = OI + AI.

But since AI is perpendicular to OI, their magnitudes are sqrt(13) and 2 sqrt(39), respectively.

So, OA is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs OI and AI.

So, OA has length sqrt( (sqrt(13))² + (2 sqrt(39))² )= sqrt(13 + 4*39)=sqrt(13 + 156)=sqrt(169)=13, which matches.

So, that's consistent.

But I'm not sure if that helps us find AB · AC.

Wait, AB · AC would be the product of the lengths AB and AC.

Which, in terms of the sides, is c * b.

Earlier, we have a =4 sqrt(30), and R=13.

So, sides are a=4 sqrt(30), b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, product bc= (26)^2 sin B sin C.

But angle B + angle C = 180 - angle A.

We know angle A, as we found sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, and cos(A)=7/13.

So, angle A is arccos(7/13).

Let me compute angle A in degrees to get an idea.

But maybe it's not necessary. Let's proceed.

We can use the sine rule: a/sin A = 2R =26.

So, a=2R sin A, which is consistent: 26 sin A =4 sqrt(30) => sin A= (4 sqrt(30))/26 = (2 sqrt(30))/13, which matches our earlier result.

Now, since B + C = 180 - A.

We can express sin B sin C as [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.

But cos(B + C) = cos(180 - A) = -cos A = -7/13.

So,

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-7/13)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + 7/13]/2.

But I don't know cos(B - C).

Alternatively, perhaps another identity.

Wait, using product to sum formula:

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.

As above.

We know cos(B + C) = -7/13.

So,

sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) +7/13]/2.

But without knowing cos(B - C), this doesn't help directly.

Wait, but from the law of cosines, we can write:

b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c cos A = a^2.

We know a=4 sqrt(30), so a²=480.

So,

b² + c² - 2 b c (7/13) =480.

Which is the same as equation 1.

So, equation 1: b² + c² - (14/13) b c =480.

So, I don't think that helps.

Wait, but maybe we can use another identity involving sin B sin C.

Wait, from the area formula, A = (1/2)ab sin C.

But A is 6s, and s is (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, perhaps using another approach.

Let me think about the formula for bc.

From the formula A = (a b c)/(4R), we have:

6s = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/52 => 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So,

6 * (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

Simplify:

3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

Which is the same as equation 2.

So, same as before.

Hmm. I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the inradius r = (A)/s.

We have r=6, so A=6s.

Also, A = (1/2)ab sin C = (1/2)ac sin B.

Wait, but not sure.

Wait, maybe from the fact that b + c = 2s - a.

But s = (a + b + c)/2, so b + c = 2s - a.

Given that a=4 sqrt(30), so b + c = 2s -4 sqrt(30).

But we have 6s = (sqrt(30)/13) b c.

So, s = (sqrt(30)/78) b c.

So, b + c = 2*(sqrt(30)/78) b c -4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, but that introduces b + c in terms of b c, which might not help.

Wait, perhaps let me denote t = b + c, and u = b c.

Then, we have two equations:

1. From equation 1: b² + c² - (14/13) u =480.

But b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = t² - 2 u.

So, equation 1 becomes:

t² - 2 u - (14/13) u =480 => t² - (2 +14/13) u =480.

Which is t² - (30/13) u =480.

Equation 2: 3t + 12 sqrt(30) = (sqrt(30)/13) u.

So,

(sqrt(30)/13) u = 3t +12 sqrt(30).

So,

u = (3t +12 sqrt(30)) * 13 / sqrt(30).

Simplify:

u = (39 t + 156 sqrt(30)) / sqrt(30).

Rationalizing the denominator,

u = (39 t)/sqrt(30) + 156 sqrt(30)/sqrt(30) = (39 t)/sqrt(30) + 156.

But 39/sqrt(30) = (39 sqrt(30))/30 = (13 sqrt(30))/10.

So,

u = (13 sqrt(30)/10) t + 156.

So, equation 1 is t² - (30/13) u =480.

Substitute u:

t² - (30/13)[ (13 sqrt(30)/10) t +156 ] =480.

Compute each term:

(30/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10) t = (30/10) sqrt(30) t =3 sqrt(30) t.

(30/13)*156 = (30*156)/13= 30*12=360.

So,

t² - 3 sqrt(30) t -360 =480.

Thus,

t² -3 sqrt(30) t -840 =0.

So, quadratic equation in t: t² -3 sqrt(30) t -840 =0.

We can solve for t using quadratic formula.

t = [3 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (3 sqrt(30))^2 +4*840 ) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant D:

(3 sqrt(30))^2 =9*30=270.

4*840=3360.

So, D=270+3360=3630.

sqrt(3630). Hmm, 3630=10*363=10*3*121=10*3*11². So, sqrt(3630)=11 sqrt(330).

Wait, 330=30*11, so sqrt(330)=sqrt(30*11). No, that's as far as we can go.

So, sqrt(3630)=11 sqrt(330).

Thus,

t = [3 sqrt(30) ±11 sqrt(330)] / 2.

But t is b + c, which must be positive. So, we take the positive root:

t = [3 sqrt(30) +11 sqrt(330)] / 2.

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe we can factor sqrt(30):

sqrt(330)=sqrt(30*11)=sqrt(30)*sqrt(11).

So,

t= [3 sqrt(30) +11 sqrt(30) sqrt(11)] /2 = sqrt(30)*[3 +11 sqrt(11)] /2.

So, t= [sqrt(30)(3 +11 sqrt(11))]/2.

But that seems messy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's recompute the discriminant.

Wait, D = (3 sqrt(30))² +4*840 = 270 +3360=3630.

3630 factors: 3630 ÷10=363. 363 ÷3=121. So, 3630=10*3*121=30*121=30*11².

So, sqrt(3630)=sqrt(30*11²)=11 sqrt(30).

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, 30*11²=30*121=3630.

So, sqrt(3630)=sqrt(30*11²)=11 sqrt(30).

Yes, that's correct. So, sqrt(3630)=11 sqrt(30).

So, back to the quadratic formula:

t = [3 sqrt(30) ±11 sqrt(30)] /2.

So, two solutions:

t= [3 sqrt(30) +11 sqrt(30)] /2 = (14 sqrt(30))/2 =7 sqrt(30).

Or,

t = [3 sqrt(30) -11 sqrt(30)] /2= (-8 sqrt(30))/2=-4 sqrt(30).

But t is b + c, which is positive, so t=7 sqrt(30).

So, b + c=7 sqrt(30).

Now, since we have t=7 sqrt(30), we can find u using equation 2.

From earlier, u=(13 sqrt(30)/10) t +156.

So,

u= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(7 sqrt(30)) +156.

Compute:

13*7=91.

sqrt(30)*sqrt(30)=30.

So, (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(7 sqrt(30))=91*30 /10=91*3=273.

Thus,

u=273 +156=429.

So, u=429. Since u= b c, we have bc=429.

So, AB·AC= c b=429.

So, the product is 429.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Using Euler's formula, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13} \). Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( AIO \) is right-angled at \( I \), giving \( AI = \sqrt{AO^2 - OI^2} = \sqrt{169 - 13} = 2\sqrt{39} \).

Using the formula for the inradius, \( r = \frac{A}{s} \), where \( A \) is the area and \( s \) is the semiperimeter, we find \( A = 6s \). The area can also be expressed as \( A = \frac{abc}{4R} \), leading to \( 6s = \frac{abc}{52} \). Additionally, using the relationship \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find \( \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \) and \( \cos(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \).

Using the double-angle formula, \( \sin A = 2\sin(A/2)\cos(A/2) = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \), and \( \cos A = \frac{7}{13} \). The side \( a \) opposite angle \( A \) is \( a = 2R\sin A = 4\sqrt{30} \).

We then use the relationships \( b + c = 7\sqrt{30} \) and \( bc = 429 \) derived from solving the system of equations involving the semiperimeter and product of sides. Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 429 \).

\boxed{429}
