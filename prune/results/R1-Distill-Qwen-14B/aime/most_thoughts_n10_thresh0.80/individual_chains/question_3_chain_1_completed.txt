Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and break it down.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), right? In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, that automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, so A is a subset of B. That makes sense. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because if A happens, B must happen.

So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). I'll calculate that.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, P(A) is the probability that Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the ones chosen. Since there's only one such combination (the one she picked), P(A) is 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, we can compute this by considering all the ways she can have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers, and then sum those probabilities.

But maybe it's easier to compute the probability of NOT winning a prize and subtract that from 1. Winning a prize means at least two matches, so not winning means zero or one match.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of Jen's numbers are selected. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). Calculating that: C(6,4) = 15.

So, the number of ways to have 0 matches is 15. Thus, P(0 matches) is 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(1 match): the number of ways where exactly one of Jen's numbers is selected, and the other three are from the remaining 6 numbers.

So, how many such combinations are there? It's C(4,1)*C(6,3). Because we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, the number of ways to have exactly 1 match is 80.

Thus, P(1 match) is 80 / 210, which simplifies to 8/21.

So, putting it all together:

P(B) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)] = 1 - [1/14 + 8/21].

Let me compute that. First, find a common denominator for 1/14 and 8/21. The least common denominator is 42.

1/14 is 3/42, and 8/21 is 16/42. So, 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me verify that calculation because 23/42 seems a bit off. Let me recalculate.

Wait, P(0) is 15/210 = 1/14 ≈ 0.0714, and P(1) is 80/210 ≈ 0.38095. Adding them together gives about 0.4523. So, 1 - 0.4523 ≈ 0.5476, which is roughly 23/42 because 23 divided by 42 is approximately 0.5476. So, that seems correct.

But wait, let me re-examine the number of ways for P(1). We said it's C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20=80. So, 80 favorable combinations. So, 80/210 reduces to 8/21, which is correct.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Wait, hold on, that contradicts earlier.

Wait, no, wait: 15 + 80 is 95, so 95/210 is the probability of not winning, so P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = 115/210.

Wait, but earlier computation was 1 - [1/14 + 8/21] = 1 - [3/42 + 16/42] = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

But 95/210 is equal to 19/42 (since 95 divides by 5 to get 19, and 210 divides by 5 to get 42). So, 115/210 reduces to 23/42 as well. So, I think the initial way was correct.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, so P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that would mean the probability is 1/115, so m=1 and n=115. Then, m + n = 116.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in computing P(B). Let me think again.

Alternatively, P(B) is the probability that at least two numbers match. So, the number of favorable cases is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two are among Jen's four numbers.

So, the number of such cases is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2)*C(6,2): Choosing 2 from Jen's 4 and 2 from the remaining 6. C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.

C(4,3)*C(6,1): Choosing 3 from Jen's 4 and 1 from the remaining 6. C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

C(4,4)*C(6,0): Choosing all 4 from Jen's 4 and 0 from the remaining. C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, number of favorable cases is 115, so P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42, which matches the earlier result.

So, P(A) is 1/210, which is the number of favorable cases for the grand prize.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) ) = 1/115.

So, m=1, n=115. Since 1 and 115 are coprime, m + n = 116.

Wait, but let me think again: does this make sense? If the probability is 1/115, that seems really low. Because if you have at least two matches, the chance that all four are matches is 1/115? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of events. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem, Jen picks 4 numbers. The lottery picks 4 numbers. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the lottery's. She wins the grand prize if all four match.

So, the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) is the probability that all four match given that at least two match.

So, another way to compute this is:

Number of favorable cases for grand prize (all four match) is 1.

Number of favorable cases for prize (at least two match) is 115, as above.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1 / 115.

So, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but wait a second: in the earlier calculation, when we computed P(B) as 23/42, and P(A) as 1/210, so 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115. So, same result.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the number of favorable cases, since P(A) is 1 and P(B) is 115, it's 1/115.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/115, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but let me think of another way: perhaps using hypergeometric distribution.

In hypergeometric terms, the probability of k successes (matches) in the drawn sample. So, the total population is 10, with 4 successes (Jen's numbers) and 6 non-successes.

We draw 4. So, the probability of exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k) / C(10,4).

So, for k=2,3,4, adding together gives the probability of at least two matches, which is P(B).

But I already did that earlier, and found P(B)=23/42.

So, maybe I'm confident that the conditional probability is 1/115, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Let me think again about the definition of P(B). Because in the problem, the lottery selects 4 numbers, and Jen's numbers are fixed. So, the probability space is choosing 4 numbers, and the probability of at least two overlapping with Jen's four.

So, the number of possible lottery tickets is C(10,4)=210.

The number of lottery tickets that have at least two matches with Jen's four numbers is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 90 + 24 +1=115.

So, the number is indeed 115, so P(B)=115/210=23/42.

Thus, the conditional probability is 1/210 divided by 115/210=1/115.

So, I think that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

The probability of winning the grand prize \( P(A) \) is the probability that all four chosen numbers match Jen's numbers. Since there is only one such combination, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

Next, we calculate the probability of winning a prize \( P(B) \). This is the probability of having at least two numbers matching. We use the complementary probability approach, subtracting the probabilities of having zero or one match from 1.

1. **Probability of 0 matches**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \). Thus, \( P(0 \text{ matches}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \).
2. **Probability of 1 match**: The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \). Thus, \( P(1 \text{ match}) = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \).

Summing these probabilities:
\[ P(0 \text{ matches}) + P(1 \text{ match}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42} \]

Thus, the probability of winning a prize:
\[ P(B) = 1 - \left( \frac{19}{42} \right) = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
