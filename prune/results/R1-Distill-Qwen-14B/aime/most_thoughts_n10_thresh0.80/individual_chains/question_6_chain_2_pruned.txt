Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions, each shifted and then taking the absolute value again. Let me sketch these functions mentally to get a sense of their shapes.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the vertex down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value of that, any negative parts will be flipped above the x-axis. So the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape that touches the x-axis at |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. Wait, no, that equation |x| = 1/2 gives x = ±1/2, so those are the points where f(x) is zero. So the graph of f(x) is a V that is W-shaped. Because when you take the absolute value of an absolute value function, you can create a W shape if the shifting causes the original V to cross the x-axis.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| is similar but with a smaller shift. The inner |x| is shifted down by 1/4, so the vertex is at (0, -1/4). Taking absolute value, the graph will touch the x-axis where |x| - 1/4 = 0, which is at x = ±1/4. So g(x) also has a W shape but with the vertices at x = ±1/4.

Now, moving on to the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These look like compositions of functions, so I need to figure out how they behave.

Let me analyze the first function: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function normally oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 2π, but here the argument is 2πx, which means the period is 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.

2. Next, apply f to this: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 will range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that gives a range from 0 to 1/2. So f(sin(2πx)) will be between 0 and 1/2.

3. Then apply g to the result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. Wait, but f(sin(2πx)) is already non-negative because it's an absolute value, so ||x| - 1/4| becomes |x - 1/4| for x >=0. Since f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, the expression inside g will be between -1/4 and 1/4? Wait, no, let's see: Let me denote h = f(sin(2πx)), so h is between 0 and 1/2. Then g(h) = |h - 1/4|. So when h is less than 1/4, this is 1/4 - h; when h is greater than or equal to 1/4, it's h - 1/4. So the output of g(h) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

4. Multiply by 4: 4 * g(h) will scale this up to 0 to 1. So y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will range between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the second function: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze this:

1. cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 2/3 because the argument is 3πy, so the period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3.

2. Apply f: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Again, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so f(cos(3πy)) is between 0 and 1/2, just like in the first function.

3. Apply g: g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy))| - 1/4|. As before, since f(cos(3πy)) is between 0 and 1/2, g of that is between 0 and 1/4.

4. Multiply by 4: 4 * g(...) gives x ranging between 0 and 1.

So both y and x in these equations range between 0 and 1. So we're looking for intersections where (x, y) satisfies both y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). 

Now, to find the number of intersections, we can think of this as solving for x and y where both equations hold. Since the functions are periodic, we can expect multiple intersections within each period. Let me try to find how many times these functions cross each other.

Let me consider the functions more carefully. Let's denote:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 * | | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Similarly, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4 * | | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

So both sides are functions that take their respective variables (x for y, y for x) and map them through a series of absolute value transformations and scaling.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to analyze the behavior in terms of their periodicity and possible intersections.

First, let me consider the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, the entire function y will have a period of 1 as well. Similarly, the function x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has cos(3πy) with a period of 2/3. So x is a function of y with period 2/3.

Wait, but in the second equation, x is expressed in terms of y, which makes it a bit more complicated. So perhaps I can try to parameterize one variable in terms of the other and look for solutions.

Alternatively, since both functions map variables into [0,1], maybe we can consider the unit square [0,1] x [0,1] and analyze the intersections there.

But considering the periodicity, perhaps the functions repeat their behavior every 1 unit in x and every 2/3 units in y. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Another approach: since both functions are even in their arguments, maybe we can consider only the first quadrant where x and y are positive, and then multiply by symmetry.

Wait, no, because the functions involve absolute values, which are symmetric, but the sine and cosine functions over x and y might introduce more symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the number of solutions by considering the number of times the functions cross each other in one period and then extrapolate.

But maybe an alternative approach is to recognize that both functions are within [0,1], so we can consider x and y in [0,1], and then find the number of solutions in that square.

But perhaps a better approach is to plot or imagine the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), and see how many times they intersect.

Wait, but since both functions are symmetric, perhaps we can limit our analysis to the first quadrant where x and y are between 0 and 1/2, and then multiply by the number of symmetric regions
