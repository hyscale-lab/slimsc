Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay, let's see. 

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, ω is a 13th root, so ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. Also, the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which probably means we're covering all the 13th roots of unity, including ω^0 = 1, even though the problem says ω ≠ 1. Wait, but since the product is from k=0 to 12, that includes ω^0 = 1, right? So one of the terms in the product is when k=0. Let me check that term first.

When k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2(1) + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product, so maybe I can ignore it and just focus on k=1 to 12? Or perhaps not, because the problem says ω ≠ 1, but the product includes k=0. Hmm, maybe I should just proceed with the product as given.

So, the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote this product as P. So P = product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I wonder if there's a way to simplify each term in the product. Let's look at the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or write it in terms of ω^k.

Let me set z = ω^k. Then for each term, it becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, the term is z² - 2z + 2. So each term is a quadratic in z, where z is a 13th root of unity. So for each k, z = ω^k, and z^13 = 1.

Wait, so if I can find the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for all 13th roots of unity z (since z runs through all ω^k as k goes from 0 to 12), except when z=1? Or including z=1? Wait, when k=0, z=1, so yes, z includes all 13th roots of unity.

Wait, but ω is a primitive 13th root, so ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0.

So the product
