Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP.

Hmm, I think it might help to draw a diagram, but since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to visualize it. Let me recall some geometry theorems that might be useful here.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Also, the line from D to the center of the circle should bisect the angle between the two tangents. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Wait, maybe power of a point could help here. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to the square of the tangent lengths from D to ω. So, since DB and DC are tangents, DB = DC. Therefore, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. That might be useful.

Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, maybe we can apply the power of point A with respect to circle ω. But wait, A is on the circle, so its power is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using intersecting chords theorem? Since AP is a chord passing through A and P, and AD is a secant line passing through D. But D is outside the circle, so maybe power of D with respect to ω would help.

Power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Yes, that seems useful.

So, if I can find DB, then I can express DP in terms of DA, and then relate it to AP.

But how do I find DB? Let's think. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. Also, the circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

Let me see if I can find the lengths of DB and DC. To do that, maybe I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC, and then find the distances DB and DC.

To find the circumradius R of triangle ABC, I can use the formula:

R = (a*b*c) / (4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and Δ is the area.

Given sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So, sides are 5,9,10.

Let me compute the semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

So, Δ = sqrt[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31.5 is 504? Wait, 16 * 31 is 496, so 16*31.5 is 504. But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 63/2) = 4 * sqrt(63/2) = 4 * sqrt(31.5). Hmm, that's not very helpful. Let me factor 504 differently.

504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 8 * 9 = 7 * 8 * 9. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(7 * 8 * 9) = sqrt(7) * sqrt(8) * sqrt(9) = 3 * 2√2 * √7 = 6√14. Wait, is that right? Let me compute 7*8*9: 7*72=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(7*72) = sqrt(7)*sqrt(72) = sqrt(7)*6√2 = 6√14. Yes, that works.

So, Δ = 6√14.

Therefore, the circumradius R = (5 * 9 * 10) / (4 * 6√14) = (450) / (24√14) = (75) / (4√14). Let me rationalize that denominator: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = 75√14 / 56.

Hmm, okay. Now, how to find DB?

Since DB is the tangent from D to ω at B, and DC is the tangent at C. So, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC.

Also, the distance from D to the center of ω should be equal to sqrt(R² + DB²), but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the sine formula in triangle DBC.

Wait, if I can find the angle at D, which is angle BDC, then I can relate it to the angles in triangle ABC. Since angle BDC is equal to 180° minus angle BAC, because angles formed by tangents and the chord are equal to the angles in the alternate segment.

Wait, actually, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between tangent DB and chord BC is equal to angle BAC.

Wait, let me think again. The angle between tangent at B and chord BC is equal to angle BAC. Similarly, angle between tangent at C and chord CB is also equal to angle BAC.
