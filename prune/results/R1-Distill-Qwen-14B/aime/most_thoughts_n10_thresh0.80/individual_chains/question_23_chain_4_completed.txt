Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that points A, B, C, and D are on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis length is 2a, where a²=20, so a is sqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis length is 2b, where b²=24, so b is sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6).

Now, the figure ABCD is a rhombus, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other and intersect at the origin. That means the diagonals pass through the origin, and each diagonal's midpoint is the origin.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and each diagonal bisects the other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A and C must be endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D must be endpoints of the other diagonal.

Wait, no, actually, since the rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, the diagonals aren't necessarily aligned with the axes, but their intersection is at the origin. So, maybe the diagonals are not aligned with the coordinate axes but are just two lines intersecting at the origin, each diagonal being a line through the origin.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Therefore, if A is some point on the hyperbola, then C must be the point such that the midpoint of AC is the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q).

So, the rhombus has vertices at A, B, C, D where C is the reflection of A through the origin, and D is the reflection of B through the origin.

Now, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on.

So, let's write down that |AB| = |BC| = |CD| = |DA|.

But perhaps it's easier to use vectors or coordinate geometry here.

Let me think. Let me denote the coordinates:

Let’s suppose points A and C are (x, y) and (-x, -y), respectively.

Similarly, points B and D are (p, q) and (-p, -q), respectively.

Since the rhombus is determined by these four points, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

Since it's a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.

Wait, maybe using vectors could help here. Let me think.

Alternatively, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD must be perpendicular.

So, vector AC is from A to C: (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). But since it's a diagonal, the direction is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q).

Wait, but these vectors are the diagonals, right? So, if the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.

So, vector AC • vector BD = 0.

But wait, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). So, their dot product is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq. Since they are perpendicular, this must equal zero.

So, 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.

So, that's one condition.

Another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1,

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

So, both (x, y) and (p, q) lie on the hyperbola.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must have equal lengths. So, |AB| = |BC|.

Let's compute |AB| and |BC|.

Point A is (x, y), point B is (p, q).

So, vector AB is (p - x, q - y).

So, |AB|² = (p - x)² + (q - y)².

Similarly, point B is (p, q), point C is (-x, -y).

So, vector BC is (-x - p, -y - q).

So, |BC|² = (-x - p)² + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2.

Since |AB| = |BC|, their squares are equal:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²).

Right side: (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²).

Set equal:

p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y² = x² + 2px + p² + y² + 2qy + q².

Subtract x², p², q², y² from both sides:

-2px - 2qy = 2px + 2qy.

Bring all terms to one side:

-2px - 2qy - 2px - 2qy = 0

-4px - 4qy = 0.

Divide both sides by -4:

px + qy = 0.

Wait, but earlier we had xp + yq = 0. So, this is the same as px + qy = 0. So, that condition is already satisfied.

So, that equation is redundant because we already have that condition from the diagonals being perpendicular. So, perhaps another condition is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sides being equal gives the same condition as the diagonals being perpendicular.

So, perhaps I need another condition.

Let me think again about the rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not only perpendicular but also bisect each other. So, since we already have the origin as the intersection point, that's satisfied.

Another property is that the diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. So, perhaps the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent.

Wait, but perhaps instead of focusing on the sides, I should consider the slopes or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

I know that hyperbolas can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization is (a cosh θ, b sinh θ), but that's for the right hyperbola. Alternatively, for points on both branches, maybe (a sec t, b tan t), but I think that's for hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, yes.

Wait, let me confirm. The standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a sec θ, y = b tan θ, which covers the right branch, and x = -a sec θ, y = -b tan θ for the left branch.

But in this problem, since the rhombus has points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals cross at the origin, points A and C are on opposite branches, as are points B and D.

So, perhaps points A and C can be represented as (a sec θ, b tan θ) and (-a sec θ, -b tan θ), respectively, and points B and D as (a sec φ, b tan φ) and (-a sec φ, -b tan φ), respectively.

Wait, but then the diagonals would be AC and BD, but in this case, the diagonals would be between opposite points on the hyperbola.

Wait, but perhaps that's not necessary, because the hyperbola is symmetric, so maybe points A and C can be on the same branch? Wait, but if the diagonals intersect at the origin, they have to be on opposite branches.

Wait, let me think. The hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 has two branches, left and right. If the rhombus's diagonals cross at the origin, then points A and C must be on opposite branches, because if they were on the same branch, the midpoint would not be the origin. So, that makes sense.

So, point A is (a sec θ, b tan θ), then point C is (-a sec θ, -b tan θ). Similarly, point B is (a sec φ, b tan φ), and point D is (-a sec φ, -b tan φ).

Wait, but perhaps that's a valid approach. Let me denote a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20), and b²=24, so b = sqrt(24).

So, a = 2*sqrt(5), b = 2*sqrt(6).

So, points A: (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ),

Point C: (-2√5 sec θ, -2√6 tan θ),

Point B: (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ),

Point D: (-2√5 sec φ, -2√6 tan φ).

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Diagonal AC is from A to C, which is along the line joining (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ) to (-2√5 sec θ, -2√6 tan θ). So, the midpoint is indeed the origin, as required.

Similarly, diagonal BD is from B to D, joining (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ) to (-2√5 sec φ, -2√6 tan φ), with midpoint at origin.

Now, since the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, which are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals.

So, let's compute the slopes.

First, the slope of AC: since it goes from A(2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ) to C(-2√5 sec θ, -2√6 tan θ). The slope is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = [(-2√6 tan θ) - (2√6 tan θ)] / [(-2√5 sec θ) - (2√5 sec θ)] = (-4√6 tan θ)/(-4√5 sec θ) = (√6 tan θ)/(√5 sec θ).

Simplify tan θ / sec θ: tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, sec θ = 1 / cos θ, so tan θ / sec θ = (sin θ / cos θ) / (1 / cos θ) ) = sin θ.

So, the slope of AC is (√6 / √5) sin θ = (√6 / √5) sin θ.

Similarly, the slope of BD is (√6 / √5) sin φ.

Wait, let me check that again.

Point B: (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ),

Point D: (-2√5 sec φ, -2√6 tan φ).

Slope of BD: [(-2√6 tan φ) - (2√6 tan φ)] / [(-2√5 sec φ) - (2√5 sec φ)] = (-4√6 tan φ)/(-4√5 sec φ) = (√6 tan φ)/(√5 sec φ).

Again, tan φ / sec φ = sin φ.

So, slope of BD is (√6 / √5) sin φ.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1.

So, [ (√6 / √5) sin θ ] * [ (√6 / √5) sin φ ] = -1.

Simplify:

(6/5) sin θ sin φ = -1.

So,

sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

Hmm, that's an equation relating θ and φ.

Now, let me think about the lengths of the diagonals AC and BD.

Wait, the problem asks for BD². So, let's compute BD².

Diagonal BD is from B to D, so let's compute the distance between B and D.

Point B is (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ),

Point D is (-2√5 sec φ, -2√6 tan φ).

So, the distance BD is sqrt[ ( (-2√5 sec φ - 2√5 sec φ )^2 + ( -2√6 tan φ - 2√6 tan φ )^2 ) ]

Which is sqrt[ ( (-4√5 sec φ )^2 + (-4√6 tan φ )^2 ) ]

Simplify:

sqrt[ 16*5 sec² φ + 16*6 tan² φ ]

= sqrt[ 80 sec² φ + 96 tan² φ ]

We can factor 16 out:

= sqrt[ 16*(5 sec² φ + 6 tan² φ) ]

= 4 * sqrt(5 sec² φ + 6 tan² φ )

So, BD² is [4 * sqrt(5 sec² φ + 6 tan² φ )]^2 = 16*(5 sec² φ + 6 tan² φ )

Similarly, AC² would be 16*(5 sec² θ + 6 tan² θ )

But since we're only asked about BD², let's focus on that.

So, BD² = 16*(5 sec² φ + 6 tan² φ )

We can express sec² φ in terms of tan² φ, since sec² φ = 1 + tan² φ.

So, substituting:

BD² = 16*(5*(1 + tan² φ) + 6 tan² φ )

= 16*(5 + 5 tan² φ + 6 tan² φ )

= 16*(5 + 11 tan² φ )

= 16*5 + 16*11 tan² φ

= 80 + 176 tan² φ

So, BD² = 80 + 176 tan² φ.

We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD², but perhaps the minimum value, and then the supremum would be infinity, but the question is about the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, perhaps the minimal possible BD² is the lower bound, but I need to think carefully.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the infimum of BD² as the rhombi vary, meaning the minimal possible BD². So, what's the minimal possible BD²?

Wait, but hyperbola points are such that their y-coordinates can be any real number except between certain limits, but wait, no, for a hyperbola, y can be any real number, right?

But perhaps the minimal BD² occurs when tan φ is minimized in some way.

Wait, but let's think about the condition we have: from the diagonals being perpendicular, we had sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

So, sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ ), but this must satisfy |sin θ| ≤ 1 and |sin φ| ≤ 1.

So, | (-5)/(6 sin φ ) | ≤ 1,

Which implies |5/(6 sin φ)| ≤ 1,

So, |5| ≤ |6 sin φ|,

Which implies |6 sin φ| ≥ 5,

So, |sin φ| ≥ 5/6.

Because 5/6 is less than 1, this is possible.

So, |sin φ| ≥ 5/6.

Which implies that φ must lie in regions where sin φ is greater than or equal to 5/6 or less than or equal to -5/6.

Similarly, sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ), so sin θ will be negative if sin φ is positive, and positive if sin φ is negative.

But how does this affect BD²?

We had BD² = 80 + 176 tan² φ.

So, tan² φ = (sin² φ)/(cos² φ) = (1 - cos² φ)/cos² φ.

Alternatively, we can express tan² φ in terms of sin φ.

But perhaps we can express BD² in terms of sin φ.

Since |sin φ| ≥ 5/6.

Let me denote t = sin φ, so |t| ≥ 5/6.

We can express cos² φ = 1 - t².

So, tan² φ = t² / (1 - t²).

So, BD² = 80 + 176*( t² / (1 - t²) )

= 80 + (176 t²)/(1 - t²).

We can write this as:

BD² = 80 + 176 t² / (1 - t²)

= 80 + [176 t²]/(1 - t²)

Let me combine the terms:

= [80(1 - t²) + 176 t² ] / (1 - t²)

= [80 - 80 t² + 176 t² ] / (1 - t²)

= [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

Now, since |t| ≥ 5/6, let's consider t ≥ 5/6 and t ≤ -5/6. But since t² is the same for both, we can consider t ≥ 5/6, as the expression is symmetric in t.

So, let's let t = 5/6 + s, where s ≥ 0, but perhaps it's easier to consider t ≥ 5/6 and t ≤ -5/6, but since t² is same for t and -t, let's just consider t ≥ 5/6.

So, now, BD² as a function of t is:

BD²(t) = [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² ), where t ≥ 5/6.

Wait, but 1 - t² is negative because t ≥ 5/6, so 1 - (25/36) = 11/36, which is positive. Wait, no: 5/6 is approximately 0.833, so t² when t=5/6 is 25/36 ≈ 0.694. So, 1 - t² is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36, which is positive. Wait, but when t approaches 1, 1 - t² approaches 0 from positive side, but for t > 1, it becomes negative. But since t is sin φ, |t| ≤ 1, so t can't exceed 1. So, 1 - t² is positive when |t| < 1, zero at |t|=1, and negative beyond. But since |t| ≥ 5/6, and |t| ≤ 1, we have 1 - t² in [0, 1 - (25/36)] = [0, 11/36].

So, 1 - t² is positive, so BD² is positive.

Wait, but let me compute BD²(t) = [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

We can write this as BD²(t) = [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

I think we can simplify this expression.

Let me try to write it as:

BD²(t) = [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

= [80(1) + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

Hmm, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, write it as:

= [80(1 - t²) + 80 t² + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

= [80(1 - t²) + 176 t² ] / (1 - t² )

= 80 + (176 t²)/(1 - t² )

Wait, that's where we came from earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

BD²(t) = [80 + 96 t² ] / (1 - t² )

Let me set u = t². Since t ≥ 5/6, u ≥ (5/6)^2 = 25/36 ≈ 0.694.

So, the expression becomes BD²(u) = [80 + 96 u ] / (1 - u )

We can write this as BD²(u) = (96 u + 80 ) / (1 - u )

We can write this as:

BD²(u) = (96 u + 80 ) / (1 - u )

= [96(u) + 80 ] / (1 - u )

We can think of this as a function of u, where u ∈ [25/36, 1).

We can find the minimum of this function in this interval.

To find the minimum of BD²(u), we can take the derivative with respect to u and set it to zero.

But since u is between 25/36 and 1, let's compute the derivative.

Let me compute d(BD²)/du:

d/du [ (96u + 80)/(1 - u) ] = [96(1 - u) - (-1)(96u + 80) ] / (1 - u)^2

Simplify numerator:

96(1 - u) + (96u + 80) = 96 - 96u + 96u + 80 = 96 + 80 = 176.

So, derivative is 176 / (1 - u)^2.

Since (1 - u)^2 is always positive, and 176 is positive, the derivative is positive for all u in (25/36, 1).

So, the function BD²(u) is strictly increasing on [25/36, 1).

Therefore, the minimal value occurs at u = 25/36.

Thus, the minimum BD² is BD²(25/36).

So, compute BD² when u = 25/36:

BD² = (96*(25/36) + 80 ) / (1 - 25/36 )

Compute numerator:

96*(25/36) = (96/36)*25 = (8/3)*25 = 200/3 ≈ 66.6667.

80 is 240/3.

So, numerator = 200/3 + 240/3 = 440/3.

Denominator: 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.

So, BD² = (440/3) / (11/36) = (440/3) * (36/11) = (440 * 36) / (3 * 11) = (440 * 12) / 11.

Simplify 440 /11 = 40.

So, 40 * 12 = 480.

So, BD² = 480.

Wait, but let me check that computation again.

Wait, 96*(25/36) = (96/36)*25 = (8/3)*25 = 200/3.

Then 80 is 240/3.

So, 200/3 + 240/3 = 440/3.

Denominator: 1 - 25/36 = (36 -25)/36 = 11/36.

So, 440/3 divided by 11/36 is (440/3) * (36/11).

Let's compute:

440 ÷ 11 = 40,

36 ÷ 3 = 12,

So, 40 * 12 = 480.

Yes, so BD² = 480.

Wait, that's the minimal BD².

Wait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the minimal possible BD² is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, since for any rhombus, BD² is at least 480.

Wait, but wait, the function BD²(u) is increasing, so as u increases from 25/36 towards 1, BD² increases from 480 to infinity.

Wait, but when u approaches 1, 1 - u approaches 0, so BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, and that occurs when u = 25/36, which is when t = 5/6.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any rhombus, BD² is at least 480, so 480 is the infimum, and thus the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but I should verify this. Let me check if BD² can indeed be 480.

So, when t = 5/6, then sin φ = 5/6.

Then, from earlier, sin θ sin φ = -5/6,

So, sin θ = (-5/6) / (5/6) = -1.

So, sin θ = -1, which implies θ = -π/2 or 3π/2.

So, let me compute point A:

x = 2√5 sec θ,

y = 2√6 tan θ.

When θ = 3π/2, sec θ is undefined because cos θ = 0. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, the parametrization I used was (a sec θ, b tan θ). But when θ = π/2, sec θ is undefined. So, perhaps this parametrization doesn't include θ = π/2.

Wait, maybe I should consider a different parametrization, perhaps using hyperbolic functions.

Alternatively, perhaps using the point (a cosh t, b sinh t), which covers the right branch, and (-a cosh t, -b sinh t) for the left branch.

Wait, let me try that.

So, hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 can be parametrized as x = 2√5 cosh t, y = 2√6 sinh t.

Similarly, the left branch is x = -2√5 cosh t, y = -2√6 sinh t.

So, point A: (2√5 cosh t, 2√6 sinh t),

Point C: (-2√5 cosh t, -2√6 sinh t),

Point B: (2√5 cosh s, 2√6 sinh s),

Point D: (-2√5 cosh s, -2√6 sinh s).

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Diagonal AC goes from A to C, which is from (2√5 cosh t, 2√6 sinh t) to (-2√5 cosh t, -2√6 sinh t).

The midpoint is at (0,0), as required.

Similarly for BD.

Now, the condition is that diagonals are perpendicular, which gives the dot product of AC and BD being zero.

Wait, but in the hyperbolic parametrization, the coordinates are expressed in terms of cosh and sinh, which are functions of t and s.

Wait, perhaps this approach might complicate things, but let me try.

Vector AC is C - A = (-4√5 cosh t, -4√6 sinh t).

Vector BD is D - B = (-4√5 cosh s, -4√6 sinh s).

The dot product is (-4√5 cosh t)(-4√5 cosh s) + (-4√6 sinh t)(-4√6 sinh s).

= 16*5 cosh t cosh s + 16*6 sinh t sinh s.

= 80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:

80 cosh t cosh s + 96 sinh t sinh s = 0.

We can factor 16:

16*(5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s) = 0.

So, 5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit more involved.

But perhaps we can express this as:

5 cosh t cosh s = -6 sinh t sinh s.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

5 (cosh t cosh s + (6/5) sinh t sinh s) = 0.

Wait, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of exponents.

We know that cosh x = (e^x + e^{-x})/2,

and sinh x = (e^x - e^{-x})/2.

So, let me compute each term.

5 cosh t cosh s = 5 * [ (e^t + e^{-t})/2 ] * [ (e^s + e^{-s})/2 ]

= 5/4 [ e^{t+s} + e^{t-s} + e^{-t+s} + e^{-t -s} ]

Similarly, 6 sinh t sinh s = 6 * [ (e^t - e^{-t})/2 ] * [ (e^s - e^{-s})/2 ]

= 6/4 [ e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + e^{-t - s} ]

So, summing these:

5 cosh t cosh s + 6 sinh t sinh s =

5/4 [ e^{t+s} + e^{t-s} + e^{-t+s} + e^{-t -s} ] + 6/4 [ e^{t+s} - e^{t - s} - e^{-t + s} + e^{-t -s} ]

= (5/4 + 6/4) e^{t+s} + (5/4 -6/4)e^{t-s} + (5/4 -6/4)e^{-t +s} + (5/4 +6/4)e^{-t -s}

= (11/4) e^{t+s} + (-1/4) e^{t-s} + (-1/4) e^{-t+s} + (11/4) e^{-t -s}.

Set equal to zero:

(11/4) e^{t+s} - (1/4) e^{t-s} - (1/4) e^{-t+s} + (11/4) e^{-t -s} = 0.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

11 e^{t+s} - e^{t-s} - e^{-t+s} + 11 e^{-t -s} = 0.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps there is a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the earlier approach where BD² = 80 + 176 tan² φ, and when |sin φ|=5/6, tan² φ is maximized or minimized?

Wait, when sin φ = 5/6, then cos φ = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) = sqrt(11/36) = sqrt(11)/6.

So, tan φ = (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6) )= 5/sqrt(11).

So, tan² φ = 25/11.

So, BD² = 80 + 176*(25/11) = 80 + (176 * 25)/11.

Compute 176 / 11 = 16, so 16*25 = 400.

So, BD² = 80 + 400 = 480.

So, yes, that checks out.

Thus, the minimal BD² is 480, so for all such rhombi, BD² is at least 480, and can be larger, up to infinity.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the infimum, which is 480, because 480 is the minimal value of BD², and for every rhombus, BD² is at least 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 480.

But wait, let me think again. If BD² can be 480, then 480 is attainable, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be less than 480? No, wait, the problem is phrased a bit differently. It says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Hmm, perhaps it's the infimum, because 480 is the minimal possible BD², so any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi, but 480 itself is equal to BD² for some rhombus, so it's not less than BD² for all. Wait, but then the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi," so the number must be less than every BD². But if the minimal BD² is 480, then any number less than 480 would satisfy being less than BD² for all rhombi, since BD² can be 480. But the greatest such number would be 480, because any number larger than 480 would not be less than BD² for that particular rhombus where BD²=480.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if a number is less than BD² for all rhombi, then it must be less than every possible BD². The minimal BD² is 480, so if you pick a number less than 480, say 400, then 400 is less than all BD², including 480. But the problem asks for the greatest such number. So, the greatest number that is less than every BD² is the infimum of BD², which is 480, because 480 is the smallest BD². Therefore, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, since you can't have a number greater than 480 that is less than every BD², because BD² can be exactly 480.

Wait, but 480 is the minimal value, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because any number greater than 480 would not be less than BD² for the rhombus with BD²=480. So, the answer is 480.

But just to make sure, let me think: if the minimal BD² is 480, then for any rhombus, BD² ≥ 480. So, the set of BD² values is [480, ∞). So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because 480 is the infimum, and any number greater than 480 would not satisfy "less than BD² for all rhombi" because for the rhombus with BD²=480, the number would not be less than 480.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the largest number that is still less than every BD². But since BD² can be as low as 480, the number must be less than 480. Because if the number is 480, it's equal to BD² in that case, so it's not less than BD². Therefore, the greatest such number is the supremum of all numbers less than 480, which would approach 480, but never reach it. But since 480 is attainable, perhaps the answer is 480, but in reality, the number must be strictly less than 480. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the infimum. Since the infimum is 480, and it's attainable, then the greatest number less than or equal to all BD² is 480. But the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi," so it's looking for a lower bound, but not including 480 itself. So, the answer would be 480, but since 480 is the minimal, perhaps the answer is 480.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the supremum of the set of all real numbers less than every BD². Since the infimum of BD² is 480, then the set of all numbers less than every BD² is (-∞, 480). So, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is included in BD², the greatest number less than all BD² is approaching 480 from below, but technically, 480 is not less than BD² for all rhombi because for the minimal rhombus, BD²=480, so 480 is not less than 480. So, perhaps the answer is 480, but as the limit, the answer is 480.

But perhaps the problem expects 480 as the answer, given that it's the minimal BD².

Wait, perhaps I should check once more with the parametrization.

Earlier, I found that when sin φ = 5/6, BD² = 480, which is the minimum. So, for that particular rhombus, BD² is exactly 480. So, any number less than 480 would be less than BD² for all rhombi, because BD² can't be less than 480. Thus, the greatest such number is 480, but since 480 is attainable, it's not less than BD² for that rhombus. Therefore, the correct answer would be 480, but since the problem asks for a number less than BD² for all rhombi, perhaps the answer is 480 because it's the infimum. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is 480.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the greatest lower bound, which is 480, so the answer is 480.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation of BD².

Wait, let me recompute BD² using the hyperbolic parametrization.

Wait, earlier, I used the trigonometric parametrization, but perhaps the hyperbolic parametrization would be better.

Wait, when I used the parametrization with hyperbolic functions, I ended up with a condition involving cosh and sinh, which became complicated, so perhaps I should stick with the trigonometric parametrization.

In any case, I think the minimal BD² is 480, so the answer is 480.


The problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all rhombi \( ABCD \) inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \( a^2 = 20 \) and \( b^2 = 24 \).
   - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the hyperbola, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

2. **Parametrization of Points**:
   - Points \( A \) and \( C \) are parametrized as \( (2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta) \) and \( (-2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, -2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta) \), respectively.
   - Points \( B \) and \( D \) are similarly parametrized with a different parameter \( \phi \).

3. **Perpendicular Diagonals**:
   - The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \( \sin \theta \sin \phi = -\frac{5}{6} \).

4. **Expression for \( BD^2 \)**:
   - Using trigonometric identities and the given hyperbola equation, \( BD^2 \) is expressed as \( 80 + 176 \tan^2 \phi \).

5. **Minimizing \( BD^2 \)**:
   - The minimal value of \( BD^2 \) occurs when \( \sin \phi = \frac{5}{6} \), leading to \( \tan^2 \phi = \frac{25}{11} \).
   - Substituting this into the expression for \( BD^2 \) gives \( BD^2 = 480 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The minimal \( BD^2 \) is 480, making it the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is:

\[
\boxed{480}
