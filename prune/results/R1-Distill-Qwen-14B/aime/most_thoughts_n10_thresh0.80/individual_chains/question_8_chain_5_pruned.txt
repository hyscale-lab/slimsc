Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let's understand the problem. I'm looking for all possible nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) such that their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals 6,000,000.

Let me write down the two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, equation 2 looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it somehow or express it in terms of other expressions.

Wait, equation 2, let's see: each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another variable. Let's see if we can factor this expression. Maybe I can group terms differently.

Looking closer, equation 2 can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems better because each term is now a square multiplied by the sum of the other two variables.

So, equation 2 becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c =300, we can substitute (b + c) as (300 - a), similarly for the others.

So:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that might be a useful substitution. Let me compute each term:

Each term is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is a, b, or c.

So, I can write this as sum_{x=a,b,c} x²(300 - x) = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, that's 300x² - x³ summed over x=a, b, c. So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, equation 2 becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can relate this to other symmetric expressions. Let me recall that for symmetric expressions, we can use the identities involving sums, products, etc.

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.

S2 = ab + bc + ca.

S3 = abc.

I remember that a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2.

Similarly, a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3.

So, substituting these into equation 2:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Which becomes:

300(S1² - 2S2) - (S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.

Let me plug in S1 = 300.

So, 300(300² - 2S2) - (300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300(300² - 2S2):

300^2 = 90,000.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.

Next, compute 300³: 300*300*300 = 27,000,000.

3*300*S2 = 900 S2.

So, the second part is -(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3) = -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3.

Putting it all together:

(27,000,000 - 600 S2) + (-27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3) = 6,000,000.

Let me combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2.

The remaining term is -3 S3.

So, entire equation becomes:

300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Let me simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, equation (A): 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Now, I need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Since we know that S1 = a + b + c = 300, and S2 and S3 are the next symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps we can express S2 in terms of a, b, c and then relate it to something else. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of a substitution.

Wait, let's think about the variables. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding triples (a, b, c) with these symmetric conditions.

Another approach: since the equation 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000, maybe express S3 as 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm, but S3 is the product abc. So
