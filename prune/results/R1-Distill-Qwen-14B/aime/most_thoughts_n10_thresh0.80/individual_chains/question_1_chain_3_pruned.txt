Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 1/3
Convert 1/3 to 4/12: 

2b = -5/12 -4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4

So, b = (-3/4)/2 = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12)

To add these, find a common denominator, which is 24.

-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Now, let's write E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Substitute the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, add them together:

E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine the terms with denominator 6 first:

(-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2

So, E = -2 + (-9/8) = - (2 + 9/8) = -(16/8 + 9/8) = -25/8

Wait, but the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime because 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.

Therefore, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me recalculate E step by step.

Compute 4a: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 ≈ -1.1667

3b: 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 ≈ -1.125

2c: 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 ≈ -0.8333

Adding them: -1.1667 -1.125 -0.8333 ≈ -3.125

But -25/8 is indeed -3.125, so the absolute value is 25/8, which is correct.

Wait, but another way to compute E is to express it as log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Maybe I can compute this logarithm directly using the expressions for x, y, z from equations (1a, 2a, 3a).

Alternatively, let's see if I can find x, y, z in terms of each other.

Wait, perhaps I can express x, y, z in terms of each other and find their ratio.

Looking back:

From equation (1a): x = y z sqrt(2)

From equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Let me substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a):

y = (y z sqrt(2)) * z * 2^(1/3)
Simplify: y = y z^2 sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3)
So, divide both sides by y (since y ≠ 0):
1 = z^2 sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * (1/y) * y?

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of one variable.

Wait, from equation (1a): x = y z sqrt(2)

From equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Substitute x from (1a) into (2a):

y = (y z sqrt(2)) * z * 2^(1/3)
Simplify:
y = y z^2 sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3)
Divide both sides by y (since y ≠ 0):

1 = z^
