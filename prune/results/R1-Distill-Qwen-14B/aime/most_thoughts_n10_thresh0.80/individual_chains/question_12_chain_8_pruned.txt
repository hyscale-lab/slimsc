Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. Each cell will have a single digit, and when I read the numbers left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Also, when I read the numbers top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Let me denote the grid like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 
a & b & c \\ \hline 
d & e & f \\ \hline 
\end{array}
\]

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

Now, the problem says that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. That means the top row forms a three-digit number, let's call it ABC, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number, DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999. Wait, but the example given uses two numbers: 8 + 991 = 999. Oh, wait a second. Wait, that can't be right because 8 is a single-digit number. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, looking at the example, the grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, reading left to right from the top row gives 008, which is 8, and the bottom row gives 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, which makes sense. Oh, so each row is treated as a three-digit number, but leading zeros are allowed. So, the top row is a three-digit number, possibly with leading zeros, and the same for the bottom row. So, the sum of the top row and the bottom row is 999.

Wait, but in the example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom is 991, which is 991. 8 + 991 = 999. Got it. So, the sum of the top three-digit number and the bottom three-digit number is 999. So, that gives me an equation: (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

But wait, in the example, a=0, b=0, c=8, d=9, e=9, f=1. So, 008 + 991 = 999, correct. So, that's the first condition.

The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. So, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number, right? Because each column has two digits: the top and the bottom. So, in the first column, it's a and d, forming
