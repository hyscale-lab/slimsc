Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that two logarithmic expressions are equal to 10. The expressions are log base x of y^x and log base y of x^(4y). And the goal is to find the product xy. Hmm, let me start by writing down the given equations.

First, the problem says log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So applying that here, if log_x(y^x) = 10, then x^10 = y^x. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. Yeah, because x raised to the power of 10 equals y raised to the power of x. So equation one is x^10 = y^x.

Then the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, that means y^10 = x^{4y}. So equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x
2) y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find x and y such that both equations are satisfied, and then find xy.

Hmm, maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides of both equations to make them easier to handle. Let me try that.

Taking natural logs on both sides of equation 1:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for equation 2:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which gives 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So now I have two equations:

1) 10 ln x = x ln y
2) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can solve this system of equations. Let me see. Let's denote a = ln x and b = ln y. Then the equations become:

1) 10a = x b
2) 10b = 4y a

But x and y are related to a and b through a = ln x and b = ln y. So x = e^a and y = e^b.

Let me substitute x and y in terms of a and b into the equations.

So equation 1 becomes:

10a = e^a * b

Equation 2 becomes:

10b = 4 e^b * a

So now I have:

1) 10a = b e^a
2) 10b = 4 a e^b

Hmm, now I can try to express one variable in terms of the other. From equation 1, I can write b = (10a) / e^a.

Then substitute this into equation 2:

10 * (10a / e^a) = 4 a e^{b}

Simplify left side: 100a / e^a = 4 a e^{b}

Divide both sides by a (since a is ln x, and x >1, so a ≠0):

100 / e^a = 4 e^{b}

But from equation 1, b = (10a)/e^a. So substitute that into the exponent on the right side:

100 / e^a = 4 e^{(10a)/e^a}

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me write it again.

100 / e^a = 4 e^{(10a)/e^a}

Let me simplify this equation. Let's divide both sides by 4:

25 / e^a = e^{(10a)/e^a}

Let me take natural logs of both sides to make this manageable.

ln(25 / e^a) = (10a)/e^a

Simplify left side:

ln(25) - ln(e^a) = (10a)/e^a

Which is:

ln(25) - a = (10a)/e^a

So,

ln(25) - a = (10a) e^{-a}

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might be tricky to solve algebraically. Maybe I can guess a value for a that satisfies this equation.

Let me denote c = a, so the equation becomes:

ln(25) - c = 10c e^{-c}

Let me rearrange this:

ln(25) = c + 10c e^{-c} = c(1 + 10 e^{-c})

Hmm, perhaps I can try some values for c and see if it works.

Let me try c=2.

Left side: ln(25) ≈ 3.2189.

Right side: 2*(1 + 10 e^{-2}) = 2*(1 + 10*(0.1353)) ≈ 2*(1 + 1.353) ≈ 2*(2.353) ≈ 4.706. That's more than 3.2189.

What about c=3?

Right side: 3*(1 + 10 e^{-3}) ≈ 3*(1 + 10*(0.0498)) ≈ 3*(1 + 0.498) ≈ 3*(1.498) ≈ 4.494. Still more than 3.2189.

Wait, maybe the right side decreases as c increases. Let me try c=1.

Right side: 1*(1 + 10 e^{-1}) ≈ 1*(1 + 10*(0.3679)) ≈ 1*(1 + 3.679) ≈ 4.679. Hmm, which is larger than ln25.

Wait, maybe I need a smaller c. Let me try c=0.5.

Right side: 0.5*(1 +10 e^{-0.5}) ≈ 0.5*(1 +10*(0.6065)) ≈ 0.5*(1 +6.065) ≈ 0.5*(7.065) ≈3.5325. Still higher than 3.2189.

Hmm, so when c=0.5, right side is ~3.5325; when c=2, it was ~4.706, which is even higher. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the substitution steps.

From equation 1: 10a = x b = e^a * b ⇒ b = (10a)/e^a.

Equation 2: 10b = 4y a = 4 e^b a.

Substituting b: 10*(10a/e^a) =4 a e^{b} ⇒ 100 a / e^a =4 a e^{b}.

Divide both sides by a: 100 / e^a =4 e^{b}.

But since b =10a/e^a, substitute that: 100 / e^a =4 e^{10a/e^a}.

Then, as before, we get 25 / e^a =e^{10a/e^a}.

Taking natural logs: ln(25) -a =10a/e^a.

So, equation: ln25 - a =10a e^{-a}.

Hmm, maybe I can let t = a. So equation is ln25 - t =10 t e^{-t}.

Let me write this as:

ln25 = t +10 t e^{-t} = t(1 +10 e^{-t} )

Let me denote f(t) = t(1 + 10 e^{-t}) - ln25.

We can try to find the root of f(t)=0.

We can try t=2:

f(2)=2*(1 +10 e^{-2}) - ln25 ≈ 2*(1 +10*0.1353) -3.2189 ≈ 2*(1+1.353) -3.2189 ≈ 2*(2.353) -3.2189 ≈4.706 -3.2189≈1.487>0.

t=1:

f(1)=1*(1 +10 e^{-1}) -3.2189 ≈1*(1+3.6788) -3.2189≈4.6788 -3.2189≈1.4599>0.

t=3:

f(3)=3*(1 +10 e^{-3}) -3.2189 ≈3*(1+0.4979) -3.2189≈3*(1.4979)≈4.4937 -3.2189≈1.2748>0.

t=4:

f(4)=4*(1 +10 e^{-4})≈4*(1 +10*0.0183) ≈4*(1.183)≈4.732. So 4.732 -3.2189≈1.513>0.

Wait, but this suggests that f(t) is always positive for t ≥1. But that can't be, because at t approaching infinity, e^{-t} approaches zero, so f(t)≈t*(1+0) - ln25 =t - ln25, which tends to infinity. Hmm, but when t approaches 0 from above, let's see:

t approaches 0+, f(t)= t*(1 +10 e^{-t}) - ln25 ≈ t*(1 +10*(1 - t)) -ln25 ≈ t*(11 -10t) -ln25. So as t approaches 0, f(t) approaches -ln25≈-3.2189, which is negative. So f(t) moves from negative at t=0 to positive as t increases, implying that there's at least one root somewhere between t=0 and t=1.

Wait, wait, but earlier when I tried t=0.5, f(t)=0.5*(1 +10 e^{-0.5}) -ln25 ≈0.5*(1 +10*0.6065) -3.2189≈0.5*(1 +6.065)≈0.5*7.065≈3.5325 -3.2189≈0.3136>0.

Wait, so at t=0.5, f(t)=0.3136>0. But when t approaches 0, f(t) approaches -3.2189. So the function crosses zero somewhere between t=0 and t=0.5.

Wait, let's compute f(t) at t=0.25.

f(0.25)=0.25*(1 +10 e^{-0.25}) -ln25 ≈0.25*(1 +10*(0.7788))≈0.25*(1+7.788)=0.25*(8.788)=2.197 ≈2.197 -3.2189≈-1.0219. Hmm, that's negative.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe my calculation was wrong.

Wait, e^{-0.25} is approximately 0.7788. So 10 e^{-0.25} ≈7.788.

So 1 +7.788=8.788. So 0.25 *8.788≈2.197. Then 2.197 -3.2189≈-1.0219. So at t=0.25, f(t)≈-1.0219 <0.

At t=0.5, f(t)=3.5325 -3.2189≈0.3136>0.

So somewhere between t=0.25 and t=0.5, f(t) crosses zero.

Let me try t=0.3:

f(0.3)=0.3*(1 +10 e^{-0.3}) ≈0.3*(1 +10 *0.7408)≈0.3*(1 +7.408)=0.3*(8.408)=2.5224. Then 2.5224 -3.2189≈-0.6965 <0.

t=0.4:

f(0.4)=0.4*(1 +10 e^{-0.4})≈0.4*(1 +10*0.6703)≈0.4*(1 +6.703)=0.4*(7.703)=3.0812. Then 3.0812 -3.2189≈-0.1377 <0.

t=0.45:

f(0.45)=0.45*(1 +10 e^{-0.45})≈0.45*(1 +10 *0.6376)≈0.45*(1 +6.376)=0.45*(7.376)=3.3192. Then 3.3192 -3.2189≈0.1003>0.

So between t=0.4 and t=0.45, f(t) crosses zero.

Let me try t=0.425:

e^{-0.425}= approximately, let's calculate it. ln(2)=0.6931, so 0.425 is less than that. Let me use calculator approximation: e^{-0.4}=0.6703, e^{-0.425}=e^{-0.4} * e^{-0.025} ≈0.6703 * (1 -0.025 + 0.0003125)≈0.6703*(0.9753125)≈0.6703*0.975≈0.653.

So 10 e^{-0.425} ≈6.53. So 1+6.53=7.53.

So f(0.425)=0.425 *7.53 ≈3.199. Then 3.199 -3.2189≈-0.0199≈-0.02 <0.

t=0.425 gives f(t)≈-0.02.

t=0.43:

e^{-0.43} ≈ let me compute it. 0.43 is about 0.4+0.03.

We know e^{-0.4}=0.6703. e^{-0.03}≈1 -0.03 +0.00045≈0.97045.

So e^{-0.43}=e^{-0.4}*e^{-0.03}≈0.6703*0.97045≈0.6703*0.97≈approx 0.6703*(1 -0.03)=0.6703 -0.0201≈0.6502.

So 10 e^{-0.43}=6.502. So 1+6.502=7.502.

f(0.43)=0.43 *7.502≈3.22586. Then 3.22586 -3.2189≈0.00696>0.

So between t=0.425 and t=0.43, f(t) crosses zero.

Let me approximate using linear interpolation.

At t=0.425, f(t)= -0.02.

At t=0.43, f(t)=+0.007.

The change in t is 0.005, and change in f(t) is 0.027.

We need to find delta where f(t) =0.

So delta ≈ (0 - (-0.02)) * (0.005)/(0.027) ≈0.02 * (0.005/0.027) ≈0.0037.

So t≈0.425 +0.0037≈0.4287.

So a≈0.4287.

So ln x =a≈0.4287 ⇒x≈e^{0.4287}≈1.535.

Now, from equation 1: b=(10a)/e^a.

Compute b: 10a≈10*0.4287≈4.287.

e^a≈e^{0.4287}≈1.535.

So b≈4.287 /1.535≈2.792.

So ln y≈2.792 ⇒ y≈e^{2.792}.

Compute e^{2.792}: e^2≈7.389, e^0.792≈2.207. So 7.389 *2.207≈16.29.

Wait, let me compute e^{2.792} more accurately.

Wait, 2.792 is approximately 2 +0.792.

e^2 ≈7.389056.

e^{0.792} ≈ let me compute using Taylor series or calculator.

Alternatively, 0.792 is close to 0.7, where e^0.7≈2.01375.

But 0.792 is higher than 0.7. Let me compute e^{0.792}.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approximation: e^{0.792} ≈2.208.

So e^{2.792}=e^2 * e^{0.792}≈7.389 *2.208≈16.30.

So y≈16.30.

Now, let me check if these values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: x^10 = y^x.

x≈1.535, so x^10≈(1.535)^10.

Let me compute that:

1.535^1 = 1.535

1.535^2 ≈2.356

1.535^3≈2.356*1.535≈3.612

1.535^4≈3.612*1.535≈5.555

1.535^5≈5.555*1.535≈8.529

1.535^6≈8.529*1.535≈13.10.

1.535^7≈13.10*1.535≈20.16

1.535^8≈20.16*1.535≈30.96

1.535^9≈30.96*1.535≈47.54

1.535^10≈47.54*1.535≈73.00.

So x^10≈73.

Now y^x≈16.3^1.535.

Compute 16.3^1.535.

Well, 16.3^1 =16.3.

16.3^0.535≈sqrt(16.3)^(0.535/0.5)= (4.0375)^{1.07}.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use logarithms.

Compute ln(16.3^1.535)=1.535 * ln(16.3).

ln(16.3)=2.791. So 1.535 *2.791≈4.287.

Thus, e^{4.287}≈73.00. So y^x≈73. So equation one holds.

Now equation two: y^10 =x^{4y}.

Compute y^10≈(16.3)^10.

Wait, 16^10 is a big number. Let me compute 16^10:

16^2=256; 16^4=256^2=65536; 16^5=1048576; 16^10=(16^5)^2≈(1,048,576)^2≈1,099,511,627,776.

Wait, but wait, y is approximately 16.3, so y^10≈(16.3)^10.

But x^{4y}= (1.535)^{4*16.3}≈(1.535)^{65.2}.

Wait, that seems like a very large number. Wait, but wait, I might have made a mistake because when I computed equation two, I may have miscalculated.

Wait, equation two is y^10 =x^{4y}.

So y^10 = (16.3)^10 ≈16^10 * (1.01875)^10≈1.0995e12 * approx 1.197≈1.315e12.

Wait, but x^{4y}= (1.535)^{4*16.3}≈(1.535)^{65.2}.

Wait, but (1.535)^{65} is a huge number, way larger than 1e12. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made an error in the substitution earlier. Let me check.

Wait, from equation 2, we had y^10 =x^{4y}.

But earlier, from x^10 =y^x, so y=x^{10/x}.

Substituting into equation 2:

y^10 =x^{4y} ⇒ (x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y} ⇒x^{100/x} =x^{4y}.

Since the bases are the same and x>1, the exponents must be equal:

100/x =4y ⇒ y= (100)/(4x)=25/x.

So y=25/x.

Hmm, that's a useful relationship. So y=25/x.

Now, from equation 1: x^10=y^x.

But since y=25/x, substitute:

x^10 = (25/x)^x ⇒x^{10} =25^x /x^x ⇒x^{10 +x} =25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(10 +x)/x} =25.

Which simplifies to x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, that's another equation involving x.

Let me write that as x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Take natural logs:

(1 + 10/x) ln x = ln25.

Hmm, perhaps I can set t = ln x, so x = e^t.

Substituting:

(1 +10/(e^t)) * t = ln25.

So:

t + (10 t)/e^t = ln25.

Hmm, this equation is similar to the earlier one I had, but perhaps this form is easier to work with.

Let me denote this as:

t + (10 t) e^{-t} = ln25 ≈3.2189.

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can try plugging in some values.

Let me try t=2:

2 + (20)e^{-2}≈2 +20*(0.1353)≈2 +2.706≈4.706>3.2189.

t=1:

1 +10 e^{-1}≈1 +10*(0.3679)≈1 +3.679≈4.679>3.2189.

t=3:

3 +30 e^{-3}≈3 +30*(0.0498)≈3 +1.494≈4.494>3.2189.

t=4:

4 +40 e^{-4}≈4 +40*(0.0183)≈4 +0.732≈4.732>3.2189.

Wait, maybe I need a smaller t. Wait, but when t approaches 0, the left side approaches 0 +0=0 <3.2189.

So the function f(t)=t +10t e^{-t} increases as t increases, because the derivative f’(t)=1 +10 e^{-t} -10t e^{-t}.

Hmm, let me compute f(t) at t=0.5:

0.5 +5 e^{-0.5}≈0.5 +5*(0.6065)≈0.5 +3.0325≈3.5325>3.2189.

At t=0.4:

0.4 +4 e^{-0.4} ≈0.4 +4*(0.6703)≈0.4 +2.681≈3.081<3.2189.

So between t=0.4 and t=0.5, f(t) crosses ln25=3.2189.

So let me try t=0.45:

f(t)=0.45 +10*0.45 e^{-0.45}≈0.45 +4.5 e^{-0.45}.

Compute e^{-0.45}≈approx 0.6376.

So 4.5 *0.6376≈2.8692.

So f(0.45)=0.45 +2.8692≈3.3192>3.2189.

t=0.425:

f(t)=0.425 +10*0.425 e^{-0.425}.

Compute e^{-0.425}≈0.653.

10*0.425=4.25.

4.25*0.653≈2.779.

So f(t)=0.425 +2.779≈3.204≈3.204<3.2189.

So between t=0.425 and t=0.45, f(t) crosses 3.2189.

Let me try t=0.43:

f(t)=0.43 +10*0.43 e^{-0.43}.

Compute e^{-0.43}≈approx 0.6502.

10*0.43=4.3.

4.3 *0.6502≈2.796.

So f(t)=0.43 +2.796≈3.226≈3.226>3.2189.

So now, between t=0.425 (f=3.204) and t=0.43 (f=3.226), the desired t is where f(t)=3.2189.

Let me compute at t=0.427:

e^{-0.427} ≈ let's approximate. e^{-0.425}=0.653, e^{-0.427}=e^{-0.425 -0.002}=0.653 * e^{-0.002}≈0.653*(1 -0.002 +0.000002)≈0.653 -0.0013≈0.6517.

10*0.427=4.27.

4.27 *0.6517≈approx 4*0.6517=2.6068, 0.27*0.6517≈0.1759. So total≈2.6068 +0.1759≈2.7827.

f(t)=0.427 +2.7827≈3.2097≈3.2097 <3.2189.

So t=0.427 gives f(t)=3.2097.

t=0.428:

e^{-0.428}=approx e^{-0.427}=0.6517, so e^{-0.428}=0.6517 * e^{-0.001}≈0.6517*(1 -0.001)≈0.6517 -0.00065≈0.65105.

10*0.428=4.28.

4.28 *0.65105≈4*0.65105=2.6042, 0.28*0.65105≈0.1823.

Total≈2.6042 +0.1823≈2.7865.

So f(t)=0.428 +2.7865≈3.2145≈3.2145 <3.2189.

t=0.429:

e^{-0.429}=approx 0.65105 * e^{-0.001}=approx 0.65105*(1 -0.001)=0.65105 -0.000651≈0.6504.

10*0.429=4.29.

4.29 *0.6504≈4*0.6504=2.6016, 0.29*0.6504≈0.1886.

Total≈2.6016 +0.1886≈2.7902.

f(t)=0.429 +2.7902≈3.2192.

Which is just above 3.2189.

So the solution is approximately t≈0.429.

So ln x≈0.429 ⇒x≈e^{0.429}≈1.536.

Then y=25/x≈25/1.536≈16.296.

So x≈1.536, y≈16.296.

Now, let me compute xy≈1.536*16.296≈25.

Wait, that's interesting. So xy≈25. Hmm, is this a coincidence? Let me check more accurately.

Wait, from equation y=25/x, so xy=25. Oh, that's a much simpler way. So if y=25/x, then xy=25.

So the product xy is 25.

Wait, that's much easier. I should have seen that earlier.

Because from equation 1 and 2, we derived y=25/x, so their product is 25.

So I think the answer is 25.


To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) implies \(x^{10} = y^x\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) implies \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\).

From the first equation, we express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):  
\(y = x^{10/x}\).

Substituting this into the second equation:  
\[
(x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4y} \implies x^{100/x} = x^{4y}.
\]

Since the bases are equal and \(x > 1\), the exponents must be equal:  
\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y \implies y = \frac{25}{x}.
\]

Thus, \(y = \frac{25}{x}\). Substituting this back into \(xy\):  
\[
xy = x \cdot \frac{25}{x} = 25.
\]

Therefore, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
