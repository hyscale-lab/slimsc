Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, and some also own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades. The numbers given are:

- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.

Additionally, everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so the total number of items is four, but each resident can have any combination of these, including none beyond the candy hearts.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So actually, every resident has at least the candy hearts. So the four things are: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade. But the counts given are for the other three. Hmm.

Wait, no, the wording is: "there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade." So, those are the numbers for each of these three items, not including the candy hearts. But each resident has at least the candy hearts. So, the total number of items a resident can have is four, but the counts for the other three are given.

Now, the problem also says that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of them. Wait, but each resident has at least the candy hearts, so when they say "exactly two" or "exactly three," do they mean exactly two of the four things, including the candy hearts, or excluding? Hmm. Let me read it again.

The problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. The other three are optional. So, when it talks about owning exactly two or three of these things, it's probably referring to the three optional items, not the candy hearts. Because the candy hearts are already owned by everyone, and the problem doesn't mention them as optional.

Wait, but that
