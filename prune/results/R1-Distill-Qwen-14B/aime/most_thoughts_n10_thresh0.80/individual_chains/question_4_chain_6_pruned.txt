Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win in this game. Let me try to understand the game first.

The game is between Alice and Bob. There's a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins.

So, the goal is to find all n where Bob can force a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. This seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve determining winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, maybe I can model this by figuring out for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's try small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't do anything. So n=1 is a W for Alice, so Bob can't win here. So n=1 is not counted.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, but wait. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Bob wins. But wait, does Alice have another option? She can only take 1 or 4. So she can't take 4 from n=2. So she must take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is counted.

Wait, wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, in game theory, positions are considered from the perspective of the player about to move. So, for n=1, the player to move can take 1 and win. So n=1 is a W position.

n=2: The player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position for them. Wait, if I take 1 from n=2, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent, meaning they can win. Alternatively, can I take
