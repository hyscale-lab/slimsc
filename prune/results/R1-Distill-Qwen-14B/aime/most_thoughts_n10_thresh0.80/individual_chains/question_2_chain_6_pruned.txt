Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The points given are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the coordinate plane. Then there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. I need to find OC squared, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, let me digest this. So, AB is a line segment between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). I should probably find the equation of line AB first. Then, the point C is on AB, but not equal to A or B. And importantly, C is not on any other segment from family F except AB.

So, the family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, each PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with sqrt(p² + q²) = 1.

I should find the set of all such segments PQ and see which point C on AB is only intersected by AB from F, and no other PQ from F.

Wait, but how does point C relate to these segments? Since C is on AB, and F consists of all these PQ segments, I need to ensure that C is only on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

But AB is also a segment in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB to confirm it's a unit length.

Calculating the distance between A and B:

Distance AB = sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F.

Therefore, for point C on AB, we need to ensure that C is not on any other PQ from F except AB itself.

So, suppose there is another segment PQ in F (i.e., PQ has length 1, P on x-axis, Q on y-axis) that also passes through C. We need to find C such that this doesn't happen; only AB passes through C among all segments in F.

Hmm, so perhaps the idea is to find C on AB such that the line from P to Q (which is PQ) is tangent to the curve of points that are on F segments, but only AB passes through C. Alternatively, maybe C is the point where AB is the only such segment passing through it.

Wait, maybe another approach: if I consider all segments PQ in F, they form a sort of envelope or something, and AB is one of them. The point C is the point on AB where AB is the only segment from F passing through it. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Therefore, if I can find all points that lie on exactly one segment from F, and then find which of those points lie on AB, which would be C.

But perhaps more precisely, for each point (x,y) in the first quadrant, we can determine how many segments PQ in F pass through (x,y). We want the point C such that exactly one segment PQ in F passes through it, and that segment is AB.

So, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F, which would be the set of points lying on exactly one member of F. Then, find where this envelope intersects AB, which would give us point C.

Alternatively, maybe the lines PQ form a pencil of lines, and the envelope is the set of points where each point is on only one line of the pencil.

Wait, but F is not a pencil; it's a family of lines of varying P and Q, each being of unit length. So, each line is PQ: from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but actually, for each PQ, p and q are varying such that p² + q² =1. So for each p from 0 to 1, q is sqrt(1 - p²), but since we're in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² =1.

So, for a given p, q = sqrt(1 - p²), so the equation is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Therefore, the family of lines is parameterized by p, 0 < p < 1.

So, the equation is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

So, to find the envelope of this family, we can use the method of finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1 = 0,

and dF/dp = 0.

So, let me compute dF/dp.

dF/dp = -x/p² + y * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * 2p ) )

Simplify: dF/dp = -x/p² + y * ( p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) = 0.

So, the two equations are:

1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1

2. -x/p² + (y p)/(1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

We can try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of p.

Let me denote sqrt(1 - p²) as q. So, q = sqrt(1 - p²), which means that p² + q² =1.

So, equation 1: x/p + y/q = 1.

Equation 2: -x/p² + y p / q³ = 0.

Let me write these as:

1. x/p + y/q = 1

2. -x/p² + (y p)/q³ = 0

Let me solve equation 2 for x.

From equation 2:

-x/p² + (y p)/q³ = 0 → x/p² = (y p)/q³ → x = y p³ / q³.

So, x = y (p/q)^3.

Now, substitute x into equation 1.

Equation 1: (y (p/q)^3 ) / p + y/q =1.

Simplify:

(y (p³ / q³)) / p + y/q = y (p² / q³) + y/q = 1.

Factor out y:

y [ p² / q³ + 1 / q ] = 1.

Express both terms with denominator q³:

y [ p² / q³ + q² / q³ ] = y [ (p² + q²) / q³ ] =1.

But p² + q² =1, so:

y [ 1 / q³ ] =1 → y = q³.

So, y = q³ = (sqrt(1 - p²))³.

And since x = y (p/q)^3,

x = (q³) (p³ / q³) ) = p³.

So, x = p³, y = q³ = (sqrt(1 - p²))³.

So, the envelope is parametrized by p as x = p³, y = (sqrt(1 - p²))³.

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of x and y.

Let me consider x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, let me see if I can express this without p.

Express p in terms of x: p = x^(1/3).

Then, y = (1 - (x^(1/3))² )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Wait, perhaps another approach: let's compute y in terms of x.

Let me square both sides to make it easier.

But first, perhaps check if that's the correct envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the parametric equations as:

x = p³,

y = (sqrt(1 - p²))³ = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, if I let t = p, then x = t³, y = (1 - t²)^(3/2).

Alternatively, we can write y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Let me test this: if x = p³, then x^(1/3) = p, so t = p = x^(1/3).

So, y = (1 - t²)^(3/2) = (1 - (x^(1/3))² )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

But I need to think about it. The envelope is the set of points that are touched by exactly one segment PQ in F. So, the point C lies on AB and on this envelope, but only on AB from F. So, perhaps point C is the intersection of AB and the envelope.

So, I need to find the point C that lies on both AB and the envelope curve.

So, let's write the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c.

Since it passes through A(1/2, 0), substitute x=1/2, y=0:

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c → c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the envelope curve is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

So, to find point C, we need to solve the system:

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

and

y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

So, let's set them equal:

-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2).

Let me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t³.

So, substituting, the equation becomes:

-sqrt(3) t³ + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - t²)^(3/2).

Let me write this as:

sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t³ = (1 - t²)^(3/2).

Let me factor out sqrt(3)/2 on the left:

sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2 t³) = (1 - t²)^(3/2).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but that might complicate things further.

Wait, but let's check if there's an obvious solution. Since C is on AB and the envelope, perhaps t is a simple value.

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify.

Let me let u = t².

Then, t³ = t * t² = t u.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can let s = t.

Wait, perhaps let me square both sides.

Left side: [sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2 t³)]^2 = (3/4)(1 - 2 t³)^2.

Right side: [(1 - t²)^(3/2)]^2 = (1 - t²)^3.

So, equation
