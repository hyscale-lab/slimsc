Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that for primes p, certain conditions must be met for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Let me think about the properties of primes in relation to exponents. Maybe Fermat's little theorem can help here, but that's usually for modulo p, not p². Hmm.

Wait, primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². So, for such primes, there exists an integer n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². I know that for primes p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue, but what about quartic?

I recall that if p is a prime where p ≡ 1 mod 8, then the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, the existence of a solution to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² requires that -1 is in the image of the quartic residues.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider for which primes p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Because if it does, maybe it can be lifted to a solution mod p² using Hensel's lemma.

So, first, I need to find primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution.

Let me see, for a prime p, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2, I think. Wait, because the order of x⁴ must divide the order of the multiplicative group.

Wait, more accurately, x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that (-1) is in the subgroup of quartic residues mod p. For that to happen, the order of (-1) must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, that might be a bit complicated.

Alternatively, since (-1) raised to the power of 2 is 1, so its order is 2. So, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Or perhaps more accurately, the equation is solvable if and only if the multiplicative order of -1 divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Another approach: Let me consider when does x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p have a solution. Let me denote g as a primitive root modulo p. Then, any element can be written as g^k
