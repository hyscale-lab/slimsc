Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The problem says that AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. Each pair is given as sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89) respectively. I need to find the distance from the incenter (a point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m√n over p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the surface area might be a bit tricky because each face is a triangle, and I need to calculate the area of each of the four faces and sum them up. Let me write down the edge lengths again to get the structure right.

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm, so the opposite edges are equal. That suggests that this tetrahedron is "isohedral" or at least symmetric in a certain way. Maybe it's a kind of "kite" tetrahedron? Not exactly sure, but perhaps the symmetry can help.

So each pair of opposite edges is equal. That might mean that the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to swapping certain vertices. But how does that help me compute the volume?

I remember that in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, there's a formula for the volume. Alternatively, maybe I can find the volume using coordinates.

Perhaps assigning coordinates to the vertices would help. Let me try that. Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D space in such a way that calculations become easier.

Let me assume point A is at (0, 0, 0). Then, I can place point B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB lies along the x-axis. Then, point C can be at (a, b, 0), and point D will be somewhere in 3D space, say (c, d, e). But that might get complicated with so many variables. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, since opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron can be considered as two congruent triangles connected in a symmetric way? Or perhaps, it's a kind of birectangular tetrahedron?

Alternatively, I recall that in such symmetric tetrahedrons, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the product of the opposite edges and some sine of angles. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths is given by:

288 V² = |CM|,

where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²
