Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So first, Alice picks some set A. Then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the max element is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024.

I think I should figure out how the number of such sets B relates to the set A. Let me think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, he can form sets B where the maximum is a. So the total number of sets B would be the sum over each a in A of the number of subsets of positive integers where the maximum is a.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because in each set B, all elements are positive integers, and the maximum is a, which is in A. So for each a in A, how many finite non-empty sets B have maximum a? 

Well, if the maximum is a, then all other elements of B must be less than a. So the other elements can be any non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, right? Because you can't have elements greater than a, as a is the maximum. But wait, no, that's not necessarily the case because B is a set of positive integers, so they can be any numbers, but the maximum is a. So the other elements must be less than a.

Wait, no, they could be any positive integers less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible B's with max a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because B must have a as the maximum, so the other elements can be any subset of the numbers less than a, but since B has to be non-empty, we have to consider all possible subsets including the empty set? Wait, no, because the set B itself is non-empty, but if the maximum is a, then at least a is in B, so the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. So the number of subsets for each a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each element less than a, you
