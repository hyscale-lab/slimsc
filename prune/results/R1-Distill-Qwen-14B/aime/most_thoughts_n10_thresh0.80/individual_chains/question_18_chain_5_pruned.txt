Okay, so I’ve got this problem here: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Maybe I should think about the structure of the dodecagon and how rectangles can be formed within it.

Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which might help. So perhaps I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, with its center at the origin, and each vertex equally spaced around a circle. That might make it easier to visualize.

Wait, but how do rectangles come into play? A rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, for a rectangle to be formed inside the dodecagon, each of its sides must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means each side of the rectangle must be aligned with some edge or diagonal of the dodecagon.

Let me think about the diagonals in a dodecagon. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. For a dodecagon, that would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. But not all of them are unique in terms of length or direction. In a regular polygon, diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal can connect a vertex to another vertex 2 steps apart, 3 steps apart, etc., up to 5 steps apart because beyond that, the diagonals repeat on the other side.

Wait, actually, in a dodecagon, the maximum number of steps between two vertices without counting the same diagonal twice is 5. Because beyond 6 steps, it's the same as going the other way around (since 12/2=6). So there are diagonals of different lengths based on how many steps apart the vertices are.

For example:
- Step 1: adjacent vertices, that's the side of the polygon.
- Step 2: skip one vertex.
- Step 3: skip two vertices.
- ...
- Step 6: the diameter, connecting opposite vertices.

But since step 6 is the same as step 6 in the other direction, but for steps less than 6, each step k is different from step (12 - k). So maybe for a dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized into steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Wait, but the sides are step 1, so the diagonals are steps 2 through 6. But step 6 is a diameter, which is the longest diagonal.

Now, the rectangle requires four sides, each lying on either a side or a diagonal. But since a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned in such a way that their lengths correspond to specific step sizes.

So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle correspond to two different step sizes, say step a and step b, where a and b are such that the sides are perpendicular. Because in a regular polygon, if two diagonals are perpendicular, their step sizes must satisfy some condition.

Wait, maybe I should model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle for simplicity. Then each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference with angles at 30-degree increments (since 360/12=30). So vertex 1 is at 0 degrees, vertex 2 at 30 degrees, vertex 3 at 60 degrees, and so on, up to vertex 12 at 330 degrees.

If I can model the sides and diagonals as vectors between these points, I can perhaps compute when two vectors are perpendicular. Because for a rectangle, adjacent sides must be perpendicular.

So, suppose I have two vectors, one from vertex i to vertex j, and another from vertex j to vertex k. These two vectors should be perpendicular. The vectors can be represented in terms of their coordinates, and the dot product should be zero if they're perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the angles of these vectors. If two vectors are perpendicular, their angle difference is 90 degrees. So, the angle between the two vectors should be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, each vertex is at 30-degree increments. So, the angle between consecutive vertices is 30 degrees. So, perhaps the angle between two vectors (sides or diagonals) can be a multiple of 30 degrees.

For them to be perpendicular, the angle between them should be 90 degrees. So, 90 degrees is 3*30 degrees. So, if two vectors are separated by three edges, their angle would be 90 degrees.

Wait, that might be a clue. So, if I take a step of 3 vertices, the angle is 90 degrees. So, perhaps a side that skips 3 vertices is perpendicular to another side that skips a certain number of vertices.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think again. The central angle between two vertices that are k steps apart is 30*k degrees. So, for two vectors (sides or diagonals) with steps k and m, the angle between them is |30k - 30m| degrees. For them to be perpendicular, this angle must be 90 degrees. So, |30k -30m| = 90, meaning |k - m| = 3. So, the difference in their steps must be 3.

So, that suggests that a diagonal of step k and a diagonal of step k+3 would be perpendicular. But I think this is only true if the vectors are in the same rotational direction. Hmm, perhaps I should formalize this a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps a rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair is separated by a certain number of steps. For example, in a regular polygon, if you take two sides that are separated by a certain number of steps, they can form opposite sides of a rectangle.

Wait, maybe another approach is to think about the coordinates of the vertices and see when four points form a rectangle. Each vertex can be given coordinates (cos(theta), sin(theta)) where theta is 30*(i-1) degrees, for i from 1 to 12.

So, let's assign vertex 1 at (1,0), vertex 2 at (cos(30°), sin(30°)), and so on, up to vertex 12 at (cos(330°), sin(330°)).

Now, a rectangle is defined by four points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4) such that the midpoints between opposite vertices are the same, and the sides are equal and at right angles.

Wait, but that might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center and separated by specific angles.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the sides of the rectangle must be aligned with diagonals or sides of the dodecagon, which correspond to certain vectors.

Wait, another thought: in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be considered as vectors, and for two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, perhaps I can calculate the vectors corresponding to the sides and diagonals and find when two vectors are perpendicular.

Let me try that. Suppose I have two vectors, vector A and vector B. Vector A goes from vertex i to vertex j, which is a step of (j - i) mod 12. Similarly, vector B goes from vertex j to vertex k, which is a step of (k - j) mod 12.

But for them to be adjacent sides of a rectangle, vector A and vector B must be perpendicular. So, their dot product must be zero.

The vectors can be represented as differences between complex numbers, since each vertex is on the unit circle. So, vector A is e^{i*theta_j} - e^{i*theta_i}, and vector B is e^{i*theta_k} - e^{i*theta_j}.

Wait, but the dot product in complex numbers is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent each vector as a complex number and then compute their product. If two vectors are perpendicular, their product is a purely imaginary number because multiplying by i rotates a vector 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps that's a useful approach. If vector B is vector A rotated by 90 degrees, then vector B = i * vector A (since multiplying by i gives a 90-degree rotation in the complex plane). But this would only be the case for specific vectors.

But in reality, vector B is a side of the polygon or a diagonal, so it's one of the 12 sides or 54 diagonals, but many of these will not be rotations of each other by 90 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the angles of the vectors. The angle of vector A is the angle of the step it represents, and the angle of vector B is the angle of its step, but they must differ by 90 degrees.

But since the dodecagon is regular, each step corresponds to a certain angle. So, if step A is k, then the angle is 30k degrees. Similarly, step B would need to be such that 30m = 30k ± 90 degrees. So, 30m = 30k + 90 or 30m = 30k -90. So, m = k + 3 or m = k - 3.

Wait, that's an interesting point. So, if two steps differ by 3, their corresponding vectors are separated by 90 degrees, making them perpendicular. So, perhaps for a rectangle, the sides must be made up of steps k and k+3.

Wait, but that's just one possibility because the steps could also be in the opposite direction. So, for each step k, a step of k+3 would result in a vector that's perpendicular.

But how does that help me count rectangles? Hmm. Maybe each rectangle is determined by two pairs of such steps.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing two different step sizes, say a and b, such that the vectors corresponding to these steps are perpendicular. Then, for each such pair (a, b), the number of rectangles would be determined by how many such pairs of steps exist around the polygon.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of steps. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal and parallel sides, each pair must be separated by
