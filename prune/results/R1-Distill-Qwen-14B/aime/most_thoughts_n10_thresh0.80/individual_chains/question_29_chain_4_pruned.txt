Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize what's given. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting. 

Alright, so let's break down the given information. The sides of rectangle ABCD are BC=16 and AB=107. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB and CD are 107 each, and BC and AD are 16 each. So, ABCD has length 107 and width 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184. So, the sides of EFGH are EF=184, FG=17, GH=184, and HE=17. So, EFGH is a longer, narrower rectangle compared to ABCD.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm. So, the line that passes through D, E, C, F. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's imagine ABCD and EFGH are placed such that their sides are aligned along this line. Maybe they are placed side by side along this line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral.

I think I need to draw a rough sketch to get a better idea. Let me imagine plotting this out.

So, let me consider the line through D, E, C, F as a horizontal line for simplicity. So, points D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent corners of rectangle EFGH. So, D and E are next to each other on the line, then E, F, and C. Wait, but the order is D, E, C, F. So, from D to E to C to F. So, the line is D---E---C---F.

Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are at right angles. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then the sides AD and BC must be perpendicular to this line, as they are sides of the rectangle. Similarly, the sides FG and EH of the other rectangle must be perpendicular to this line as well.

Wait, so if the line DC is horizontal, then AD and BC are vertical, with lengths 16. Similarly, FG and EH are vertical sides with lengths 17.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let me try that.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if DC is along the x-axis, then point C would be at (107,0), because BC=16 and AB=107. Wait, no, BC is 16. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is length 107, BC is
