Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the numbers is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I'll need to construct such a list and then compute the sum of squares. Let's start by recalling what each term means.

Mode: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Median: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from least to greatest. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer not in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median can be one of the numbers, but in this case, it's not. So if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which might not be an integer unless those two numbers are the same. Wait, but if the median is an integer, that suggests that the two middle numbers could be consecutive integers whose average is an integer. For example, 3 and 5 average to 4.

Wait, but if the median is not in the list, then if the list has an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must average to an integer that's not present. So perhaps one is even and the other is odd, making their average a half-integer, but since the median is an integer, that can't be. Wait, that can't happen. So maybe the list has an odd number of elements?

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th element when sorted. So if that element is not in the list, but the list is made of positive integers, but the median is an integer. Hmm, that can't be, because the (k+1)th element is part of the list. So wait, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements because then the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list. But the median is a positive integer, so the average must be an integer. So those two middle numbers must average to an integer, meaning their sum is even. Therefore, both are even or both are odd. So if the two middle numbers are both even or both odd and their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me think. For example, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, their average is 8. So if 8 is not in the list, then the median is 8. Okay, so in that case, the two middle numbers could be 7 and 9, sum is 16, average is 8, which isn't in the list. That works.

So perhaps the list has an even number of elements. Let me try to figure out the possible structure of the list.

Also, the sum is 30. So the list is a collection of positive integers, sum to 30, with 9 being the unique mode, and the median being an integer not present in the list.

Let me try to think about the minimal number of elements the list can have. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. But to be the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. Wait, no. Suppose another number appears twice, then 9 must appear at least three times to be the unique mode. So the minimal case is that 9 appears three times, others appear at most twice. But wait, another way:
