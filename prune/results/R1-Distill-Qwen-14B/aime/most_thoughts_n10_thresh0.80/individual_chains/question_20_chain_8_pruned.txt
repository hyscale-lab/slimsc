Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable beyond their color. The rules are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions.

Hmm. So I need to find the number of ways to place some chips under these constraints.

Let me try to break this down. Each row and each column must be entirely one color or the other. So, for example, if a row has a white chip, all the cells in that row must be white, or else they can't have any chips. Wait, no, actually, the condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, but it doesn't say that if a row has any chips, all cells must have chips. So, actually, a row can have some chips, but all of them must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but if I have a row with some chips, then all the cells in that row must have the same color chip. But the row doesn't have to be completely filled, right? So a row could have, say, two white chips, but then all other cells in that row must be empty, not black. Because if any cell in a row has a black chip, all chips in that row must be black. So if a row has any chips, all the chips in that row must be the same color, but other cells in the row can be empty.

Similarly for columns. So for each row, you can decide whether it's white, black, or empty. But there's a catch: if you have a row that's white, then all the columns that intersect this row must either be entirely white or entirely empty? Wait, no, because columns are independent. Wait, no, if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. So if a row is white, then any column intersecting this row cannot have a black chip in that cell. Because if a column has a black chip in that cell, then all other cells in that column must be black, which would conflict with the white in the row.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think about it more carefully
