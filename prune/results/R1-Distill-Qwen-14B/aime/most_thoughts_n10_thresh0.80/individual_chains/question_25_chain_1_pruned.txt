Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me try to parse it step by step. 

Alright, there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal, everyone has that. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. 

The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four, which would be the candy hearts plus the other three items. 

Wait, so candy hearts are a given for everyone, so when they talk about owning things, the four "things" include candy hearts as the fourth. So, each resident owns at least one thing, which is candy hearts. The others are optional. 

So, the problem is about using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of people who have all four items. 

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:

Total = A + B + C + D - (AB + AC + AD + BC + BD + CD) + (ABC + ABD + ACD + BCD) - (ABCD)

But wait, in this case, D is the candy hearts, and since everyone has D, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the problem in terms of the three optional items (diamond, golf, garden) and the fourth being candy hearts, which everyone has. 

Wait, actually, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are universal. So, when we're talking about the four things, one of them is always owned by everyone. So, the four "things" are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, the problem is about four sets, but one of them has a universal membership.

But perhaps it's better to model it as the three optional items, since everyone has the candy hearts. So, the total number of residents is 900, and each resident has at least the candy hearts.

Let me think: the problem states that 437 own exactly two of
