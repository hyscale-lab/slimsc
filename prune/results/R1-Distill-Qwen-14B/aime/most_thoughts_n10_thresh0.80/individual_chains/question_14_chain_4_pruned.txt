Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, and the largest such number with this specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Interesting.

First, I need to understand the property. So if N is a four-digit number, let's denote its digits as a, b, c, d. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Now, if I replace any one digit with 1, the resulting number should be divisible by 7.

Wait, that means:

1. Replacing the first digit (a) with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing the second digit (b) with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing the third digit (c) with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing the fourth digit (d) with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest four-digit N (so as large as possible) with this property. Then, compute Q + R where Q is N divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Hmm, okay. So to approach this, perhaps I can model each of these conditions and see what constraints they impose on the digits a, b, c, d.

Let me consider each condition separately.

First, let's denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

1. When the first digit is replaced by 1: the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this N1.

So N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7, so N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, when the second digit is replaced by 1: N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d. So N2 must be ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be ≡0 mod7.

And N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 must be ≡0 mod7.

So, now I can write each of these in terms of N.

Let me express each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

For N1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a). Because the original N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so subtracting 1000a gives 100b + 10c + d, then adding 1000 gives N1.

So N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a) = N - 1000a + 1000.

But 1000a is the thousands digit part. Alternatively, since N is 1000a + ... , then N - 1000a = 100b + 10c +d.

Wait, so N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a). So N1 = N - 1000a + 1000.

But N1 is divisible by 7, so N1 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, for N2: replacing b with 1. So N2 = 1000a + 100*1 +10c +d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. But N is 1000a + 100b + 10c +d, so N2 = N - 100b + 100.

So N2 = N -100b + 100.

Similarly, N2 must be ≡0 mod7.

Similarly for N3: replacing c with 1, so N3 = 1000a + 100b +10*1 +d = N -10c +10.

And N3 must be ≡0 mod7.

For N4: replacing d with 1, so N4 = 1000a + 100b +10c +1 = N -d +1.

N4 must be ≡0 mod7.

So, now, each of these expressions must be congruent to 0 mod7.

So:

1. N1 = N -1000a +1000 ≡0 mod7
2. N2 = N -100b +100 ≡0 mod7
3. N3 = N -10c +10 ≡0 mod7
4. N4 = N -d +1 ≡0 mod7

So, each of these equations can be rewritten in terms of N and the digit:

1. N ≡ 1000a -1000 mod7
2. N ≡ 100b -100 mod7
3. N ≡ 10c -10 mod7
4. N ≡ d -1 mod7

But this seems a bit tangled. Maybe instead, we can express each condition as a congruence on N, and then find N that satisfies all four.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about each modified number N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of their congruence modulo7.

Let me think about each condition separately.

Starting with N1: 1000 + 100b +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

But 1000 mod7: Let me compute 1000 /7.
