Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and these points form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. That is, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound for BD² across all possible such rhombi.

First, let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm: Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that means, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, for points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if I consider points A and C, since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q).

Wait, but since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA must all be equal. Alternatively, since the sides are equal, the distance from A to B must be the same as from B to C, etc.

Alternatively, another way to represent the rhombus is to consider vectors. If the origin is the midpoint, then vectors OA and OC are negatives, and similarly for OB and OD. So vectors OA = -OC and OB = -OD.

Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:
A = (x1, y1)
B = (x2, y2)
C = (-x1, -y1)
D = (-x2, -y2)

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC
