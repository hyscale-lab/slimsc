Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what it's asking. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable, meaning I can't tell one white chip from another or one black chip from another. The grid has 25 unit cells, and each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, once I place some chips, if I try to add any more, it would break one of the previous conditions. So, I need to figure out how many ways there are to place these chips under these constraints.

Hmm, let me break this down. Each row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or have no chips. But wait, the problem says that once I place some chips, I can't add any more without violating the conditions. That probably means the placement is maximal—meaning every possible cell that could have a chip without violating the row and column conditions does have a chip.

Wait, but each cell can hold at most one chip. So, if a row is all white, then each cell in that row has a white chip. Similarly, if a column is all black, each cell in that column has a black chip. But this could lead to overlaps where a cell is in both a white row and a black column, which would be impossible because a cell can't have both a white and a black chip. So, that suggests that any placement must satisfy that the rows and columns don't conflict in color assignments.

Another way to think about it: for any cell, the color of its row and the color of its column must agree. Otherwise, the cell can't exist because it can't be both white and black. So, for all cells that have a chip, the row color and column color must be the same. 

So, perhaps the problem reduces to assigning each row and column a color (white, black, or empty), ensuring that whenever a row is assigned a color, all columns in that row are the same, and the same for columns. Additionally, every cell that is in a row with a color and a column with the same color must have a chip. And it's maximal, meaning that if you tried to add a chip anywhere else, you'd have to change the color of a row or column, which isn't allowed.

Wait, let me try to rephrase. Each row is either white, black, or empty. Each column is either white, black, or empty. But for any cell (i,j), if row i is color C and column j is color D, then C must equal D for the cell to have a chip. And since it's maximal, every cell where C=D must have a chip, and you can't add any more chips without changing the colors.

Hmm, so the setup is that the rows and columns are colored in such a way that overlapping cells can only have chips where row and column colors match. And the placement is maximal, meaning that every possible chip that could be placed given the row and column colors is placed.

So, maybe this problem is equivalent to assigning colors to the rows and columns, such that for each color assignment, all possible cells where row and column colors match are filled with a chip, and the rest are empty. But also, the assignment must be such that you can't add any more chips without changing the color assignments.

Wait a second, but all cells in a row must be the same color, and all cells in a column must be the same color. So, if a row is white, then all its cells can only be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all its cells must be black. But if a cell is in a white row and a black column, that cell can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. So, such cells would be empty, meaning that for that cell, either the row or the column must be empty. But no, the row or column can't be empty because they are assigned a color.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But if a row is white, then every cell in that row is white. If a column is black, every cell in that column is black. But if a cell is in a white row and a black column, that's a conflict because the cell can't be both white and black. So, that cell can't have a chip. Therefore, for any cell (i,j), if row i is color C and column j is color D, then C and D must be the same for the cell to have a chip. Otherwise, it's empty.

But also, the placement is maximal. That means that every cell that could have a chip (i.e., where the row and column colors are the same) does have a chip. So, the number of chips is equal to the number of cells where the row and column have the same color.

But wait, the grid is 5x5, so 25 cells. Each cell is either white, black, or empty. Wait, no, each cell can have at most one chip. So, the chips are only placed where the row and column colors agree. So, for each cell, if the row is white and the column is white, place a white chip. If the row is black and the column is black, place a black chip. Otherwise, leave it empty.

But wait, the chips are indistinct by color, but the grid's cells are distinguishable. So, the total number of white chips would be the sum over all white rows of the number of white columns intersecting them, but only where row and column are both white. Similarly for black.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other set is the columns. Each row is connected to each column. Assigning a color (white, black, or empty) to each row and column, such that for any edge (row, column), if row color is C and column color is D, then the cell (row, column) can only have a chip if C = D. But the placement is such that all possible chips are placed, so for all cells (i,j) where row i and column j have the same color, there is a chip.

But also, the problem statement says that all chips in the same row and same column have the same color. So, each row is all one color, each column is all one color, and the only cells with chips are those where row and column colors match.

Wait, so maybe each row can be white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty. But the placement of chips is determined by the intersection of same-colored rows and columns.

But since the grid is 5x5, each row has 5 cells, and each column has 5 cells. The number of white chips would be the number of white rows multiplied by the number of white columns. Similarly, the number of black chips would be the number of black rows multiplied by the number of black columns.

But wait, that's not quite right because if a row is white and a column is white, the cell is white; if a row is black and a column is black, the cell is black; otherwise, it's empty. So, the total white chips would be (number of white rows) * (number of white columns). Similarly, the total black chips would be (number of black rows) * (number of black columns).

But wait, is that correct? Because each white row has all cells white, but only in the columns that are white. So, for a white row, the number of white chips is equal to the number of white columns. Similarly, for a black row, the number of black chips is equal to the number of black columns.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to model it differently. Let me say that for the rows, I can choose some subset of rows to be white, some subset to be black, and the rest are empty. Similarly for the columns.

But the key point is that the intersection of a white row and a white column will have a white chip. The intersection of a black row and a black column will have a black chip. The intersections of white and black rows/columns will be empty.

Wait, but each row must be either white, black, or empty, and same for each column. So, suppose I let R_w be the number of white rows, R_b the number of black rows, and R_e the number of empty rows. Similarly, C_w, C_b, C_e for columns.

Then, R_w + R_b + R_e = 5, and C_w + C_b + C_e = 5.

The number of white chips would be R_w * C_w, and the number of black chips would be R_b * C_b.

But the problem states that we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips. Wait, no, wait. Wait the problem says there's a collection of 25 white and 25 black chips, but each cell can have at most one chip. So the total number of chips placed on the grid cannot exceed 25. But each placement must satisfy that all white and black chips are placed in such a way that any additional chip would cause a conflict.

Wait, but the problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, the placement is maximal—meaning that every cell that can have a chip (without violating the row and column conditions) does have a chip.

Wait, so the total number of chips could be less than 25, but you can't add any more without violating the conditions. Wait, but in the problem statement, there are 25 white and 25 black chips. So perhaps the placement uses some number of white and black chips, up to 25 each, but the total placed is up to 25.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem statement.

"Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip

all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour

any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

So, the chips can be white or black. Each cell can have at most one chip. All chips in the same row must be same color, same for columns. The placement is such that it's maximal—meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column conditions.

So, the setup is that each row is assigned a color (white, black, or empty), and each column is assigned a color (white, black, or empty). Then, for each cell (i,j), if row i is color C and column j is color D, then if C = D, the cell has a chip of that color. If C ≠ D, the cell is empty.

But the placement is such that it's maximal, which implies that every cell where row and column colors agree is filled. So, the number of white chips is R_w * C_w, and the number of black chips is R_b * C_b. But since each cell can have at most one chip, and we can't have a cell with both white and black, that's already handled.

But in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we don't have to use all of them. Wait, no, the problem says "place some of these chips", so the number placed can be any number up to 25, but such that the conditions are satisfied and it's maximal.

Wait, but the problem could also imply that all possible chips are placed given the constraints. So, the number of white and black chips placed is exactly R_w * C_w and R_b * C_b, respectively. And the sum R_w + R_b ≤5 (since R_e =5 - (R_w + R_b)), and same for columns.

But the problem allows any number of white and black chips, as long as each row is monochromatic and each column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a matrix where each row is white, black, or empty, and each column is white, black, or empty. The cells where row and column have the same color are filled with that color's chip, and others are empty.

But the colors of rows and columns can't conflict. So, for each cell, if the row is white, and the column is white, then it's white. If the row is black and the column is black, it's black. Otherwise, it's empty. But when considering the entire grid, some rows and columns can be empty.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of selecting a subset of rows and columns for each color. For example, choosing k rows to be white, m rows to be black, and the rest empty. Similarly, choosing l columns to be white, n columns to be black, and the rest empty. Then, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is m*n. The total number of chips is k*l + m*n. But the problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions, so that the placement is maximal.

Wait, but how is that maximal? Because if you have any cell that could have a chip without conflicting, it should already have a chip. But in this model, that's already the case. Because all cells where row and column colors match have a chip. So, perhaps the condition is that you can't add any more chips without changing the row or column color assignments.

Wait, but perhaps the problem also requires that all possible cells that can have a chip (given the current row and column colors) have a chip. So, the placement is such that it's already maximal with respect to the row and column color assignments. So, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is m*n, where k is the number of white rows, m the number of black rows, l the number of white columns, n the number of black columns.

But we also have that the number of white rows plus black rows plus empty rows equals 5, same for columns.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible assignments of rows and columns to colors (white, black, empty), such that the placement is maximal. Wait, but every possible assignment where you assign each row and column to a color will automatically be maximal in the sense that all possible chips are placed where row and column colors agree. So, perhaps the problem is to count all possible such assignments, considering the colorings of rows and columns, but with the constraint that the number of white and black chips is exactly 25 each? No, wait, that's not possible because in a 5x5 grid, you can't have 25 white and 25 black chips since that would require 50 chips, but the grid only has 25 cells. So, perhaps the problem is that the number of white and black chips placed must be as much as possible, but without exceeding 25 in total.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify.

Each cell can have at most one chip. So, the total number of chips placed can't exceed 25. The problem says "some of these chips"—so using any number of chips up to 25. The constraints are:

1. Each row must be all one color (white, black, or empty).
2. Each column must be all one color (white, black, or empty).
3. The placement is maximal, meaning that no additional chip can be placed without violating the first two conditions.

So, the problem is to count the number of such maximal placements.

So, each row is assigned a color (W, B, E), same for each column. The cells where row and column colors match get a chip of that color. The placement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without changing the color assignments of rows or columns.

Wait, but in this model, the placement is already such that all possible chips are placed given the row and column colors. So, the maximal condition is automatically satisfied because adding any more chips would require that a cell which is in a row and column of different colors to have a chip, which is impossible. So, perhaps every possible assignment of row and column colors leads to a maximal placement.

But then, the problem is to count the number of such assignments where the number of white chips is ≤25 and the number of black chips is ≤25, but in reality, the total number of chips is the sum of white and black chips. But since each cell can have at most one chip, the sum of white and black chips must be ≤25. But the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we can choose how many to place.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require using all 25 white and black chips, but just any number up to 25, as long as the conditions are met. So, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is m*n, where k is the number of white rows, m the number of black rows, l the number of white columns, n the number of black columns. And k, m, l, n are non-negative integers such that k + m ≤5 and l + n ≤5.

Wait, but the problem is about placing some of the chips, so we can choose any number as long as the color assignments lead to a valid placement.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the key is that each row and column can be either white, black, or empty. For each row, it's W, B, or E. Similarly for each column. Each such assignment defines a placement of chips where a cell (i,j) has a chip of color C if row i and column j are both C. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

The problem is to count all possible such assignments where:

- All rows and columns are assigned W, B, or E.
- The placement is maximal, meaning that no additional chip can be placed without violating the row or column color assignments.

Wait, but in this model, the placement is already maximal because all possible cells where row and column colors match have a chip. So, any assignment of row and column colors will give a maximal placement. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of possible assignments of row and column colors, where the number of white chips is ≤25, black chips is ≤25, and the total chips (white + black) is ≤25.

But perhaps that's not necessary. Wait, the problem states that "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, in other words, the placement is such that every empty cell is empty because either its row or column is empty, or the row and column have different colors. So, in this case, the assignment of row and column colors must satisfy that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is empty, column j is empty, or row i and column j have different colors.

Wait, but if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) is empty, which is allowed. So, the placement is maximal because you can't add any more chips without either changing a row or column color to allow it.

So, the problem is to count the number of such assignments of row and column colors, where each row is W, B, or E, each column is W, B, or E, such that the number of white chips is k*l, black chips is m*n, and the total is k*l + m*n ≤25.

Wait, but perhaps the problem just wants the number of possible assignments of rows and columns to colors (W, B, E), where each row and column is assigned a color, and the placement is such that it's maximal. But then the problem would be the number of such assignments, which is (3^5) * (3^5) = 3^10. But that seems too large, and the answer is probably smaller.

Wait, but perhaps some assignments would result in the same placement. For example, if all rows are E and all columns are E, then no chips are placed. But the problem requires that the placement is maximal, which in this case, it's already maximal because you can't add any chips as all rows and columns are empty. So, that's a valid placement.

But perhaps the problem is more constrained. Let me think again.

Each row can be W, B, or E. Similarly for columns. So, each row has 3 choices, each column has 3 choices. Total assignments would be 3^5 * 3^5 = 3^10. But that's 59049, which is way too big, but perhaps that's the case. But no, the problem says "place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells", so the placement must use some chips, but perhaps not all. But the maximal condition complicates things.

Wait, another approach: each row and column can be assigned a color (W, B, E). The placement is determined by the intersection of same-colored rows and columns. The placement is maximal, which means that for every empty cell, you cannot place a chip there without changing a row or column color. So, every empty cell must be because either its row is empty, its column is empty, or the row and column have different colors.

So, in this case, the problem is essentially to count all possible assignments of row and column colors, as each such assignment defines a unique maximal placement.

But then, the problem is to count the number of such assignments. Each row has 3 options, each column has 3 options. So, 3^5 for rows, and 3^5 for columns, giving 3^10 = 59049 possible assignments. But the problem says "some of these chips"—but perhaps the answer is 3^10.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there are constraints on the number of white and black chips. The problem says there are 25 white and 25 black chips, but you can use any number of them as long as the conditions are met.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's about placing some chips, not necessarily using all. So the count would be all possible assignments of rows and columns to W, B, E, which is 3^10. But that seems too large, given the context. Also, the problem mentions that each cell can have at most one chip, so the total number of chips is the number of cells where row and column colors match. So, for each assignment, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is m*n, where k is the number of white rows, m the number of black rows, l the number of white columns, n the number of black columns.

But the problem doesn't restrict the number of white or black chips, only that each cell has at most one. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 3^10, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as each row and each column being assigned a color, and the number of ways is 3^5 (for rows) multiplied by 3^5 (for columns), which is 3^10 = 59049. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps not all assignments are valid. For instance, if I have a row assigned to white and a column assigned to black, their intersection is empty, which is fine. But the problem is about placing some chips, so the assignment must lead to at least one chip being placed. Wait, but no, the problem says "place some of these chips", which could include placing zero chips. But in that case, all rows and columns are empty, which is a valid assignment.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the last condition says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, if all rows and columns are empty, then adding any chip would require assigning a color to a row and a column, which is allowed. So that placement is not maximal. Therefore, the case where all rows and columns are empty is invalid because you can add chips, which would violate the maximal condition.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the assignment must be such that it's impossible to add any chip without changing a row or column color. Therefore, in the case where all rows and columns are empty, you can add a chip by assigning a color to a row and a column, so that's not maximal. Therefore, such assignments (where all rows and columns are empty) must be excluded.

Hmm, so perhaps we need to count all assignments except the one where all rows and columns are empty. So, total assignments would be 3^10 -1. But that seems off because the problem is about placements, not assignments.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each assignment of rows and columns, the placement is determined. The assignment is maximal if you can't add any more chips without changing the row or column assignments. So, the case where all rows and columns are empty is not maximal because you can add a chip by assigning a color to a row and a column.

So, the problem is to count all assignments where the placement is maximal. So, the assignments where it's impossible to add any chip without changing the row or column colors.

Wait, but in the case where a row is empty and a column is empty, you can add a chip by assigning a color to that row and column. Therefore, such assignments are not maximal. So, to have a maximal assignment, every empty cell must be such that either the row is non-empty (i.e., W or B) and the column is non-empty (W or B), but their colors don't match, making the cell empty. Or, the row or column is empty.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. For a placement to be maximal, every empty cell must be such that you can't place a chip there without changing the row or column color. So, for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is E, or column j is E, or row i and column j have different colors.

Wait, yes. So, the condition is that for every empty cell, either the row is empty or the column is empty, or the row and column have different colors.

Wait, but that's automatically satisfied for any assignment, because in any assignment, a cell is empty if row i and column j have different colors, or if either is E.

Wait, no. For example, if row i is W and column j is E, then cell (i,j) is empty. But in that case, you could assign column j to W, which would allow placing a chip there without changing row i's color. So, that would mean the placement isn't maximal, because you could add a chip at (i,j) by changing column j's color from E to W.

Wait, but that contradicts the maximal condition. So, in order for the placement to be maximal, for every empty cell (i,j), it must be that you can't assign a color to row i or column j to allow placing a chip there without changing the color of row i or column j.

Wait, that's a bit more involved. So, for each empty cell (i,j), either:

1. Row i is E, and you can't assign it a color without affecting other cells, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that for every empty cell (i,j), at least one of row i or column j is already assigned a color that would conflict if you tried to place a chip there. So, if row i is W and column j is B, then cell (i,j) is empty, and you can't place a chip there without changing either row i or column j's color. Similarly, if row i is E, then placing a chip there would require assigning row i a color (W or B), which would affect all cells in row i. So, the placement is maximal if, for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is assigned a color and column j is assigned a different color, or one or both are E.

Wait, but in the case where row i is E and column j is W, then you could place a W chip at (i,j) by assigning row i to W, which would make all cells in row i W, and column j is already W, so cell (i,j) would be W. So, the placement isn't maximal in that case because you could add a chip there, which would require changing row i's color from E to W. So, the condition for maximal placement is that for every empty cell (i,j), if row i is E and column j is not E, then placing a chip there would require assigning row i to column j's color, which would affect all cells in row i. Similarly, if column j is E and row i is not E, then placing a chip there would require assigning column j to row i's color, affecting all cells in column j.

Wait, but in order for the placement to be maximal, you can't add any more chips without changing the row or column colors. So, any empty cell (i,j) must satisfy that either row i is not E, column j is not E, and row i's color != column j's color. Or, if row i is E, then column j must be E as well. Because if row i is E and column j is not E, then you could assign row i to column j's color, which would allow placing a chip at (i,j), making the placement non-maximal.

Wait, that seems correct. So, for a placement to be maximal, every empty cell must be such that either:

1. The row is E and the column is E, or

2. The row is not E, the column is not E, and their colors are different.

In other words, you can't have a situation where a row is E and a column is not E, because then you could add a chip by assigning the row to the column's color. Similarly, if a column is E and a row is not E, you could add a chip by assigning the column to the row's color.

So, the condition is that the set of non-empty rows and non-empty columns must form a bipartition where every non-empty row has the same color, and every non-empty column has the same color, and the row color is different from the column color.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The condition is that the set of non-empty rows must be monochromatic, and the set of non-empty columns must be monochromatic, and their colors must differ. Otherwise, if non-empty rows are white and non-empty columns are white, then every cell where row is non-empty and column is non-empty would have a white chip, which is allowed. But then, the placement is not maximal because you could add a chip in a cell where the row is empty and the column is non-empty by assigning the row to white, but that would require changing the row's color.

Wait, perhaps the maximal condition requires that all non-empty rows have the same color, and all non-empty columns have the same color, and the row color is different from the column color. Because if they were the same, then you could have more cells filled.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to model it.

Suppose that the set of non-empty rows is R, and the set of non-empty columns is C. R is a subset of rows, each assigned either white or black. Similarly, C is a subset of columns, each assigned either white or black.

But for the placement to be maximal, any row not in R must have all its cells empty, and any column not in C must have all its cells empty.

But also, for each cell in R x C, the row and column must have different colors, so that the cell is empty. Because if they had the same color, the cell would have a chip, but then you could add a chip in a cell where the row is not in R or the column is not in C by changing the row or column's color.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

If I have some non-empty rows and non-empty columns, and the non-empty rows are all white, and the non-empty columns are all black, then every cell in R x C is empty. But then, in that case, I could add a white chip in a cell where the row is in R and the column is not in C by assigning that column to white. So, the placement isn't maximal.

Wait, perhaps the only way to have a maximal placement is that either all non-empty rows are a single color, and all non-empty columns are the same color, but that color is different. Or alternatively, all non-empty rows and all non-empty columns are the same color, but that would allow adding more chips.

Wait, maybe the maximal placements are those where either:

1. All non-empty rows are of one color, all non-empty columns are of the same color, and they are different. So, the non-empty rows are white, non-empty columns are black, or vice versa.

OR

2. All non-empty rows are of one color, and all non-empty columns are of the same color, and they are the same. But then, every cell in R x C would have a chip, making the placement non-maximal because you could add more chips by assigning more rows or columns.

Wait, perhaps the only maximal placements are those where the non-empty rows and non-empty columns are assigned different colors, or both are empty.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Suppose that the set of non-empty rows is R, and the set of non-empty columns is C. Each row in R is assigned a color, say W or B, and each column in C is assigned a color, W or B. The placement is maximal if:

- For any row not in R, you can't assign it a color without causing a conflict in its columns.

- Similarly, for any column not in C, you can't assign it a color without causing a conflict in its rows.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the only maximal placements are when all non-empty rows are white, all non-empty columns are black, or vice versa. Because in that case, any attempt to add a chip would require changing a row or column color.

Wait, let's consider an example. Suppose I have 2 white rows and 3 black columns. Then, the cells where the white rows intersect with black columns are empty. But in this case, I could add a black chip in a cell where the row is white and the column is black by changing the row's color to black. But that would change the row's color, which is not allowed because the row is already white. So, that's not possible. Wait, no, the problem says that you can't add any chip without violating the previous conditions. So, if I try to add a chip in an empty cell, I might have to change a row or column's color, which is not allowed because the conditions require that all chips in a row are the same color.

Wait, perhaps the only way to have a maximal placement is when the non-empty rows and non-empty columns are assigned different colors, and all possible cells where their colors match are filled. But in that case, you can't add any more chips because any empty cell is either in a row or column that is empty or has a different color.

Wait, perhaps the maximal condition is automatically satisfied for any assignment where the non-empty rows and non-empty columns are assigned colors such that their colors are different. Because then, any empty cell is either in an empty row or empty column, or in a row and column with different colors.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose that the non-empty rows are assigned color C_r (either W or B), and the non-empty columns are assigned color C_c (either W or B). For the placement to be maximal, C_r must not equal C_c. Because if they were equal, then any empty cell (i,j) where row i is empty and column j is non-empty could be filled by assigning row i to C_r, which is allowed, thus violating the maximal condition.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if non-empty rows and non-empty columns are assigned the same color, then you can add more chips by assigning more rows or columns to that color. Therefore, to have a maximal placement, the non-empty rows and non-empty columns must be assigned different colors.

Thus, the conditions for a maximal placement are:

1. All non-empty rows are assigned the same color, say C_r (either W or B).

2. All non-empty columns are assigned the same color, say C_c (either W or B).

3. C_r ≠ C_c.

In addition, any row not in the non-empty rows is empty, and any column not in the non-empty columns is empty.

So, the number of maximal placements is equal to the number of ways to choose:

- A subset of rows R (non-empty) with size k (where 0 ≤ k ≤5), assign them a color C_r (W or B).

- A subset of columns C (non-empty) with size l (where 0 ≤ l ≤5), assign them a color C_c (W or B), such that C_r ≠ C_c.

Plus the cases where either R or C is empty.

Wait, but if R is empty, then all rows are empty, and similarly for C. But earlier, we determined that the case where all rows and columns are empty isn't maximal because you can add a chip. So, perhaps we need to include only those cases where R and C are non-empty and C_r ≠ C_c.

Wait, let me think again. If R is empty (all rows are empty), then all cells are empty. But in that case, you can add a chip by assigning a row and a column to a color, which violates the maximal condition. So, such cases are invalid. Similarly, if C is empty, then all cells are empty, which is invalid.

Therefore, the only valid maximal placements are those where:

- R is non-empty, C is non-empty,

- All rows in R are assigned the same color C_r,

- All columns in C are assigned the same color C_c,

- C_r ≠ C_c.

So, the number of such placements is:

Number of ways to choose R (non-empty subset of rows) × 2 (choices for C_r) × number of ways to choose C (non-empty subset of columns) × 1 (since C_c must be different from C_r).

Wait, no, because once C_r is chosen (W or B), C_c must be the opposite color. So, for each choice of R and C, there are 2 possibilities: C_r = W and C_c = B, or C_r = B and C_c = W.

So, the total number of maximal placements is:

Sum over k=1 to 5 (number of ways to choose k rows) × 2 × Sum over l=1 to 5 (number of ways to choose l columns) × 1.

Wait, but for each R and C, you have 2 choices for C_r and C_c (as long as C_r ≠ C_c). So, the total number is:

2 × (2^5 -1) × (2^5 -1) = 2 × (31) × (31) = 2 × 961 = 1922.

Wait, because the number of non-empty subsets of rows is 2^5 -1=31, same for columns. For each such pair (R,C), there are 2 possible color assignments (C_r and C_c different). So, 2 ×31 ×31=1922.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Each non-empty subset R of rows can be assigned either W or B. Similarly, each non-empty subset C of columns can be assigned either W or B. But the colors must be different between R and C. So, for each pair (R,C), where R and C are non-empty, there are 2 possible color assignments: R is W and C is B, or R is B and C is W.

So, the total number is 2 × (number of non-empty R) × (number of non-empty C) = 2 ×31×31=1922.

But wait, let me check another way. The number of ways to choose R (non-empty) is 31. For each R, the number of ways to choose C (non-empty) is 31. For each such pair, there are 2 color assignments. So, total is 31×31×2=1922.

Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, what about the case where R is non-empty, C is non-empty, but C_r = C_c? In that case, the placement isn't maximal because you could add more chips by assigning more rows or columns. So, those cases are excluded because we require C_r ≠ C_c.

So, the total number of maximal placements is 1922.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I choose R as any non-empty subset of rows, and C as any non-empty subset of columns. For each such pair, I can assign R to W and C to B, or R to B and C to W. So, 2 possibilities per pair.

Therefore, the total number is 2 × (2^5 -1) × (2^5 -1) = 2 ×31×31=1922.

But wait, let me consider another scenario. Suppose R is all 5 rows, and C is all 5 columns. Assign R to W and C to B. Then, every cell where a white row intersects a black column is empty. The placement is maximal because any additional chip would require changing a row or column color, which is not allowed. So, this is a valid maximal placement.

Similarly, if R is a single row and C is a single column, assigning R to W and C to B, then the cell at their intersection is empty, and all other cells in R's row are W, and all other cells in C's column are B. The placement is maximal because you can't add any more chips without changing row or column colors.

Another example: R is 3 rows, C is 2 columns. Assign R to W, C to B. So, in R x C cells, the cells are empty. The rows in R have all W chips in their non-C columns. The columns in C have all B chips in their non-R rows. The cells where rows are R and columns are C are empty. The cells where rows are not R and columns are not C are empty because their rows and columns are empty. So, this is a valid maximal placement.

So, the calculation seems correct.

Therefore, the number of ways is 1922.

Wait, but 2^5 -1 is 31, so 31×31=961. 961×2=1922.

But wait, the problem is about placing some chips, so perhaps we need to include the cases where either R or C is empty, but earlier we determined that those cases are invalid because they are not maximal. So, only the cases where both R and C are non-empty and have different colors are valid.

Thus, the total number of valid maximal placements is 1922.

Wait, but let me check for a small grid, say 1x1.

In a 1x1 grid, how many maximal placements are there?

Possible assignments:

1. Row is W, column is W: cell has W chip. Can't add any more chips, since grid is full. So, valid.

2. Row is B, column is B: cell has B chip. Grid is full. Valid.

3. Row is W, column is B: cell is empty. But you can add a chip by changing row or column color, so this is not maximal.

4. Row is B, column is W: cell is empty. Similarly, not maximal.

5. Row is E, column is W: cell is empty. Not maximal.

6. Row is E, column is B: cell is empty. Not maximal.

7. Row is W, column is E: cell is empty. Not maximal.

8. Row is B, column is E: cell is empty. Not maximal.

9. Row is E, column is E: cell is empty. Not maximal.

So, only the two cases where the single row and column have the same color are maximal. So, for 1x1 grid, the answer is 2.

Using our formula: 2 × (2^1 -1) × (2^1 -1) = 2×1×1=2. Correct.

Another test case: 2x2 grid.

According to our formula, the number is 2 × (2^2 -1)^2 = 2×3×3=18.

Let me count manually.

Each maximal placement requires that non-empty rows and non-empty columns have different colors.

So, possible non-empty row subsets: {1}, {2}, {1,2}.

Similarly for columns.

For each pair (R,C), where R and C are non-empty, and colors are different.

For each such pair, 2 color assignments.

Number of R: 3, number of C:3. So, 3×3=9 pairs. Each has 2 color assignments: total 18.

Which matches our formula.

Thus, for 5x5 grid, the answer is 2 × (2^5 -1)^2 = 2×31×31=1922.

So, I think that's the correct answer.


The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid under specific constraints. Each row and column must be uniformly colored (white, black, or empty), and the placement must be maximal, meaning no additional chip can be placed without violating the constraints.

To solve this, we consider the following:

1. **Row and Column Assignments**: Each row and column can be assigned a color (white, black, or empty). For the placement to be maximal, the non-empty rows and columns must be assigned different colors. This ensures that all possible cells where row and column colors match are filled, and no additional chips can be placed without changing a row or column's color.

2. **Counting Valid Assignments**: We count the number of valid assignments where:
   - Non-empty rows are assigned one color (white or black).
   - Non-empty columns are assigned the opposite color.
   - Both non-empty rows and columns are non-empty.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The number of non-empty subsets of rows is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\), and similarly for columns. For each pair of non-empty row and column subsets, there are 2 possible color assignments (rows white and columns black, or rows black and columns white). Thus, the total number of valid maximal placements is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \times 31 = 1922
   \]

**Answer**: \boxed{1922}
