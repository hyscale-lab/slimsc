Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a certain property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Let me break this down step by step. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such N, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long without a strategy.

The key property is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers should be divisible by 7.

Hmm, so I need to find a number where replacing any digit with 1 makes it a multiple of 7. That seems pretty restrictive. I wonder how I can approach this without checking every four-digit number.

Let me consider each digit position and what constraints they must satisfy.

Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0.

Now, when we replace each digit with 1, the new numbers are:

1. Replace a: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this M1.
2. Replace b: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this M2.
3. Replace c: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this M3.
4. Replace d: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this M4.

Each of these M1, M2, M3, M4 must be divisible by 7.

So, M1 ≡ 0 mod 7,
M2 ≡ 0 mod 7,
M3 ≡ 0 mod 7,
M4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can write these as congruences.

1. M1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. M2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. M3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. M4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me compute each modulo 7.

First, calculate the coefficients modulo 7:

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each M in terms of modulo 7:

1. M1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. M2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7
3. M3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7
4. M4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

Our variables are a, b, c, d, each digits from 0-9, with a ≥1.

We need to find the largest N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so we should maximize a, then b, then c, then d.

So, perhaps start with a=9, then try to find b, c, d such that all four equations are satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find relationships between the equations.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod7

Simplify:

6a + 2 -6 -2b ≡ 0 mod7

6a -2b -4 ≡ 0 mod7

Let me write this as:

6a - 2b ≡4 mod7

We can divide both sides by 2, since 2 and 7 are coprime, so:

3a - b ≡ 2 mod7

So, Equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (2) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (2):

(6a + 2b + 3 + d) - (6a + 2 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod7

Simplify:

2b +3 + d -2 -3c -d ≡0 mod7

2b +1 -3c ≡0 mod7

So:

2b -3c ≡ -1 mod7

Which is same as:

2b -3c ≡6 mod7

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4.

So, multiplying both sides:

(4)(2b -3c) ≡4*6 mod7

Which is:

8b -12c ≡24 mod7

Simplify each term mod7:

8 mod7=1, 12 mod7=5, 24 mod7=3.

So:

1b -5c ≡3 mod7

Equation (6): b -5c ≡3 mod7

Hmm. So now we have Equations (5) and (6):

Equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7

Equation (6): b -5c ≡3 mod7

Let me try to express b from Equation (5):

From Equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7

Plug into Equation (6):

(3a -2) -5c ≡3 mod7

Simplify:

3a -2 -5c ≡3 mod7

So,

3a -5c ≡5 mod7

Equation (7): 3a -5c ≡5 mod7

Let me also consider Equation (4): 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

We can express b from Equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7

So, substitute into Equation (4):

6a + 2*(3a -2) +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

Compute:

6a +6a -4 +3c +1 ≡0 mod7

Combine like terms:

12a -3 +3c ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

12a mod7 is 12-7=5, so 5a.

So,

5a -3 +3c ≡0 mod7

Let me write this as:

5a +3c ≡3 mod7

Equation (8): 5a +3c ≡3 mod7

Now, from Equation (7): 3a -5c ≡5 mod7

And Equation (8):5a +3c ≡3 mod7

So now, we have two equations:

3a -5c ≡5 (Equation 7)
5a +3c ≡3 (Equation 8)

Let me write this system as:

3a -5c =5 +7k

5a +3c =3 +7m

for integers k and m.

We can solve this system using elimination or substitution.

Let me write it in matrix form:

[3  -5 |5]
[5   3 |3]

To eliminate variables, let's multiply the first equation by 5 and the second by 3.

First equation *5: 15a -25c =25 +35k

Second equation *3:15a +9c =9 +21m

Now subtract the second multiplied equation from the first:

(15a -25c) - (15a +9c) =25 +35k -9 -21m

Simplify:

0a -34c =16 +35k -21m

Which is:

-34c ≡16 mod7

But let's compute modulo7.

-34 mod7: 34 /7 is 4*7=28, 34-28=6, so -34 ≡-6≡1 mod7.

16 mod7: 16-14=2.

So, 1*c ≡2 mod7

Thus, c ≡2 mod7.

So c can be 2 or 9 (since c is a digit 0-9).

Wait, c is a digit, so possible values are c=2 or c=2+7=9.

So, c is either 2 or 9.

Let me consider both cases.

Case 1: c=2.

Then, from Equation (7): 3a -5*2 ≡5 mod7 →3a -10 ≡5 mod7 →3a ≡15 mod7 →15 mod7 is 1, so 3a ≡1 mod7.

So, 3a ≡1 mod7. Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, a ≡5*1≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit from 1-9, possible a=5 or 12, but 12 is invalid, so a=5.

So, a=5.

From Equation (5): b≡3a -2 mod7 →3*5=15≡1 mod7. So b≡1-2 mod7 →b≡-1≡6 mod7.

So b=6 or 6+7=13 (invalid). So b=6.

Now, check if these values satisfy all equations.

So far, a=5, b=6, c=2.

Now, from Equation (3): 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Compute:

6*5=30, 2*6=12, so 30+12=42, plus 3 is 45. So 45 +d ≡0 mod7.

45 mod7: 7*6=42, 45-42=3. So 3 +d ≡0 mod7 →d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So d=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So d=4.

So now, N would be 5624.

But wait, is this the largest possible? Because a=5 is not the maximum. Since we need the largest N, which is four-digit, maybe a=9 is possible.

Wait, but in Case 1, c=2, a=5. Let's see if in Case 2, c=9, we can get a higher a.

Case 2: c=9.

So c=9.

From Equation (7):3a -5*9 ≡5 mod7 →3a -45 ≡5 mod7.

45 mod7: 7*6=42, 45-42=3. So 3a -3 ≡5 mod7 →3a ≡8 mod7 →8 mod7 is 1, so 3a ≡1 mod7.

Again, multiply by 5: a≡5 mod7.

So a=5 or 12 (invalid). So a=5.

From Equation (5):b=3a -2 mod7 →3*5=15≡1 mod7. So b≡1-2=-1≡6 mod7. So b=6.

From Equation (3):6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Same as before: 6*5=30, 2*6=12. 30+12=42. 42+3=45. So 45 +d ≡0 mod7 →3 +d≡0 mod7 →d=4.

So N=5 6 9 4? Wait, no, N is 1000a +100b +10c +d. So a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 →5694.

Wait, but 5694 is larger than 5624. So, which case gives a larger N? Case 2 gives 5694, which is higher than Case 1's 5624.

But wait, can't we have a higher a? Like a=9? Because 5694 is not the highest four-digit number.

So maybe there's a mistake in assuming c must be 2 or 9. Let me think again.

Wait, when I had Equation c ≡2 mod7, c can be 2 or 9 because they are the only digits (0-9) satisfying that.

So in both cases, a=5, which is lower than 9.

So is there a way to have a higher a?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me retrace.

We had four equations, manipulated them to get relations between a, b, c, d.

From Equation (7):3a
