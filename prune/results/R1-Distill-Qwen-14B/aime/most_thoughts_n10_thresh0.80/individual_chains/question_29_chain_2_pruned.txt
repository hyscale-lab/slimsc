Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out what's going on. The problem says:

"Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. If BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184, what is the length of CE?"

Hmm. Okay, let's break this down. First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to understand the setup.

I imagine two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let's assume ABCD is a larger rectangle, and EFGH is another rectangle attached or positioned such that points D, E, C, F are on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which is interesting because that means they form a cyclic quadrilateral. That's probably going to be important.

Given the lengths: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find CE.

Let me note down the given info:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.
  - BC = 16, which is the same as AD.
  - AB = 107, which is the same as CD.
- EFGH is another rectangle.
  - FG = 17, so EH = 17 and GH = FG = 17.
  - EF = 184, so FG = 17 and GH = 17? Wait, no, EF is a side. So EF = 184, FG = 17. So EF is adjacent to FG, making EFGH a rectangle with sides 184 and 17.

Wait, no, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are the length and width. So EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17. So EFGH is a rectangle of 184 by 17.

Okay, now the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So they lie on a straight line. So line DEF... wait, D, E, C, F are collinear. So the order must be D, E, C, F or some permutation? Hmm.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That must mean that the opposite angles of quadrilateral ADHG sum to 180 degrees. Or, equivalently, the power of point applies, or perhaps some other circle theorems.

But first, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to each point to make this more concrete. Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates to rectangle ABCD. Let's say point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16.

So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (BC, 0) = (16, 0). Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So if D is (0,0), and since AB is 107, which would be the length from A to B. Hmm, maybe I should define it differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to orient the rectangle so that AB is horizontal. Let me think: Let me place point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107,0). Then, since BC is 16, moving up from B to C, which would be at (107,16). Then, point D would be at (0,16). So ABCD has coordinates:

A: (0,0)
B: (107,0)
C: (107,16)
D: (0,16)

Wait, that makes sense. So ABCD is a rectangle with length AB=10
