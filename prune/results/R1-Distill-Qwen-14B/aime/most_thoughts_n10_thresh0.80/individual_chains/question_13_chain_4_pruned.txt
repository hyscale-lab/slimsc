Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning. She usually walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes she spends in a coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, her walk time decreases to 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the total time she spends is her walking time plus the coffee shop time. But the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both scenarios, right? So, when her walking speed changes, the walking time changes, but the coffee shop time remains the same.

Let me break it down. First, when she walks at 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes the coffee shop time. So, the walking time alone must be 4 hours minus 't' minutes. But wait, 't' is in minutes, and the walking times are in hours. I should probably convert everything to the same units to make it easier.

Wait, 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So maybe converting everything into minutes would be better.

Let me try that.

So, first scenario:

Walking speed = s km/h

Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes

This includes walking time + coffee shop time (t minutes).

So, walking time = 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, in the second scenario:

Walking speed = s + 2 km/h

Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes.

Walking time here is 144 - t minutes.

Now, the distance she walks is the same in both cases, which is 9 kilometers.

So, distance = speed Ã— time. But time here is in minutes, and speed is in km per hour. Oh, right, so I need to convert the walking time from minutes to hours when using the formula.

Alternatively, I can convert
