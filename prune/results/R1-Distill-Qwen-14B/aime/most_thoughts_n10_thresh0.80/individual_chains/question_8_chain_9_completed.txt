Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving squares and products: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

First, let me write down the equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I think I can factor the second equation somehow. Let me see:

Looking at the terms, each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another different variable. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a² as a factor. Similarly for the others.

Wait, maybe I can factor a² from the first two terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Yes, that makes sense. So the second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of the total sum. Let's see:

b + c = 300 - a,
a + c = 300 - b,
a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable, but I'm not sure yet. Maybe I can expand each term:

a²*(300 - a) = 300a² - a³,
Similarly for the others.

So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor 300 out:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation?

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c = 300, (300)^2 = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So if I let S = a² + b² + c² and P = ab + ac + bc, then 90,000 = S + 2P. So S = 90,000 - 2P.

Also, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S, P, and another symmetric sum. The formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So that's 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc.

Calculating 300³: 300*300=90,000, 90,000*300=27,000,000. So a³ + b³ + c³ =27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

So now, substituting S and the expression for a³ + b³ + c³ into the equation we had earlier:

300S - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me plug in S = 90,000 - 2P:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Calculating 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000,
300*(-2P) = -600P.

So the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600P + 900P = 300P.

So we have:

300P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

So now we have:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

But we also know that S = 90,000 - 2P.

Hmm. So now I have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300.

2. 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums. Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, we have:

x + y + z = 300,

and

100(xy + xz + yz) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of this as a cubic equation. Let me see.

If I let t be a variable, then the cubic equation with roots x, y, z would be t³ - (x + y + z)t² + (xy + xz + yz)t - xyz = 0.

Which would be t³ - 300t² + Pt - abc = 0.

But from our previous equation, 100P - abc = 2,000,000. So abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Substituting that into the cubic equation:

t³ - 300t² + Pt - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

t³ - 300t² + Pt - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor out P? Let's see:

t³ - 300t² + P(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can write it as:

t³ - 300t² + P(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Alternatively, maybe express P from the equation:

From 100P - abc = 2,000,000, we have P = (2,000,000 + abc)/100.

So P = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

But since P is ab + ac + bc, which is an integer because a, b, c are integers, (abc)/100 must also be an integer. Therefore, abc must be a multiple of 100.

So abc = 100k, where k is an integer. Then P = 20,000 + k.

So now, our cubic equation becomes:

t³ - 300t² + (20,000 + k)t - (100k) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Simplify:

t³ - 300t² + 20,000t + kt - 100k + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor terms with k:

t³ - 300t² + 20,000t + k(t - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I can think of this differently. Let me try to think of possible values for a, b, c.

Since a, b, c are non-negative integers adding to 300, and they have to satisfy that other equation. Let me see if I can think of a, b, c being equal or something. Suppose all of them are equal. Then a = b = c = 100. Let me check if that satisfies the second equation.

Compute a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b.

Each term would be 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the second equation! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Which makes sense.

But the question is, are there other solutions? Or is this the only one?

Wait, maybe not. Let me see.

Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and the third is different. Let me set a = b = k, then c = 300 - 2k.

Let me substitute into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

Since a = b = k, this becomes:

k²k + k²c + k²k + k²c + c²k + c²k.

Simplify:

2k³ + 2k²c + 2c²k.

Factor:

2k(k² + k c + c²).

But c = 300 - 2k.

So substituting, we have:

2k [k² + k(300 - 2k) + (300 - 2k)^2].

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

k² + 300k - 2k² + (90,000 - 1200k + 4k²).

Simplify term by term:

k² - 2k² +4k² = 3k².

300k -1200k = -900k.

Then the constant term is 90,000.

So the entire expression becomes:

2k (3k² -900k + 90,000).

So that is 2k*(3k² -900k +90,000).

We can factor out 3:

2k *3*(k² - 300k + 30,000) = 6k (k² - 300k + 30,000).

So the second equation is equal to 6k(k² - 300k + 30,000) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6:

k(k² - 300k + 30,000) = 1,000,000.

So k³ - 300k² +30,000k -1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation for integer k. Let me see if I can find integer roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so integer divisors of 1,000,000. That's a lot, but perhaps I can test some.

First, try k=100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000.

= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000.

= 1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 =0.

So k=100 is a root. So (k -100) is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide k³ -300k² +30,000k -1,000,000 by (k -100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000     -1,000,000

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.

Multiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.

Multiply 10,000 by 100: 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.

So the cubic factors as (k -100)(k² -200k +10,000).

Now, set (k² -200k +10,000)=0.

Discriminant: (200)^2 -4*1*10,000=40,000 -40,000=0. So a double root at k= (200)/2=100.

So the equation factors as (k -100)^2(k -100)= (k-100)^3=0.

So k=100 is the only solution.

Therefore, the only solution in this case is a=b=100, c=100. So that's the same as the earlier case where all three are 100.

So in this symmetric case, that's the only solution.

But maybe when a, b, c are not all equal or two equal. Maybe when all are distinct.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a symmetric function and express variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the equation as:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Which can be written as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) =6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c, etc.

So substituting:

ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) =6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc.

So this becomes:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

Set equal to 6,000,000:

300P - 3abc =6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - abc=2,000,000.

Which is the same as before.

So now, we have that 100P - abc=2,000,000.

And from the first equation, a + b + c=300.

So, we can think of this as a system:

a + b + c =300,

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc=2,000,000.

I wonder if I can express this in terms of a variable substitution. Let me set x = a, y = b, z = c.

Then, the equations are:

x + y + z =300,

100(xy + xz + yz) - xyz =2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation. Let me rearrange:

xyz -100(xy + xz + yz) +2,000,000=0.

We can write this as:

xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz +2,000,000=0.

Hmm, maybe factor by grouping.

Let me factor terms:

xyz -100xy -100xz -100yz +2,000,000=0.

I can factor xy(z -100) -100z(x + y) +2,000,000=0.

But z =300 -x - y, so let's substitute z as 300 -x - y.

So, substituting:

xy(300 -x - y -100) -100(300 -x - y)(x + y) +2,000,000=0.

Simplify:

xy(200 -x - y) -100(300 -x - y)(x + y) +2,000,000=0.

Let me compute each term.

First term: xy(200 -x - y).

Second term: -100*(300 -x - y)*(x + y).

Let me compute the second term.

Let me denote s = x + y, and t = xy.

Then, 300 -x - y = 300 - s.

So the second term becomes -100*(300 - s)*s.

So:

First term: t*(200 - s).

Second term: -100*(300 - s)*s.

So overall, equation becomes:

t*(200 - s) -100*(300 - s)*s +2,000,000=0.

But s =x + y, t =xy.

But I also know that z =300 - s.

So, maybe I can express in terms of s and t.

Wait, but I have two variables s and t, but I can write another relation: for two variables x and y, the relation is t =xy. So, given s and t, the discriminant must be non-negative: s² -4t ≥0.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me think differently.

I can write the equation in terms of s and t:

t*(200 - s) -100*(300 - s)*s +2,000,000=0.

Let me expand this:

200t - t s -30,000 s +100 s² +2,000,000=0.

Rearranged:

- t s +200 t +100 s² -30,000 s +2,000,000=0.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express t in terms of s.

From t =xy, and s =x + y, we have that t ≤ (s²)/4, since the maximum product of two numbers with a fixed sum is when they're equal.

But not sure if that helps.

Wait, let me try to express the equation:

- t s +200 t +100 s² -30,000 s +2,000,000=0.

Factor terms with t:

t(-s +200) +100 s² -30,000 s +2,000,000=0.

So, t = [ -100 s² +30,000 s -2,000,000 ] / ( -s +200 )

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator: -100 s² +30,000 s -2,000,000.

Factor numerator: let's factor -100:

-100(s² -300 s +20,000).

Denominator: -s +200 = -(s -200).

So t = [ -100(s² -300 s +20,000) ] / [ -(s -200) ].

Simplify negatives:

t = [100(s² -300 s +20,000)]/(s -200).

So, t = 100*(s² -300 s +20,000)/(s -200).

Hmm, let's perform polynomial division on the numerator s² -300 s +20,000 divided by (s -200).

Divide s² -300 s +20,000 by s -200.

Using polynomial long division:

s -200 ) s² -300 s +20,000

First term: s² / s = s. Multiply (s -200) by s: s² -200 s.

Subtract: (s² -300 s) - (s² -200 s) = (-300 s +200 s) = -100 s.

Bring down +20,000.

Next term: -100 s /s= -100. Multiply (s -200)*(-100)= -100 s +20,000.

Subtract: (-100 s +20,000) - (-100 s +20,000)=0.

So the division gives s -100, with no remainder.

Therefore, s² -300 s +20,000 = (s -200)(s -100).

So, t =100*(s -200)(s -100)/(s -200).

Cancel (s -200) terms, assuming s ≠200.

So, t =100*(s -100).

So t=100(s -100).

But t=xy, and s =x + y.

So, we have that:

xy =100(x + y -100).

Hmm, this is an equation in x and y. Let me write it as:

xy =100x +100y -10,000.

Rearranged:

xy -100x -100y +10,000=0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

Add 10,000 to both sides:

xy -100x -100y =-10,000.

Add 10,000 to both sides:

xy -100x -100y +10,000=0.

Now, factor:

(x -100)(y -100)=0.

Wait, let me check:

(x -100)(y -100)=xy -100x -100y +10,000.

Yes, exactly. So (x -100)(y -100)=0.

This implies that either x=100 or y=100.

So, either x=100 or y=100.

Wait, so in this case, either a=100 or b=100.

Because x and y are a and b.

So, going back, either a=100 or b=100.

Let me consider two cases:

Case 1: a=100.

Then, from a + b + c=300, we have b + c=200.

Also, from the second equation:

100P - abc=2,000,000.

But since a=100, let's compute P and abc.

P=ab + ac + bc=100b +100c + bc=100(b +c) + bc=100*200 + bc=20,000 + bc.

abc=100*b*c.

So substituting into 100P - abc=2,000,000:

100*(20,000 + bc) -100 bc=2,000,000.

Compute:

200,000 +100 bc -100 bc=2,000,000.

Simplify:

200,000=2,000,000.

Wait, that can't be. 200,000=2,000,000? That's not true.

Hmm, that suggests that when a=100, we end up with an impossible equation. So that implies that a cannot be 100.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my substitution.

Wait, when a=100, then P=ab + ac + bc=100b +100c + bc.

Which is 100(b +c) + bc. Since b +c=200, that's 100*200 + bc=20,000 + bc. That's correct.

abc=100*b*c.

So 100P - abc=100*(20,000 + bc) -100 bc=2,000,000.

So 100*20,000=2,000,000, 100 bc -100 bc=0. So 2,000,000=2,000,000. Which is an identity.

Wait, so it's 2,000,000=2,000,000. So that equation doesn't give any new information. So in this case, when a=100, the equation is automatically satisfied.

Which means that any triple where a=100 and b +c=200 will satisfy both equations. Similarly, if b=100 or c=100.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried setting a=b=100, I ended up with only a solution when all were 100. But wait, now I'm getting that if a=100, then regardless of b and c (as long as b +c=200), it satisfies the second equation. So that suggests there are many solutions where one of a, b, c is 100.

Wait, but that can't be, because when I set a=100, b and c can be anything adding up to 200, so that would give many solutions. But when I checked the case where a=b=100, I only got c=100 as a solution. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me go back. When I assumed two variables equal, like a=b=k, then c=300-2k, and ended up with only k=100 as a solution. So in that case, all variables must be 100. But in the current analysis, when a=100, regardless of b and c, as long as b +c=200, it satisfies the equation. So is this a contradiction?

Wait, perhaps I need to check whether when a=100, b and c can be arbitrary. Let me take an example:

Suppose a=100, b=0, c=200. Then, let's check the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Compute each term:

100²*0 =0,

100²*200=10,000*200=2,000,000,

0²*100=0,

0²*200=0,

200²*100=40,000*100=4,000,000,

200²*0=0.

So total is 0 +2,000,000 +0 +0 +4,000,000 +0=6,000,000. So that works.

Similarly, take a=100, b=100, c=100. That's the all 100 case, which also works.

Take another example: a=100, b=50, c=150.

Compute the second equation:

100²*50=10,000*50=500,000,

100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000,

50²*100=2,500*100=250,000,

50²*150=2,500*150=375,000,

150²*100=22,500*100=2,250,000,

150²*50=22,500*50=1,125,000.

Adding all together:

500,000 +1,500,000=2,000,000,

250,000 +375,000=625,000,

2,250,000 +1,125,000=3,375,000.

Total: 2,000,000 +625,000=2,625,000; 2,625,000 +3,375,000=6,000,000.

Yes, that works too.

Wait, so when a=100, any b and c such that b +c=200 will satisfy the equation. So, in that case, the number of triples where a=100 is equal to the number of non-negative integer solutions to b +c=200, which is 201 (since b can be 0 to 200, inclusive). Similarly, if b=100, then a +c=200, which also gives 201 solutions. Similarly, if c=100, then a +b=200, which also gives 201 solutions.

But wait, but when a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted in all three cases. So, the total number of triples would be 201 +201 +201 -3*1 +1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. When a=100, we get 201 triples. Similarly for b=100 and c=100, each also gives 201. But the triple where a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted three times, once in each case. The other triples are unique because in each case, only one variable is fixed at 100, and the other two vary.

So, the total number of distinct triples would be 3*(201) - 3*(1) +1. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, each of the cases a=100, b=100, c=100 includes the triple (100,100,100). So, if I just add them up, I get 3*201, which counts (100,100,100) three times. The other triples are unique because in each case, only one variable is fixed at 100. So the number of distinct triples is 3*(201 -1) +1. Because for each case, the variable is fixed at 100, and the other two vary, but the triple where all are 100 is counted three times. So:

Total = 3*(200) +1 = 601.

Wait, let me check that.

When a=100, the number of triples is 201, including (100,100,100). Similarly, when b=100, another 201, including (100,100,100). When c=100, another 201, including (100,100,100). So the total count is 3*201, which is 603, but we have to subtract the duplicates.

The triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, so we subtract 2 duplicates to get 603 -2=601.

Alternatively, think of it as 3*(200) (for each case, subtracting the one duplicate triple) plus 1 for the triple itself. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another way: For each variable fixed at 100, we have 201 triples, but the intersection of all three cases is only the triple (100,100,100). So using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - (number with a=100 and b=100) - (number with a=100 and c=100) - (number with b=100 and c=100) + (number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

Compute each term:

Number with a=100:201,

Same for b=100 and c=100: each 201.

Number with a=100 and b=100: c=300 -200=100, so only 1 triple.

Similarly, number with a=100 and c=100: b=100, only 1 triple.

Number with b=100 and c=100: a=100, only 1 triple.

Number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100:1 triple.

So applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total=201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

So, 601 distinct triples where at least one variable is 100.

But wait, are these the only solutions?

Earlier, when I assumed two variables are equal and ended up only with (100,100,100), but now, by setting a=100, we get a lot more solutions.

So, perhaps all solutions are those where at least one variable is 100.

But to confirm, let me assume that one variable is 100, and see if all solutions satisfy that.

Wait, let me suppose that in a solution, none of the variables is 100. Then, what happens?

Suppose a ≠100, b ≠100, c ≠100.

Then, from earlier, we had (x -100)(y -100)=0, which implies x=100 or y=100. So, if none of a, b, c is 100, then this would be a contradiction.

Therefore, any solution must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Therefore, all solutions are those where at least one variable is 100. So the total number of solutions is 601, as computed above.

Wait, but earlier when I set a=100, b=100, c=100, I had the case where all are 100, but in the inclusion-exclusion, I accounted for that. So, 601 is the correct number.

Wait, but let me check another example. Suppose a=100, b=150, c=50.

Compute the second equation:

a²b=10000*150=1,500,000,

a²c=10,000*50=500,000,

b²a=22500*100=2,250,000,

b²c=22500*50=1,125,000,

c²a=2500*100=250,000,

c²b=2500*150=375,000.

Adding all together:

1,500,000 +500,000=2,000,000,

2,250,000 +1,125,000=3,375,000,

250,000 +375,000=625,000.

Total:2,000,000 +3,375,000=5,375,000; 5,375,000 +625,000=6,000,000. So that works.

So, yeah, it seems that whenever one variable is 100, the second equation is satisfied.

Therefore, the only solutions are the ones where at least one variable is 100.

So, the number of such triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier I got 601, but let me recount.

Each case where a=100: b +c=200, so 201 solutions.

Same for b=100: a +c=200, 201.

Same for c=100: a +b=200, 201.

Total without considering overlaps: 201*3=603.

But the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, so we need to subtract 2 to get 601.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer is 601.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When a=100, b can vary from 0 to200, and c=200 -b. Similarly for the other cases. So, in each case, 201 solutions. So, 3*201=603, but we have to subtract the duplicates.

How many duplicates? The triple (100,100,100) is counted in all three cases, so it's subtracted twice to count once.

So 603 -2=601.

Yes, that's correct. So, the number of triples is 601.

But wait, the problem says nonnegative integers, so 0 is allowed. So, for example, a=100, b=0, c=200 is allowed, which is one of the 201 in the a=100 case.

So, yes, 601 seems correct.

But wait, let me check another example. Suppose a=100, b=0, c=200. Then the second equation gives 6,000,000, as computed earlier. So that's valid.

Another example: a=100, b=1, c=199.

Compute the second equation:

a²b=10000*1=10,000,

a²c=10,000*199=1,990,000,

b²a=1*100=100,

b²c=1*199=199,

c²a= (199)^2 *100=39601*100=3,960,100,

c²b= (199)^2 *1=39601.

Adding all together:

10,000 +1,990,000=2,000,000,

100 +199=299,

3,960,100 +39601=4,000, (wait, 3,960,100 +39,601=4,000, (3,960,100 +39,601)=3,999,701? Wait, 3,960,100 +39,601=3,999,701? Let me compute that:

3,960,100 +39,601:

3,960,100 +30,000=3,990,100,

3,990,100 +9,601=3,999,701.

So total is 2,000,000 +299 +3,999,701=2,000,000 +3,999,701=5,999,701 +299=6,000,000.

Yes, so that works.

So, this shows that all triples where a=100, b +c=200 satisfy the second equation. Therefore, the total number of such triples is 601.

Thus, the answer is 601.


The number of triples is 601. 

$\boxed{601}$
