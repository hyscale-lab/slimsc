Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I have to place some of them in a 5x5 grid (so 25 cells total). Each cell can hold at most one chip. Now, the conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions.

Hmm, okay. So, each row and each column has chips of a single color. But I don't have to fill all cellsâ€”some might be empty. And the last condition means that the arrangement is maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules.

Wait, so each row is either all white, all black, or empty? No, wait, if a row is non-empty, then all chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So, each row is either entirely white, entirely black, or empty? But wait, if a row has any chips, they all must be the same color. Same for columns.

But wait, there's a catch. Because if a row is white, then every column that intersects this row must have all its chips white as well. Otherwise, you'd have a column with both white and black chips, which violates the second condition.

Wait, so if a row is white, then every column that has a white chip in that row must also be entirely white. Similarly, if a row is black, all columns intersecting that row's black chips must be entirely black.

This seems to suggest that the grid is divided into blocks of same-colored regions, where each region is a rectangle, and all rows and columns within this rectangle are of the same color.

Hmm, maybe it's simpler than that. Let me think.

Suppose I decide that each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But then, the intersection of a white row and a black column would have a conflict, because the cell at their intersection would have to be both white (due to the row) and black (due to the column). So that's impossible. Therefore, if a row is white, all columns that intersect this row must be white as well. Similarly, if a row is black, all intersecting columns must be black.

Wait, but that's too restrictive. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose I have a row that's white. Then, for each cell in that row, the column containing that cell must be entirely white. So, if any cell in a column is white, the entire column must be white. Similarly, if any cell in a column is black, the entire column must be black.

Wait, so the rows and columns can't have mixed colors. So, if a row is partially filled with white, the entire row must be white. Similarly, if a column is partially filled with white, the entire column must be white. But wait, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, that means that any non-empty row must have all its chips the same color, and same for columns.

So, that suggests that the grid must be such that each non-empty row is monochromatic, and each non-empty column is monochromatic. And furthermore, if a cell is white, then its entire row and column must be white. Because otherwise, you could add a chip of another color in the same row or column, which would violate the condition.

Wait no, the condition is that all chips in a row have the same color. So, for any non-empty row, all chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So, if a row has even one chip, all chips in that row are same color. Similarly for column.

Wait, but you can have an empty row or column. So, for example,
