Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Looking back to equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.

If I add equation 1 and equation 4:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/2) + (13/12)

Simplify left side:

a - a cancels. -b - b = -2b. -c - c = -2c.

Right side: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12 =19/12.

So, -2b - 2c = 19/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

b + c = -19/(12*2) = -19/24.

So, equation 5: b + c = -19/24.

Similarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c =1/3.

Add equation 2 and equation 4:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/3) + (13/12)

Left side: -a -a = -2a; b - b = 0; -c - c = -2c.

So, -2a -2c = 1/3 +13/12.

Compute right side: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12=17/12.

So, -2a -2c =17/12.

Divide by -2:

a + c = -17/(12*2) = -17/24.

So equation 6: a + c = -17/24.

Similarly, let's take equation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.

Add equation 3 and equation 4:

(-a - b + c) + (-a - b - c) = (1/4) + (13/12)

Left side: -a -a = -2a; -b -b = -2b; c -c =0.

So, -2a -2b= 1/4 +13/12.

Right side: 1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +13/12=16/12=4/3.

So, -2a -2b=4/3.

Divide by -2:

a + b= -4/(3*2) = -2/3.

So equation 7: a + b= -2/3.

Now, now, so we have equations 5,6,7:

5. b + c = -19/24

6. a + c = -17/24

7. a + b = -2/3

Our goal is to find a, b, c.

Let me see. Let's write these equations:

Equation 5: b + c = -19/24

Equation 6: a + c = -17/24

Equation 7: a + b = -2/3

So, perhaps we can subtract equation 6 from equation 5.

Equation5 - equation6:

(b + c) - (a + c) = (-19/24) - (-17/24)

Simplify:

b - a = (-19 +17)/24 = (-2)/24 = -1/12.

So, equation8: b - a= -1/12.

But equation7 is a + b = -2/3.

So now, we have equation7 and equation8:

7. a + b = -2/3

8. b - a = -1/12

Let me add equations7 and8:

(a + b) + (b -a) = (-2/3) + (-1/12)

Simplify:

a -a cancels, b +b=2b.

Right side: (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4.

So, 2b= -3/4 --> b= -3/8.

So, b= -3/8.

Now, from equation8: b -a= -1/12.

We have b= -3/8, so:

-3/8 - a = -1/12.

Let me solve for a.

- a = (-1/12) +3/8.

Convert to common denominator, which is 24.

-1/12 = -2/24, 3/8 =9/24.

So, (-2 +9)/24=7/24.

So, -a=7/24 --> a= -7/24.

So, a= -7/24.

Now, from equation7: a + b= -2/3.

Check: a= -7/24, b= -3/8= -9/24.

Sum: (-7 -9)/24= -16/24= -2/3. Correct.

Now, let's find c.

From equation6: a + c= -17/24.

a= -7/24, so:

-7/24 +c= -17/24.

So, c= (-17/24) +7/24= (-10/24)= -5/12.

So, c= -5/12.

Let me verify with equation5: b + c= (-3/8) + (-5/12).

Convert to 24 denominator:

-3/8= -9/24, -5/12= -10/24.

Sum: -19/24. Which matches equation5.

Good.

So, now, we have a= -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

Now, we need to compute 4a +3b +2c.

Let me compute each term:

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

So, sum all:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, let's find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have LCM 24.

Convert each:

-7/6= -28/24.

-9/8= -27/24.

-5/6= -20/24.

Add them together:

-28 -27 -20 = -75.

So, -75/24.

Simplify: 75 and 24 share a factor of 3. 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8.

So, -25/8.

Taking absolute value: | -25/8 | =25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Therefore, m=25, n=8, which are coprime.

Hence, m +n=25+8=33.


The given system of equations in terms of logarithms can be converted into a linear system by letting \( a = \log_2(x) \), \( b = \log_2(y) \), and \( c = \log_2(z) \). This results in:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \\
-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \\
-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]

We then solve for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) by manipulating these equations. After finding \( a = -\frac{7}{24} \), \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \), and \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \), we compute \( 4a + 3b + 2c \):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]

Converting to a common denominator and simplifying, we find:

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \( \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to \( m + n = 33 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{33}\).
