Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. So, given an integer b that's at least 2, a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers that satisfy this condition.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's formalize what it means for a number n to be b-eautiful.

In base b, a two-digit number is written as "ab" where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, the problem uses n as the number, so maybe I should use different letters to avoid confusion. Let's say the two digits are 'a' and 'c'. So the number n in base b is written as ac, which translates to a*b + c in decimal.

Given that, the conditions are:
1. n = a*b + c
2. a + c = sqrt(n)

Also, since it's a two-digit number in base b, the first digit 'a' can't be zero. So, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

So, substituting the second condition into the first, we have:
n = a*b + c
a + c = sqrt(n)
So, sqrt(n) = a + c
Therefore, n = (a + c)^2

So, substituting back into the first equation:
(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

So, now I have an equation involving a, c, and b. Since a and c are digits in base b, a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.

Let me rearrange the equation to see if I can express it in terms of a and c.

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c
Expanding the left side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let's bring all terms to one side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

I can rearrange terms:
a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. For given b and c, we can solve for a. But since a and c are digits in base b, they have to be integers within specific ranges.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this in terms of c and b, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Alternatively, since both a and c are digits, and their sum is sqrt(n), which is (a + c), which must be an integer because n is a perfect square. So, (a + c) must be an integer, meaning that sqrt(n) is an integer. That makes sense because n is expressed as (a + c)^2.

Wait, so n is a perfect square, and the sum of its digits in base b is equal to its square root.

So, for each base b, we can find all two-digit numbers in base b which are perfect squares, and whose digits sum to their square roots.

So, the approach might be: for each base b starting from 2 upwards, count how many two-digit numbers in base b satisfy n = (a + c)^2 and n = a*b + c. Then, find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Hmm, that seems computationally intensive, but perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Let me consider the equation again: (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for b:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c
=> a*b = (a + c)^2 - c
=> b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, the right-hand side must be an integer.

So, for given a and c, b must be equal to [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

But a and c are digits in base b, so a < b and c < b.

Wait, but if we express b in terms of a and c, perhaps for each a and c, we can compute b and see if it's valid (i.e., a < b and c < b). Then, for each b, we can count how many (a, c) pairs result in that b.

Alternatively, perhaps for each b, we can iterate over possible a and c values and check if the equation holds.

But since b can be large, it's better to find a way to parameterize this.

Let me try to express b in terms of a and c.

From above, b = [(a + c)^2 - c
