Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a pretty big number, but I guess it's manageable. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the problem. We're dealing with three variables: a, b, and c. They are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward—it's a linear equation where the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. It involves quadratic terms multiplied by linear terms, so it's a bit more challenging.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can factor or simplify the second equation. Let me look for common factors or patterns.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So, the entire equation can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, from the first equation, I know that (b + c) is equal to (300 - a), because a + b + c = 300. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b and (a + b) = 300 - c. So, substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That seems a bit more manageable. Let's write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

I can expand each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, that's an interesting form. Maybe I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation. Let me recall that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c = 300, then (300)^2 = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc). 

Let me note that down:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, substituting back into our equation:

300(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute 300 * 90,000 first: 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

Then, 300 * (-2(ab + ac + bc)) is -600(ab + ac + bc).

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Bring the 27,000,000 to the other side:

-600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000
-600(ab + ac + bc) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:

600(ab + ac + bc) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so now we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

I wonder if I can relate this to some known algebraic identity. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc). But I don't see a direct connection here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to factor it differently or find a common term.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider symmetric sums. Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + ac + bc, and S3 = abc. Perhaps expressing the equation in terms of S1, S2, S3 can help.

Wait, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3.

Yes, let's confirm that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). Wait, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, the expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

Wait, that's the same as the second equation in the problem. Let me check:

From the problem, we have:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Wait, so if I plug that into the expansion:

300^3 = (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc.

So, 27,000,000 = (a³ + b³ + c³) + 18,000,000 + 6abc.

So, rearranging:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc.

Wait, but earlier, from the equation we derived, we had:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

So, substitute a³ + b³ + c³ from here:

(9,000,000 - 6abc) + 600(ab + ac + bc) = 21,000,000.

So, 9,000,000 - 6abc + 600S2 = 21,000,000.

Let me subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

-6abc + 600S2 = 12,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6 to simplify:

-abc + 100S2 = 2,000,000.

Thus,

100S2 - abc = 2,000,000.

Or,

abc = 100S2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm, interesting. Now, S2 is ab + ac + bc. So, I have an equation involving S1, S2, and S3.

We already know S1 = 300, S2 is ab + ac + bc, and S3 = abc.

So, in terms of symmetric sums, we have:

abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Which is S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000.

So, S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000.

Now, I have two equations:

1. S1 = 300
2. S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000

I wonder if I can find another equation involving S1, S2, and S3 to solve for these variables.

Wait, I know that in symmetric polynomials, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - S1x² + S2x - S3 = 0. Since S1, S2, S3 are symmetric sums.

So, the polynomial would be x³ - 300x² + S2x - S3 = 0.

But I also have S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000, so substituting that in:

x³ - 300x²
