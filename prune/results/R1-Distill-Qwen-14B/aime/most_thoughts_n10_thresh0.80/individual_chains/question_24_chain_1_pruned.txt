Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll tackle each property one by one and see how they can help me figure out what the list looks like.

Starting with the first property: the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, they should total 30.

The second property says that the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, no other number can appear as many times as 9.

The third property is a bit tricky: the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. For example, if there are 5 numbers, the third one is the median. If the median is a positive integer but isn't in the list, that means it's a number that sits right in the middle of the sorted list but isn't actually present. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me think about how these properties can work together.

First, since 9 is the mode, it has to appear at least twice, right? Well, actually, more than any other number, so if all other numbers appear once, 9 just needs to appear twice. But if another number appears twice, then 9 has to appear three times to be the unique mode.

So, the number of times 9 appears in the list is crucial. Let's denote the number of 9s as k. Since it's the mode, k must be greater than the count of any other number.

Now, the median not being in the list suggests that the number of elements in the list is even. Wait, no, actually, wait. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, which would be in the list. But if the median isn't in the list, that implies that the number of elements is even because the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which may not be an integer or may not be present. Or wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer. So, the median is an integer, but it's not in the list. So, that must mean that the number of elements is even, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer, but neither of the two middle numbers is that integer. Wait, that would require the two middle numbers to average to an integer, but that integer isn't present.

Alternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer not present in the list. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is in the list as the mode. So that might not work. Alternatively, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, the average is 9, which is in the list as the mode. Hmm, but that's still 9. So, the median is 9, but 9 is in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So that can't be. So, perhaps the two middle numbers average to a number that isn't 9, but that number isn't in the list.

Wait, let me think again. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is in the list, so that's not allowed. If the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, median is 9, again in the list. So, that's not good. What if the two middle numbers are 8 and 9? Then the median is 8.5, which is not an integer, so that's not allowed because the median has to be a positive integer. So, that's not possible. So, perhaps if the two middle numbers are both 9, the median is 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.

Wait, maybe the list has an even number of elements, but the two middle numbers are different, and their average is an integer not present in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is in the list. So that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, if the two middle numbers are 6 and 12, their average is 9, which is in the list. Hmm. So, that's still not good because the median is 9, which is present.

Wait,
