Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it out.

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and the candy hearts. So, four items in total.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And all 900 own candy hearts.

Additionally, we know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is to find how many own all four.

Hmm. This seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up their individual sizes, subtracting the intersections, adding back in the intersections of three sets, and so on.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things. So maybe I can use that information to find the number owning all four.

Let me think about the variables involved. Let's denote:

- D = number of people owning diamond rings = 195.
- G = number owning golf clubs = 367.
- S = number owning garden spades = 562.
- C = number owning candy hearts = 900 (since everyone owns this).

But wait, C is the total number of residents, so everyone owns at least one thing, right? Because the candy hearts are given to all.

We also know:
- The number of people owning exactly two items = 437.
- The number owning exactly three items = 234.
- Let x be the number of people owning all four items.

We need to find x.

I think we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but since each person owns at least one thing, the total number of owners across all items is equal to the total number of residents, which is 900.

Wait, actually, each person can own multiple things, so the sum of the individual counts (D + G + S + C) will be greater than 900 because people can own multiple items. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since everyone owns at least C, which is candy hearts, then the union |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is just 900. So:

900 = D + G + S + C - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (sum of triple intersections) - (all four intersection).

But I think this might get complicated because I don't know the individual pairwise or triple overlaps. However, I do know the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three items.

Wait, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437. The number owning exactly three is 234. And the number owning all four is x.

Hmm, maybe I can express the sum of all pairwise intersections in terms of these values. Let me think.

Each person owning exactly two items contributes to exactly one pairwise intersection. For example, a person who owns D and G but nothing else contributes to |D ∩ G|. Similarly, someone who owns D and C but nothing else also contributes to |D ∩ C|.

But wait, since everyone owns at least C, because C is the candy hearts which everyone
