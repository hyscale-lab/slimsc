Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down.

Let me write down what's given. So, log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. I remember that logarithms can be manipulated using certain properties. Maybe I can rewrite these equations in terms of exponents or use the change of base formula to simplify them.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I recall that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that here, it would be x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, okay, so that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10. Maybe I can express this in a different base to make it easier. I know that log_x(y) is equal to ln(y)/ln(x) where ln is the natural logarithm. So substituting that in, x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10.

Wait a second, maybe I can let’s say, let’s denote a = log_x(y). Then the first equation becomes a = 10 / x. Because from the first equation, x * a = 10, so a = 10/x. But a is log_x(y), which is also equal to ln(y)/ln(x). So, ln(y) = a * ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x). That might be useful later.

Now moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Similarly, log_y(x) is equal to ln(x)/ln(y). So substituting, we have 4y * (ln(x)/ln(y)) = 10.

Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations:

1. ln(y) = (10/x) * ln(x)
2. 4y * (ln(x)/ln(y)) = 10

Let me see. Maybe I can substitute ln(y) from the first equation into the second one. From equation 1, ln(y) = (10/x) * ln(x). So, ln(x)/ln(y) would be ln(x) divided by (10/x)*ln(x), right?

Let me compute that. ln(x)/ln(y) = ln(x) / [(10/x) * ln(x)] = (ln(x)) / [(10 ln(x))/x] = (ln(x)) * (x)/(10 ln(x)) ) = x/10. Oh, that's nice! So, ln(x)/ln(y) simplifies to x/10.

So, substituting back into equation 2: 4y * (x/10) = 10. Let me write that:

4y * (x/10) = 10

Simplify this equation. Multiply 4y and x/10:

(4xy)/10 = 10

Simplify 4/10 to 2/5:

(2xy)/5 = 10

Now, multiply both sides by 5:

2xy = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

xy = 25

Wait, so that's the answer? Because the problem is asking for xy, and I just found that xy is 25. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converted to x * log_x(y) = 10. Let a = log_x(y), so a = 10/x. Then, ln(y) = (10/x) ln(x). That seems correct.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Converted to 4y log_y(x) = 10. Then, log_y(x) = ln(x)/ln(y). So 4y*(ln(x)/ln(y)) = 10. Then I substituted ln(y) from the first equation, which gave me ln(x)/ln(y) = x/10. Substituted that into the second equation, leading to (4y)*(x/10) =10. Then 4xy/10=10, simplifies to 2xy=50, so xy=25.

Everything seems to check out. So, the product of x and y is 25.


We are given that $\log_x(y^x) = 10$ and $\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10$. Using logarithmic properties, we rewrite these equations:

1. $\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10$ implies $\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}$.
2. $\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10$ implies $\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}$.

Using the change of base formula, $\log_x(y) = \frac{\ln(y)}{\ln(x)}$ and $\log_y(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)}$. Let $a = \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}$, so $\ln(y) = a \cdot \ln(x) = \frac{10}{x} \cdot \ln(x)$.

Substituting $\ln(y)$ into the second equation, we find $\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(y)} = \frac{x}{10}$. Plugging this into $4y \cdot \frac{x}{10} = 10$, we get:

\[
\frac{4xy}{10} = 10 \implies \frac{2xy}{5} = 10 \implies 2xy = 50 \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the product of $x$ and $y$ is $\boxed{25}$.
