Alright, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n, and I need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. So, each coloring has a probability of (1/2)^8, which is 1/256.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Wait, so essentially, we need that after some rotation, every blue vertex is where a red vertex was before, and every red vertex is where a blue was. Hmm.

Wait, actually, no. Let me re-read the problem: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, perhaps it's about mapping the blue vertices to the red positions. That is, the rotated octagon's blue vertices must align with the original red vertices.

But the octagon is regular, so rotations can be by multiples of 45 degrees. So, the possible rotations are 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which correspond to rotating the octagon by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. So, each rotation can be considered as shifting the vertices by k positions, where k is from 0 to 7.

So, for a given coloring, we need to check if there's a rotation (i.e., a shift by k positions) such that every blue vertex in the original coloring is moved to a position that was originally red. Alternatively, that the set of blue vertices is a shifted version of the set of red vertices.

Wait, so if we let R be the set of red vertices and B be the set of blue vertices, then the condition is that B is a rotation of R, meaning that B = R + k mod 8 for some k.

But in this problem, R and B are complements since every vertex is either red or blue. So, R = V \ B
