Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe like a regular one but not necessarily. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, a convex hexagon means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of the sides cross each other. It's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length, but not necessarily regular since the angles might not be equal.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is probably a type of hexagon similar to a regular one but stretched or compressed in certain directions. Maybe it's affine-regular? I remember that affine transformations can turn a regular hexagon into one where opposite sides are parallel but the sides aren't equal in all directions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. So, if I imagine the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are like translations of each other because they're parallel. Extending these sides would form a triangle outside the hexagon.

Maybe I can model this using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try to visualize it. Let's label the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA as the sides. Since it's convex and equilateral, each side has the same length, let's say 's'.

Opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Let's think about how these extensions would intersect.

Wait, AB and CD are not adjacent sides. AB is the first side, CD is the third side. Extending AB and CD, which are opposite sides, they should meet at a point. Similarly, extending CD and EF (which is opposite to BC) should meet at another point, and extending EF and AB should meet at the third point, forming the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps AB is extended, CD is extended, and EF is extended, each in a way that their extensions intersect to form the triangle. So each of these extended sides is a side of the triangle.

Let me try to think of this triangle as being similar to the hexagon but scaled up. Since the hexagon is equilateral with all sides length 's', the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Maybe the sides of the triangle relate to the sides of the hexagon through some scaling factor.

Wait, perhaps I can model the hexagon as a centrally symmetric figure. In such a case, the hexagon can be thought of as formed by translating each side by some vector. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle, with each side of the hexagon being a portion of the triangle's sides. So, the triangle's sides are longer than the hexagon's sides, and the hexagon is sort of 'cut out' from the triangle.

Wait, I remember something called the "outer triangle" or "extended triangle" for a convex polygon like this. Let me think. If you have a convex polygon with opposite sides parallel, extending the sides will form a triangle, and the hexagon is somehow related to this triangle.

I think there's a theorem or formula that relates the side length of such a hexagon to the sides of the triangle formed by the extensions. Let me try to recall or derive it.

Suppose each side of the hexagon is 's'. Since opposite sides are parallel, the translation vectors between them must be the same. So the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same. Wait, but in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distances between opposite sides might not necessarily be the same unless it's regular.

But in this case, the triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 24
