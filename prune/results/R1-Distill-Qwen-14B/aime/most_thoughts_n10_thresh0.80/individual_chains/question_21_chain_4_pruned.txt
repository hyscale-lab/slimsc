Alright, so I have this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is written in base b, it must have exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6+3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

Our goal is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, we need to find the minimal b where the count of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.

Let me start by breaking down the problem. First, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b.

In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. Importantly, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, n = d1 * b + d0, where 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits d1 + d0 equals the square root of n. So, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n = d1 * b + d0, we can substitute that in:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can reorganize the terms:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of variables. Let me let s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Then, since n = s², and also n = d1*b + d0, we have:

d1*b + d0 = s²

But since s = d1 + d0, we can write:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Let me write this as:

d1*b + d0 = d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0²

Rearranging:

d1*b = d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d0

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is helpful yet.

Alternatively, maybe express b in terms of the digits.

From n = d1*b + d0 = s², and s = d1 + d0, so:

d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2

Let me solve for b:

b = [ (d1 + d0)^2 - d0 ] / d1

Because:

d1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0

So,

b = [ (d1 + d0)^2 - d0 ] / d1

Simplify numerator:

= [ d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d0 ] / d1

= d1 + 2*d0 + (d0² - d0)/d1

Hmm, since b must be an integer, the entire expression must evaluate to an integer.

Therefore, (d0² - d0) must be divisible by d1.

So, (d0² - d0) mod d1 = 0.

Which implies that d1 divides (d0² - d0). So, d1 | d0*(d0 - 1)

Given that d0 is between 0 and b-1, and d1 is between 1 and b-1, but since we can write b in terms of d1 and d0, perhaps we can find constraints on d1 and d0.

Let me think about it.

We can consider that d0 is a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1.

Similarly, d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1.

But since b is expressed in terms of d1 and d0, we might need to find possible d1 and d0 such that b is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and then check how many such numbers exist for each b.

Alternatively, maybe fix d1 and d0, compute b, and then count how many (d1, d0) pairs give the same b.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10. So, for each b, we need to find how many n satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count is more than 10.

Alternatively, for each base b, we can
