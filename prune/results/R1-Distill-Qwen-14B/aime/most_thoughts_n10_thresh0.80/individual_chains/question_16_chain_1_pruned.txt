Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I also need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem is asking about primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. So, my goal is to find the smallest such prime p. I remember that primes dividing numbers of the form n⁴ + 1 have some specific properties. Let me recall what I know about primes and equations like n^4 + 1.

I remember that primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8 are important here because 4 is a power, and the exponent relates to the modulus. For example, if p is a prime that divides n⁴ + 1, then the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. For this to happen, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. 

Wait, what's a quartic residue? A number a is a quartic residue modulo p if there exists some x such that x⁴ ≡ a mod p. So, in this case, a is -1. For -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 modulo p must divide (p-1)/4, I think. Alternatively, it might be related to the multiplicative order.

Alternatively, another approach is to look at the multiplicative group modulo p, which is cyclic of order p-1. So, for -1 to be a fourth power, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. Let's think about the group structure.

The multiplicative group mod p has order p-1, which is cyclic. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2. Wait, maybe I should think about the order of x⁴. Hmm, maybe not. Let me recall that for an equation x^k ≡ a mod p to have a solution, the order of a must divide (p-1)/gcd(k, p-1).

Wait, perhaps another way: the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that x^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x modulo p divides 8. So, the order must be a divisor of 8, but x^4 ≡ -1 implies that the order is exactly 8, because if the order were 1, 2, or 4, then x^4 would be 1, not -1. So, for x to satisfy x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the multiplicative group mod p must have an element of order 8. Therefore, the multiplicative group must have order divisible by 8, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 can have solutions to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But wait, is that sufficient? Or is it also necessary? Let me think. If p ≡ 1 mod 8,
