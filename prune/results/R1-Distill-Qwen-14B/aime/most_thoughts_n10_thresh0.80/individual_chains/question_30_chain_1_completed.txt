Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That's probably going to be useful.

Now, the product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or simplify each term somehow.

Let me first look at each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Wait, ω^{2k} is (ω^k)^2. So the term becomes 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. Let me write that as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

Let me consider it as a quadratic equation: x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back, each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Now, that's interesting because I can split the product into two separate products: product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, so I have two products. Each is the product of (ω^k - α) for k from 0 to 12, where α is either (1 + i) or (1 - i). I remember that for roots of unity, the product over all roots of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^n - 1. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is cyclotomic, but maybe I can use that here.

Wait, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. So, if I set x to (1 + i), then the product product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, for (1 - i), it would be (1 - i)^13 - 1.

So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-(1 + i) - ω^k*(-1)) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i + ω^k) ) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i + ω^k). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things here.

Wait, no, actually, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. So, if I have a = (1 + i), then product_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for (1 - i).

But in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-(1 + i) - (ω^k*(-1))). Wait, maybe I should factor out a negative sign. Let me think.

Each term is ω^k - (1 + i) = -( (1 + i) - ω^k ). So, the entire product becomes (-1)^13 times product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ). Since (-1)^13 is -1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].

Similarly, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

Therefore, the original product is equal to [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

Simplify that: (-1) * [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * (-1) * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

So, the product is [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

Now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I recall that (1 + i) can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i *13 * π/4}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13 first.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, let's compute the exponents of e^{i * 13π/4} and e^{-i *13π/4}.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 3*2π is 6π, but wait, 13π/4 is 3.25π. Hmm, but angles are periodic modulo 2π, so let me subtract 2π to bring it within 0 to 2π.

13π/4 = 3π + π/4. 3π is more than 2π, so subtract 2π: 3π + π/4 - 2π = π + π/4 = 5π/4. Wait, no, 3π is 3/4 of 4π, maybe another way.

Wait, 13 divided by 4 is 3.25, so 3.25π radians. Since 2π is a full circle, subtract 2π: 3.25π - 2π = 1.25π, which is 5π/4. So, e^{i*13π/4} = e^{i*(5π/4)}.

Similarly, e^{-i*13π/4} = e^{-i*(5π/4)}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4)].

Compute cos(5π/4) and sin(5π/4). 5π/4 is in the third quadrant, so both cosine and sine are negative. cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ) ].

Let me compute that:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (2)/2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.

Wait, but wait, that's just for the real part. Hmm, maybe I should compute this step by step.

Wait, 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) = 64 * (- 2 / 2 ) = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly for the imaginary part, same result. So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ) ].

Wait, let me compute that:

(1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) ] = 64*sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].

So, that's 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) + i *64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2).

Compute each part:

First part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64*(2)/2 = -64.

Second part: 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(2)/2 = 64.

So, (1 - i)^13 = (-64) + 64i.

Now, let me plug these into our expression:

[ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = (-64 -64i) - 1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = (-64 + 64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So, the product is (-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.

Compute that: (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2). Since i^2 = -1, it becomes 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it step by step to make sure.

Alternatively, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a = -65, b = 64i.

So, (-65)^2 = 4225, (64i)^2 = 4096 * i² = -4096.

Thus, 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, so the product is 8321.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that calculation.

Compute (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i):

First, multiply the real parts: (-65)*(-65) = 4225.

Then, the outer: (-65)*(64i) = -4160i.

Inner: (-64i)*(-65) = +4160i.

Last: (-64i)*(64i) = -4096i² = -4096*(-1) = +4096.

So, adding all together: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.

The -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving 4225 + 4096 = 8321. So, that's correct.

So, the original product is 8321.

Wait, but the problem says "the remainder when ... is divided by 1000." So, I need to compute 8321 mod 1000.

8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Therefore, the answer is 321.

But wait, let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Expressed each term as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

2. Split the product into two products, each being product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - alpha), where alpha is 1+i and 1-i.

3. Recognized that product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 -1.

4. Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (alpha - ω^k) = alpha^13 -1.

5. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - alpha) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} (alpha - ω^k) = - (alpha^13 -1).

6. Therefore, each product is - ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) and - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ).

7. Multiplied them together, getting [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] [ (1-i)^13 -1 ].

8. Computed (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 using polar forms, got -64 -64i and -64 +64i.

Wait, wait, hold on. When I computed (1 + i)^13, I got -64 -64i, but let me double-check that because (1+i) has a modulus of sqrt(2), and when raised to 13th power, it's (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*13π/4}.

Wait, (sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Then, 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to 5π/4 after subtracting 2π. So, yeah, e^{i*5π/4} is cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*5π/4} = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].

Multiplying these together: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64 for the real part. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i.

Then, subtracting 1: [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ] = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Multiplying these: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.

So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but I just thought of something. When I considered product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 -1, that's correct because ω is a primitive 13th root. So, product_{k=0}^{12}(x - ω^k) = x^13 -1.

But in our case, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - alpha) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( - (alpha - ω^k) ) = (-1)^13 product_{k=0}^{12} (alpha - ω^k) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (alpha - ω^k) = - (alpha^13 -1).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, all steps check out.

Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that each term in the product can be factored as a quadratic in ω^k. The product can then be expressed in terms of roots of unity, leading to the evaluation of complex numbers raised to the 13th power. After simplifying, we find the product equals 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

The final answer is:

\boxed{321}
