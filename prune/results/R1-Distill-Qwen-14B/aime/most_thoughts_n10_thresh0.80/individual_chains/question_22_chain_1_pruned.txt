Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. The problem says that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all its sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. This usually means that the hexagon can be inscribed in a larger triangle, with each pair of opposite sides extending to form the sides of that triangle. So, in this case, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is given, with sides 200, 240, and 300.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three smaller parallelograms inside the triangle. Each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are sides of these parallelograms, and since the hexagon is equilateral, all these smaller sides are equal.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides is length 's'. Now, the triangle that's formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. This triangle must be similar to the smaller triangles that are formed inside it because of the parallel sides.

I think I should assign variables to the lengths from the triangle's vertices to the points where the extensions meet. Let me denote the points where AB, CD, and EF meet when extended as points P, Q, and R. So, triangle PQR has sides PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300.

Now, in this setup, the sides of the hexagon are the sides of three smaller similar triangles within PQR. Each of these smaller triangles is similar to PQR because their sides are parallel. Let me denote the scaling factors for these smaller triangles as 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Then, the sides of these smaller triangles would be a*200, a*240, a*300; b*200, b*240, b*300; and c*200, c*240, c*300.

Wait, actually, maybe I should think in terms of the hexagon's sides forming segments that are parallel and proportional to the triangle's sides. Let me consider that the hexagon's sides are each 's', and the extensions lead to the larger triangle.

Another approach is to use affine transformations because the opposite sides are parallel, which suggests the hexagon can be thought of as a scaled-down version of the triangle, with each side of the triangle divided into segments. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a centrally symmetric hexagon. But wait, is that the case? Well, central symmetry would mean that each vertex has an opposite vertex, but in this case, since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, it
