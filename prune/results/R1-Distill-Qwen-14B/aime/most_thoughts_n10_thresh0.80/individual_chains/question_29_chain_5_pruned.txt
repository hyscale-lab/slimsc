Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the problem. Let me think about how the rectangles might be placed. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. So, points D and E are on one side, and C and F are on the line extending from them.

Both ABCD and EFGH are rectangles. So, ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA, and EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Given that AB=107 and BC=16, that makes ABCD a rectangle with sides of 107 and 16. Similarly, EF=184 and FG=17, so EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17.

Now, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. Maybe that property can help here.

But first, let me try to figure out the positions of these rectangles. Since D and E are collinear with C and F, and the rectangles are ABCD and EFGH, I think E must be next to D on the line DC. So, the line DC has points D, E, C, F in order. Hmm, but wait, I need to confirm the exact order. It could be D, E, C, F or another order—maybe E is between D and C? Or C is between D and E? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to assign coordinates to make it clearer.

Let's assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16, then the coordinates can be determined.

In rectangle ABCD:
- Point D is at (0,0).
- Since BC=16 and AB=107, moving from D, which is (0,0), to C would be along the x-axis, so C is at (16,0). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if AB=107 and BC=16, then AD=BC=16 and DC=AB=107.

Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is another. So, if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then the sides are 107 and 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), since DC is equal to AB. Then, point B would be at (107,16), and point A at (0,16). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I should re-define the rectangle. Let me think: in rectangle ABCD, points are labeled in order, so AB is a side, BC is the next, CD is the next, and DA is the last. So, if AB is 107, then BC is 16, CD is 107, and DA is 16.

So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0). Then, since BC is 16, moving up from C, point B is at (107,16). Then, moving left from B to A, which is 107 units, so A would be at (0,16). That makes sense.

So:
- A: (0,16)
- B: (107,16)
- C: (107,0)
- D: (0,0)

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D (0,0), E, C (107,0), F are on the same line, which is the x-axis in my coordinate system.

So, E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis. Now, rectangle EFGH: EF is a side, FG is another. Given EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is one side, length 184, FG is another side, length 17.

So, if I place E on the x-axis, then F must be somewhere. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, which is a horizontal or vertical line? Well, in a rectangle, sides are perpendicular. So, if EF is a horizontal line, then FG would be vertical.

Wait, but E and F are on the x-axis, so EF is along the x-axis. Then FG must be vertical. So, if E is at (x,0), then F would be at (x+184,0), since EF=184. Then, from F, moving up 17 units, point G would be at (x+184,17), and then moving left 184 units, point H would be at (x,17). So, rectangle EFGH has coordinates:
- E: (x, 0)
- F: (x+184, 0)
- G: (x+184,17)
- H: (x,17)

Now, the line EC is on the x-axis, from E (x,0) to C (107,0). So, the length of CE is |107 - x|, which is what we need to find.

But we also have the condition that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (x,17), and G (x+184,17) all lie on a circle.

So, the four points are (0,16), (0,0), (x,17), and (x+184,17). Let's see if these four points lie on a circle.

To find if four points lie on a circle, we can use the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. If all four points satisfy the equation, then they lie on the same circle.

So, let's plug each point into the equation and set up equations.

First, point D (0,0):
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Next, point A (0,16):
(0)^2 + (16)^2 + 2g(0) + 2f(16) = 0 ⇒ 256 + 32f = 0 ⇒ 32f = -256 ⇒ f = -8.

So, now the equation is x² + y² + 2gx -16y = 0.

Now, let's plug in point H (x,17):

x² + (17)^2 + 2g(x) -16(17) = 0 ⇒ x² + 289 + 2gx - 272 = 0 ⇒ x² + 2gx + 17 = 0.

Similarly, plug in point G (x+184,17):

(x+184)^2 + 17^2 + 2g(x+184) -16*17 = 0.

Let me compute this:

(x+184)^2 + 289 + 2g(x+184) - 272 = 0.

Simplify:

(x² + 368x + 184²) + 289 + 2gx + 368g -272 = 0.

Compute 184²: 184*184. Let me calculate that:

180² = 32400, 4²=16, so 180² + 2*180*4 +4² = (180+4)^2 = 184² = 33856.

So, expanding:

x² + 368x + 33856 + 289 + 2gx + 368g - 272 = 0.

Combine constants:

33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 -272 = 33873.

So, the equation becomes:

x² + 368x + 33873 + 2gx + 368g = 0.

Now, from point H, we had:

x² + 2gx + 17 = 0. Let me note that as equation (1).

From point G, we have equation (2): x² + 368x + 33873 + 2gx + 368g = 0.

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate x² and 2gx:

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

( x² + 368x + 33873 + 2gx + 368g ) - (x² + 2gx + 17) ) = 0 - 0.

Simplify:

368x + 33873 + 368g -17 = 0 ⇒ 368x + 368g + 33856 = 0.

Divide both sides by 368:

x + g + 33856 / 368 = 0.

Compute 33856 / 368:

Let me compute 368 * 92 = 368*(90+2)= 368*90=33120, 368*2=736; sum is 33120+736=33856. So, 33856 /368=92.

So, equation becomes:

x + g +92 = 0 ⇒ x + g = -92 ⇒ g = -92 -x.

Now, go back to equation (1):

x² + 2gx +17 = 0.

Substitute g = -92 -x:

x² + 2*(-92 -x)*x +17 = 0 ⇒ x² -184x -2x² +17 =0.

Simplify:

x² -184x -2x² +17 = 0 ⇒ -x² -184x +17 =0 ⇒ Multiply both sides by -1:

x² +184x -17 =0.

Now, solve for x using quadratic formula:

x = [-184 ± sqrt(184² +4*1*17)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184² = 33856

4*1*17=68

So, sqrt(33856 +68) = sqrt(33924).

What's sqrt(33924)? Let me see:

184^2=33856, 185^2=34225.

So, 33924 is between them.

Compute 184.5^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.5^2=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25, which is larger than 33924.

Wait, maybe 184.2^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.2 + 0.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64. Hmm, that's larger than 33924.

Wait, maybe 184.1^2: 33856 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1^2=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81.

Still less than 33924.

Wait, 184.1^2=33892.81, 184.2^2=33929.64. So, 33924 is between these.

Compute 33924-33892.81=31.19.

So, the sqrt is 184.1 + (31.19)/(2*184.1) ≈ 184.1 + 0.085 ≈184.185.

So, x ≈ [ -184 ±184.185 ] /2.

We have two solutions:

x = [ -184 +184.185 ] /2 ≈ (0.185)/2≈0.0925

x = [ -184 -184.185 ] /2 ≈ (-368.185)/2≈-184.0925

Now, let's think about x. Since E is on the x-axis between D (0,0) and C (107,0), or maybe beyond. So, x could be less than 0 (to the left of D) or between 0 and 107, or greater than 107 (to the right of C). But considering the rectangle EFGH, EF=184, so if E is at x, then F is at x+184. So, if E is at x≈0.0925, F is at approximately 184.0925, which is beyond point C at 107. Alternatively, if E is at x≈-184.0925, then F would be at x+184≈-184.0925+184≈-0.0925, which is to the left of D (0,0).

So, we have two possibilities for E: approximately 0.0925 or approximately -184.0925.

But let's check which one makes sense in terms of the problem. The problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if E is at 0.0925, then F is at 184.0925, which is to the right of C (107,0). Alternatively, if E is at -184.0925, F is at -0.0925, which is just left of D.

But in either case, both E and F would lie on the line DC (the x-axis). So, both possibilities are geometrically valid, but we need to see which one fits the other condition that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Wait, but maybe both are possible, but we need to check if both solutions make sense with the rest of the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them will result in a valid rectangle EFGH where H and G lie such that the circle passes through A, D, H, G.

Wait, but let me think about the coordinates:

If x is approximately 0.0925, then E is very close to D (0,0), and F is far to the right at around 184.0925. Then, H is at (x,17) ≈ (0.0925,17), and G is at (x+184,17) ≈ (184.0925,17).

Alternatively, if x is approximately -184.0925, then E is far to the left of D, F is just left of D at (-0.0925,0). Then, H is at (-184.0925,17), and G is at (x+184,17)= (-184.0925+184,17)= (-0.0925,17).

So, in both cases, the rectangles are placed either to the right or left of D.

But wait, the problem says that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Maybe both configurations are possible, but perhaps only one of them satisfies the circle condition.

Wait, but we already used the four points to find x and g, so both x=0.0925 and x=-184.0925 are solutions. But in reality, only one of them would place E between D and C or vice versa.

But let's think again: in the problem statement, it's only said that D, E, C, F are collinear. It doesn't specify the order. So, perhaps E is between D and C or beyond C. Similarly, F can be beyond E or beyond C.

Wait, but if E is at x≈0.0925, then F is at x+184≈184.0925, which is beyond C (107,0). So, in this case, the order would be D (0,0), E (≈0.0925), C (107,0), F (≈184.0925).

Alternatively, if E is at x≈-184.0925, then F is at x+184≈-0.0925, which is left of D (0,0). So, the order would be F (≈-0.0925), E (≈-184.0925), D (0,0), C (107,0).

But in terms of the problem statement, it's only given that D, E, C, F are collinear. It doesn't specify which order, so both could be possible.

But perhaps the problem expects a positive CE length, so regardless of E's position, CE is either 107 - x or x -107, depending on whether E is to the left or right of C.

Wait, but CE would be the distance between C and E, which is |107 - x|.

So, if x≈0.0925, then CE≈107 -0.0925≈106.9075.

If x≈-184.0925, then CE≈107 - (-184.0925)≈291.0925.

But which one is correct? I think maybe only one of these makes sense because the rectangle EFGH must be placed in such a way that the points H and G lie on the circle with A and D.

Wait, but the circle passes through A (0,16), D (0,0), H (x,17), and G (x+184,17). So, regardless of where E is placed, we might have two possible circles, but given the problem's constraints, perhaps only one is valid.

Wait, but in reality, the problem is constructed such that E is between D and C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is on the extension beyond C.

Wait, let me think about the rectangle EFGH. If E is to the left of D, then F would be to the left of E, which might complicate the position of F relative to C. Alternatively, if E is to the right of C, F is further right, which could also be okay.

But perhaps the problem is set up so that E is between D and C. Let me try both possibilities.

Case 1: x ≈0.0925, so E is just right of D (0,0). So, points on the x-axis: D (0,0), E (0.0925,0), C (107,0), F (184.0925,0). So, in this case, rectangle EFGH is to the right of E.

Case 2: x≈-184.0925, so E is far left, and F is just left of D. Then, points on the x-axis: F (-0.0925,0), E (-184.0925,0), D (0,0), C (107,0). So, EFGH is to the left of E.

But in terms of the circle passing through A, D, H, G, both configurations might be possible, but perhaps only one is feasible because point H would be either to the right or left.

Wait, but let's think about the circle passing through A (0,16), D (0,0), H (x,17), and G (x+184,17). If H is at (0.0925,17), then G is at (184.
