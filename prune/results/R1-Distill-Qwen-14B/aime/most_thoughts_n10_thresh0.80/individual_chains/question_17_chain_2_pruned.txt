Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area (S) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume (V) is xyz. So, in this problem, S = 54 and V = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to touch the farthest corners of the box, the radius would be half of the space diagonal. So, the radius r is half the square root of (x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints of surface area and volume. So, I need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² with the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but since it's three variables, maybe there's a symmetric solution? Or perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third and substitute.

Let me denote S = x² + y² + z². Our target is to find the minimum S.

Given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so xy + yz + xz = 27. And xyz = 23.

I remember that for three variables, there are some inequalities that relate the sum of squares, sum of products, and the product. Maybe I can use the inequality that relates these terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other. Let me think: if I fix two variables, can I express the third?

For instance, from the volume equation: z = 23/(xy). Then, plug this into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify: xy + 23/(x) + 23/(y) = 27.

Hmm, that might get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, I can consider the problem in terms of symmetric variables. Let’s assume that the box is a cube. Wait, but a cube would have x = y = z. Let me check if that’s possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27, but the volume here is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't the solution here. Therefore, the minimal sphere probably doesn't correspond to a cube.

Hmm, okay. So, let's think again. Maybe the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal. Let me assume that y = z. Then, we can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let’s set y = z, so the problem becomes:

Surface area: 2(xy + y² + x y) = 2(2xy + y²) = 54 => 2xy + y² = 27.

Volume: x y² = 23 => x = 23/(y²).

Substitute x into the surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²)) * y + y² = 27

Simplify:

46/y + y² = 27

Multiply both sides by y to eliminate the denominator:

46 + y³ = 27 y

Bring all terms to one side:

y³ - 27 y + 46 = 0

Hmm, now I have a cubic equation in y. Let's see if I can find rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing y=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46, +46 is 0. So y=2 is a root.

So, (y - 2)(y² + 2y -23) =0.

The quadratic equation y² + 2y -23 =0 can be solved with y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6). Since y must be positive, y = -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ 3.146.

So, the possible y values are 2 and approximately 3.146. Let me check if y=2 is valid.

If y=2, then x = 23/(2²) = 23/4 = 5.75. So, x=5.75, y=z=2.

Then, S = x² + y² + z² = (5.75)^2 + 2*(2)^2 = 33.0625 + 8 = 41.0625. So S = 41.0625, which is 657/16. So r² = 657/(16*4) = 657/64 ≈ 10.2656.

Alternatively, for y = -1 + 2 sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.146. Let's compute x.

x = 23/(y²) = 23 / [(-1 + 2 sqrt(6))²].

Compute denominator: (-1 + 2 sqrt(6))² = 1 - 4 sqrt(6) + 24 = 25 -4 sqrt(6).

So x = 23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):

x = [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/[(25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2] = [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/[625 - 96] = [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/529.

Simplify 23/529: 529 is 23 squared, so 23/529 = 1/23. So x = (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So x ≈ (25 + 4*2.449)/23 ≈ (25 + 9.796)/23 ≈ 34.796/23 ≈ 1.513.

So, x ≈ 1.513, y = z ≈ 3.146.

Now, compute S = x² + y² + z² = 1.513² + 2*(3.146)^2 ≈ 2.289 + 2*(9.879) ≈ 2.289 + 19.758 ≈ 22.047.

Wait, that's significantly smaller than the previous S of 41.0625. So, this suggests that when y = -1 +2 sqrt(6), we get a smaller S.

But wait, I assumed y = z, but is that assumption valid? Maybe the minimal S occurs when y = z, but I'm not sure. Perhaps the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal, but maybe it's when all variables are equal, but as we saw, that gives a larger S. Wait, no, in the cube case, S was 9*3=27, but in the other case, S was around 22, which is smaller. So, perhaps my assumption of y = z led me to a better solution.

Wait, but if I set y = z, but the minimal S is achieved when all variables are equal. Hmm, conflicting results. So, perhaps I need to consider whether the minimal S occurs when y = z or not.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the problem.

We need to minimize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z²

Subject to two constraints:

g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

and

h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23

Since we have two constraints, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x: 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, ∂L/∂y: 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z: 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0

2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0

3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y = 0

4. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

5. xyz = 23

This looks complicated, but maybe we can find ratios between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2 to see if x = y.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z - [2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z] = 0

Simplify:

2x -2y -2λ(y + z - x - z) - μ(y z - x z) = 0

Which becomes:

2(x - y) -2λ(y - x) - μ z (y - x) = 0

Factor (x - y):

(x - y)[2 + 2λ + μ z] = 0

So, either x = y, or 2 + 2λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 and equation 3:

2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z - [2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y] = 0

Simplify:

2y - 2z -2λ(x + z - x - y) - μ x (z - y) = 0

Which becomes:

2(y - z) - 2λ(z - y) - μ x (z - y) = 0

Factor (y - z):

(y - z)[2 + 2λ + μ x] = 0

So, either y = z, or 2 + 2λ + μ x = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 and equation 3 would yield similar results.

So, from these, either two variables are equal, or some other conditions hold. Let's assume that two variables are equal, say x = y, and see if that leads us somewhere.

If x = y, then what? Let me denote x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, the constraints become:

Surface area: 2(a^2 + a b + a b) = 2(a² + 2 a b) = 54 => a² + 2 a b = 27.

Volume: a^2 b = 23 => b = 23/(a²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

a² + 2 a*(23/(a²)) = 27 => a² + 46/a = 27

Multiply both sides by a: a³ + 46 = 27 a => a³ -27 a +46=0.

Wait, this is the same cubic equation as before when I set y = z. So, same scenario. So, when x = y, we get a cubic equation for a, which we've already solved, and found a=2 and a=-1 +2 sqrt(6).

So, in this case, for x = y, the minimal S occurs at a = -1 +2 sqrt(6), leading to a lower S as we saw earlier.

Alternatively, suppose all three variables are equal, but we saw that in that case the volume is 27, but we need 23, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, suppose x, y, z are all different.

But it's complicated to handle all three variables. Perhaps the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal, as that's a common case in optimization problems.

So, if we proceed under the assumption that two variables are equal, then we can find the minimal S.

Earlier, when we set y = z, we found that S can be as low as approximately 22.047. Let me compute it exactly.

So, when y = z, and we have y = -1 + 2 sqrt(6), then x = (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, let me compute x² + 2 y².

x² = [(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2 = (625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 16*6)/529 = (625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 96)/529 = (721 + 200 sqrt(6))/529.

y² = (-1 + 2 sqrt(6))² = 1 -4 sqrt(6) + 24 = 25 -4 sqrt(6).

So, 2 y² = 50 -8 sqrt(6).

So, S = x² + 2 y² = (721 + 200 sqrt(6))/529 + 50 -8 sqrt(6).

Convert 50 and 8 sqrt(6) into fractions over 529:

50 = 50 * 529 /529 = 26450/529.

-8 sqrt(6) = (-8 sqrt(6)) *529 /529 = -4232 sqrt(6)/529.

So, S = [721 + 200 sqrt(6) + 26450 -4232 sqrt(6)] /529.

Combine like terms:

200 sqrt(6) -4232 sqrt(6) = -4032 sqrt(6).

721 +26450 = 27171.

So, S = (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Wait, but 27171 divided by 529: Let me see, 529 *50 = 26450, so 27171 -26450 = 721. So, 27171 = 529*51 + 721 -529*1=?

Wait, 529*51=529*50 +529=26450 +529=26979. 27171-26979=192. So, 27171=529*51 +192.

So, 27171 /529=51 + 192/529. 192 and 529: 529 is 23², 192 is 64*3. 64 and 23 are coprime, 3 and 23 are coprime, so 192/529 is reduced.

Similarly, 4032 sqrt(6)/529: Let's see if 4032 and 529 have common factors. 529 is 23², 4032 ÷23: 4032 ÷23= 175.3, which is not an integer. So, 4032/529 is reduced.

So, S = (51 + 192/529) - (4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Wait, that's not very helpful. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check.

Wait, no, actually, that's correct. But it's a bit messy. Maybe instead of assuming y=z, perhaps there's a smarter substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of symmetric inequalities. Let me think.

We know that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds: (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since we know xy + yz + xz =27, then (x + y + z)^2 = S + 54.

But I don't know x + y + z, so not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM >= GM on x, y, z.

We have AM = (x + y + z)/3 >= (xyz)^(1/3) = (23)^(1/3). So, x + y + z >= 3*(23)^(1/3). But I don't see how this directly helps with S.

Wait, another thought. Maybe using the inequality between quadratic mean and arithmetic mean.

The quadratic mean of x, y, z is sqrt((x² + y² + z²)/3) = sqrt(S/3). The arithmetic mean is (x + y + z)/3. So, sqrt(S/3) >= (x + y + z)/3.

But again, not sure how to connect to the known values.

Wait, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. (x² + y² + z²)(1 +1 +1) >= (x + y + z)^2. So, 3 S >= (x + y + z)^2. But we also have (x + y + z)^2 = S +54. So, 3 S >= S +54 => 2 S >=54 => S >=27.

Wait, that's interesting. So, according to Cauchy-Schwarz, S must be at least 27. But from our earlier calculation when y = z, we found S ≈22, which is less than 27. That contradicts the inequality. So, that suggests that my earlier assumption may be wrong, or perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the Cauchy-Schwarz step again. The inequality is (x² + y² + z²)(1 +1 +1) >= (x + y + z)^2. So, 3S >= (x + y + z)^2. But earlier, we have (x + y + z)^2 = S + 2(xy + yz + xz) = S +54. So, substituting, 3S >= S +54 => 2S >=54 => S >=27. So, S must be at least 27.

But earlier calculation gave me S ≈22, which is less than 27. That's impossible. Therefore, my earlier assumption that y = z must be invalid because it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the minimal S is indeed 27, achieved when x + y + z is minimized, but given the constraints, perhaps the minimal S is 27.

Wait, but wait, Cauchy-Schwarz gives a lower bound; it doesn't necessarily mean that the bound is achievable. So, perhaps the minimal S is 27, but in reality, due to the constraints of surface area and volume, maybe S can't reach 27. So, the minimal S is higher than 27.

Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

If S >=27, but when I assumed y = z, I found a solution with S ≈22, which is lower than 27. That suggests that either my assumption was wrong, or my calculation was wrong.

Wait, let me recalculate S when y = z and y = -1 +2 sqrt(6).

Earlier, I found y ≈3.146, x ≈1.513.

Compute S = x² + 2 y².

x² ≈ (1.513)^2 ≈2.289.

y² ≈ (3.146)^2 ≈9.879.

So, 2 y² ≈19.758.

Add them:
