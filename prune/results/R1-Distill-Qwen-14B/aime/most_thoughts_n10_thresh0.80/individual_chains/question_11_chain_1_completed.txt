Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before diving in. The problem is about finding the largest possible real part of a complex expression. Let me write it down again to have it clear:

We need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm, okay. So \( z \) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 centered at the origin in the complex plane. The expression involves both \( z \) and its reciprocal \( 1/z \). I remember that for a complex number \( z \), \( 1/z \) can be expressed as \( \overline{z}/|z|^2 \) when \( z \neq 0 \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( |z|^2 = 16 \), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/16 \).

Let me note that down: \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

So, substituting this into the original expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)\frac{\overline{z}}{16}
\]

Simplify the second term:

\( 96/16 = 6 \) and \( 144/16 = 9 \), so the expression becomes:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + 6(9 + 24i)\overline{z}
\]

Wait, no, let me check that again. 96/16 is indeed 6, and 144/16 is 9. So, the second term is \( (96 + 144i)\overline{z}/16 = (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z}
\]

Hmm, okay. Now, since \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) in polar form. Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Then, \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let me compute the coefficients first:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4 = 300 + 468i \)
\( (6 + 9i) \times 4 = 24 + 36i \)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, now I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me recall that for any complex number \( w = a + bi \), \( Re(w) = a \). Also, for a complex exponential, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's expand each term:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each separately.

Compute the first term:

Multiply \( (300 + 468i) \) with \( (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Using distributive property:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

Since \( i^2 = -1 \):

= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Now, group real and imaginary parts:

Real: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

Similarly, compute the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Multiply out:

\( 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta -36i^2\sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= \( 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta +36\sin\theta \)

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: \( 24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary: \( -24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta \)

Now, sum the real parts of both terms and the imaginary parts of both terms, but since we're interested in the real part of the entire expression, let's focus on the sum of the real parts.

So, total real part:

= [300cosθ -468sinθ] + [24cosθ +36sinθ]

Combine like terms:

= (300 +24)cosθ + (-468 +36)sinθ
= 324cosθ -432sinθ

Hmm, so the real part of the entire expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

We need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \).

I remember that an expression of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) (or something like that, depending on the signs). The maximum value of this expression is then \( R \).

Wait, but in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). So, let me write it as \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \), where \( a=324 \) and \( b = -432 \).

Then, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

Compute \( a^2 = 324^2 \). Let me compute that:

324 × 324. Hmm, 300²=90000, 24²=576, and cross term 2×300×24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300² + 2×300×24 +24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104,976.

Similarly, \( b^2 = (-432)^2 = 432². Let me compute that:

400²=160000, 32²=1024, cross term 2×400×32=25600. So, (400+32)^2 = 400² + 2×400×32 +32² = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000+25600=185,600 +1024=186,624.

So, \( a^2 + b^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \).

So, \( R = \sqrt{291,600} \). Let me compute that.

Well, 540² = (500 +40)^2 = 500² + 2×500×40 +40² = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So, R=540.

Hence, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't confuse the formula. The expression is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \). The maximum value of this is indeed R, because the maximum of cos is 1. So, yeah, the maximum real part is R=540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Expressed \( z =4e^{i\theta} \), correct.

2. Substituted into the expression: correct.

3. Calculated each term separately, expanded, grouped real and imaginary parts: correct.

4. Added the real parts from both terms: 324cosθ -432sinθ: correct.

5. Recognized that expression can be written as a single sinusoid with amplitude R, computed R as sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600)=540: correct.

Yeah, that seems solid. So the maximum real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we start by expressing \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). The reciprocal \( 1/z \) becomes \( \frac{\overline{z}}{16} = \frac{4e^{-i\theta}}{16} = \frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4} \).

Substituting \( z \) and \( 1/z \) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4}
\]
Simplifying the coefficients:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Expanding each term using \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), we compute the real parts:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]
To maximize this expression, we recognize it as \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) with \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \). The maximum value is the amplitude \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \):
\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]
Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
