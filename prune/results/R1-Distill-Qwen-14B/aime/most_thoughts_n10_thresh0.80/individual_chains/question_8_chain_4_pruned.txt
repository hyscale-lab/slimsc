Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. It says: Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. We're dealing with nonnegative integers, so a, b, c can be 0 or any positive integer. The first condition is straightforward: the sum of a, b, c is 300. The second condition is a bit more complex: it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Let me write that out more clearly.

So, the second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I can factor this a bit to see if it simplifies. Let me group terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Wait, that's a good step. So, substituting the first equation here, since a + b + c = 300, we can replace (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others. Let me try that.

So, substituting, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Let me think about this. So, each term is of the form x²(300 - x), where x is each of a, b, c. Maybe I can represent this as a function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Then, the equation becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

I wonder what this function looks like. Let me analyze f(x) = x²(300 - x). It's a cubic function. Let me see its behavior. For x = 0, f(0) = 0. For x = 300, f(300) = 300² * 0 = 0. So, it starts at 0, goes up, and comes back down to 0 at x=300.

Let me find the maximum of this function. Taking the derivative: f'(x) = 2x(300 - x) + x²(-1) = 600x - 2x² - x² = 600x - 3x². Setting derivative to zero: 600x - 3x² = 0 ⇒ x(600 - 3x) = 0 ⇒ x=0 or x=200. So, the maximum is at x=200. Let's compute f(200): 200² * (300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the maximum value of f(x) is 4,000,000. So, if all three variables were 200, but wait, a + b + c = 300, so they can't all be 200. If two of them are 200, the third would be -100, which is not allowed because we're dealing with nonnegative integers. So, the maximum value each of a, b, c can take is 300, but the function f(x) peaks at 200.

So, for each variable, the maximum contribution to the sum f(a) + f(b) + f(c) is 4,000,000. But since the sum of all three is 6,000,000, which is 1.5 times the maximum for one variable, maybe each variable is contributing 2,000,000? Let me check.

Wait, 4,000,000 is the maximum per variable. So, if two variables are at 200, their f(x) would be 4,000,000 each, but that would already sum to 8,000,000, which is over the required 6,000,000. So, that's not possible. So, maybe only one variable is at 200, and the others are lower.

Wait, let me think. Suppose one variable is 200, then the other two sum to 100. Let's say a=200, then b + c = 100. Then, f(a) = 4,000,000. So, f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000 - 4,000,000 = 2,000,000. So, is it possible for two variables, b and c, each less than 200, to sum to 2,000,000 in their f(b) + f(c)?

Alternatively, maybe none of the variables are 200. Let me think about possible distributions.

Alternatively, perhaps all three variables are the same. If a = b = c, then each would be 100, since 3*100=300. Let's compute f(100): 100² * 200 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. So, three times that is 6,000,000. So, that works! So, the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

So, that's one solution. But the problem is asking for the number of triples. So, maybe there are more.

Wait, but are there other triples where a, b, c are not all equal but still satisfy the conditions?

Let me consider another case. Suppose two of the variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Then, a + a + c = 300 ⇒ 2a + c = 300 ⇒ c = 300 - 2a.

Then, compute f(a) + f(a) + f(c) = 2f(a) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

Substituting c = 300 - 2a, we have:

2a²(300 - a) + (300 - 2a)²(2a) = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me compute that:

First term: 2a²(300 - a) = 2a²(300 - a)
Second term: (300 - 2a)^2 * 2a.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can let a be some variable and see if the equation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try specific values. Let's try a = 100, then c = 300 - 200 = 100. So, that's the case where all three are 100, which we already know works.

What if a is different from 100? Let's try a = 50. Then c = 300 - 100 = 200.

Compute f(a) for a=50: 50²*(250) = 2500*250 = 625,000. So, 2f(a) = 1,250,000.

f(c) for c=200: 200²*(100) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

So, total is 1,250,000 + 4,000,000 = 5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So, that doesn't work.

What about a=150? Then c=300-300=0.

Compute f(a)=150²*(150)=22500*150=3,375,000. So, 2f(a)=6,750,000.

f(c)=0²*(300)=0. So, total is 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So, that's too big.

Hmm, so when a=50, the sum is 5.25M, which is less than 6M. When a=150, it's 6.75M, which is over. So perhaps somewhere in between.

Wait, maybe a=125. Then c=300-250=50.

Compute f(a)=125²*(175)=15,625*175. Let's compute that:

15,625 * 175: 15,625 * 100 = 1,562,500; 15,625 *75=1,171,875. So total is 1,562,500 + 1,171,875 = 2,734,375.

So, 2f(a) = 5,468,750.

f(c)=50²*(250)=2500*250=625,000.

Total sum: 5,468,750 + 625,000 = 6,093,750, which is more than 6,000,000.

Hmm, so a=125 gives us 6.09375M. Close to 6M but over.

Let me try a=110. Then c=300-220=80.

Compute f(a)=110²*(190)=12,100 * 190.

12,100 * 100 = 1,210,000.
