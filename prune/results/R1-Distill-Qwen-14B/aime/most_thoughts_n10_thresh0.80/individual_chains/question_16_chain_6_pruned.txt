Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some integer n. Once I find that p, I then need to find the smallest m that satisfies the same condition modulo p².

I think I should start by understanding for which primes p, the congruence x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. I remember that for primes p, certain conditions must be met for such solutions to exist.

First, let's consider the equation modulo p. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then certainly n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution.

I recall that in a field like Z_p, the multiplicative group is cyclic with order p-1. So, for the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/2 because -1 is an element of order 2. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, for x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, x⁸ ≡ 1 mod p must hold because if x⁴ ≡ -1, then squaring both sides gives x⁸ ≡ 1. So, the order of x modulo p must divide 8, right? But x⁸ ≡ 1 implies that the order of x divides 8, but in the multiplicative group of Z_p, the order must divide p-1. So, 8 must divide p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but that's for x⁸ ≡1. But here, we have x⁴ ≡ -1, which is a different condition. So, let me think again.

If x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then x⁸ ≡ 1 mod p as I said. So, the order of x modulo p divides 8, but doesn't divide 4 because if it did, x⁴ would be 1, not -1. Therefore, the order of x must be exactly 8, which implies that 8 divides p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8 are candidates. But wait, could there be any smaller primes? Let's check for p=2 and p=5.

For p=2: Let's see if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4. For n=1: 1⁴=1, 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod 4 is 1, so 17 mod 4 is 1, which is not 0. Wait, n² mod 4 cycles as 0 or 1, so n⁴ mod 4 would be 0 or 1. So, n⁴ +1 mod 4 could be 1 or 2. So, 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

For p=5: Let's see if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5²=25. Let me compute n⁴ mod 25.

But first, let's check n⁴ mod 5. For n not divisible by 5, n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5 by Fermat's little theorem. So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 5. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5 would require 1 ≡ -1 mod 5, which is not true. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5 has no solution, meaning p=5 can't be such a prime because even modulo 5, n⁴ can't be -1. So, p=5 is out.

Wait, but what about p=17? Wait, p=17 is 1 mod 8, so maybe that's a candidate. But let's see if there's a smaller prime.

Wait, primes p where p ≡1 mod 8: the primes are 17, 97, etc. Wait, no—wait, 17 is 1 mod 8. But wait, 8+1=9, which is not prime. 16+1=17, which is
