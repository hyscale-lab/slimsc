Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We're given a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We need to find the length of AP, given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, from B and C, we draw the tangents to ω. These tangents meet at D. So D is the exsymmedian point or something? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. So DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to ω. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Then, line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P. So P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. So AP is the length from A to P along that line.

I need to find AP. Hmm. Maybe I can use power of a point or some properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me recall some theorems. The Power of a Point theorem says that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points where any secant from D intersects the circle. So in this case, the power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP.

Wait, right. So DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful because if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA or something, maybe I can find AP.

But wait, how do I find DA? Hmm. DA is the length from D to A. But I don't have coordinates or any angles yet. Maybe I can find DA using triangle properties or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. If I assign coordinates to points A, B, C, then compute the circumcircle, find the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find the equation of line AD, find its intersection P with the circumcircle, and compute AP.

That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me try to set up a coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, let me put point A at (10, 0) because AC = 10. Point B is somewhere in the plane; we can compute its coordinates using the given side lengths.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.

So, with points A(10, 0), C(0, 0). Let me find coordinates of B.

Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then, distance from A to B is 5, so sqrt[(x - 10)^2 + (y)^2] = 5. So (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Also, distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt[x^2 + y^2] = 9. So x^2 + y^2 = 81.

So I have two equations:

1. (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25
2. x^2 + y^2 = 81

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(x - 10)^2 - x^2 = 25 - 81
Expanding (x - 10)^2: x² - 20x + 100 - x² = -56
Simplify: -20x + 100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x = 39/5. Now plug back into equation 2 to find y.

x² + y² = 81 → (39/5)^2 + y² = 81 → (1521/25) + y² = 81 → y² = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25 → y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5. Simplify sqrt(504):

504 = 16 * 31.5 = 16 * 9 * 3.5 = Wait, no, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Let me factor 504:

504 = 16 * 31.5 → No, better to factor into primes: 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 * 7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2 * sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7). Hmm, but maybe I can just write sqrt(504) as 6*sqrt(14). Wait, 504 = 36 * 14, so sqrt(504) = 6*sqrt(14). So y = 6*sqrt(14)/5.

So coordinates of B are (39/5, 6√14/5). Hmm, okay.

So now, points are:

A: (10, 0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0, 0)

Now, we need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

The circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection, which is the circumcenter O.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AC and the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Wait, AC is from (10, 0) to (0, 0). The midpoint of AC is (5, 0). The slope of AC is (0 - 0)/(0 - 10) = 0, it's horizontal. So the perpendicular bisector is vertical, passing through (5, 0), so equation is x = 5.

Now, let's find the perpendicular bisector of AB.

First, find the midpoint of AB. A is (10, 0), B is (39/5, 6√14/5). Midpoint M:

x: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10 = 8.9

y: (0 + 6√14/5)/2 = (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5

So midpoint M is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB is (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6√14/5) / (-11/5) = -6√14/11.

Therefore, the slope of AB is -6√14/11. The perpendicular bisector will have slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 11/(6√14).

So the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10)

We can write this as:

y = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10) + 3√14/5

Now, since the circumcenter O lies on x = 5, we can plug x =5 into this equation to find y.

So substitute x =5:

y = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10) + 3√14/5

Compute 5 - 89/10: 5 = 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = -39/10.

So:

y = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10) + 3√14/5

Compute the first term:

(11 * (-39)) / (6√14 * 10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14)

Rationalize the denominator:

(-143)/(20√14) * (√14/√14) = (-143√14)/(20*14) = (-143√14)/280

So y = (-143√14)/280 + 3√14/5

Convert 3√14/5 to denominator 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14 / 280

So y = (-143√14 + 168√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Okay, so O is (5, 5√14/56). Now, we can write the equation of ω as (x - 5)^2 + (y - 5√14/56)^2 = R^2, where R is the radius.

But perhaps we don't need R directly. Alternatively, since we have O, we can compute the tangent lines at B and C.

Wait, the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and similarly for tangent at C.

So let's compute the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, let's find the slope of OB. Point O is (5, 5√14/56), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5).

Compute the slope of OB:

m_OB = (6√14/5 - 5√14/56) / (39/5 - 5)

Compute denominator: 39/5 - 25/5 = 14/5.

Numerator: let's get common denominator 56:

6√14/5 = (6*11.2√14)/56? Wait, 6√14/5 = (6√14 * 5.6)/56? Wait, perhaps better to compute numerator:

6√14/5 = (6√14)*(56)/5*56 = ... Wait, maybe better to compute as fractions.

Wait, 6√14/5 = (6√14 * 56)/280 = 336√14/280.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 6√14/5 - 5√14/56.

Convert to common denominator 280:

6√14/5 = (6√14 * 56)/280 = 336√14/280

5√14/56 = (5√14 * 5)/280 = 25√14/280

So 6√14/5 - 5√14/56 = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = 311√14/280.

So numerator is 311√14/280, denominator is 14/5.

So slope m_OB = (311√14/280) / (14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920.

Let me see if they have a common factor. 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So 1555/3920 = 311/784.

So m_OB = (311√14)/(784).

So the slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal:

m_tangent_B = -784/(311√14)

Simplify: perhaps rationalize.

But maybe it's better to compute it as is for now.

Similarly, let's compute the tangent at C. Since C is (0,0), the radius OC is from (5, 5√14/56) to (0,0). The slope of OC is (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0) = (√14)/56 *5 = √14/11.2. Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Slope of OC: (5√14/56 - 0)/(5 - 0) = (5√14/56)/5 = √14/56.

So the slope of OC is √14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular, so its slope is negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify: -56/√14 = -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So the tangent at C has slope -4√14.

So now, we have the equations of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

Equation of tangent at B: passes through B(39/5, 6√14/5) with slope -784/(311√14).

Equation: y - 6√14/5 = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5)

Similarly, equation of tangent at C: passes through C(0,0) with slope -4√14.

Equation: y = -4√14 x.

Now, point D is the intersection of these two tangents. So we can solve these two equations to find D.

So we have:

Equation 1: y = -4√14 x

Equation 2: y - 6√14/5 = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5)

Substitute y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

-4√14 x - 6√14/5 = (-784/(311√14))(x - 39/5)

Multiply both sides by 311√14 to eliminate denominator:

-4√14 x * 311√14 - 6√14/5 *311√14 = -784(x - 39/5)

Compute each term:

First term: -4√14 * x *311√14 = -4*311*(√14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*311*14 x.

Compute 4*311 =1244; 1244*14 = 17416. So first term: -17416 x.

Second term: -6√14/5 *311√14 = -6/5 *311*(√14)^2 = -6/5 *311*14 = (-6*311*14)/5.

Compute 6*311=1866; 1866*14=26124. So second term: -26124/5.

Right-hand side: -784(x - 39/5) = -784x + 784*(39/5) = -784x + (784*39)/5.

Compute 784*39: 784*40=31360, minus 784: 31360-784=30576. So (30576)/5.

So putting it all together:

-17416 x - 26124 /5 = -784x + 30576 /5

Bring all terms to left side:

-17416x +784x -26124/5 -30576/5 = 0

Compute coefficients:

-17416x +784x = (-17416 +784)x = -16632 x

-26124/5 -30576/5 = (-26124 -30576)/5 = (-56700)/5 = -11340.

So equation becomes:

-16632x -11340 =0 → -16632x = 11340 → x = 11340 / (-16632)

Simplify x:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12:

11340 ÷12=945; 16632 ÷12=1386.

So x = 945 / (-1386)

Simplify further: 945 and 1386.

Find GCD of 945 and 1386.

945: factors include 5, 7, 3^3.

1386: 1386 ÷2=693; 693 ÷3=231; 231 ÷3=77; so 2*3^2*7*11.

So GCD: 3^2 *7=63.

So 945 ÷63=15; 1386 ÷63=22.

So x= -15/22.

So x coordinate of D is -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22 = (30√14)/11.

So point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, having found D, we can find the equation of line AD.

Points A(10, 0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m_AD = (30√14/11 - 0)/( -15/22 -10 ) = (30√14/11) / ( (-15/22 - 220/22) ) = (30√14/11) / (-235/22) = (30√14/11) * (-22/235) = (30√14 * (-22)) / (11 *235 )

Simplify:

30 and 22: 30=2*3*5, 22=2*11.

11 cancels with denominator 11.

So:

(30√14 * (-22)) / (11 *235) = (30√14*(-2)) /235 = (-60√14)/235.

Simplify further: 60 and 235 have GCD 5.

60 ÷5=12; 235 ÷5=47.

So slope m_AD= -12√14/47.

So the equation of line AD is:

y - 0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10)

So y = (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we need to find the intersection point P of AD with ω, other than A.

We already know A is on both AD and ω, so P is the other intersection.

We can parametrize line AD and find the other point, but perhaps it's better to use parametric equations or solve the system.

Alternatively, since points A and P lie on ω, and line AD passes through both. So perhaps using parametric form.

Alternatively, since we have the equation of ω, we can substitute the equation of AD into ω's equation.

The equation of ω is (x -5)^2 + (y - 5√14/56)^2 = R^2.

But perhaps it's better to compute R² as OA².

Point O is (5,5√14/56). Point A is (10,0).

So OA² = (10 -5)^2 + (0 -5√14/56)^2 = 25 + (25*14)/(56²).

Wait, compute (5√14/56)^2:

(5^2)*(14)/(56^2)=25*14/(3136)=350/3136=175/1568.

So OA²=25 + 175/1568.

Convert 25 to 25*1568/1568 = 39200/1568.

So OA²= (39200 +175)/1568= 39375/1568.

So R²=39375/1568.

Now, equation of ω: (x-5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = 39375/1568.

Equation of AD: y = (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Substitute y into ω's equation.

Let me denote y = m x + c, where m= -12√14/47, c=120√14/47.

So equation:

(x -5)^2 + ( (m x + c) - 5√14/56 )^2 = 39375/1568.

This will be a quadratic in x. Since we know x=10 is a solution (point A), the other solution will be x_P, which we can find.

But maybe it's easier to use parametric equations. Let me set t as parameter such that x=10 + t*(direction vector of AD).

Vector AD: from A(10,0) to D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

So direction vector is (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0) = (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + (-235/22) t

y=0 + (30√14/11) t

We can substitute into ω's equation.

Compute (x-5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = R².

Substitute x and y:

( (10 -5) + (-235/22) t )^2 + ( (30√14/11 t ) -5√14/56 )^2 = 39375/1568

Simplify:

(5 - (235/22) t)^2 + ( (30√14/11) t -5√14/56 )^2 = 39375/1568

Let me compute each term.

First term: (5 - (235/22) t )^2 = [5 - (235/22) t]^2 = 25 - 2*5*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t²

=25 - (2350/22) t + (55225/484) t²

Second term: ( (30√14/11) t -5√14/56 )^2 

Let me factor out √14:

√14*(30/11 t -5/56 ) so squared: 14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2

Compute (30/11 t -5/56)^2:

Let me write 30/11 as (30*56)/(11*56) = 1680/616, and 5/56 as (5*11)/(56*11)=55/616.

So 30/11 t -5/56 = (1680 t -55)/616.

So (30/11 t -5/56)^2 = (1680 t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

But maybe it's better to compute directly:

(30/11 t -5/56)^2 = (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2

= (900/121) t² - (300/616) t + 25/(56²)

Simplify:

900/121 t² - 300/616 t + 25/3136.

Multiply by 14:

14*(900/121 t²) = 12600/121 t²

14*(-300/616 t) = -4200/616 t = -1050/154 t = -525/77 t.

14*(25/3136) = 350/3136 = 175/1568.

So the second term is 12600/121 t² -525/77 t + 175/1568.

So overall equation:

[25 - (2350/22) t + (55225/484) t²] + [12600/121 t² -525/77 t + 175/1568] = 39375/1568.

Combine like terms:

t² terms: 55225/484 + 12600/121

Convert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 12600/121 = (12600*4)/484 = 50400/484.

So 55225/484 +50400/484 = 105625/484.

t terms: -2350/22 t -525/77 t

Convert to common denominator: 22 and 77. 77 is 7*11, 22 is 2*11. So LCD is 154.

Convert -2350/22 to -2350*7/154 = -16450/154.

Convert -525/77 to -525*2/154= -1050/154.

So total t term: (-16450 -1050)/154 t = -17500/154 t.

Constants: 25 + 175/1568.

25 is 25*1568/1568 = 39200/1568.

So 39200/1568 +175/1568 = 39375/1568.

Putting it all together:

(105625/484) t² - (17500/154) t + 39375/1568 = 39375/1568.

Subtract 39375/1568 from both sides:

(105625/484) t² - (17500/154) t =0.

Factor t:

t [ (105625/484) t -17500/154 ] =0.

So solutions t=0 and t= (17500/154)/(105625/484).

t=0 corresponds to point A (10,0). The other solution is t= (17500/154) * (484/105625).

Simplify:

17500 /154 = (17500 ÷ 14)/(154 ÷14)=1250/11.

484/105625: 484=22², 105625= 325². Let me see.

Wait, 105625 ÷ 25=4225, which is 65². So 105625=25*4225=25*65²= (5*65)^2=325². So 484/105625= (22/325)^2.

So t= (1250/11)*(22²/325²) ? Wait, wait, no.

Wait, t = (17500/154) * (484/105625).

Let me compute this as:

(17500 *484)/(154 *105625)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator:17500= 175*100=25*7*100=25*7*10².

484=4*121=4*11².

Denominator:154=14*11, 105625= 325²= (5² *13)^2=5^4 *13².

So:

Numerator:25*7*10² *4*11²=25*4*7*10²*11²=100*7*100*121= wait, let me factor all:

25 * 4 = 100.

7 remains.

10²=100.

11²=121.

So numerator=100*7*100*121= 7*100^2*121.

Denominator:

154=14*11=2*7*11.

105625=5^4 *13².

So denominator=2*7*11 *5^4 *13².

So overall:

t= [7*100² *121 ] / [2*7*11 *5^4 *13² ].

Cancel 7:

t= [100² *121 ] / [2*11 *5^4 *13² ].

Simplify 100²= (2²*5²)^2=2^4*5^4.

121=11².

So:

t= [2^4*5^4 *11² ] / [2*11 *5^4 *13² ].

Cancel 5^4, 2^4 ÷2=2^3, 11² ÷11=11.

So t= [2^3 *11 ] /13²= (8*11)/169=88/169.

So t=88/169.

So the parameter t is 88/169.

So the coordinates of P are:

x=10 + (-235/22)*t=10 + (-235/22)*(88/169).

Similarly, y=0 + (30√14/11)*t= (30√14/11)*(88/169).

Compute x:

First, compute (-235/22)*(88/169):

88/22=4, so (-235)*4= -940.

So (-235/22)*(88/169)= (-940)/169.

So x=10 -940/169.

Convert 10 to 1690/169.

1690/169 -940/169=750/169.

So x=750/169.

Compute y:

(30√14/11)*(88/169) = (30√14 *8)/169 = 240√14/169.

So point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we can find AP.

Point A is at (10, 0), point P at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Compute distance AP:

AP = sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2 ]

Compute 750/169 -10: 10=1690/169, so 750/169 -1690/169= -940/169.

So:

AP = sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ]

= sqrt[ (940^2 + (240^2 *14 )) / (169^2) ]

Factor numerator:

Compute 940^2: 940=94*10, so 94²=8836, 940²=8836*100=883600.

240^2=57600, 57600*14=806400.

So numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So AP= sqrt(1,690,000 / (169^2)) = sqrt(1,690,000)/169.

Simplify sqrt(1,690,000): sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1300.

So AP=1300/169.

Simplify 1300/169: 169*7=1183; 169*7.69≈1300.

Wait, 169*7=1183; 1300-1183=117. 117=169*(117/169)= 9*13/169=9/13.

Wait, 1300=169*7 +117=169*7 +9*13.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

1300=13*100.

169=13².

So 1300/169=(13*100)/(13²)=100/13.

So AP=100/13.

So m=100, n=13. They are coprime because 100 and13 share no common divisors besides 1.

So m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). The tangents from point \(D\) to the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\) at points \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at \(D\). We need to find the length \(AP\), where \(P\) is the second intersection of line \(AD\) with the circumcircle \(\omega\).

Using coordinate geometry, we place \(C\) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \(A\) at \((10, 0)\), and find the coordinates of \(B\) by solving the system of equations based on the given side lengths. We determine \(B\) to be at \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

Next, we find the circumcenter \(O\) of triangle \(ABC\) by calculating the perpendicular bisectors of sides \(AC\) and \(AB\). The circumcenter \(O\) is found to be at \(\left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)\).

We then determine the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The tangent at \(C\) has a slope of \(-4\sqrt{14}\), giving its equation as \(y = -4\sqrt{14}x\). The tangent at \(B\) is found using the slope of \(OB\) and determining the perpendicular slope, leading to the equation \(y - \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} = \frac{-784}{311\sqrt{14}}\left(x - \frac{39}{5}\right)\).

Solving these two tangent equations, we find the coordinates of \(D\) to be \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

The equation of line \(AD\) is derived with slope \(-\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}\), giving the equation \(y = -\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}x + \frac{120\sqrt{14}}{47}\). Substituting this into the circumcircle equation, we solve for the intersection points and find the parameter \(t\) corresponding to point \(P\). 

After calculating, we determine the coordinates of \(P\) and compute the distance \(AP\). Simplifying, we find \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\). Thus, \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), leading to \(m + n = 113\).

\boxed{113}
