Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product AB times AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay, let me jot down what I know.

First, some basics. The circumradius R is given as 13. The inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The triangle has vertices A, B, C, with circumcenter O and incenter I. The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That seems important.

I remember that in any triangle, the inradius r can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R can be found using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the side lengths. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, the triangle's inradius is 6, so r = 6. The circumradius R is 13. Maybe I can relate R and r using some known formulas or identities.

I recall that in a triangle, several relationships connect R, r, and other elements like the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. There's a formula for the distance between O and I: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI squared equals R times (R minus two times r). Plugging in the values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in our problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at A. Wait, no, the right angle is at I because it's IA perpendicular to OI. Wait, no, actually, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So triangle IAO is a right triangle at I.

Wait, no, actually, OI is the line from O to I, and IA is the line from I to A. So the lines IA and OI meet at I, forming a right angle there. So the triangle IAO has a right angle at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, IA² + OI² = OA².

But OA is the circumradius, so OA = R =13. So IA² + OI² = R². We know OI is sqrt(13), so OI²
