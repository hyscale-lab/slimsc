Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set 𝒜. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer should be expressed as a fraction p/q, and then I need to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So, given that the surface area is 54 and volume is 23, I can set up equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter would be equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere needs to enclose all corners of the box. The space diagonal d is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r would be half of that, which is d/2. Therefore, r² would be (d²)/4, which is (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize r², which means I need to minimize l² + w² + h² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, the key is to minimize l² + w² + h² with the constraints 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization, but maybe there's a smarter way using inequalities or substitution.

Let me denote S = l + w + h, Q = lw + lh + wh, and P = lwh. We know that Q = 54/2 = 27, and P = 23.

We need to find l² + w² + h². I remember that l² + w² + h² = S² - 2Q. So, if I can express S in terms of Q and P, maybe I can find S.

Wait, but we have three variables and two equations. Maybe I can express S in terms of l, w, h and then find some relationship.

Alternatively, since all variables are symmetric, maybe the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible. Is that the case? Because in similar problems, the cube often minimizes or maximizes certain quantities.

But wait, in this case, the volume is fixed, and surface area is fixed. So, perhaps the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is a cube? Let me check. If it's a cube, then l = w = h = a. Then, surface area would be 6a² = 54, so a² = 9, a = 3. Volume would then be 27, but our volume is 23, which is less. So, it can't be a cube.

Hmm, so the box isn't a cube, but maybe it's close to a cube. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rectangular prism where two sides are equal, making it a square-based prism.

Let me suppose that l = w. Then, the variables are l, l, h. Let me write down the equations.

So, with l = w:

Surface area: 2(l² + 2lh) = 54 → l² + 2lh = 27.

Volume: l²h = 23.

I can try to solve for h in terms of l from the volume equation: h = 23/(l²).

Substitute into the surface area equation:

l² + 2l*(23/(l²)) = 27 → l² + (46)/l = 27.

Multiply both sides by l to eliminate the denominator:

l³ + 46 = 27l → l³ - 27l + 46 = 0.

Hmm, solving the cubic equation l³ -27l +46 = 0. Let me try to factor this.

Let me test l=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0.

l=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → 8 -54 is -46, +46 gives 0. So, l=2 is a root.

So, I can factor this as (l - 2)(l² + 2l -23)=0.

So, the roots are l=2, and l = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/
