Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, with a total length of 16 steps. But there's a catch: the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. The total number of steps is 16, which makes sense.

Now, a path on this grid that goes from one corner to the opposite can be represented as a sequence of moves: right (R) and up (U). So, any valid path is a permutation of 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But we need to impose the condition that the path changes direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. Let me think about what that means. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, starting at the lower left, the first move could be right or up. Each change in direction counts as a switch. 

For example, if the path starts with a series of R's, then switches to U's, then R's again, and so on. Each switch is a direction change. Since the path changes direction exactly four times, it must have five segments of consecutive R's or U's. Because each direction change adds a new segment, so n changes lead to n+1 segments.

So, if we have four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of R's or U's. Now, depending on whether the first move is R or U, the segments alternate between R and U.

Let me consider two cases:

1. The path starts with a right move (R).
2. The path starts with an up move (U).

These two cases are symmetrical, so maybe I can calculate one and double it, but I need to make sure that symmetry holds.

Wait, no. Because the grid is square, starting with R or U might lead to similar counts, but perhaps I should check whether the number of paths starting with R is the same as those starting with U when considering direction changes. Hmm, I think they should be the same because of the symmetry, so maybe I can compute one case and multiply by two. But I'll keep that in mind.

So, let's first assume the path starts with R. Then, each direction change alternates between R and U. Since there are four direction changes, the number of segments is five. Starting with R, the sequence of segments is R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments, or vice versa? Wait, no. Wait, starting with R, then after four direction changes, how many segments do we have? Let's see:

- Start: R
- Change 1: U
- Change 2: R
- Change 3: U
- Change 4: R

So, the segments are R, U, R, U, R. That's five segments, with three R segments and two U segments. Similarly, if we start with U, the segments would be U, R, U, R, U: five segments, three U and two R.

Wait, but in the starting with R case, there are three R segments and two U segments. So, the number of R steps is 8, which is split into three segments, each of length at least 1, right? Because each segment must have at least one step. Similarly, the U steps are 8, split into two segments, each at least 1 step.

So, in the starting with R case, the number of ways is the number of ways to split 8 R's into three parts, each at least 1, multiplied by the number of ways to split 8 U's into two parts, each at least 1.

Similarly, for starting with U, it's the same: number of ways to split 8 U's into three parts (since starting with U, then R, U, R, U â€“ wait, no, starting with U and four direction changes would lead to segments U, R, U, R, U, which is five segments, three U segments and two R segments. So, the U's are 8, split into three parts, and R's into two parts.

Wait, so in both cases, whether starting with R or U, the number of ways is the same. Because in one case, it's 8 R's split into three parts and 8 U's into two; in the other, it's 8 U's into three and 8 R's into two. So, the number of ways for each case is the same, so I can compute one and
