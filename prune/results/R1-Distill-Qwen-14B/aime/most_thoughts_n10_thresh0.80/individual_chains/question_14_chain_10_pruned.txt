Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with this particular property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, N has four digits: let's call them a, b, c, d. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Now, if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number should be divisible by 7. That means if I replace a with 1, or b with 1, or c with 1, or d with 1, each time the number becomes a multiple of 7.

Wait, but the original number N doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, right? Because the condition is only that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So N itself could be anything, but when you modify each digit individually to 1, the result is a multiple of 7.

So, for example, if I replace the thousands digit a with 1, making the number 1bcd, then 1bcd must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit b with 1 gives a1cd, which must also be divisible by 7. Same for replacing c and d: ab1d and abc1 must both be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions here:

1. 1bcd is divisible by 7.
2. a1cd is divisible by 7.
3. ab1d is divisible by 7.
4. abc1 is divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest four-digit N (so maximize a, then b, then c, then d) that satisfies all four conditions.

Since N is the greatest such number, it's likely that N is as close to 9999 as possible, but the digits might have to be adjusted to meet the conditions.

So, let's think about each condition:

1. Replacing a with 1: So the number is 1bcd. 1bcd must be divisible by 7. That gives us some constraint on b, c, d.

2. Replacing b with 1: a1cd must be divisible by 7. So, another constraint on a, c, d.

3. Replacing c with 1: ab1d must be divisible by 7. Another constraint on a, b, d.

4. Replacing d with 1: abc1 must be divisible by 7. Constraint on a, b, c.

Since we're looking for the largest N, we probably want a to be 9, then b to be as high as possible, and so on. So, let's try to set a=9, and see if we can find suitable b, c, d.

But first, perhaps it's better to think about the modular constraints. Since each modified number is divisible by 7, their modulo 7 is zero.

Let me consider each condition modulo 7.

Condition 1: 1bcd ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, condition 2: a1cd ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 3: ab1d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 4: abc1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, for each condition, we can write the equation:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, perhaps we can compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7 to simplify these.

Calculating:

1000 ÷ 7: 7×142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7×14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7: 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, substituting into each condition:

Condition 1: (6) + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.   → Equation (1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (4)

Let me write them again:

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 6 ≡ -1, so 0 - (-1) = 1 mod 7?)

Wait, no. Let me compute each equation correctly.

Equation (1): 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 2b + 3c + d
