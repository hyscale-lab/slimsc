Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The key property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, after finding N, I need to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

First, let's break down the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such N, which means I should start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long. There must be a smarter way.

The main property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing that digit with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me represent N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

Now, when I replace A with 1, I get 1BCD. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C gives AB1D, and replacing D gives ABC1.

Each of these numbers should be divisible by 7. So, I have four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, okay. So each modified number must be a multiple of 7. I need to find N = ABCD such that all four modified numbers satisfy this.

Since I'm looking for the largest N, I should probably try to maximize the digits starting from the left. So, let's start with 9999 and check downwards, but that's impractical. Maybe I can find constraints on each digit.

Let me think about each condition.

First, let's consider replacing A with 1. The number becomes 1BCD. Let me denote this as N1 = 1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D. N1 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2 = A*1000 + 100 + C*10 + D. N2 must be divisible by 7.

Replacing C gives N3 = A*1000 + B*100 + 10 + D. N3 must be divisible by 7.

Replacing D gives N4 = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1. N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, all four numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

Let me write each condition modulo 7.

For N1:
1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But wait, 1000 mod 7 is equal to (since 10^3 = 1000). Let me compute 10^k mod 7 for k=0,1,2,3:

10^0 mod7=1
10^1 mod7=3
10^2 mod7=2 (since 10^2=100, 100/7=14*7=98, 100-98=2)
10^3 mod7=6 (10^3=1000, 1000-142*7=1000-994=6)
So, 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D → modulo7: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, for N2 = A*1000 + 100 + 10C + D → modulo7: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.

N3 = A*1000 + B*100 + 10 + D → modulo7: 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7.

N4 = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1 → modulo7: 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (from N1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (from N2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7. (from N3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7. (from N4)

These are four equations modulo7. Let me see if I can manipulate these equations.

Let me number them for reference:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7. Since -6 mod7 is 1, so 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7.

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7. -2 mod7 is 5, so 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7. -3 mod7 is 4, so 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7. -1 mod7 is 6, so 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, okay. Now, I have four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Let me try subtracting some equations to eliminate variables.

For example, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7.

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let me write this as Equation 5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

(6A +2B + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7.

So, 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

That's Equation 6: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

And subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:

(6A +2B +3C) - (2B +3C + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because Equation 4 is 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7, and Equation1 is 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

So subtract Equation1 from Equation4: (6A +2B +3C) - (2B +3C + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

Which gives: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, Equation7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Now, from Equation7: D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Similarly, Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → 2B ≡6A -4 mod7 → B ≡3A -2 mod7 (since 6 ≡6 mod7, and 6/2=3 mod7; because 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4, but here 6A -4 multiplied by inverse of 2 which is 4: 6A*4=24A≡3A, -4*4=-16≡-2 mod7. So 2B ≡6A-4 → B≡3A -2 mod7.

Wait, let me verify:

Equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → -2B ≡4 -6A mod7 → 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 4 (the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7):

B ≡4*(6A -4) mod7 → B ≡24A -16 mod7.

24 mod7 is 3 (since 7*3=21, 24-21=3), and -16 mod7 is (-16 +21)=5.

So, B ≡3A +5 mod7, but 5 mod7 is 5. Wait, that can't be right because 24A mod7 is (24%7)=3A, and -16 mod7 is -16 +21=5. So yes, B ≡3A +5 mod7.
