Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me recall what the circumradius and inradius are. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. Here, R is 13, and r is 6.

The triangle has circumcenter O and incenter I. The incenter is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here, or perhaps some properties of triangle centers.

Wait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, the incenter I is somewhere in this plane. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from O to I.

Hmm, that might be a bit abstract. Maybe I can denote coordinates for points. Let me think. Let me denote point I as (h, k). Then, O is at (0,0). The vector OI would be (h, k). The vector IA would be from I to A, so if A is at (x, y), then IA is (x - h, y - k).

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero. So, (h)(x - h) + (k)(y - k) = 0.

But wait, A is a point on the circumcircle with radius 13, so the distance from O to A is 13. So, x² + y² = 13² = 169.

Also, since I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to use that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some triangle formulas. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me see... Yes, I remember something like that. It's a formula that relates OI, R, and r. So in this case, OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) =13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay, that's useful.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IA and OI are perpendicular. So, using Pythagoras in triangle OIA, maybe?

Wait, no, because
