Okay, so I've got this problem here: 

There exist real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that \( \log_x(y^x) = \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). I need to find \( xy \).

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I remember some logarithm properties, so maybe I can use those to rewrite these equations in a more manageable form.

First, let's look at the first equation: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). I know that \( \log_b(a^n) = n \cdot \log_b(a) \), so maybe I can apply that here.

Applying that property, the equation becomes:
\( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \).

Wait, but \( \log_x(y) \) is the logarithm of y with base x. Let me denote that as \( \log_x(y) = a \), so that \( x^a = y \). Maybe that substitution will help later.

But going back, I have \( x \cdot a = 10 \), so \( a = 10/x \).

But since \( a = \log_x(y) \), that means \( \log_x(y) = 10/x \). That feels a bit abstract. Maybe I can rewrite this in terms of natural logarithms or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can express both logarithmic equations in terms of exponents to get rid of the logs. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \). Converting this into exponential form, it becomes \( x^{10} = y^x \). Because \( \log_b(a) = c \) is equivalent to \( b^c = a \).

Similarly, the second equation is \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). Converting that, we get \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. \( x^{10} = y^x \)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \)

Hmm, now I have a system of equations. Maybe I can take some ratio or find a relationship between x and y.

Let me write them again:

1. \( x^{10} = y^x \) → Equation (1)
2. \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \) → Equation (2)

I need to find \( xy \). Maybe if I can find expressions involving x and y, I can solve for one in terms of the other.

Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides for both equations to see if that helps.

Taking ln of Equation (1):

\( \ln(x^{10}) = \ln(y^x) \)
Which simplifies to:
\( 10 \ln x = x \ln y \) → Let's call this Equation (1a).

Similarly, taking ln of Equation (2):

\( \ln(y^{10}) = \ln(x^{4y}) \)
Which simplifies to:
\( 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \) → Equation (2a).

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1a. \( 10 \ln x = x \ln y \)
2a. \( 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \)

Hmm, so perhaps I can solve for one logarithm in terms of the other and substitute.

From Equation (1a): \( \ln y = (10 \ln x) / x \)

Plugging this into Equation (2a):

\( 10 \times \left( \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \right) = 4y \ln x \)

Simplify the left side: \( 100 \ln x / x = 4y \ln x \)

Hmm, I can divide both sides by \( \ln x \) (assuming \( \ln x \neq 0 \), which is true since x > 1, so \( \ln x > 0 \)).

So, \( 100 / x = 4y \)

Simplify that: \( 100 / x = 4y \) → \( y = 100 / (4x) \) → \( y = 25 / x \)

Ah, so y is equal to 25 divided by x. That's a useful relationship. Let's note that.

So \( y = 25 / x \) → Equation (3).

Now, I can substitute this into one of the previous equations to solve for x. Let's pick Equation (1a):

\( 10 \ln x = x \ln y \)

But from Equation (3), \( y = 25/x \), so \( \ln y = \ln(25/x) = \ln 25 - \ln x \).

Substituting into Equation (1a):

\( 10 \ln x = x (\ln 25 - \ln x) \)

Let's write that out:

\( 10 \ln x = x \ln 25 - x \ln x \)

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side:

\( 10 \ln x + x \ln x - x \ln 25 = 0 \)

Factor out ln x:

\( (10 + x) \ln x - x \ln 25 = 0 \)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can factor this differently or find a way to express this in terms of a single logarithm.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:

\( (10 + x) \ln x = x \ln 25 \)

Divide both sides by x:

\( \left(10 + x\right)/x \cdot \ln x = \ln 25 \)

Simplify \( (10 + x)/x \) as \( 10/x + 1 \):

\( (10/x + 1) \ln x = \ln 25 \)

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let's let \( t = x \). So, in terms of t:

\( (10/t + 1) \ln t = \ln 25 \)

But that might not lead anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 10 as 2*5 or 25 as 5^2, but not sure.

Wait, another idea: Let's write both sides in exponential form.

From Equation (3), \( y = 25/x \). Let's substitute this into Equation (1): \( x^{10} = y^x \).

So, \( x^{10} = (25/x)^x \).

Let me write that out:

\( x^{10} = (25/x)^x \)
Which is \( x^{10} = 25^x / x^x \)
So, \( x^{10} = 25^x / x^x \)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

\( x^{10} \cdot x^x = 25^x \)
Which is \( x^{x +10} = 25^x \)

Hmm, so \( x^{x +10} = 25^x \). Let me write this as:

\( (x^{(x+10)/x}) = 25 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( x^{(1 + 10/x)} = 25 \)

So, \( x^{(1 + 10/x)} = 25 \)

Hmm, now, taking natural logs on both sides:

\( (1 + 10/x) \ln x = \ln 25 \)

Wait, that's the same equation I had earlier. So, perhaps I need a different approach here.

Let me think about possible integer solutions. Since x and y are greater than 1, and their product is to be found. Let's see.

Wait, from Equation (3), \( y = 25/x \), so \( xy = x*(25/x) = 25 \). Wait, that can't be right because then xy would be 25, but let me check.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if \( y = 25/x \), then \( xy = x*(25/x) = 25 \). Oh! So, \( xy = 25 \) regardless of x and y? So, is the answer 25? Hmm, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.

If \( y =25/x \), then \( xy =25 \). So, perhaps that's the answer. But I should verify that with the original equations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting. Let me go back.

From Equation (3), \( y = 25/x \). Let's plug this into Equation (1): \( x^{10} = y^x \).

So, \( x^{10} = (25/x)^x \).

Which is \( x^{10} = 25^x / x^x \).

Multiply both sides by x^x: \( x^{10} \cdot x^x = 25^x \).

Which is \( x^{x +10} = 25^x \).

Hmm, so \( x^{x+10} =25^x \). Let's take the 25th root of both sides? Not sure. Alternatively, take logarithms again.

Taking ln of both sides: \( (x +10) \ln x = x \ln 25 \).

Which can be rewritten as:

\( (x +10) \ln x = x \ln 25 \).

Hmm, maybe I can factor this equation differently. Let's divide both sides by x:

\( (1 + 10/x) \ln x = ln 25 \).

Which is the same as before. Maybe I can let \( t = \ln x \) and express 10/x in terms of t.

Wait, \( x = e^t \), so 10/x is 10 e^{-t}.

So substituting, the equation becomes:

\( (1 + 10 e^{-t}) t = \ln 25 \).

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution, so perhaps we can guess a value for x that satisfies this.

Wait, let's try x=5.

If x=5, then y=25/5=5.

So, let's check if x=5 and y=5 satisfy the original equations.

First equation: \( \log_5(5^5) = \log_5(3125) \). Since 5^5 is 3125, so \( \log_5(3125) =5 \). But the first equation says it should be 10. So, that's not correct.

Wait, so x=5 and y=5 don't work. Hmm.

Wait, maybe x=25? Let me try x=25, then y=25/25=1. But wait, y must be greater than 1, so y=1 is invalid. So, x can't be 25.

Wait, perhaps x=2? Then y=25/2=12.5.

Let me check the first equation: \( \log_2((12.5)^2) \).

Compute 12.5 squared: 12.5^2 = 156.25.

So \( \log_2(156.25) \). Let me compute this: 2^7 =128, 2^8=256. So, 156.25 is between 2^7 and 2^8. 156.25 is 128 * 1.222... So, the log base 2 is about 7.22 or something. Not 10. So that's not working.

Hmm
