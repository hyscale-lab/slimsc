Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this. So, each vertex is independently colored red or blue, right? That means for each vertex, there's a 1/2 chance it's red and 1/2 chance it's blue. Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So, the total possible cases are 256.

Now, the problem asks for the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red ones. Wait, so I think this is similar to saying that there's a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. Or maybe the other way around? Let me be precise.

If we have a coloring, say, with some blue vertices and some red ones, then a rotation would permute the vertices. For the rotation to satisfy the condition, after rotating, every blue vertex must be on a position that was previously red. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate, the blue vertices move to where the red ones were.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the original coloring has a set B of blue vertices and a set R of red vertices. Rotating the octagon by some number of positions would map B to another set. If after rotation, B coincides exactly with R, then all blue vertices are now where red ones were. So, the condition is that B is a rotation of R.

But since it's a regular octagon, the rotations correspond to cyclic permutations. So, R and B must be cyclic shifts of each other. That is, there exists some rotation (i.e., some k) such that the set R shifted by k positions is equal to B.

Wait, but actually, the problem says that after rotating, the blue vertices move to where the red ones were. So, the image of B under rotation must equal R. Which is equivalent to saying that B is a rotation of R.

So,
