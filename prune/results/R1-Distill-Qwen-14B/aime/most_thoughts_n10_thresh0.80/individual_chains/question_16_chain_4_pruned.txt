Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p². Then, with that p, find the smallest m such that m^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

Alright, let's tackle this step by step.

First, I think I should find the smallest prime p for which n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² is solvable. Maybe I can start by checking small primes one by one.

Let me consider primes starting from the smallest.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 4.

Wait, mod 4 is p² when p=2, which is 4.

So n^4 mod 4. Let's compute n^4 for n=1,2,3,...

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1 mod 4
n=2: 16 mod4=0
n=3: 81 mod4=1
n=4: 256 mod4=0
Wait, so n^4 mod4 is either 0 or 1. So can n^4 ≡ -1 mod4? Since -1 mod4 is 3. But n^4 mod4 is either 0 or 1. So 3 isn't possible. So p=2 is not possible.

Next prime: p=3. Let's check if there exists an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1 mod9=1
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: 256 mod9. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 → 4
n=5: 625 mod9. 9*69=621, 625-621=4 →4
Wait, that can't be. Wait 5^4 is 625, yes.

Wait, let me recalculate n=4 and n=5.

n=4: 4^4=256. 256/9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 → 4 mod9.

n=5: 5^4=625. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4 → 4 mod9.

n=6: 6^4=1296, which is 0 mod9.

n=7: 7^4=2401. Let's see 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, but that's the digital root method. Wait, 2401 /9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7 →7 mod9.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1 mod9. Or 4096-9*455=4096-4095=1 mod9.

So the possible residues are: 1,7,4,0,4,7,0,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡ -1 mod9. -1 mod9 is 8. So we're looking for 8. From the above, n^4 mod9 gives 0,1,4,7. So 8 is not achieved. So p=3 is also not possible.

Next prime: p=5. Let's see if there exists an n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe a smarter way.

I remember that in mod5, n^4 can be 0,1, or maybe something else. Since 5 is prime, by Fermat's little theorem, n^4 ≡1 mod5 if n not divisible by5.

So to have n^4 ≡-1 mod25, n must not be divisible by5, so n^4≡1 mod5, which would mean that 1 ≡-1 mod5 → 1≡4 mod5, which is not true. Therefore, no solution for p=5.

Wait, that's an important point. If n^4 ≡ -1 mod p², then mod p, n^4 ≡-1 mod p. So for this to hold, -1 must be a quartic residue mod p.

But for p=5, since 5≡1 mod4, maybe? Wait, 5 is 1 mod4, so -1 is a quadratic residue, but is it a quartic residue?

Let me think. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So for -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 in the multiplicative group must divide (p-1)/4.

Alternatively, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution.

So let's check for p=5: x^4 ≡ -1 mod5.

Compute x^4 mod5 for x=1,2,3,4.

1^4=1 mod5
2^4=16≡1 mod5
3^4=81≡1 mod5
4^4=256≡1 mod5.

So all x not divisible by5 have x^4≡1 mod5. So -1≡4 mod5 is not achieved. So no solution in p=5.

So p=5 is out.

Next prime: p=7.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod49 has a solution.

Again, first check mod7.

By Fermat's little theorem, n^6≡1 mod7, so n^4 ≡n^{-2} mod7.

So -1 mod7 is 6, so n^4≡6 mod7.

So n^4 ≡6 mod7. Let's see which n satisfy this.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6.

n=1: 1 mod7=1
n=2: 16 mod7=2
n=3: 81 mod7= 81-7*11=81-77=4
n=4: 256 mod7: 256-7*36=256-252=4→4 mod7
n=5: 625 mod7: 625-7*89=625-623=2→2 mod7
n=6: 1296 mod7: 1296-7*185=1296-1295=1→1 mod7

So the quartic residues mod7 are 1,2,4. 6 is not among them. So no solution for p=7.

So p=7 is out.

Next prime: p=11? Wait, let's check p=13? Wait, wait, perhaps p=17? No, wait, maybe p=13, 17 are higher, but let's look for the next primes in order.

Wait, after 7 comes 11. Let's check p=11.

First, check if n^4 ≡-1 mod121 has a solution.

First check mod11.

n^4 ≡-1 mod11.

Compute n^4 mod11 for n=1 to10.

n=1: 1 mod11
n=2: 16 mod11=5
n=3: 81 mod11=4
n=4: 256 mod11: 256-23*11=256-253=3
n=5: 625 mod11. 625 /11=56*11=616, 625-616=9→9
n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod11: 1296 - 117*11=1296-1287=9→9
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod11: 2401/11=218*11=2398, 2401-2398=3→3
n=8: 8^4=4096 mod11. 4096 - 372*11=4096-4092=4→4
n=9: 9^4=6561 mod11. 6561 - 596*11=6561-6556=5→5
n=10: 10^4=10000 mod11: 10000 mod11. Since 10≡-1 mod11, so (-1)^4=1 mod11.

So the quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. So -1 mod11 is 10. 10 isn't among the quartic residues mod11. So no solution for p=11.

Hmm, this is taking longer than I thought. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, maybe I can recall that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue are primes where p ≡ 1 mod8. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so for -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 must divide (p-1)/4, I think.

Wait
