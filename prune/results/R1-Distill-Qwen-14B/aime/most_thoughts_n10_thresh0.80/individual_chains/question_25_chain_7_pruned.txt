Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me list out the given information:

- Total number of residents: 900
- Number of residents who own a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number who own a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number who own a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So, total for H is 900.
- Number of residents who own exactly two of these things: 437
- Number who own exactly three of these things: 234
- We need to find the number of residents who own all four of these things, which I'll call x.

Hmm, okay. So, all residents own at least one thing, since the ones who own exactly two, three, or four would be included in the counts for each item. Wait, no, actually, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, H is universal, everyone has at least H.

Wait, the problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, H is 900. So, all 900 have H. The other items (D, G, S) are subsets.

So, the problem is about four sets: D, G, S, H. But since H is universal, we can focus on the overlaps between D, G, S, and how H factors into that.

Wait, but H is included in all of them, since every resident has it. So, when they talk about someone owning exactly two things, it could be any two of D, G, S, or including H. But since H is always there, maybe some of these counts are a bit more complicated.

Wait, no. Because when they say someone owns exactly two of these things, it's referring to exactly two of all four. Or is it considering H as one of the "things"? Hmm, I think it's all four. Because the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four things are D, G, S, and H. So, when they say 437 own exactly two, that's exactly two of the four, and 234 own exactly three of the four.

So, the standard inclusion-exclusion principle applies here. Let me recall the formula for four sets. For four sets A, B, C, D, the total number is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But in our case, H is the set that everyone is in, so |H| = 900. So, the total union would be |D ∪ G ∪ S| because everyone already has H. Wait, but wait, no. Because H is one of the four things, so the union of all four sets is the entire 900, because everyone has H. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = 900. But since H is the universal set, then the union of D, G, S, and H is H itself, which is 900. So, the inclusion-exclusion formula for D, G, S, H would give 900. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the principle for four sets, but considering that H is universal. Let me think.

Alternatively, since H is universal, we can think of the problem without H for
