Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on here. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, when Aya walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her total time is 4 hours. But this total time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is still including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the coffee shop time is the same in both cases, only her walking speed and the time she spends walking change.

Wait, so the total time she spends each day is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop. Since the coffee shop time is the same, t, in both scenarios, but her walking time changes because her speed changes.

Let me think about the variables. Let's denote:

- Distance walked: 9 km (constant)
- Speed: s km/h and s + 2 km/h
- Total time including coffee: 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes
- Coffee shop duration: t minutes

So, in the first case, when she walks at s km/h, the time she spends walking is (9 / s) hours, and the total time is (9 / s) + (t / 60) hours = 4 hours.

In the second case, walking at (s + 2) km/h, the walking time is (9 / (s + 2)) hours, and the total time is (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2 hours 24 minutes. Wait, 2 hours 24 minutes is how many hours? 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total is 2.4 hours.

So now I have two equations:

1) (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4
2) (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Hmm, okay. Since both equations have the term (t / 60), maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate t.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s - 9/(s+2)] + [t/60 - t/60] = 4 - 2.4
So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute that. Let's factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Simplify inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Multiply 9 and 2:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, let's solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 / 1.6. Hmm, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 ÷ (8/5) = 18 * (5/8) = (18*5)/8 = 90/8 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Okay, let's solve this quadratic equation for s.

Quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 4*(1)*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Square root of 49 is 7.

So,

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h

s = (-9)/2 = -4.5 km/h

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

So, her walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Wait, let me check if this makes sense. If she walks at 2.5 km/h, then 9 km would take her 9 / 2.5 hours.

Calculate 9 / 2.5: 2.5 goes into 9 three times with a remainder of 1.5. 1.5 / 2.5 = 0.6. So total is 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes.

But the total time including coffee is 4 hours. So, 3 hours 36 minutes walking plus t minutes coffee equals 4 hours.

So, t minutes is 4 hours minus 3 hours 36 minutes. Let's convert all to minutes.

4 hours is 240 minutes. 3 hours 36 minutes is 216 minutes. So, t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Let me confirm with the second scenario. When she walks at s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

Walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.

Total time including coffee is 2 hours + 24 minutes = 2 hours 24 minutes, which matches the given data.

Perfect, so s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes.

Now, the question is: What's the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h? Let's compute that.

s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Including the coffee shop time, which is 24 minutes, so total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes + 24 minutes = 204 minutes. Or, 3 hours 24 minutes.

But the problem asks for the number of minutes, so 204 minutes. Alternatively, if it's expected in hours, but since the problem includes t minutes, which is 24, the
