Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where C is a specific point on the line segment AB. The points O, A, and B are given, and there's a family of segments called F that I need to consider. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the setup. We have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin; A at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis; and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis. I can imagine these points forming a triangle OAB. Since O is the origin, and A and B are on the axes, the triangle is right-angled at O.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a line segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each such segment connects a point (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers. Since the length is 1, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) must be 1. Using the distance formula, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. That means each segment PQ is part of the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q) for some p and q such that p² + q² = 1.

Wait, so for each such segment, the equation of the line would be x/p + y/q = 1, right? Because it's the intercept form of a line. And since p² + q² = 1, each of these lines is a member of F.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F besides AB itself. So, AB is also a segment from F because it's from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), and let me check its length.

Calculating the length of AB: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, right! So AB is itself a segment in F. Therefore, C is a point on AB that is not covered by any other segment from F besides AB. So, any other segment from F (i.e., any other PQ) doesn't pass through C except AB.

So, we need to find point C on AB such that for any other PQ in F, point C is not on PQ. So, C is the only point on AB that's not intersected by any other segment from F.

Hmm. So, how can I approach this? Maybe I can parametrize point C on AB and then find conditions under which it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.

First, let's parametrize the line AB. Let me find the equation of AB. Since points A are (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(1/2)*0? Wait, no. Let me use the two-point form.

The two-point form is (y - y1)/(x - x1) = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, plugging in A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2):

(y - 0)/(x - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Expanding, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So that's the equation of AB.

Now, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find such a point C that does not lie on any other segment PQ from F, except AB itself.

So, suppose there's another segment PQ in F, which is not AB. Let me assume P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), with p² + q² = 1, and since it's not AB, either p ≠ 1/2 or q ≠ sqrt(3)/2.

We want to ensure that point C is not on PQ. So, for all such PQ ≠ AB, C is not on PQ.

So, let's think about this: for a general PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1. If point C (which is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)) lies on PQ, then:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.

We can rearrange this:

x/p - sqrt(3)x/q + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1.

Let me factor x:

x(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1.

We can write this as:

x*(1/p - sqrt(3)/q) = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2q).

So, if C is on PQ, then x must satisfy this equation. But since C is on AB, x is between 0 and 1/2. So, if for any PQ other than AB, this equation holds for x between 0 and 1/2, then C is on PQ. We want to find a C such that this equation doesn't hold for any other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ, and find the point C that is on AB but not on any other PQ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the lines PQ in F are all tangent to some curve, and the envelope
