Okay, so I've got this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Alright, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk, and apparently, she spends t minutes there. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the total time taken, including the coffee shop time. I need to find the total time when she walks at a different speed.

Let me break it down. The first scenario says she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and it takes her 4 hours in total. That 4 hours includes t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks a bit faster, s + 2 kilometers per hour, and this time the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

My goal is to find out how much time the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes again.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I'll need to set up some equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables clearly.

Let me denote:
- Distance she walks: D = 9 km
- Her walking speed in the first case: s km/h
- Her walking speed in the second case: (s + 2) km/h
- Her walking speed in the third case: (s + 1/2) km/h
- Time she spends walking without the coffee break: let's call this T_w
- Total time including coffee shop: T_total

In the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which includes the walking time and t minutes (coffee time). So, I can write the first equation as:

T_total1 = T_w1 + t = 4 hours

Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours for consistency. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. So the equation becomes:

T_total2 = T_w2 + t = 2.4 hours

Now, I need to express T_w1 and T_w2 in terms of s. Since time is distance divided by speed, we can write:

T_w1 = D / s = 9 / s hours

T_w2 = D / (s + 2) = 9 / (s + 2) hours

So substituting these into the total time equations:

For the first scenario:
9/s + t = 4  -- equation (1)

For the second scenario:
9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4  -- equation (2)

Now, I have two equations with two variables: s and t. I can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of s and t.

Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate t.

(9/s + t) - (9/(s + 2) + t) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify the left side:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) + t - t = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

Factor 9 out of the numerator:
9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:
[ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:
18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Now, solve for s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 divided by 1.6. Let me think: 1.6 * 11 = 17.6; 1.6 * 11.25 = 18. So, 18 /1.6 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expand the left side:
s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring all terms to one side:
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, I can solve this quadratic equation for s. Let's use the quadratic formula.

s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Square root of 49 is 7.

So, s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:
s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s must be 2.5 km/h.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's plug s back into equation (1):

9/s + t = 4

9 / 2.5 + t = 4

Compute 9 /2.5: 9 divided by 2.5 is the same as 9 * (2/5) = 18/5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t = 4 --> t = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Wait, that seems a bit long for a coffee break. Hmm, but the problem says including t minutes, so maybe it's correct.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time does she take, including t minutes.

So, s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h.

The distance is still 9 km.

Time taken walking is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Adding the coffee time, which is 24 minutes, so total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, but the question says to include t minutes, which is 24 minutes, so yes, 3 hours plus 24 minutes.

But the problem says to put the answer in minutes, I think. Wait, no, the question says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes." So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, maybe I should represent it as hours, but the problem says "the number of minutes".

Wait, the problem says: "Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, yes, we need to express the total time in minutes.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Compute s: 2.5 km/h is correct. t is 24 minutes.

Walking speed for the third case is 3 km/h.

Time taken: 9 /3 = 3 hours.

3 hours is 180 minutes, plus t (24 minutes) is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me check the initial equations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Equation (1): 9/s + t =4. With s=2.5, t=0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. Correct.

Equation (2): 9/(2.5 +2) +24 = 9/4.5 +24 = 2 +24=26 minutes? Wait, 9/4.5 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. So, 120 +24=144 minutes. But equation (2) was 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes. So, correct.

So, yes, s=2.5, t=24 minutes.

So when she walks at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes coffee, so 204 minutes.

Wait, but 204 minutes seems like a lot for a walk. I mean, 3 hours walking, plus 24 minutes coffee. Hmm, but maybe Aya takes a long time in the coffee shop. Or perhaps the walk is 9 km, which is about 5.6 miles. Walking 5.6 miles at 3 km/h is indeed 3 hours. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, let me make sure all my time conversions are correct.

In equation (1): t = 0.4 hours. 0.4 *60=24 minutes. Correct.

In the second scenario, equation (2): 9/(2.5+2)=9/4.5=2 hours. 2 hours +24 minutes=
