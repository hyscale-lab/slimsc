Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should understand what it means for n⁴ + 1 to be divisible by p². That would mean that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, I'm looking for primes p where the congruence x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, and also that this solution can be lifted to a solution modulo p². I remember something about Hensel's lemma, which is used for lifting solutions from modulo p to higher powers, but I'm not too sure. Maybe I should start by finding primes p where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution.

So, first step, find primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is solvable. Let me think about the conditions for that. For the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the multiplicative order of x modulo p must divide 8 because (x⁴)² ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of x modulo p is 8, which implies that 8 divides p-1, because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8. That's a necessary condition for the equation to have a solution.

Wait, but I should also consider whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Maybe I can use Euler's criterion or something related to quadratic residues. Let me recall that for a prime p, x^k ≡ a mod p has a solution only if certain conditions are met. For -1 to be a quartic residue, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution.

Alternatively, I can think about the multiplicative group. The group (Z/pZ)^* is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that -1 is in the subgroup generated by x. Since (Z/pZ)^* is cyclic, -1 is an element of order 2. So, for -1 to be in the subgroup generated by x, which has order dividing p-1, the order of x must be a multiple of 4 (since x⁴ is -1, so x has order 8). Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, the primes p must be of the form 8k +1. The smallest primes of this form are 17, 97,  etc. Wait, but 17 is the first prime ≡1 mod8. Let me check if 17 works.

Wait, but let's think again. Maybe 2 is a possibility. Let me check p=2. If p=2, then n⁴ +1 must be divisible by 4. Let me see: for n=1, 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4. For n=2, 16+1=17, which mod4 is 1. Hmm, maybe n=3: 81+1=82 mod4= 82 mod4= 2, not 0. n=4: 256+1=257, which mod4 is 1. Wait, maybe p=2 is not possible because n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 or 2 mod4. So it's never 0 mod4, which means p=2 isn't a solution. So p must be an odd prime ≡1 mod8.

So the first candidate is p=17. Let me check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod17²=289 is
