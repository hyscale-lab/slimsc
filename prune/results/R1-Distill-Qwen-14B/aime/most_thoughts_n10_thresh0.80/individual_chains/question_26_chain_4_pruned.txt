Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle ABC. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So it's not a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10²=100. So, it's just a scalene triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which should lie outside the circle ω. Then line AD passes through ω again at P, and we need to find AP.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle to the circle, the lengths of these tangents are equal. So, DB should equal DC because both are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, so triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. That could be useful.

Also, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, point D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the circle ω with respect to points B and C. Not sure if that helps yet, but perhaps.

I also recall that in such configurations, the point D is called the symmedian point or something related. Or maybe not exactly, but perhaps there's a harmonic division or something like that.

Wait, another thought: The point D is the ex-pole of line BC with respect to circle ω. Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point would be helpful here. Since D lies outside the circle ω, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD is a secant intersecting ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DA * DP.

So, combining these two, we have DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful.

So, if I can find DB, and DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA (or DA - DP, depending on the direction), I can find AP.

Wait, let me clarify the lengths. Let me denote AP as x. Then DP = AP + something? Wait, no, A is on ω, and P is another intersection point of AD with ω. So, the length from D to A is DA, and from D to P is DP. Since A is between D and P, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If D is outside the circle, and AD passes through A and
