Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis.

There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the lower bound for BD², and then state the greatest number less than BD² for all possible rhombuses. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum BD², but the wording says "greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Hmm, that sounds like it's the supremum of the lower bounds. Wait, no, maybe it's the minimum value that BD² can take, and then the greatest number less than that would be approaching it but not reaching it. But I need to make sure. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Oh, so BD² can be as large as possible, and the question is asking for the maximum lower bound. So, the greatest number that is less than all possible BD². That would mean we're looking for the infimum of BD². If BD² can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be that infimum.

So, my goal is to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD² for all such rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola.

First, let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. I think that's correct. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagon
