Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. The triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel... that must mean it's a regular-like hexagon but not necessarily regular because it might not have all sides equal unless it's regular. Wait, no, the problem says it's equilateral, so all sides are equal, but it's not necessarily regular because in a regular hexagon, not only sides are equal, but all angles are equal too. But here, only the sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel.

So, it's an equilateral convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. That probably makes it a type of hexagon that can be inscribed in a rectangle or something similar, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in some directions.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, if I imagine the hexagon, each side is length 's', and when I extend AB, CD, EF, these extended lines form a triangle.

I remember something about similar triangles or maybe using coordinate geometry to solve this. Maybe placing the hexagon on a coordinate system would help.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector geometry or affine transformations could be useful here. Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, it's an affine image of a regular hexagon, I think. Affine transformations can stretch or skew shapes but preserve parallelism and ratios along lines.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the concept of similar triangles and ratios because the triangle formed by the extensions is a larger triangle, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it, with each pair of opposite sides contributing to the sides of the triangle.

Let me think about how the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle. If I extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these lines intersect to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.

I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of one side of the hexagon. So, each side of the triangle corresponds to an extension of a side of the hexagon.

Given that the hexagon is convex and equilateral, maybe each extension of a pair of opposite sides (like AB and DE) contributes to the sides of the triangle. Wait, but the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. Hmm, so each of these three sides is extended to form the triangle.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of a more methodical approach.

Since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, it's a translationally symmetric figure. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Since it's equilateral, all sides are of
