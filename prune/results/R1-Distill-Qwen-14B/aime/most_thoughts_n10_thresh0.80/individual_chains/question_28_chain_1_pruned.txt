Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it to each of its faces. The point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. Hmm, I think this point is called the incenter or something like that, similar to the inradius in a triangle.

Let me first write down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe this tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry which can help me.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere that touches all faces) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V and the sum of the areas of the four faces, then compute r = 3V / S.

First, let me figure out the volume. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron, which I think is also called a disphenoid. In such cases, there's a formula for volume based on the edge lengths.

Wait, I think the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with edge lengths a, b, c, a', b', c' where opposite edges are equal is:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / (something?)

No, wait, maybe I should use the Cayley-Menger determinant. That's a formula that gives the volume based on all the edge lengths. Since all the edges are given, that might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

0   1    1    1    1
1   0   a²   b²   c²
1  a²   0    d²   e²
1  b²  d²    0    f²
1  c²  e²   f²    0

So, let me set up this matrix with the given edge lengths.

But first, let me assign variables to the edges to avoid confusion. Let's say:

AB = a = √41
AC = b = √80
AD = c = √89
BC = d = √89
BD = e = √80
CD = f = √41

So, substituting into the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, (41), (80), (89)
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, (89), (80)
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, (41)
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me double-check that. Each entry is the square of the respective edge.

So, AB² = 41, AC²=80, AD²=89, BC²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

So, the matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, the Cayley-Menger determinant is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Then, the volume is sqrt(det(CM)/288).

Calculating a 5x5 determinant by hand is tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding the determinant step by step.

Alternatively, I might look for row or column operations to simplify it.

But since this is getting complex, maybe I can compute it numerically. But since I need an exact answer, probably I should proceed symbolically.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that because of the symmetry in the edge lengths, the determinant might factor into something manageable.

Wait, looking at the matrix, it's symmetric except for the last row and column. Let me see:

Looking at the matrix:

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

It seems that each row is a permutation of the previous ones. So, perhaps the determinant can be calculated by recognizing the symmetry.

Alternatively, since all the edge lengths are symmetric, the volume may be a multiple of sqrt( something ). Maybe I can compute it.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume.

Yes, that might be a better approach. Let me try that.

Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D space in such a way that calculations are easier.

Let me set point A at (0, 0, 0).

Let me set point B at (x, 0, 0), so that AB is along the x-axis.

Let me set point C at (p, q, 0), so that ABC is in the xy-plane.

Point D will then be at (r, s, t), with t > 0, to make it a tetrahedron.

Now, let me use the given edge lengths to set up equations.

First, AB = √41, so the distance from A(0,0,0) to B(x,0,0) is |x| = √41. So, x = √41.

So, B is at (√41, 0, 0).

Next, AC = √80. So, the distance from A(0,0,0) to C(p, q, 0) is sqrt(p² + q²) = √80 → p² + q² = 80.

Similarly, AD = √89. The distance from A(0,0,0) to D(r, s, t) is sqrt(r² + s² + t²) = √89 → r² + s² + t² = 89.

Also, BC = √89. The distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to C(p, q, 0) is sqrt( (p - √41)^2 + q^2 ) = √89.

So, (p - √41)^2 + q^2 = 89.

Similarly, BD = √80. The distance from B(√41, 0, 0) to D(r, s, t) is sqrt( (r - √41)^2 + s^2 + t^2 ) = √80.

So, (r - √41)^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 80.

Similarly, CD = √41. The distance from C(p, q, 0) to D(r, s, t) is sqrt( (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 + t^2 ) = √41.

So, (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 + t^2 = 41.

Alright, so we have several equations:

1. p² + q² = 80. (from AC)
2. (p - √41)^2 + q^2 = 89. (from BC)
3. r² + s² + t² = 89. (from AD)
4. (r - √41)^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 80. (from BD)
5. (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 + t^2 = 41. (from CD)

Let me try to solve these equations step by step.

First, equations 1 and 2 can be used to find p and q.

Equation 1: p² + q² = 80.

Equation 2: (p - √41)^2 + q^2 = 89.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(p - √41)^2 - p² = 89 - 80 → (p² - 2 p √41 + 41) - p² = 9 → -2 p √41 + 41 = 9 → -2 p √41 = -32 → p = (32)/(2√41) = 16/√41.

Rationalizing the denominator: p = (16√41)/41.

Now, plug p into equation 1 to find q.

p² = (256 * 41)/ (41²) ) = 256/41.

So, q² = 80 - 256/41 = (80 * 41 - 256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41.

So, q = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41).

Simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 ÷ 16 = 189. So sqrt(3024) = 4 sqrt(189).

189 factors: 9 * 21 = 9 * 3 *7. So, sqrt(189) = 3 sqrt(21).

So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).

Thus, q = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(881))/41? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait, sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4 sqrt(189). So, q = 4 sqrt(189)/sqrt(41).

But sqrt(189) is sqrt(9*21) = 3 sqrt(21). So, q = 4 * 3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41).

To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(41):

q = 12 sqrt(21 * 41)/41 = 12 sqrt(861)/41.

Wait, but 861 factors: 861 ÷ 3 = 287. 287 is 7*41. So, 861 = 3*7*41. So, sqrt(861) is sqrt(3*7*41), which can't be simplified further.

So, q = 12 sqrt(861)/41.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 *21 = 16 *9 *3*7. So, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, yes, 12 sqrt(21). So, q²=3024/41, so q = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). But to rationalize, 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(881))/41? Wait, sqrt
