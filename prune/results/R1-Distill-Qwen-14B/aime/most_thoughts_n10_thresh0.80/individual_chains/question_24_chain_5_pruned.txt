Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm. Alright, let me break this down.

First, the list is made up of positive integers. So all the numbers are at least 1.

The first condition is that the sum is 30. That gives me some constraint on what numbers I can have.

The second condition is that the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. And it's unique, so no other number can have the same frequency as 9.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median is some number, let's say m, which is an integer. But m is not present in the list.

Okay, so let's start by recalling what the median is. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer, so if it's even, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, and that integer doesn't appear in the list.

Wait, but if the median is an integer, that could happen in two ways. Either the list has an odd number of elements, so the median is the middle one, or the list has an even number of elements, and the average of the two middle numbers is an integer.

But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which would have to be 9? Wait, no. Wait, no, because the mode is 9, but the median could be something else.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the median is not 9, but some other number that's not in the list.

So the list can have either an odd number of elements or an even number. Let's consider both cases.

But first, the mode is 9, which must be unique. So 9 occurs more frequently than any other number. So, for example, if the list has multiple 9s, more than any other number.

Let me think about the median. If the median is not present in the list, that gives me a clue about the structure of the list. For example, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th term. If that term is not present in the list, that would mean all the other elements are arranged such that the (k+1)th term is missing.

Wait, but how? Because if the list is arranged in order, the (k+1)th term is definitely part of the list. So that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because in that case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If that average is an integer and not present in the list, that's possible.

So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer and is present in the list (since 9 is the mode). Wait, but in that case, the median is 9, which is present in the list. But the problem says the median is not present.

Hmm, so perhaps the two middle numbers average to some number that's not in the list. Let me think.

Wait, let's consider an even-length list. Let's say the list has 2k elements. Then the median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2.
