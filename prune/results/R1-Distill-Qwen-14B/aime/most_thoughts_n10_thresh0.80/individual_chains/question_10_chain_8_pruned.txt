Alright, so I've come across this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. So, Alice picks set A, and Bob then creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B where each B has its maximum element in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and from that, I need to determine the sum of elements in A.

First, I should probably think about how Bob constructs these sets B. Each set B is finite, nonempty, and consists of positive integers. The key condition is that the maximum element of B is in A. So, if I denote the elements of B as b₁, b₂, ..., bₖ where k ≥ 1, then bₖ is the maximum, and bₖ ∈ A.

So, for each element a in A, how many sets B have a as their maximum? Well, for a particular a, the other elements of B must be less than a. So, the number of possible subsets B with maximum a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with the element a.

Wait, no. Actually, the elements of B can be any positive integers less than a. So, for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each such a, the other elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, and since B is non-empty, we have 2^{a-1} possibilities, but wait, no—the set B must include a, so the number of possible subsets is the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with a. So, including the empty set? Wait, no, because B is non-empty, but it's allowed to have just {a}, which is a singleton. So, the number of subsets is 2^{a-1}, because each element less than a can be present or not. So, for each a, the number of B's with max a is 2^{a-1}.

But wait, hold on. Let's think more carefully. Suppose a
