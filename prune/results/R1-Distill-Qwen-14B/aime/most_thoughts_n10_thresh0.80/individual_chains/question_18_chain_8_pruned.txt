Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal, and all internal angles equal too. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are a lot of symmetries. So, maybe I can use some symmetry properties here. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about how rectangles can be formed inside such a polygon.

A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, but to get a rectangle, we need four lines that form two pairs of parallel sides, each pair perpendicular to the other. So, the key is to find sets of four lines (sides or diagonals) that form such a rectangle.

I think maybe I can model this by considering the vertices of the dodecagon. Let's label them from 0 to 11 in a clockwise manner. So, vertex 0 is connected to vertex 1 and vertex 11, vertex 1 connected to 2 and 10, and so on. 

Each rectangle is determined by four points where the sides are either sides or diagonals. But wait, not any four points will form a rectangle. They need to satisfy the condition of having opposite sides equal and all angles right angles.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors or slopes. For a rectangle to exist, the sides must be perpendicular, so their slopes should multiply to -1. But since the dodecagon is regular, the diagonals have specific slopes. Let me think about the angles.

In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is separated by 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30. So, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees. The sides correspond to steps of 1 vertex apart, but diagonals can connect vertices that are 2, 3, etc., steps apart.

Wait, perhaps instead of thinking in terms of slopes,
