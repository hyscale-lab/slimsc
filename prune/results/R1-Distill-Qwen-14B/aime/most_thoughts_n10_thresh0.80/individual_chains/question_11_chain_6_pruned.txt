Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, I could also write \( z = a + bi \) where \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \) because the magnitude squared is 16. Maybe using the exponential form would be more convenient here because it might make the multiplication and division easier.

So, let's express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because the reciprocal of \( e^{i\theta} \) is \( e^{-i\theta} \), and the magnitude becomes \( 1/4 \).

Now, let's rewrite the original expression using this substitution. The first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \), which becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute that: 75 times 4 is 300, and 117 times 4 is 468. So, this term becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \), which is \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Calculating the scalar multiplication, 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 144 divided by 4 is 36. So, this term is \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

Putting it all together, the entire expression is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, this looks like the sum of two complex exponentials. I remember that expressions like \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \) can be rewritten using Euler's formula, which states that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). So, let me try expanding both terms.

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each of these separately.

Starting with the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply out the terms:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
Now, combine like terms:
Real parts: 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
Imaginary parts: 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta

So, the first term is \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) \)

Now, the second term:

\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
Multiply out:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Combine like terms:
Real parts: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Imaginary parts: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i

So, the second term is \( (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)

Now, add the first and second terms together. Let's collect the real and imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:
\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
= (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

Imaginary parts:
\( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)
= (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta
= 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta

So, the entire expression simplifies to:
\[ (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta) \]

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on the real component:
\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies.

So, the problem now reduces to finding the maximum of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Hmm, this is a standard problem in trigonometry where you have an expression of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), and you can find its maximum by rewriting it in the form \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) or \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). The maximum value will then be \( R \).

Wait, let me make sure I get the signs right. Our expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, let me write this as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

The maximum of such an expression is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). So, let's compute that.

Compute \( A^2 = 324^2 \)
324^2 is... Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000, and 24^2=576. Then, 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. So, 324^2 = 104,976.

Compute \( B^2 = (-432)^2 = 432^2 \)
432 is 400 + 32. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 is 185,600; plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So, \( A^2 + B^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \). The square root of that is... Hmm, sqrt(291,600). Let me see.

I know that 500^2 = 250,000. 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Perfect! So, sqrt(291,600) is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs. Our expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) where A is positive and B is negative. So, when I compute the maximum, it should be the same as if both were positive because the maximum is based on the magnitude.

Wait, actually, the maximum of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), regardless of the signs of A and B.

Wait, no, actually, let's think again. The expression \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \) and \( \tan\phi = B/A \). The maximum value is R because the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1. So, the maximum of \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \) is R, and the minimum is -R.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is the same as \( 324\cos\theta + (-432)\sin\theta \). So, \( A = 324 \), \( B = -432 \). So, \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} =
