Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. The question is about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle, and the distance is like the inradius.

The problem states that this distance can be written in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, we need to find m + n + p.

First, I need to recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found by the formula:

inradius = 3 * (volume) / (sum of the areas of the faces)

So, I should calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and the areas of its four faces.

But wait, the tetrahedron isn't regular since the edges are of different lengths. However, looking at the edges, it seems like it's a symmetrical tetrahedron. Because each pair of opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid.

In such tetrahedrons, there's a property that says the volume can be calculated using the formula:

Volume = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / (72)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm confusing it with Heron's formula for triangles. Let me think.

Alternatively, for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, the volume can be calculated using another formula. I think it's related to the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a way to find the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, I need to assign the given edge lengths to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f.

Given that:
AB = CD = √41 => AB = a = √41, CD = f = √41
AC = BD = √80 => AC = b = √80, BD = e = √80
AD = BC = √89 => AD = c = √89, BC = d = √89

So, plugging in the squares:

a² = 41, b² = 80, c² = 89, d² = 89, e² = 80, f² =41

Now, let's construct the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, no, I think the order might be different. Let me check. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with points A, B, C, D is constructed with edges AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4:
