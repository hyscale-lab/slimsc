Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it might help to represent z in polar form. Since |z| is given as 4, z can be written as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things simpler because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is easier.

So, let's write z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the magnitude of 1/z is 1/|z|, and the argument is negative of z's argument.

Now, substituting z into the expression, we get:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i):

4*75 = 300; 4*117 = 468. So, that's 300 + 468i.

So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

1/4 of 96 is 24, and 1/4 of 144 is 36. So, that's 24 + 36i.

So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let's recall that for a complex number in polar form, Re[ (a + bi)e^{iθ} ] = a cosθ - b sinθ. Wait, is that right? Because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so multiplying (a + bi)(cosθ + i sinθ) gives a cosθ + a i sinθ + bi cosθ + bi^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, that's a cosθ - b sinθ + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So yes, the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ.

So, applying this to both terms:

First term real part: Re[ (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} ] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term real part: Re[ (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ} ] = 24 cos(-θ) - 36 sin(-θ).

But cos(-θ) = cosθ, and sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So, substituting:

24 cosθ - 36*(-sinθ) = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, adding both real parts together:

Total real part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ.

Wait, let me compute that:

300 +24 = 324.

-468 +36 = -432.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, so I can write it in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude. The maximum value of this expression would then be R.

Alternatively, I can compute R as sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Because for an expression a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(a^2 + b^2).

Wait, but in my case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is a cosθ + b sinθ, with a = 324 and b = -432.

So, the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Which is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000. 24^2 = 576. Then, 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2=160,000 + 25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

Wait, but 432 is 432, not 400 +32. Wait, 432
