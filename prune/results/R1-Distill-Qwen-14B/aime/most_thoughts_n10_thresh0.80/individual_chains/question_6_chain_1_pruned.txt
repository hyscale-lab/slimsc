Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g look like. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, these are absolute value functions with some transformations.

Let me think about f(x) first. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. This is like taking the absolute value of x, then subtracting 1/2, and then taking the absolute value again. So, let's visualize this. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 would shift this down by 1/2, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, any negative part after the shift will be flipped. So, parts of the graph that were below 0 will become positive.

Wait, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's find the critical points. The expression inside the outer absolute value, |x| - 1/2, is zero when |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape with vertices at these points.

Specifically, for |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So, f(x) looks like a W that's been compressed. It has a peak at x=0, y=1/2, and then slopes down to 0 at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. Wait, no. Let me think again. If |x| < 1/2, then f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So at x=0, it's 1/2. As x approaches 1/2, it goes to zero. But for |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So, at x=1/2, it's 0, and it increases linearly as x moves away from 1/2. So, the graph is actually a V shape, but with the vertex at (1/2, 0) and ( -1/2, 0), and having a peak at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, that can't be. Because when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) increases as |x| increases. So, the graph of f(x) would look like a V that's inverted, pointing downward, but actually, since it's an absolute value, it's always positive. Hmm, maybe I should sketch it.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to note that f(x) is the distance of |x| from 1/2. So, it's a transformation that creates a "W" shape or perhaps a series of Vs. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just note the key points.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So, similar to f, but with a different shift. So, when |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

So, the graph of g is V-shaped, with vertices at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, and a peak at x=0, y=1/4.

Wait, but since both f and g are functions of |x|, they are even functions, symmetric about the y-axis.

Now, moving on. The functions we're dealing with are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, these are compositions of functions, and then scaled by 4.

I think the first step is to understand the behavior of these composite functions.

Let me denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)), then 4g(h(x)) is the y function. Similarly, for the x function, let's denote k(y) = f(cos(3πy)), then 4g(k(y)) is the x function.

Wait, no, the x equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), which is x = 4g(k(y)), and the y equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), which is y = 4g(m(x)), where m(x) = f(sin(2πx)).

So, perhaps to find the intersections, we need to solve for points (x, y) such that y = 4g(m(x)) and x = 4g(k(y)).

But since both equations are interdependent, this could get complicated. Maybe it's better to look for symmetry or periodicity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the functions step by step.

First, let's consider m(x) = f(sin(2πx)) and k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

So, m(x) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Similarly, k(y) = || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |.

Then, 4g(m(x)) = 4 || m(x) - 1/4 |.

So, perhaps I can analyze the range of m(x) and k(y), then see how they are transformed through g, then scaled by 4.

Wait, let's find the range of m(x). Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. So, f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2π
