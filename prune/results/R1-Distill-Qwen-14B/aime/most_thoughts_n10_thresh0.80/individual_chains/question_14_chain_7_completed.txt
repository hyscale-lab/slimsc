Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me understand the problem correctly. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any single digit of N to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. That means if I take N, and for each digit (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replace that digit with 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7.

So, for example, if N is abcd (where a, b, c, d are digits), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives abc1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

And we're looking for the greatest such N. So, starting from 9999 and going down, we need to find the largest N that satisfies this condition.

But checking each number one by one would be time-consuming. There must be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of numbers divisible by 7. Divisible by 7 tests can be a bit tricky because there's no straightforward rule like for 3 or 9. One method is to take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But that might not be directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent N in terms of its digits. Let me denote N as:

N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d

Where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a can't be 0 since it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we change each digit to 1, we get four new numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four modified numbers, when divided by 7, the remainder is 0.

Let me denote the original number N as:

N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d

So, for each modified number, we can write:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Since all these modified numbers must be divisible by 7, I can express each of these congruences.

First, let me compute the value of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7 because that might simplify things.

Calculating:

- 1000 mod 7: Let's divide 1000 by 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.
- 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. Thus, 100≡2 mod7.
- 10 mod7: 10-7=3. So 10≡3 mod7.
- 1 mod7: 1.

So substituting these into the four congruences:

1. (6) + (2)b + (3)c + d ≡ 0 mod7
2. (6)a + (2) + (3)c + d ≡ 0 mod7
3. (6)a + (2)b + (3) + d ≡ 0 mod7
4. (6)a + (2)b + (3)c + (1) ≡ 0 mod7

So now we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

So now, I have four equations involving a, b, c, d. Let me write them out:

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 --> which is equivalent to 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod7).

Equation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7 --> 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 --> 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 --> 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7.

Hmm, so now I have four equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7 ... (1)
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod7 ... (2)
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod7 ... (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7 ... (4)

I think I can subtract some of these equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see. Let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod7

Simplify: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod7

Which is 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod7.

We can factor 2: 2*(3a - b) ≡ 4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7). So multiply both sides by 4:

(3a - b) ≡ 4*4 mod7 --> 3a - b ≡ 16 mod7 --> 16 mod7 is 2. So 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7.

So that's one equation: 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7 ... (5)

Now, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2b + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 4 - 1 mod7

Simplify: 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod7.

Factor 3: 3*(2a - c) ≡ 3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: (since 3 and 7 are coprime, inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7). Multiply both sides by 5:

2a - c ≡ 3*5 mod7 --> 2a - c ≡ 15 mod7 --> 15 mod7 is 1. So 2a - c ≡ 1 mod7 ... (6)

Next, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 6 - 1 mod7

Simplify: 6a - d ≡5 mod7.

So 6a - d ≡5 mod7 ... (7)

Now I have equations (5), (6), and (7):

(5): 3a - b ≡ 2 mod7

(6): 2a - c ≡ 1 mod7

(7): 6a - d ≡ 5 mod7

I can also try to express b, c, d in terms of a.

From (5): b ≡ 3a - 2 mod7

From (6): c ≡ 2a -1 mod7

From (7): d ≡ 6a -5 mod7

So now, I can express b, c, d in terms of a. Since a is a digit from 1 to 9 (as it's the thousands digit), we can figure out possible a values and then compute b, c, d modulo 7, and then find possible digit values.

But digits must be between 0 and 9, so when we compute b, c, d, they can be in the range 0-9.

So, for each a from 9 down to 1, we can compute b, c, d mod7, then find possible digits that fit those residues, and then check if the original number N satisfies the four conditions.

But since we want the greatest N, it's best to start with a=9 and work our way down until we find a valid N.

So let me start with a=9.

Compute:

From (5): b ≡ 3*9 - 2 mod7.

3*9=27, 27 mod7: 7*3=21, 27-21=6. So 27≡6 mod7. So 6 -2=4. So b≡4 mod7.

So b can be 4 or 11, but since it's a digit, b=4 or 11 is invalid, so only b=4.

From (6): c ≡ 2*9 -1 mod7.

2*9=18, 18 mod7: 14 is 2*7, 18-14=4. So 4 -1=3. So c≡3 mod7. So c can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so c=3.

From (7): d ≡6*9 -5 mod7.

6*9=54, 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So 5 -5=0. So d≡0 mod7. So d can be 0 or 7.

So d=0 or 7.

So with a=9, b=4, c=3, d can be 0 or 7.

So possible Ns are 9430 and 9437.

Now, we need to check if these Ns satisfy the original condition: changing any digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

Let's first check N=9437.

Check each modified number:

1. Changing a to 1: 1437. Is 1437 divisible by 7?

Let's compute 1437 ÷7.

7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2, so remainder 2. Not divisible. So N=9437 is invalid.

Next, check N=9430.

1. Changing a to 1: 1430.

Check 1430 ÷7. 7*204=1428. 1430-1428=2. Remainder 2. Not divisible. So N=9430 is invalid.

So a=9 doesn't work. Proceeding to a=8.

a=8.

Compute:

From (5): b≡3*8 -2 mod7.

3*8=24, 24 mod7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3. 3 -2=1. So b≡1 mod7. So b can be 1 or 8.

From (6): c≡2*8 -1 mod7.

2*8=16, 16 mod7=2. 2 -1=1. So c≡1 mod7. So c=1 or 8.

From (7): d≡6*8 -5 mod7.

6*8=48, 48 mod7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. 6-5=1. So d≡1 mod7. So d=1 or 8.

So possible a=8, b can be 1 or 8, c can be 1 or 8, d can be 1 or 8.

We need to form N as 8b c d.

But since we are looking for the greatest N, we should maximize each digit starting from b, then c, then d.

So first, try b=8, c=8, d=8: N=8888.

But wait, d is either 1 or 8. So the maximum for d is 8.

So let's check N=8888.

Check each modified number:

1. Change a to 1: 1888. Check divisibility by 7.

1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible. So 8888 is invalid.

Next, try N=8881.

Check:

1. Change a to 1: 1881. 1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible.

So N=8881 is invalid.

Next, try N=8818.

Change a to 1: 1818.

1818 ÷7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible.

Not good.

Next, N=8811.

Change a to 1: 1811.

1811 ÷7: 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible.

Hmm, not working.

Next, try N=8188.

Change a to 1: 1188.

1188 ÷7: 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible.

No good.

Next, N=8181.

Change a to 1: 1181.

1181 ÷7: 7*168=1176, 1181-1176=5. Remainder 5.

Still not.

Next, N=8118.

Change a to 1: 1118.

1118 ÷7: 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5. Remainder 5.

Hmm, same issue.

Next, N=8111.

Change a to 1: 1111. 1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Remainder 5.

Still 5. Hmm, seems like changing a to 1 gives a number with remainder 5 mod7. Which suggests that none of these Ns with a=8 satisfy the condition.

Wait, but maybe I need to check the other modified numbers as well. Maybe changing a to 1 doesn't necessarily have to be the first check, but all four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

But in the case of a=8, b=8, c=8, d=8, all four modified numbers are:

1. 1888: Not divisible by7
2. 8188: Let's check if that's divisible by7. 8188 ÷7: 7*1169=8183, 8188-8183=5. Remainder 5. Not divisible.
3. 8818: Not divisible as checked earlier.
4. 8881: Not divisible.

So N=8888 doesn't work. Next, try other combinations where maybe a=8 and b=1.

Wait, no, we tried b=8 first as that gives a higher N. But perhaps with b=1, c=8, d=8: N=8188. But already checked that.

Alternatively, maybe a=8, b=1, c=1, d=1: N=8111. But changing a to 1 gives 1111, which isn't divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps a=8 doesn't work because changing a to 1 gives a number that's 5 mod7, as seen in all cases. So maybe a=8 is invalid.

So move on to a=7.

a=7.

Compute b, c, d.

From (5): b≡3*7 -2 mod7.

3*7=21, 21 mod7=0. 0 -2= -2≡5 mod7. So b≡5 mod7. So b=5 or 12, but 12 is invalid. So b=5.

From (6): c≡2*7 -1 mod7.

2*7=14≡0 mod7. 0 -1= -1≡6 mod7. So c≡6 mod7. So c=6 or 13, but 13 invalid. So c=6.

From (7): d≡6*7 -5 mod7.

6*7=42≡0 mod7. 0 -5= -5≡2 mod7. So d≡2 mod7. So d=2 or 9.

So possible Ns are with a=7, b=5, c=6, d=2 or 9. So N=7562 and 7569.

Check the highest N first: 7569.

Check each modified number:

1. Change a to 1: 1569. Check divisibility by7.

1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. Remainder 1. Not divisible. So invalid.

Next, check N=7562.

Change a to 1: 1562.

1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Remainder 1. Not divisible. So invalid.

So a=7 doesn't work.

Proceed to a=6.

a=6.

Compute:

From (5): b≡3*6 -2 mod7.

3*6=18, 18 mod7=4. 4 -2=2. So b≡2 mod7. So b=2 or 9.

From (6): c≡2*6 -1 mod7.

2*6=12≡5 mod7. 5 -1=4. So c≡4 mod7. So c=4 or 11→ invalid. So c=4.

From (7): d≡6*6 -5 mod7.

6*6=36≡1 mod7. 1 -5= -4≡3 mod7. So d≡3 mod7. So d=3 or 10→ invalid. So d=3.

So N is 6b c d.

To maximize N, set b=9, c=4, d=3. So N=6943.

Check each modified number:

1. Change a to1: 1943.

Check 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. Remainder 4. Not divisible. So invalid.

Next, try b=2, c=4, d=3: N=6243.

Check:

Change a to1: 1243. 1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Remainder 4. Not divisible.

So a=6 doesn't work.

Proceed to a=5.

a=5.

Compute:

From (5): b≡3*5 -2 mod7.

3*5=15≡1 mod7. 1 -2= -1≡6 mod7. So b≡6 mod7. So b=6 or 13→ invalid. So b=6.

From (6): c≡2*5 -1 mod7.

2*5=10≡3 mod7. 3 -1=2. So c≡2 mod7. So c=2 or 9.

From (7): d≡6*5 -5 mod7.

6*5=30≡2 mod7. 2 -5= -3≡4 mod7. So d=4 or 11→ invalid. So d=4.

So possible Ns: a=5, b=6, c can be 2 or9, d=4.

Maximize N: set c=9, d=4. So N=5694.

Check each modified number:

1. Change a to1: 1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Exactly, so divisible by7.

2. Change b to1: 5194.

Check 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly, divisible by7.

3. Change c to1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly, divisible by7.

4. Change d to1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Exactly, divisible by7.

Wait, so all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So N=5694 satisfies the condition.

But wait, before finalizing, let me check if there's a larger N with a=5. Because when c=9, d=4, we get N=5694. If c=2, then N=5624, which is smaller. So 5694 is the largest for a=5.

But wait, before accepting that, I should check if a=5 is the best possible. Because maybe a=6,7,8,9 didn't work, so a=5 is the next best. But let's see if for a=5, there exists a higher N than 5694.

Wait, when a=5, b=6 (max), c=9 (max), d=4 (max). So 5694 is the maximum possible for a=5. So perhaps this is our N.

But just to be thorough, let me check other a values to make sure.

Wait, I skipped a=4, but maybe a=5 is the highest possible.

But let's confirm whether a=5 is indeed the maximum. Wait, a=6,7,8,9 didn't work, so yes, a=5 is the highest possible.

But just to make sure, let me check N=5694 in all four modified forms.

1. 1694 ÷7: 1694 /7=242. So yes, divisible.
2. 5194 ÷7: 5194 /7=742. Yes.
3. 5614 ÷7: 5614 /7=802. Yes.
4. 5691 ÷7: 5691 /7=813. Yes.

All four numbers are divisible by7. So N=5694 is a valid number.

But wait, is there a larger N? For example, maybe a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the largest. But perhaps if d is higher? But d is fixed by the modulo condition. For a=5, d must be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So d=4.

Is there a way to get a higher N with a=5? Like, perhaps with higher c or d? Well, c=9 is the maximum for c when a=5, and d=4.

So N=5694 seems to be the maximum.

Wait, but earlier, when a=8 and b=8, c=8, d=8: N=8888, but it didn't work because changing a to1 gave 1888, which wasn't divisible by7. So maybe 5694 is the answer.

Wait, but I can check if N=5694 is indeed the maximum possible, or if perhaps another N with a=5, but higher digits.

Wait, 5694: a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. Any higher combination with a=5 would require b=6, c=9, d=4. So that's the highest for a=5.

But let me check if a=5 is indeed the maximum possible, or if perhaps a=6,7,8,9 have other combinations that might work.

Wait, when a=6, I had b=2 or9, c=4, d=3. The maximum N was 6943, but when I checked, changing a to1 gave 1943, which had a remainder of4. So it didn't work.

Similarly, for a=7, N=7569 and 7562 both failed.

a=8: N=8888 and others didn't work.

a=9: N=9437 and 9430 didn't work.

So a=5 is the highest possible a that works.

So N=5694.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by1000.

So N=5694.

Divide by1000: 5694 ÷1000=5 with a remainder of 694.

So Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm that N=5694 is indeed the largest possible. Because perhaps a=5, but with b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum. But perhaps I can find a larger N.

Wait, perhaps if other digits can be higher, but still satisfy the conditions.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that when changing any digit to1, the number must be divisible by7. So, for example, changing the thousands digit to1 gives a number that's divisible by7. So, 1bcd ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit: a1cd ≡0 mod7.

Changing the tens digit: ab1d ≡0 mod7.

Changing the units digit: abc1 ≡0 mod7.

So, all four modified numbers must be divisible by7.

In the case of N=5694, these modified numbers are:

1. 1694: divisible by7.
2. 5194: divisible by7.
3. 5614: divisible by7.
4. 5691: divisible by7.

So, all four are divisible.

But is there a higher N than 5694 that satisfies this?

Wait, let me think: perhaps I can find another N with a=5, but higher digits in other places. For example, if a=5, but b=7 or higher, but wait, from the earlier equations, when a=5, b must be6 mod7. So if a=5, b can be6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So the maximum b is6.

Similarly, c is determined by a: c=2 mod7, so c can be2 or9. So c=9 is higher.

d is 4 mod7, so d=4 or11→ invalid. So d=4.

So N=5694 is indeed the maximum for a=5.

But wait, maybe a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest.

Alternatively, maybe another N with a=5, but higher digits. Wait, a=5, b=6 is the maximum, c=9 is maximum, d=4. So yes, 5694 is the highest.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe another a=5, but with different digits.

Wait, for a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4: N=5624. Which is smaller than 5694.

So yes, 5694 is the highest.

Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose I have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Is there a way to have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4+7=11? No, because d must be a digit. So 4 is the maximum.

Thus, N=5694 is the greatest four-digit number with the required property.

Thus, Q=5, R=694. So Q+R=5+694=699.

But wait, just to make sure, is there a possibility that another N with a=5, but higher in some digit, could satisfy the conditions?

Wait, for example, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

If I try to set d=11, it's invalid. So no. So yes, 5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps another combination where a=5, but with different b, c, d.

Wait, but the equations are strict: for a=5, b must be6, c must be2 or9, d must be4. So to maximize N, set b=6, c=9, d=4.

So N=5694 is correct.

Thus, Q+R is 5 + 694 = 699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, we compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Represent \( N \) in terms of its digits:**
   \[
   N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d
   \]
   where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits (0-9), and \( a \neq 0 \).

2. **Conditions for divisibility by 7:**
   - Changing \( a \) to 1: \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - Changing \( b \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - Changing \( c \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - Changing \( d \) to 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

3. **Simplify using modulo 7:**
   - \( 1000 \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 100 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)

4. **Formulate congruences:**
   - \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

5. **Solve the system of congruences:**
   - Subtract equations to eliminate variables and express \( b, c, d \) in terms of \( a \).
   - Determine possible values for \( a, b, c, d \) that satisfy all conditions.

6. **Maximize \( N \):**
   - Start with \( a = 9 \) and decrease until a valid \( N \) is found.
   - For \( a = 5 \), the valid \( N \) is 5694, which satisfies all conditions.

7. **Compute \( Q \) and \( R \):**
   - \( N = 5694 \)
   - \( Q = 5 \) (quotient when divided by 1000)
   - \( R = 694 \) (remainder when divided by 1000)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{699}
\]
