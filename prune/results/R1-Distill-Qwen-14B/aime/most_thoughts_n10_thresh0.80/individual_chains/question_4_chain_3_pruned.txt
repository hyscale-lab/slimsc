Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of how Alice plays. Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Both players have two choices each turn: remove 1 or 4 tokens. The key here is to figure out the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. I'll denote that a position n is a winning position (W) if the current player can force a win, and a losing position (L) otherwise.

Base cases:
- n=0: Well, the game is already over, but if a player is faced with n=0, they can't move and thus lose. But actually, n=0 is a losing position because you can't make a move. Wait, but the last token taken wins, so if n=0, the previous player took the last token and wins. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my thinking.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the player about to make a move. So when n=0, the player can't move, so that's a losing position. But since the game ends when the last token is taken, the player who takes the last token wins, so the position just before that (n=1 or n=4) might be winning positions.

Let me try to model the positions starting from small n.

For n=1:
- Current player takes 1 token and wins. So W.

n=2:
- Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Or take 4, which isn't possible. So the only move is to 1, which is a W for the opponent. So n=2 is L.

Wait, no. Wait, if I leave n=1, the opponent can take it and win. So n=2 is a losing position because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win.

n=3:
- Current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which we just determined is L for the opponent
