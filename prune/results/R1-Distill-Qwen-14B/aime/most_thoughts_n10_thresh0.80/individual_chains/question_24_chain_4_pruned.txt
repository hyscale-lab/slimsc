Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The problem says:

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

Alright, so I need to construct such a list and then calculate the sum of the squares. But wait, the problem doesn't give the specific list; it just gives some constraints. So my job is to figure out what the list must look like based on these constraints and then compute the sum.

Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I understand each property.

1. **Sum of the items is 30**: That means if I add up all the numbers in the list, the total is 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. Also, it's unique, meaning no other number has the same frequency as 9.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. For an even-numbered list, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer and it's not present in the list. Hmm, that's an interesting point.

So, let's try to approach this step by step.

First, let's think about the mode. The mode is 9, and it's unique. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. Let's assume the list has n elements. The number of times 9 appears must be greater than the count of any other number.

Next, the sum of all elements is 30. So, if I denote the number of 9s as k, then the sum contributed by the 9s is 9k. The remaining sum (30 - 9k) must be distributed among the other numbers in the list.

The median not being in the list is a bit tricky. Let's think about the median. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. But in this case, the median is an integer not present in the list. So, for an odd-length list, the median would be an integer not in the list, which is possible only if the two middle numbers average to a number that's not in the list.

Wait, but the median has to be a positive integer. So, let's consider both cases: when the list has an odd number of elements and when it's even.

Let me figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the length as n.

Since the sum is 30 and all elements are positive integers, the minimum possible length is when all elements are 1, so 30 elements. But that's probably not the case here because of the mode. Alternatively, the maximum possible length would be 30 (all ones), but with the mode being 9, which is larger, the list must have some length where 9s are included, but not too many to exceed the sum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible values of n. Let's consider that n must be such that the median is not in the list. Let's think about the implications.

Suppose the list has an odd number of elements, say 2m+1. Then the median is the (m+1)th term. If the median is not present in the list, that would mean that the (m+1)th term is a number that isn't in the list. But wait, all the elements in the list are positive integers, and the list is
