Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD, and all the edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point is called the incenter, right? It's like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle, where the distances to all sides are equal.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the tetrahedron isn't regular, it's just that opposite edges are equal. Hmm, so it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it's called an isohedral or something? Not sure, but maybe I can find its volume using coordinates.

Setting up coordinates might be a good idea. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that makes calculations easier. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can place the points symmetrically. Let me think.

Let’s place the tetrahedron in 3D space such that:

- Let’s put point A at (a, b, c)
- Point B at (-a, -b, c)
- Point C at (-a, b, -c)
- Point D at (a, -b, -c)

This setup is symmetric in a way that opposite edges will be equal. Let me check if this works.

Calculating AB: The distance between A (a,b,c) and B (-a,-b,c). So, the distance is sqrt[ (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0^2 ] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2 sqrt(a² + b²). Similarly, CD is the distance between C (-a,b,-c) and D (a,-b,-c). That's sqrt[ (2a)^2 + ( -2b )^2 + 0^2 ] = same as AB. So, AB=CD=2 sqrt(a² + b²). But in the problem, AB=CD= sqrt(41). So, 2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41). Therefore, sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)/2, so a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, let's compute AC. Point A is (a,b,c), point C is (-a,b,-c). Distance is sqrt[ (2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2 ] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(a² + c²). Similarly, BD is sqrt[ (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 ]? Wait, no. Wait, points B (-a,-b,c) and D (a,-b,-c). So distance BD is sqrt[ (2a)^2 + 0 + ( -2c )^2 ] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = same as AC. So AC=BD=2 sqrt(a² + c²). In the problem, AC=BD=sqrt(80). So 2 sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80) → sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)/2 → a² + c² = 80/4 = 20.

Similarly, BC: point B (-a,-b,c) to C (-a,b,-c). Distance is sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (-2c)^2 ] = sqrt(4b² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(b² + c²). Similarly, AD: point A (a,b,c) to D (a,-b,-c). Distance is sqrt[0 + ( -2b )^2 + (-2c)^2 ] = same as BC. So BC=AD=2 sqrt(b² + c²). Given that BC=AD= sqrt(89), so 2 sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89) → sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)/2 → b² + c² = 89/4.

So, now I have three equations:

1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

I can solve these equations for a², b², c².

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - (41/4) → c² - b² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.

But from equation 3, b² + c² = 89/4. So now I have:

c² - b² = 39/4

c² + b² = 89/4

If I add these two equations: 2c² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 =32 → c²=16 → c=4 (since we can take positive, as coordinates can be oriented accordingly).

Then from equation 3: b² + 16 = 89/4 → b² = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 =25/4 → b=5/2.

From equation 1: a² + (25/4) =41/4 → a²=41/4 -25/4=16/4=4 → a=2.

So, a=2, b=5/2, c=4.

Therefore, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Okay, so now with coordinates, maybe I can compute the volume.

To find the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates, I can use the scalar triple product formula. The volume is | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6.

Wait, but let me see. Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: Since all opposite edges are equal, this is a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron? Or maybe it's a disphenoid.

Yes, actually, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula involving the squares of the edges.

Wait, but I think the formula is Volume = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / (  something ). Wait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / ( 8 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using coordinates.

So, let's compute vectors.

Let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, point A is (2, 5/2, 4). Point B is (-2, -5/2, 4). So vector AB is B - A = (-4, -5, 0).

Similarly, vector AC is C - A = (-4, 0, -8).

Vector AD is D - A = (0, -5, 0).

Wait, so to compute the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD).

First, compute AC × AD.

AC is (-4, 0, -8)
AD is (0, -5, 0)

Cross product:

|i     j     k|
|-4    0    -8|
|0    -5     0|

= i*(0*0 - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*0 - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

= i*(0 - 40) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)

= (-40, 0, 20)

Now, AB is (-4, -5, 0). So, AB · (AC × AD) is:

(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*0 + 0*20 = 160 + 0 + 0 = 160.

So the scalar triple product is 160, so the volume is |160| / 6 = 160/6 = 80/3.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the vectors.

Wait, vector AB: from A (2, 5/2, 4) to B (-2, -5/2, 4). So delta x: -4, delta y: -5, delta z: 0. So AB is (-4, -5, 0). Correct.

Vector AC: from A (2, 5/2, 4) to C (-2, 5/2, -4). Delta x: -4, delta y:0, delta z: -8. So (-4, 0, -8). Correct.

Vector AD: from A (2, 5/2,4) to D (2, -5/2, -4). Delta x:0, delta y: -5, delta z: -8. So (0, -5, -8). Wait a minute! In my earlier calculation, I thought AD was (0, -5, 0), but that's incorrect. Because from A (2,5/2,4) to D (2,-5/2,-4): delta z is -8, not 0. So AD is (0, -5, -8), not (0, -5, 0). So that cross product is different.

Oh no, I made a mistake in computing AD. Let me correct that.

So, AC is (-4, 0, -8), AD is (0, -5, -8).

So cross product AC × AD:

|i     j     k|
|-4    0    -8|
|0    -5    -8|

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0 - (40) = -40

j: - [ (32) - 0 ] = -32

k: 20 - 0 = 20

So cross product is (-40, -32, 20)

Then AB · (AC × AD) is:

AB is (-4, -5, 0)

Dot product: (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320.

So volume is |320| / 6 = 320 /6 = 160/3.

Wait, that's different from before. So the correct volume is 160/3.

Wait, but when I first did the cross product, I had AD as (0, -5, 0), which was wrong because AD is (0, -5, -8). So the
