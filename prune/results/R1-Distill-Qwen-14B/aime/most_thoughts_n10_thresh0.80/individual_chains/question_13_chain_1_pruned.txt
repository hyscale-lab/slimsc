Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem is about figuring out how long her walk takes when she walks at a different speed, specifically s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. The answer needs to include the time she spends in the coffee shop, which is t minutes.

So, the problem gives me two different scenarios. In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop. In the second scenario, she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes at the shop.

My goal is to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time. 

Let me break this down. I think I need to set up some equations based on the information given. Since the distance is the same in both cases (9 km), I can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

But wait, the time given includes both walking time and the coffee shop time. So, I need to be careful to separate the walking time from the total time.

Let me denote:

- When speed is s km/h, total time is 4 hours. So, walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours. Wait, but t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I should convert all units to be consistent. Maybe convert everything to minutes or hours. Hmm.

Let me think in hours. 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 144 minutes. But maybe it's easier to keep everything in hours for the walking time. So, t is in minutes; to convert it to hours, I divide by 60. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking time + coffee time = total time.

Walking time is distance divided by speed, so 9/s hours. Plus t/60 hours equals 4 hours. 

Similarly, in the second scenario, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, plus t/60 hours equals 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 2 hours and 24 minutes to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables: s and t. I can solve these equations to find s and t, and then use them to find the total time when walking at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write down the equations again:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, (9/s + t/60) - (9/(s+2) + t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify left side: 9/s - 9/(s+2) + (t/60 - t/60) = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Factor out the 9: 9(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2):

1/s - 1/(s+2) = (s+2 - s)/(s(s+2)) ) = 2/(s(s+2))

So, 9 * (2)/(s(s+2)) ) = 1.6

Simplify:

18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):

18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Divide both sides by 1.6:

18 / 1.6 = s(s+2)

Calculate 18 / 1.6:

1.6 goes into 18 how many times? 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, so 18 - 17.6 = 0.4. So 11.25? Wait, wait, maybe easier to compute as fractions.

18 divided by 1.6 is the same as 180 divided
