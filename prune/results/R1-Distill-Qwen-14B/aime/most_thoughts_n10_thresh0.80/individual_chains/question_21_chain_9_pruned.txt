Okay, so I came across this math problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down. Let me start by understanding the problem statement properly.

The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. So, given an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_{13}, and 6 + 3 equals √81, which is 9.

Our task is to find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, so I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the two conditions above.

Let me structure this step by step.

First, I need to represent n in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be less than b. So, a and c are integers such that 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals √n. So, a + c = √n.

But n is also equal to a*b + c, so we have:

a + c = √(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can collect terms involving a and terms involving c.

Looking at the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me bring everything to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

I can write this as:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me denote it as:

A*a² + B*a + C = 0,

where A = 1,

B = 2c - b,

C = c² - c.

Since a must be an integer (specifically, a digit in base b, so 1 ≤ a < b), the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for a to be an integer. The discriminant D is given by:

D = B² - 4*A*C

Substituting B, A, and C:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c² - c)

Let me compute this:

D = (4c² - 4b c + b²) - (4c² - 4c)

Simplify term by term:

4c² cancels with -4c².

So, we have:

-4b c + b² + 4c.

So,

D = b² - 4b c + 4c

Hmm, that's the discriminant.

For the quadratic equation to have integer solutions, D must be a perfect square.

So, we have D = b² - 4b c + 4c = k², where k is some integer.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find another approach.

Alternatively, since a and c are digits in base b, they satisfy 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b. And n must be a perfect square since √n is an integer (as a + c is an integer). So, n must be a perfect square, say m², where m = a + c.

So, n = m², and n = a*b + c. Therefore:

a*b + c = m²

But m = a + c, so substituting:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Which brings us back to the same equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

So, perhaps I can rearrange this as:

a*b = a² + 2ac + c² - c

Then,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Simplify the numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + 2ac + (c² - c)

Factor this as:

= a² + 2ac + c(c - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me try to factor the numerator differently.

Wait, the numerator can be rewritten as:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

But m = a + c, so:

b = (m² - c)/a

But since m = a + c, we can write c = m - a.

Substituting back:

b = (m² - (m - a)) / a = (m² - m + a)/a = (m² - m)/a + 1

Hmm, interesting. So,

b = (m² - m)/a + 1

But since b must be an integer, (m² - m) must be divisible by a. So, a must be a divisor of (m² - m).

Alternatively, since a is a positive integer less than b, and m = a + c, which is at least 1 (since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0). So, m can vary from 1 upwards, but with a and c such that a < b and c < b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider m as the square root, so m = a + c. Since n = m², and n must be a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b and b² - 1.

Wait, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c, where a >=1 and c >=0. So, the minimum n is b (when a=1, c=0) and the maximum is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1.

So, m² must be in [b, b² - 1].

Therefore, m is in [sqrt(b), sqrt(b² - 1)].

Which is approximately [sqrt(b), b - something small]. So, m ranges from roughly sqrt(b) up to about b.

But m must be an integer, so m can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b² - 1)).

Wait, sqrt(b² - 1) is less than b, so the maximum integer m is b - 1.

Wait, let me take an example. For base 13, n=81=6*13 +3. Then m = 6+3=9. So, m=9, which is less than b=13.

So, m can be up to b - 1.

But let's get back. So, given that m = a + c, and n = m² = a*b + c.

We can express this as:

a*b + c = m²

But m = a + c, so substituting:

a
