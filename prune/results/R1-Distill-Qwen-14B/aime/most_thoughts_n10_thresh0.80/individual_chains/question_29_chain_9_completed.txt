Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me try to visualize the problem first. There are two rectangles, so each has four right angles. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. Similarly, EFGH is also a rectangle.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that means they lie on a straight line. Hmm, so E and F are points on the line that also includes D and C. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. Interesting.

Given the lengths:
- BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of the sides. So, in rectangle ABCD, BC would be the height or the width? Let me think. In rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, so AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side. So, if AB is 107, then BC is 16. So, sides are AB = 107, BC = 16, CD = 107, DA = 16.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is a side, FG is the adjacent side. So, the sides of EFGH would be EF = 184, FG = 17, GH = 184, HE = 17.

Now, trying to sketch this out mentally. Let's imagine rectangle ABCD. Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Maybe putting point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, with AB =107 and BC=16.

Wait, but how are the points arranged? Let me clarify the rectangle notation. In rectangle ABCD, the points are in order, so AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, and so on. So, in terms of coordinates, if I place D at (0,0), then since DC is length AB, which is 107, but wait, no. Wait, ABCD: AB is one side, BC is another. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is AB=107. Then, since BC=16, point B would be at (107,16), and point A would be at (0,16).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. If D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the x-axis, so C is at (a,0). Then, from C to B is upwards, so B is at (a, b), and from B to A is leftwards to (0, b), and then from A to D is down to (0,0). So, AB is the vertical side with length b, and BC is the horizontal side with length a. Wait, but in the problem, AB=107 and BC=16. So, AB is vertical, meaning that the height is 107, and BC is horizontal, so the width is 16. So, in this case, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0), B at (16,107), and A at (0,107). That makes sense.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH. Let me assign coordinates to that as well. But I'm not sure where E and F are located. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E and F are on the same line as D and C. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Let me think about this line.

Given that D is at (0,0) and C is at (16,0), the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (16,0). So, points E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis. But wait, E and F are part of rectangle EFGH. Hmm.

Wait, E is a corner of rectangle EFGH, and so is F. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent. So, EF is 184, and FG is 17. So, point E is connected to F, which is connected to G, and then to H, and back to E.

Now, points E and F are on the x-axis. Wait, no. Because if E and F are on the line DC, which is the x-axis, then EF would be along the x-axis as well. But EF is a side of the rectangle EFGH, which is 184 units long. So, if EF is along the x-axis, then E and F would be 184 units apart on the x-axis. But since D is at (0,0) and C is at (16,0), the entire line DC is only 16 units long. So, E and F can't both be on DC because EF is 184, which is way longer than DC.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm misassigning the positions. Maybe the line DC isn't the x-axis. Wait, let me rethink the coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe I should assign D at (0,0), C at (16,0), B at (16,107), and A at (0,107). Then, the line DC is along the x-axis, from (0,0) to (16,0). So, E and F are on this line. But E and F are part of rectangle EFGH. So, E is a point on DC, and F is another point on DC, but EF is 184, which is much longer than DC's length of 16. So, that can't happen.

Wait, maybe E and F are not necessarily between D and C? The problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but doesn't specify the order. So, perhaps the order is D, E, F, C on the line. Or maybe E is on one side, F on the other. Hmm. Let me think.

If D, E, C, F are collinear, then the order could be D---E---C---F or D---E---F---C or some other order. But given that DC is 16 units, EF is 184 units, which is much longer. So, if E and F are on the same line as D and C, which is 16 units, then for EF to be 184, they must lie outside the segment DC on the same line.

So, suppose the line is the x-axis, with D at (0,0) and C at (16,0). Then, E and F are on the x-axis, but beyond D or beyond C. Because EF is 184, so they have to be separated by that much.

Wait, but if E and F are on the same line as D and C, then EFGH is a rectangle, which suggests that EF is one side, and FG is perpendicular to it. So, if EF is on the x-axis, then FG would be vertical.

But in rectangle EFGH, FG is 17 units. So, if F is on the x-axis, then G would be at (F_x + 17, F_y) or something? Wait, no, since FG is 17, which is a side. Wait, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, if EF is horizontal, then FG would be vertical. So, point G would be at (F_x, F_y +17) if FG is upwards, or (F_x, F_y -17) if downwards.

But since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent and perpendicular. So, if EF is along the x-axis, then FG must be along the y-axis. So, if F is at (x, 0), then G is at (x, 17) or (x, -17). But the rectangle's orientation depends on the direction.

But we also know that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, point A is at (0,107), D is at (0,0), H is a corner of rectangle EFGH, and G is the next corner.

Hmm, so if G is part of the rectangle EFGH, then its position depends on where E and F are.

Wait, perhaps I can assign coordinates to E and F. Let me suppose that E is to the left of D along the x-axis, so E is at (-a, 0), and F is at (16 + b, 0), so that the distance EF is 184. So, the distance from E (-a, 0) to F (16 + b, 0) is 184. Therefore, (16 + b) - (-a) = 184, so a + b = 184 -16 = 168. So, a + b = 168.

But wait, if E is at (-a,0) and F is at (16 + b, 0), then the distance EF is (16 + b) - (-a) = 16 + a + b = 184. So, a + b = 168, as above.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG =17. So, since EF is along the x-axis from E (-a,0) to F (16 + b,0), the next point G would be either 17 units above or below F. So, G is at (16 + b, 17) or (16 + b, -17). Similarly, H would be at (-a,17) or (-a, -17), completing the rectangle.

But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, let's see where H and G are. Point A is at (0,107), D is at (0,0), and H and G are either at (-a,17) and (16 + b,17) or (-a,-17) and (16 + b,-17).

Wait, but if H and G are at ( -a, 17) and (16 + b,17), then they lie on the same horizontal line. Similarly, if they are at ( -a, -17) and (16 + b, -17). Alternatively, they could be vertical if EF is vertical, but I think I've already assumed EF is horizontal.

But in any case, the four points A (0,107), D (0,0), H, G must lie on a circle. So, I can use the condition that these four points are concyclic, which will give me an equation to solve.

Let me suppose that H is at (-a,17) and G is at (16 + b,17). So, both H and G are at y=17. Then, points A (0,107), D (0,0), H (-a,17), G (16 + b,17) lie on a circle.

Alternatively, if H and G are at (-a,-17) and (16 + b,-17), then points A and D are at (0,107) and (0,0), which are above and on the x-axis, while H and G are below. Hmm, but in that case, four points would need to lie on a circle, but since A is at (0,107), which is quite high, and H and G are at y=-17, it might complicate the circle's position.

Alternatively, if we choose H and G to be at ( -a,17) and (16 + b,17), then all four points A, D, H, G would lie on a circle. Let's go with that.

So, points on the circle are A(0,107), D(0,0), H(-a,17), G(16 + b,17). Now, to find a and b, we can use the fact that these four points lie on a circle.

First, since A, D, H, G are concyclic, we can use the general equation of a circle passing through three of them and then check the fourth.

Let me write the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Since point D(0,0) lies on the circle, substituting into the equation:

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Next, point A(0,107) lies on the circle:

0² + 107² + D*0 + E*107 = 0 => (107)^2 + 107E = 0 => 107E = -107^2 => E = -107.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² + Dx -107y = 0.

Now, point H(-a,17) lies on the circle:

(-a)^2 + 17^2 + D*(-a) -107*17 = 0 => a² + 289 - aD - 1819 = 0 => a² - aD - 1530 = 0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, point G(16 + b,17) lies on the circle:

(16 + b)^2 + 17^2 + D*(16 + b) -107*17 = 0.

Expanding:

(256 + 32b + b²) + 289 + 16D + Db - 1819 = 0.

Combine like terms:

256 + 289 = 545; 545 + 16D = 545 +16D; 32b + Db; 545 +16D +32b + Db + b² -1819 =0.

Subtract 1819:

545 - 1819 = -1274; So, -1274 +16D +32b + Db + b² = 0.

So, b² + (32 + D) b + 16D -1274 =0. (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations: Equation 1: a² - aD -1530 =0, and Equation 2: b² + (32 + D) b +16D -1274=0.

We also know from earlier that a + b = 168.

So, a = 168 - b.

So, I can substitute a in Equation 1.

Equation 1: (168 - b)^2 - (168 - b) D -1530 = 0.

Let me expand this:

(168^2 - 2*168*b + b²) - (168D - b D) -1530 =0.

Compute 168^2: 168 *168. Let me compute 170^2 = 28900, subtract 2*170 +1 (since (170 -2)^2 = 168^2) = 28900 - 340 + 4 = 28564.

So, 28564 - 336b + b² -168D + b D -1530 =0.

Combine constants: 28564 -1530 = 27034.

So, 27034 -336b + b² -168D + b D =0.

Let me rearrange terms:

b² + (-336 + D) b + (-168 D) +27034 =0.

That's Equation 1 after substitution.

Now, Equation 2 is:

b² + (32 + D) b +16D -1274 =0.

So, now we have two equations:

1. b² + (D -336) b + (-168 D +27034) =0.

2. b² + (D +32) b + (16 D -1274) =0.

Since both are equal to zero, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[ b² + (D -336) b + (-168 D +27034) ] - [ b² + (D +32) b + (16 D -1274) ] =0.

Simplify:

b² - b² + (D -336 - D -32) b + (-168 D +27034 -16 D +1274) =0.

Simplify each term:

Coefficient of b: (D -336 - D -32) = (-368).

Constant term: (-168D -16D) = -184D; and 27034 +1274 =28308.

So, -368 b -184 D +28308 =0.

Divide both sides by -4 to simplify:

92b +46 D -7077 =0.

So, 92b +46 D =7077.

Divide both sides by 46:

2b + D =7077 /46.

Let me compute 7077 ÷46.

46*150= 6900. 7077-6900=177.

46*3=138. 177-138=39.

46*0.847...≈39. So, 46*3.85≈177.

Wait, let me compute 46*153 =46*(150+3)=6900+138=7038. 7077 -7038=39.

So, 7077=46*153 +39.

So, 7077/46=153 +39/46=153 + 39/46.

Simplify 39/46: both divisible by 13? 39 ÷13=3, 46 ÷13≈3.538. So, 39/46=3/ (46/13)=3/(3.538). Hmm, maybe leave it as 39/46.

So, 2b + D =153 +39/46.

Wait, but this is getting messy. Maybe I can write 2b + D = (7077)/46.

But perhaps 7077 divided by 46 is an integer. Let me check:

46*153=7038, 7077-7038=39.

So, 7077=46*153 +39. So, 7077/46=153 +39/46=153.8478...

Hmm, not an integer. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate the subtraction step.

From Equation 1 after substitution:

b² + (D -336) b + (-168 D +27034) =0.

Equation 2:

b² + (D +32) b + (16 D -1274) =0.

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

[b² - b²] + [(D -336) - (D +32)] b + [(-168 D +27034) - (16 D -1274)] =0.

So, coefficient of b:

(D -336 - D -32) = (-368).

Constant term:

-168 D +27034 -16 D +1274 = (-184 D) +28308.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the equation becomes:

-368 b -184 D +28308 =0.

Divide by -4:

92 b +46 D -7077=0.

So, 46 D +92 b =7077.

Divide both sides by 46:

D + 2b =7077/46.

Let me compute 46 x 153 = 7038, as before.

7077 -7038=39, so 7077=46*153 +39.

So, 7077/46=153 +39/46=153.8478...

Hmm, so D +2b=153.8478...

But D and b are variables here, so perhaps this can be expressed as:

D + 2b = 153 + 39/46.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as D = 153 + 39/46 -2b.

Wait, but moving on. Let me see if I can find another equation.

From earlier, we have a =168 -b.

So, in Equation 1:

a² - a D -1530=0.

Which is (168 -b)^2 - (168 -b) D -1530=0.

Which I expanded earlier as:

27034 -336b + b² -168 D + b D =0.

Hmm, perhaps instead of substituting a, I should use the relation a +b=168.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express D from the equation 92b +46D=7077.

Let me solve for D:

46 D =7077 -92b.

So, D = (7077 -92b)/46.

Simplify numerator:

7077 ÷46: As before, 46*153=7038, 7077-7038=39.

So, 7077=46*153 +39.

So, D=(46*153 +39 -92b)/46= [46*(153 -2b) +39]/46=153 -2b +39/46.

So, D=153 -2b +39/46.

Hmm, perhaps not very helpful. Alternatively, 39/46 can be written as 39/46= 3/ (46/13)=3/(3.538). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can plug this D into Equation 2.

Equation 2: b² + (32 + D) b +16D -1274=0.

Substituting D= (7077 -92b)/46.

So,

b² + [32 + (7077 -92b)/46] b +16*(7077 -92b)/46 -1274=0.

Multiply through by 46 to eliminate denominators:

46 b² + [32*46 +7077 -92b] b +16*(7077 -92b) -1274*46=0.

Compute each term:

First term: 46b².

Second term: [1472 +7077 -92b]b = [8549 -92b]b=8549b -92b².

Third term: 16*7077 -16*92b= 113232 -1472b.

Fourth term: -1274 *46.

Compute 1274*46: Let me compute 1200*46=55,200. 74*46= 74*(40+6)=2960 +444=3404. So, 55,200 +3404=58,604. So, -58,604.

Putting it all together:

46b² +8549b -92b² +113232 -1472b -58604=0.

Combine like terms:

46b² -92b²= -46b².

8549b -1472b=7077b.

113232 -58604=54628.

So, equation becomes:

-46b² +7077b +54628 =0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

46b² -7077b -54628=0.

Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of b:

46b² -7077b -54628=0.

Let me write this as:

46b² -7077b -54628=0.

To solve for b, we can use the quadratic formula.

So, b = [7077 ± sqrt(7077² +4*46*54628)] / (2*46).

First, compute discriminant D =7077² +4*46*54628.

Compute 7077²:

Let me compute (7000 +77)^2 =7000² +2*7000*77 +77²=49,000,000 +1,078,000 +5,929=49,000,000 +1,078,000=50,078,000 +5,929=50,083,929.

Then, compute 4*46*54628.

First, 4*46=184.

184*54628.

Compute 54628 * 184:

Let's break it down:

54628 * 100 =5,462,800.

54628 *80=4,369,440.

54628 *4=218,512.

Adding together:5,462,800 +4,369,440=9,832,240 +218,512=10,050,752.

So, 4*46*54628=10,050,752.

So, the discriminant D=50,083,929 +10,050,752=60,134,681.

Now, sqrt(60,134,681). Let me see what this is.

I know that 7756²=?

Wait, 7756^2: Let me compute 7000^2=49,000,000.

7756=7000+756.

So, (7000 +756)^2=7000² +2*7000*756 +756².

7000²=49,000,000.

2*7000*756=14000*756= Let me compute 14000*700=9,800,000; 14000*56=784,000. So, total=9,800,000+784,000=10,584,000.

756²: Let me compute 700²=490000; 2*700*56=78,400; 56²=3,136. So, 490,000 +78,400=568,400 +3,136=571,536.

So, total 49,000,000 +10,584,000=59,584,000 +571,536=60,155,536.

Wait, but our discriminant is 60,134,681, which is less than 7756²=60,155,536.

Hmm, so 7756²=60,155,536.

Compute 60,155,536 -60,134,681=20,855.

So, 7756² is larger by ~20,855. Let me try 7750².

7750²: 7750=77.5*100. (77.5)^2=6006.25. So, 6006.25 *10,000=60,062,500.

60,062,500.

Our discriminant is 60,134,681.

So, 60,134,681 -60,062,500=72,181.

So, 7750²=60,062,500.

Now, let me compute 7750 + x squared:

(7750 +x)^2=7750² +2*7750*x +x²=60,062,500 +15,500x +x².

Set this equal to 60,134,681.

So, 60,062,500 +15,500x +x²=60,134,681.

Subtract 60,062,500: 15,500x +x²=72,181.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

So, approx x≈72,181 /15,500≈4.66.

So, let's test x=4.66:

Compute (7750 +4.66)^2=7754.66².

But perhaps instead, let me compute 7755²:

7755²= (7750 +5)^2=7750² +2*7750*5 +5²=60,062,500 +77,500 +25=60,140,025.

Compare to discriminant:60,134,681.

60,140,025 is larger. So, 7755²=60,140,025.

Which is 60,140,025 -60,134,681=5,344 larger.

So, discriminant is between 7754² and 7755².

Wait, 7754²= (7755 -1)^2=7755² -2*7755 +1=60,140,025 -15,510 +1=60,124,516.

Wait, 7754²=60,124,516.

Compare to discriminant 60,134,681.

So, 60,134,681 -60,124,516=10,165.

So, 7754²=60,124,516.

So, 7754 + x squared=60,134,681.

Compute (7754 +x)^2=60,124,516 + 2*7754*x +x²=60,134,681.

So, 15,508 x +x²=10,165.

Assuming x is small, x≈10,165/15,508≈0.656.

So, x≈0.656.

So, sqrt(60,134,681)=7754.656 approximately.

So, approximately 7754.656.

So, b=(7077 ±7754.656)/(2*46).

Compute with the plus sign:

b= (7077 +7754.656)/92 = (14831.656)/92≈ 14831.656 /92≈161.21.

With the minus sign:

b=(7077 -7754.656)/92≈ (-677.656)/92≈-7.367.

But since b is a length from F beyond C, and a is length from E before D, both a and b should be positive.

So, a=168 -b. If b≈161.21, then a≈168 -161.21=6.79.

Alternatively, if b≈-7.367, then a≈168 -(-7.367)=175.367, which would mean E is way left of D, and F is to the left of C by about 7 units. But given that EF is 184, which is much longer than DC, which is 16, the first solution makes more sense.

So, b≈161.21, a≈6.79.

So, E is at (-a,0)=(-6.79,0), and F is at (16 + b,0)=(16 +161.21,0)=(177.21,0).

So, now, with these values, let's find D.

From earlier, D= (7077 -92b)/46.

So, plug in b≈161.21.

Compute 92 *161.21= approximately 92 *160=14,720; 92*1.21≈111.32. So total≈14,720 +111.32=14,831.32.

So, 7077 -14,831.32= -7,754.32.

Then, D= (-7,754.32)/46≈-168.57.

Wait, that's negative. But D is the x-coordinate of point D, which we placed at (0,0). Wait, no, wait: D is the coordinate (0,0). Oh, wait, no, in the equation, D was the coefficient in the circle equation. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, in our earlier substitution, D was part of the circle equation, not the point D. Oh, I think I confused variable names. Because we named a point D at (0,0), but in the circle equation, we used D as a coefficient. That's probably where the confusion is.

So, in the circle equation, we have x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0, but we named one of the points D as (0,0). So, in the circle equation, D is a coefficient, not the point. So, perhaps I should have used a different symbol, like 'd' or 'k' to avoid confusion.

But in any case, from the quadratic solution, we have D (the coefficient)≈-168.57.

So, the circle equation is x² + y² -168.57x -107y=0.

Now, with that, we can find more information.

But perhaps instead of using approximate values, I should try to find exact values.

Wait, perhaps 7077² +4*46*54628=60,134,681 is a perfect square.

Wait, let me check: sqrt(60,134,681). Let me see:

Compute 7757²: 7750²=60,062,500. 7757=7750 +7.

(7750 +7)^2=7750² +2*7750*7 +7²=60,062,500 +108,500 +49=60,171,049.

Which is larger than 60,134,681.

So, 7757²=60,171,049.

Wait, 7756²=60,155,536 as before.

Wait, 7756²=60,155,536.

So, 60,134,681 is between 7754²=60,124,516 and 7755²=60,140,025.

Wait, 7754.5²: Let me compute 7754.5².

= (7754 +0.5)^2=7754² +2*7754*0.5 +0.25=60,124,516 +7,754 +0.25=60,132,270.25.

Hmm, close to 60,134,681.

Difference:60,134,681 -60,132,270.25=2,410.75.

So, 7754.5²=60,132,270.25.

We need 60,134,681, which is 2,410.75 higher.

So, the next step is to compute how much more x is needed beyond 7754.5 to get 2,410.75 more.

Let me denote x=7754.5 + t.

So, (x)^2= (7754.5 +t)^2=7754.5² +2*7754.5*t +t²=60,132,270.25 +15,509*t +t².

Set equal to 60,134,681:

60,132,270.25 +15,509 t +t²=60,134,681.

Subtract 60,132,270.25:

15,509 t +t²=2,410.75.

Assuming t is small, t≈2,410.75 /15,509≈0.1556.

So, t≈0.1556.

So, x≈7754.5 +0.1556≈7754.6556.

So, sqrt(60,134,681)≈7754.6556.

So, back to the quadratic formula:

b=(7077 ±7754.6556)/(2*46)= (7077 ±7754.6556)/92.

Calculate both possibilities.

1. b=(7077 +7754.6556)/92≈(14831.6556)/92≈161.213.

2. b=(7077 -7754.6556)/92≈(-677.6556)/92≈-7.367.

So, as before. We take the positive solution, b≈161.213.

Then, a=168 -b≈168 -161.213≈6.787.

So, a≈6.787, b≈161.213.

Thus, E is at (-a,0)= (-6.787,0), F is at (16 +b,0)= (16 +161.213,0)= (177.213,0).

Now, rectangle EFGH has points E(-6.787,0), F(177.213,0). Since EF is 184 units, that's correct because 177.213 - (-6.787)=184.

Now, FG is 17 units, so from F(177.213,0) to G. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is perpendicular to EF, which is along the x-axis, so FG is vertical.

Assuming the rectangle is drawn upwards, G would be at (177.213,17), and H would be at (-6.787,17).

So, points G(177.213,17) and H(-6.787,17).

Now, points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(-6.787,17), G(177.213,17) lie on a circle.

So, let me confirm that these four points lie on the same circle.

We already used this condition to find a and b, but perhaps now with these approximate values, we can check.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.

We have points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(-6.787,17), G(177.213,17).

We can write the general equation of the circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

We know D(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 => F=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey=0.

Point A(0,107): 0 + (107)^2 +0 +E*107=0 => 11449 +107E=0 => E= -11449/107= -107.

So, equation: x² + y² + Dx -107y=0.

Now, plug in point H(-6.787,17):

(-6.787)^2 +17^2 + D*(-6.787) -107*17=0.

Compute:

(-6.787)^2≈46.06.

17^2=289.

So, 46.06 +289= 335.06.

-6.787 D.

-107*17= -1819.

So, equation: 335.06 -6.787 D -1819=0 → -6.787 D= 1819 -335.06=1483.94.

So, D=1483.94 / (-6.787)=≈-218.7.

Similarly, plug in point G(177.213,17):

(177.213)^2 +17^2 + D*(177.213) -107*17=0.

Compute:

177.213²≈31,414.

17^2=289.

31,414 +289=31,703.

D*177.213= (-218.7)*177.213≈-218.7*177≈-38,763.9.

-107*17= -1819.

So, total equation:31,703 -38,763.9 -1819=31,703 -40,582.9≈-8,879.9≈0. Not zero.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, this suggests that my approximate values for a and b lead to inconsistency. Perhaps due to the approximations in the square root.

So, perhaps I should instead solve the quadratic equation exactly.

We have 46b² -7077b -54628=0.

Multiply both sides by 1 to make it easier.

Looking for factors of 46* (-54628)= -2,512, 828? Wait, maybe it's better to use the quadratic formula with exact values.

We had:

b=(7077 ± sqrt(7077² +4*46*54628))/(2*46).

We know that sqrt(7077² +4*46*54628)=sqrt(60,134,681).

But 60,134,681=7757²?

Wait, let me compute 7757²:

7757*7757.

Let me compute 7757*7757:

I can compute it as (7000 +757)^2=7000² +2*7000*757 +757².

7000²=49,000,000.

2*7000*757=14,000*757.

Compute 14,000*700=9,800,000; 14,000*57=798,000. So, total=9,800,000 +798,000=10,598,000.

757²: Let's compute 700²=490,000; 2*700*57=79,800; 57²=3,249. So, 490,000 +79,800=569,800 +3,249=573,049.

Adding all terms:

49,000,000 +10,598,000=59,598,000 +573,049=60,171,049.

Which is larger than 60,134,681.

So, 7757²=60,171,049.

So, 60,134,681 is less than that.

So, perhaps 7756²=60,155,536 (as before), and 7755²=60,140,025.

Wait, 7755²=60,140,025.

So, 60,134,681 is less than that.

So, sqrt(60,134,681)=7755 - some value.

Let me compute 7755² -60,134,681=60,140,025 -60,134,681=5,344.

So, (7755 - x)^2=60,134,681.

7755² -2*7755*x +x²=60,134,681.

So, 60,140,025 -15,510x +x²=60,134,681.

So, -15,510x +x²= -5,344.

Rearranged: x² -15,510x +5,344=0.

Assuming x is small, x≈5,344 /15,510≈0.345.

So, sqrt(60,134,681)=7755 -0.345≈7754.655.

Which is what I found earlier.

So, the exact value is messy, but perhaps we can proceed with variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this problem differently, using coordinate geometry and similar triangles or something.

Wait, another approach: since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point C with respect to this circle can be used.

Wait, but point C is at (16,0), and line CE is what we're to find, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CD.

Wait, power of a point: If a line through C intersects the circle at two points, say E and D, then CE * CD = power of C.

But CD is the distance from C to D, which is 16 units. Wait, but CE is the distance from C to E, which is along the line, and D is at (16,0).

Wait, perhaps.

Power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CE * CD.

But what is the power of point C?

The power can also be calculated as CO² - r², where O is the center of the circle, and r is the radius.

Alternatively, since point C is at (16,0), and the circle passes through A(0,107), D(0,0), H(-a,17), G(16 +b,17).

Wait, so perhaps I can compute the power of point C with respect to the circle.

The power of point C is equal to the product of the lengths from C to the points of intersection with the circle along any line through C.

In this case, line CD passes through C and D, which is on the circle. So, the power would be CD * CE, but since D is on the circle, CE * CD = CD² - r²? Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the power of point C is equal to the square of the tangent from C to the circle. Also, it's equal to CE * CD, where CE and CD are the lengths along the line intersecting the circle.

Since D is on the circle, CD is zero? No, wait, CD is the distance from C to D, which is 16 units, but in the line DC, D is one end, and E is another point on the line.

Wait, perhaps the power of point C is equal to CE * CD.

Wait, in the power of a point theorem, if a line passes through C and intersects the circle at D and E, then CE * CD = power of C.

But in our case, line DC passes through C(16,0) and D(0,0), but D is on the circle. So, CE is the other intersection point. So, the power of point C is equal to CD * CE.

But since CD is the distance from C to D, which is 16 units, and CE is the distance from C to E, which is |16 - E_x|, but E is at (-a,0). So, CE would be |16 - (-a)|=16 +a.

Wait, so CD is 16, CE is 16 +a.

So, power of point C is CD * CE=16*(16 +a).

But the power of point C can also be calculated as CO² - r², where O is the center of the circle.

Alternatively, the power can be found using coordinates.

The power of point C(16,0) with respect to the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey=0 is:

(16)^2 +0^2 + D*16 + E*0=256 +16 D.

Because the general power formula is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F, but F=0 here.

So, power=256 +16 D.

But also, power=CE * CD=16*(16 +a)=16*(16 + (168 -b))=16*(184 -b).

Wait, but from earlier, we have a=168 -b. So, 16 +a=16 +168 -b=184 -b.

So, power=16*(184 -b).

But also, power=256 +16 D.

So, 256 +16 D=16*(184 -b).

Divide both sides by 16:

16 + D=184 -b.

So, D=184 -b -16=168 -b.

So, D=168 -b.

Wait, but from earlier, we have D= (7077 -92b)/46.

So, 168 -b=(7077 -92b)/46.

Multiply both sides by 46:

46*(168 -b)=7077 -92b.

Compute 46*168: 46*100=4600; 46*68=3128. So, 4600 +3128=7728.

So, 7728 -46b=7077 -92b.

Bring all terms to one side:

7728 -7077= -92b +46b.

651= -46b.

So, b= -651 /46≈-14.152.

Wait, that contradicts our earlier assumption that b is positive.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.

Wait, but according to the power of point C, we have D=168 -b.

But earlier, from the quadratic equation, we had D=(7077 -92b)/46.

So, setting them equal:

168 -b=(7077 -92b)/46.

Multiply both sides by46:

46*(168 -b)=7077 -92b.

Compute left side:

46*168=7728.

46*(-b)= -46b.

So, 7728 -46b=7077 -92b.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

-46b +92b=7077 -7728.

46b= -651.

So, b= -651 /46≈-14.152.

But earlier, from the quadratic, we found b≈161.21 or -7.367.

This suggests a contradiction. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the line isn't the x-axis.

Wait, perhaps I placed the coordinate system incorrectly. Maybe the line DC isn't the x-axis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have placed D at (0,0). Maybe I should assign a different coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the line DC is not horizontal.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in assigning coordinates. Let me try a different approach.

Let me denote the line where D, E, C, F lie as the x-axis. Let me place point D at (0,0), and since DC is 16 units, point C is at (16,0). Point E is at (e,0), and point F is at (f,0). Given that EF=184, so |f -e|=184.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So, from F, moving perpendicularly to EF (i.e., along the y-axis) to point G, which would be at (f,17) or (f,-17). Similarly, from E, moving to H at (e,17) or (e,-17).

So, rectangle EFGH has coordinates E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).

Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Point A is part of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 and BC=16, and since D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0), then coordinates of A and B can be determined.

In rectangle ABCD, sides AB=107, BC=16.

Assuming ABCD is arranged with AB vertical and BC horizontal, then from D(0,0), moving to C(16,0), then up to B(16,16), but wait, BC is 16, but AB is 107, so perhaps differently.

Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0), then B is at (16,107), and A is at (0,107).

Wait, that makes BC=107, but problem says BC=16. So, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I have the sides mixed up. In rectangle ABCD, AB and BC are adjacent sides. So, AB is one side, BC is the next.

If AB=107 and BC=16, then in the coordinate system, let me assign D at (0,0). Then, since AB is adjacent to BC, which is 16.

So, if AB is vertical and BC is horizontal, then from D(0,0), moving along AB would be upwards, but that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign D at (0,0), C at (0,16), making BC=16, and then AB=107 would make A at (-107,16), but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps assign D at (0,0), C at (16,0), B at (16,107), and A at (0,107). Then, AB is vertical with length 107, BC is horizontal with length 16. That makes sense.

So, points:

D: (0,0)

C: (16,0)

B: (16,107)

A: (0,107)

Now, rectangle EFGH has points E(e,0), F(f,0), G(f,17), H(e,17).

Points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17) lie on a circle.

So, four points on a circle: (0,107), (0,0), (e,17), (f,17).

We can use the general equation of the circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

Since D(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 => F=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey=0.

Point A(0,107): 0 + (107)^2 +0 + E*107=0 => 11449 +107 E=0 => E= -11449 /107= -107.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx -107 y=0.

Now, plug in point H(e,17):

e² +17² + D e -107*17=0.

So, e² +289 + D e -1819=0 => e² + D e -1530=0. (Equation 1)

Similarly, plug in point G(f,17):

f² +289 + D f -1819=0 => f² + D f -1530=0. (Equation 2)

So, both e and f satisfy the equation x² + D x -1530=0.

Which means that e and f are roots of the quadratic equation x² + D x -1530=0.

So, by Vieta's formula, e + f= -D, and e*f= -1530.

But from the rectangle EFGH, EF=184, which is |f -e|=184.

So, we have:

e + f= -D,

e*f= -1530,

and |f -e|=184.

Let me consider f -e=184 (assuming f>e).

So, f= e +184.

So, substituting into e + f= -D:

e + (e +184)= -D => 2e +184= -D => D= -2e -184.

Also, e*f= e*(e +184)= e² +184 e= -1530.

So, e² +184 e +1530=0.

Solve for e:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184² -4*1*1530)] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33,856.

4*1*1530=6,120.

So, sqrt(33,856 -6,120)=sqrt(27,736).

Compute sqrt(27,736):

166²=27,556.

167²=27,889.

So, between 166 and167.

Compute 166²=27,556.

27,736-27,556=180.

So, sqrt(27,736)=166 +180/(2*166)=166 +90/166≈166 +0.542≈166.542.

So, e= [ -184 ±166.542 ] /2.

Compute the two possibilities:

1. e= (-184 +166.542)/2= (-17.458)/2≈-8.729.

2. e= (-184 -166.542)/2= (-350.542)/2≈-175.271.

So, e≈-8.729 or e≈-175.271.

If e≈-8.729, then f= e +184≈175.271.

If e≈-175.271, then f= e +184≈9.729.

But since in the problem, points D, E, C, F are collinear, and in our coordinate system, D is at (0,0), C is at (16,0). So, E and F are on the same line (x-axis). If E is at e≈-8.729, then F is at≈175.271, which is to the right of C(16,0). Alternatively, if E is at≈-175.271, F is at≈9.729, which is between D(0,0) and C(16,0).

But in the problem statement, D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. So, both possibilities are valid, but let's see which one makes sense with the rectangle.

If E is at≈-8.729, F is≈175.271, then rectangle EFGH would extend from E(-8.729,0) to F(175.271,0), which is a very long rectangle. Alternatively, if E is at≈-175.271, F is≈9.729, which is within the vicinity of D and C.

But let's proceed with both possibilities.

Case 1: e≈-8.729, f≈175.271.

Then, from e*f= -1530:

(-8.729)*(175.271)≈-1530. Correct.

Case 2: e≈-175.271, f≈9.729.

Then, (-175.271)*(9.729)≈-1709. Not exactly -1530, but perhaps due to approximation errors.

Wait, but in exact terms, since e and f are roots of x² + D x -1530=0, their product is -1530.

So, in case 2, e≈-175.271, f≈9.729. Their product≈-175.271*9.729≈-1709, which is not -1530. So, perhaps case 1 is correct.

So, proceeding with case 1: e≈-8.729, f≈175.271.

So, points E≈(-8.729,0), F≈(175.271,0).

Then, H(e,17)= (-8.729,17), G(f,17)= (175.271,17).

Now, the circle passes through A(0,107), D(0,0), H(-8.729,17), G(175.271,17).

So, let's compute the equation of the circle.

From earlier, we have:

x² + y² + Dx -107 y=0.

We can plug in H(-8.729,17):

(-8.729)^2 +17^2 + D*(-8.729) -107*17=0.

Compute:

76.17 +289 -8.729 D -1819=0.

So, 365.17 -8.729 D -1819=0.

So, -8.729 D= 1819 -365.17=1453.83.

Thus, D≈1453.83 / (-8.729)≈-166.5.

Similarly, from point G(175.271,17):

(175.271)^2 +17^2 + D*(175.271) -107*17=0.

Compute:

30,726 +289 + (-166.5)*175.271 -1819=0.

Compute each term:

30,726 +289=31,015.

-166.5 *175.271≈-166.5*175≈-29,137.5.

-1819.

So, equation≈31,015 -29,137.5 -1819≈31,015 -30,956.5≈58.5≈0.

Hmm, not exactly zero, which suggests some approximation errors.

But perhaps the exact values can be found.

Wait, from the quadratic equation earlier:

e² + D e -1530=0,

and from e + f= -D,

and |f -e|=184.

So, let me denote s= e + f= -D,

and p= e*f= -1530,

and f -e=184.

So, we have:

s= e + f= -D,

p= e*f= -1530,

and f= e +184.

So, substituting f= e +184 into s= e + (e +184)= 2e +184= -D.

And p= e*(e +184)= e² +184 e= -1530.

So, equation: e² +184 e +1530=0.

We solved this earlier, getting e=( -184 ± sqrt(184² -4*1*1530) )/2.

Which is e=( -184 ± sqrt(33856 -6120) )/2= ( -184 ± sqrt(27736) )/2.

Now, sqrt(27736)=166.542 as before.

So, e=( -184 ±166.542 )/2.

So, e≈(-184 +166.542)/2≈(-17.458)/2≈-8.729,

or e≈(-184 -166.542)/2≈(-350.542)/2≈-175.271.

So, exact values would involve sqrt(27736). Let me see if 27736 is a perfect square.

Wait, 166²=27,556.

166.5²= (166 +0.5)^2=166² +2*166*0.5 +0.25=27,556 +166 +0.25=27,722.25.

Which is greater than 27,736.

Wait, 166.5²=27,722.25.

Then, 166.5²=27,722.25,

166.6²=166.5² +2*166.5*0.1 +0.1²=27,722.25 +33.3 +0.01=27,755.56.

Wait, 166.6²=27,755.56, which is larger than 27,736.

Wait, perhaps 166.5²=27,722.25,

So, 27,736 -27,722.25=13.75.

So, sqrt(27,736)=166.5 +13.75/(2*166.5)≈166.5 +0.0413≈166.5413.

So, sqrt(27,736)= approximately 166.5413.

So, exact e= (-184 +166.5413)/2= (-17.4587)/2≈-8.72935,

and f= e +184≈175.27065.

So, e= (-184 +sqrt(27736))/2,

f= ( -184 -sqrt(27736) )/2 +184= (sqrt(27736) -184)/2.

Wait, wait, let me compute f= e +184= [ (-184 +sqrt(27736))/2 ] +184= [ (-184 +sqrt(27736)) +368 ] /2= [ sqrt(27736) +184 ] /2.

So, e= [ -184 +sqrt(27736) ] /2,

f= [ sqrt(27736) +184 ] /2.

Now, D= - (e +f)= - [ ( -184 +sqrt(27736) )/2 + ( sqrt(27736) +184 )/2 ]= - [ ( -184 +sqrt(27736) + sqrt(27736) +184 ) /2 ]= - [ 2 sqrt(27736)/2 ]= - sqrt(27736).

So, D= -sqrt(27736).

But sqrt(27736)= approximately 166.5413.

So, D≈-166.5413.

So, the circle equation is x² + y² -166.5413 x -107 y=0.

Now, the problem asks for the length of CE.

Point C is at (16,0), and point E is at (e,0)= [ (-184 +sqrt(27736) )/2 , 0 ].

So, CE= |16 - e|= |16 - [ (-184 +sqrt(27736) )/2 ] |.

Compute:

16=32/2,

so 32/2 - [ (-184 +sqrt(27736) )/2 ]= [32 +184 -sqrt(27736) ] /2= [216 -sqrt(27736) ] /2.

So, CE= [216 -sqrt(27736) ] /2.

But sqrt(27736)= approx 166.5413,

so CE≈(216 -166.5413)/2≈49.4587/2≈24.729.

Wait, that's approximately 24.73 units.

But is there an exact value?

Wait, sqrt(27736)=sqrt(16*1733.5)=? Wait, 27736 divided by 16 is 1733.5, which is not integer. Alternatively, perhaps 27736= 4*6934=4*2*3467=8*3467. 3467 is a prime number? Let me check.

3467 divided by primes: 3467 ÷7=495.28... no. 3467 ÷11=315.18... no. 13: 3467 ÷13≈266.69. Not integer.

So, 27736=8*3467, so sqrt(27736)=2*sqrt(2*3467)=2*sqrt(6934). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps 27736= 166.5413², which doesn't help.

So, CE= [216 -sqrt(27736) ] /2.

But perhaps simplifying:

216= 108*2,

sqrt(27736)= sqrt(16*1733.5)=4*sqrt(1733.5). Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 27736.

Wait, 27736 ÷4=6934.

6934 ÷2=3467.

3467 is a prime number.

So, sqrt(27736)=sqrt(4*6934)=2*sqrt(6934).

So, sqrt(27736)=2*sqrt(6934).

So, CE= [216 -2*sqrt(6934) ] /2=108 -sqrt(6934).

But 6934=2*3467, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 108 -sqrt(6934).

But the problem expects an integer answer, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, if CE=108 -sqrt(6934), that's not an integer. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should use the power of point C.

Earlier, we found that power of point C is 256 +16 D.

But we also have that power=CE * CD= CE *16.

So, 256 +16 D=16 CE.

So, CE= (256 +16 D)/16=16 + D.

But from earlier, D= -sqrt(27736)= -sqrt(4*6934)= -2*sqrt(6934).

So, CE=16 + (-2 sqrt(6934))=16 -2 sqrt(6934).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the coordinate system.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that CE is |e -16|.

Since E is at e≈-8.729, and C is at 16, then CE=16 - (-8.729)=24.729≈24.73.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the exact value is 108 -166.5413≈-58.5413, which is not possible.

Wait, maybe I should re-express CE.

Wait, in the coordinate system, E is at e, which is≈-8.729, and C is at 16.

So, CE=16 -e=16 - [ (-184 +sqrt(27736) ) /2 ]= [32 +184 -sqrt(27736) ] /2= [216 -sqrt(27736) ] /2.

But 216=108*2.

Wait, perhaps [216 -sqrt(27736) ] /2=108 - sqrt(27736)/2.

Hmm, sqrt(27736)=sqrt(4*6934)=2*sqrt(6934).

So, CE=108 -sqrt(6934).

But 6934 is 2*3467, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, in the equation:

From power of point C: CE * CD=16*(16 +a)=16*(16 + (168 -b))=16*(184 -b).

But we also have power=256 +16 D.

Setting equal: 16*(184 -b)=256 +16 D.

Divide by 16: 184 -b=16 + D.

So, D=184 -b -16=168 -b.

But from the quadratic equation earlier, D=(7077 -92b)/46.

So, 168 -b=(7077 -92b)/46.

Multiply both sides by46:

46*168 -46b=7077 -92b.

Compute 46*168: 46*(100+60+8)=4600 +2760 +368=7728.

So, 7728 -46b=7077 -92b.

Bring variables to left: -46b +92b=7077 -7728.

46b= -651.

So, b= -651 /46≈-14.152.

But earlier from the quadratic, b≈161.21 or -7.367.

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have placed the line DC on the x-axis. Maybe the line is not horizontal.

Wait, perhaps the line DC is not horizontal, so my initial coordinate assignment was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the two rectangles are placed such that their sides are not aligned with the axes.

But without loss of generality, I can choose a coordinate system where line DC is the x-axis.

Wait, but this seems to have led to inconsistency.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle passing through A, D, H, G is such that power of point C is equal to CE * CD=16*(16 +a). Also, power of point C is equal to CO² - r², where O is the center of the circle.

But unless I can find the center, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find the circle.

Wait, points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).

We can use the perpendicular bisectors of chords AD and HG to find the center.

Chord AD: from (0,0) to (0,107). The perpendicular bisector is the line y=53.5.

Chord HG: from (e,17) to (f,17). The midpoint is ((e +f)/2,17). The perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=(e +f)/2.

Since the center lies on both perpendicular bisectors, it must be at ( (e +f)/2,53.5 ).

So, center O is at ( (e +f)/2,53.5 ).

Now, the radius can be found by the distance from O to D(0,0):

r²= ( (e +f)/2 -0 )² + (53.5 -0 )²= [ (e +f)/2 ]² +53.5².

Similarly, the radius is also the distance from O to A(0,107):

r²= ( (e +f)/2 -0 )² + (53.5 -107 )²= [ (e +f)/2 ]² + (-53.5 )²= same as before.

Similarly, distance from O to H(e,17):

r²= ( (e +f)/2 -e )² + (53.5 -17 )²= [ (f -e)/2 ]² +36.5².

So, set equal to previous r²:

[ (e +f)/2 ]² +53.5²= [ (f -e)/2 ]² +36.5².

Compute:

Left side: [ (e +f)/2 ]² +53.5².

Right side: [ (f -e)/2 ]² +36.5².

Expand both sides:

Left: (e² + 2 e f +f²)/4 + (53.5)^2.

Right: (f² -2 e f +e²)/4 + (36.5)^2.

Subtract right from left:

[ (e² + 2 e f +f²)/4 - (f² -2 e f +e²)/4 ] + (53.5² -36.5²)=0.

Simplify the first bracket:

[ (e² +2 e f +f² -f² +2 e f -e² ) /4 ]= [4 e f /4 ]= e f.

So, equation becomes:

e f + (53.5² -36.5²)=0.

Compute 53.5²=2862.25,

36.5²=1332.25.

So, 2862.25 -1332.25=1530.

Thus, e f +1530=0.

But earlier, from the circle equation, we have e*f= -1530.

So, indeed, equation holds. So, no new information.

So, perhaps I can't find CE directly this way.

Wait, but from power of point C:

CE * CD= power=256 +16 D.

But earlier, power=16*(184 -b).

But perhaps now, we can express D in terms of e and f.

From earlier, D= -(e +f).

So, power=256 +16*(-e -f)=256 -16(e +f).

But also, power=16*(184 -b).

So, 256 -16(e +f)=16*(184 -b).

Divide both sides by16:

16 - (e +f)=184 -b.

So, b=184 - [16 - (e +f) ]=184 -16 +e +f=168 +e +f.

But from earlier, e +f= -D= -( -sqrt(27736) )=sqrt(27736).

So, b=168 + sqrt(27736).

But sqrt(27736)= approximately 166.5413.

So, b≈168 +166.5413≈334.5413.

But earlier, from quadratic equation, b≈161.21 or -7.367.

This suggests inconsistency, which probably arises from wrong assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take another approach.

Wait, perhaps since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the quadrilateral ADGH is cyclic.

Then, by cyclic quadrilateral properties, the product of the lengths of opposite sides relate somehow. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find the position of E and F such that the circle passes through A, D, H, G.

But this might be too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps consider vectors or coordinate transformations.

Wait, another idea: Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the angles subtended by chord AH should be equal for points D and G.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the property that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the slopes of the diagonals is -1 if they are perpendicular, but I don't think that's generally true.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that for points A, D, H, G to be concyclic, the cross ratio is real, but that might be too advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.

We have points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).

We can plug these into the general circle equation.

As before, the equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0.

From D(0,0), F=0.

From A(0,107): 0 +107² +0 +E*107=0 => E= -107.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +Dx -107 y=0.

From H(e,17): e² +17² +D e -107*17=0 => e² +D e -1530=0.

From G(f,17): f² +17² +D f -107*17=0 => f² +D f -1530=0.

So, e and f are roots of x² +D x -1530=0.

So, e +f= -D,

e*f= -1530.

We also have |f -e|=184.

So, let me let f= e +184.

Then,

e + (e +184)= -D => 2e +184= -D.

And,

e*(e +184)= -1530 => e² +184 e +1530=0.

Solving this quadratic:

e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² -4*1*1530) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33,856,

4*1530=6,120,

sqrt(33,856 -6,120)=sqrt(27,736)=166.5413.

So,

e= [ -184 ±166.5413 ] /2.

So,

e1= [ -184 +166.5413 ] /2≈ (-17.4587)/2≈-8.729,

e2= [ -184 -166.5413 ] /2≈ (-350.5413)/2≈-175.2706.

So, f1= e1 +184≈-8.729 +184≈175.271,

f2= e2 +184≈-175.2706 +184≈8.7294.

So, two possibilities:

1. e≈-8.729, f≈175.271,

2. e≈-175.2706, f≈8.7294.

Now, compute D= -(e +f).

Case 1:

e≈-8.729, f≈175.271,

e +f≈166.542,

so D≈-166.542.

Case 2:

e≈-175.2706, f≈8.7294,

e +f≈-166.5412,

so D≈166.5412.

Now, check the circle equation for both cases.

Case 1: D≈-166.542,

Circle equation: x² + y² -166.542 x -107 y=0.

Check if G(f,17)= (175.271,17) lies on this circle:

(175.271)^2 +17^2 -166.542*175.271 -107*17≈30,726 +289 -29,137.5 -1819≈31,015 -30,956.5≈58.5≈0. Not exact, but due to approximations.

Case 2: D≈166.5412,

Circle equation: x² + y² +166.5412 x -107 y=0.

Check if G(f,17)= (8.7294,17) lies on this circle:

(8.7294)^2 +17^2 +166.5412*8.7294 -107*17≈76.2 +289 +1,453.8 -1,819≈365.2 +1,453.8=1,819 -1,819=0.

Exactly zero. So, case 2 is exact.

So, correct values are:

e≈-175.2706,

f≈8.7294,

D≈166.5412.

Thus, points:

E≈(-175.2706,0),

F≈(8.7294,0),

G≈(8.7294,17),

H≈(-175.2706,17).

Now, compute CE.

Point C is at (16,0).

Point E is at≈(-175.2706,0).

So, CE= |16 - (-175.2706)|=16 +175.2706≈191.2706.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the exact value is 191.2706, which is approximately 191.27. But likely, the exact value is 191.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.

From earlier, e= [ -184 -sqrt(27736) ] /2,

so CE= |16 -e|=16 -e=16 - [ (-184 -sqrt(27736)) /2 ]= [32 +184 +sqrt(27736) ] /2= [216 +sqrt(27736) ] /2.

But sqrt(27736)=sqrt(16*1733.5)=4*sqrt(1733.5). Not helpful.

Alternatively, sqrt(27736)=sqrt(4*6934)=2*sqrt(6934).

So, CE= [216 +2*sqrt(6934) ] /2=108 +sqrt(6934).

But 6934=2*3467, and 3467 is a prime, so no simplification.

But wait, in case 2, D≈166.5412,

So, CE=16 -e=16 - [ (-184 -sqrt(27736))/2 ]=16 + [184 +sqrt(27736)]/2= [32 +184 +sqrt(27736)]/2= [216 +sqrt(27736)]/2.

Which is the same as above.

But 216 + sqrt(27736)≈216 +166.5413≈382.5413,

so CE≈382.5413 /2≈191.2706.

So, approximately 191.27, which is about 191.27 units.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps it's 191 or 192.

But let me check with exact values.

Wait, sqrt(27736)=166.5413.

So, [216 +166.5413]/2=382.5413/2=191.2706.

So, approximately 191.27.

But the problem might have an exact integer answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate assignment.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that CE=191.27≈191.27.

But the problem might expect 108 as the answer, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute CE as |e -16|.

In case 2, e≈-175.2706,

so CE=16 - (-175.2706)=191.2706.

So, the length is approximately 191.27, which is about 191.27.

But since the problem likely expects an integer, perhaps the exact value is 191 or 192.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.

From e= [ -184 -sqrt(27736) ] /2,

so CE=16 -e=16 - [ (-184 -sqrt(27736))/2 ]= [32 +184 +sqrt(27736) ] /2= [216 +sqrt(27736) ] /2.

But 27736=16*1733.5, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps 27736= 166.5413², so sqrt(27736)=166.5413.

So, CE= [216 +166.5413 ] /2=382.5413 /2=191.2706.

So, approximately 191.27.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 108, but I can't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the length is 108 units.

Wait, but 108 is half of 216, which appears in the equation.

Wait, but CE≈191.27, which is approximately 191.27.

But the problem might have intended for it to be 108, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 108, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF=184, FG=17.

So, the area of EFGH is 184*17=3128.

Similarly, area of ABCD is 107*16=1712.

But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps since A, D, H, G are concyclic, then angle AGD= angle AHD.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find the exact value.

Given that in case 2, CE= [216 +sqrt(27736) ] /2=108 + sqrt(27736)/2.

But sqrt(27736)=sqrt(16*1733.5)=4*sqrt(1733.5), which is irrational.

So, perhaps the exact value is 108 + (sqrt(27736))/2, which is approximately 108 +83.27≈191.27.

So, the length of CE is approximately 191.27 units.

But the problem expects an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 108.

But from the calculation, it's approximately 191.27, which is roughly 191.

Wait, but wait, let me think differently.

Maybe after placing the points correctly, CE is actually 108.

Wait, from the circle equation:

In case 2, e≈-175.2706,

so CE=16 - (-175.2706)=191.2706.

But if the problem expects an integer, perhaps it's 191 or 192.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute CE= |e -16|=| (-175.2706) -16|=191.2706.

So, the integer is 191.

But I'm not entirely sure, but given the calculations, it's approximately 191.27, so the closest integer is 191.


The length of CE is approximately 191.27 units, so the closest integer is **191**.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me verify once more.

From case 2, e= [ -184 -sqrt(27736) ] /2.

sqrt(27736)=166.5413.

So, e= [ -184 -166.5413 ] /2= (-350.5413)/2≈-175.2706.

So, CE=16 - e=16 - (-175.2706)=191.2706.

So, the exact value is (216 + sqrt(27736))/2, which is approximately 191.27.

But perhaps the exact value is 191.

So, the integer answer is \boxed{191}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{191}
