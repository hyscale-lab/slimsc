Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. I'll take it step by step because it seems a bit complex at first glance.

First, the problem gives me three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis at a point that's sqrt(3)/2 up. I know that sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so B is somewhere near the top of the y-axis in the first quadrant.

Next, it introduces a family of segments F, which are all the segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and point Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is like a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1 unit.

The problem then says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, other than A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these unit segments, but there's another point C on AB that isn't on any other segment from F. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I should probably find the equation of line AB because point C is on AB. So, I can parametrize AB and find the coordinates of C.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB can be written as y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Alternatively, I can parametrize AB with a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, it's at A (1/2, 0), and when t=1, it's at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t

That's a good way to represent point C on AB. So, C can be written as ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, the key idea is that point C is on AB, and it shouldn't lie on any other segment PQ from the family F except for AB itself. So, if I can find the condition such that C is only on AB and not on any other PQ from F, then I can find the specific point C.

Let me think about the family F. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, for any such segment, if P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), then the distance between P and Q must be 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, for each PQ in F, p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1, with p, q > 0 since we're in the first quadrant.

Now, a point (x, y) lies on PQ if and only if it can be expressed as a convex combination of P and Q. So, for some λ in [0,1], (x, y) = (λ p, (1 - λ) q). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the parametric equation of segment PQ is (p - λ p, 0 + λ q) where λ ranges from 0 to 1, but that might not capture all points. Alternatively, parametric equations can be written as x = p(1 - λ) + 0 * λ, y = 0*(1 - λ) + q * λ, which gives x = p(1 - λ), y = q λ. So, for λ in [0,1], (x, y) spans the segment PQ.

So, for any PQ in F, points on PQ satisfy x = p(1 - λ), y = q λ, where p^2 + q^2 = 1, and λ is between 0 and 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, so it's ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t). We need to ensure that this point is not on any other segment PQ in F except for AB itself. That is, if we suppose that C lies on some other PQ, then we must show that this can't happen unless PQ is AB.

So, let's suppose, for contradiction, that C lies on another PQ in F. Then, there exist p, q > 0 with p^2 + q^2 = 1, and λ in (0,1), such that:

(1/2)(1 - t) = p (1 - λ)
(sqrt(3)/2) t = q λ

Additionally, since C is on AB, and AB is a segment from A to B, which is itself in F because OA is (1/2,0), OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2), and the distance OA^2 + OB^2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so AB is indeed a member of F. So, when PQ is AB, then p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

But we are looking for another PQ in F where C is on PQ as well as on AB. So, the idea is to find if such a point C exists on AB that also lies on another PQ, which would mean that C is the intersection point of AB and PQ. But the problem states that such a point C exists uniquely, so our job is to find that C.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider that for point C to not lie on any other PQ except AB, then the line PQ other than AB shouldn't pass through C. So, we need to find C on AB such that no other PQ from F passes through it. So, perhaps we're looking for a point C on AB such that the only PQ from F that passes through C is AB itself.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this by considering the envelope of all such segments PQ in F. The envelope would be a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F, and points inside the envelope would lie on multiple segments, while points outside would not. But in this case, since all PQ are in the first quadrant and of unit length, the envelope might form a curve, and points on AB that are inside this envelope would lie on multiple PQs, while points beyond the envelope would only lie on AB.

Alternatively, perhaps the only point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. So, finding that tangent point would give us C.

Hmm, the envelope of a family of curves can be found by solving the system of equations given by the curve and its derivative with respect to the parameter. In this case, each PQ is a line segment parameterized by p (since q is determined by p via p^2 + q^2 =1). So, perhaps we can parameterize the lines PQ by p, then find the envelope.

So, for each p in (0,1), the line PQ has equation x/p + y/q = 1, with q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, the equation is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

To find the envelope, we can consider F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) - 1 = 0.

Then, the envelope is found by solving F(p, x, y) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp: derivative with respect to p.

dF/dp = -x/p^2 + y * ( (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-3/2) * (2p) ) ) = 0.

So, dF/dp = -x/p^2 + (y p)/( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) ) = 0.

So, the equations are:

1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1

2. -x/p^2 + (y p)/( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = 0

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the envelope.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (x)/p + (y)/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1

Equation 2: - (x)/p^2 + (y p) / ( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = 0

Let me try to solve for x and y in terms of p.

From Equation 2:

( y p ) / ( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = x / p^2

So, y p * p^2 = x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 )

=> y p^3 = x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 )

So, y = [ x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) ] / p^3

Now, plug this into Equation 1:

x/p + [ ( x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) ) / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2 ) = 1

Simplify the second term:

[ x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) ] / p^3 divided by sqrt(1 - p^2) is [x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 - 1/2 ) ] / p^3 = [x (1 - p^2)^1 ] / p^3 = x (1 - p^2)/p^3

So, Equation 1 becomes:

x/p + x (1 - p^2)/p^3 = 1

Factor out x:

x [ 1/p + (1 - p^2)/p^3 ] = 1

Compute the expression in the brackets:

1/p + (1 - p^2)/p^3 = (p^2 + 1 - p^2 ) / p^3 = 1 / p^3

Wait, let me check that again:

1/p = p^2 / p^3

So, 1/p + (1 - p^2)/p^3 = (p^2 + 1 - p^2 ) / p^3 = (1)/p^3

So, the equation becomes:

x * (1/p^3 ) = 1 => x = p^3.

Then, from Equation 2, y = [x (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) ] / p^3

But x = p^3, so y = [ p^3 (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) ] / p^3 = (1 - p^2)^(3/2 )

Thus, the envelope is parametrized by p as:

x = p^3

y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2 )

So, this is the envelope curve of the family F.

Now, the envelope is a curve in the first quadrant. Points on AB that lie on this envelope are the points where AB is tangent to the envelope. Since we're looking for a unique point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB, that point must be the point of tangency between AB and the envelope.

Therefore, we need to find the point where line AB is tangent to the envelope curve.

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

The envelope is given parametrically by x = p^3, y = (1 - p^2)^(3/2 ). So, to find where AB is tangent to the envelope, we can substitute x and y from the envelope into AB's equation and set the discriminant to zero for tangency.

So, substituting into AB's equation:

(1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) = -sqrt(3) * p^3 + sqrt(3)/2

Let me write that as:

(1 - p^2)^(3/2 ) + sqrt(3) p^3 = sqrt(3)/2

We can write this equation and solve for p.

Let me denote s = p^2 for simplicity. Then, p^3 = p * s.

Wait, but maybe it's better to work directly with p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but I need to be careful since squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

Wait, but before that, let's see if we can rearrange the equation:

(1 -
