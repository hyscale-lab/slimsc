Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, and D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and they form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in fact, they are perpendicular. Wait, I think they are. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's a key property.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

So, let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Let me think about the coordinates of the points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, another approach could be to use the properties of the rhombus in terms of the diagonals.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relation: if d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals, then the area is (d1*d2)/2. Also, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals: each side is sqrt( (d1/2)² + (d2/2)² ). So, maybe I can express the sides in terms of the diagonals.

But in this problem, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/
