Okay, so I have this tetrahedron problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths:
- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

And there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me recall that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, analogous to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, we're looking for the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think the formula is similar to the 2D case. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, for a tetrahedron, I believe the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, inradius r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A, then compute 3V / A.

But first, to compute V, I might need to figure out the coordinates of the vertices or find some other way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a property from the given edge lengths that can help compute volume and surface area more easily.

Wait, the given edge lengths seem symmetrical. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. It looks like the opposite edges are equal. That suggests that this tetrahedron is "equifacial," or maybe it's isohedral? Wait, no, isohedral is when all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, perhaps with congruent opposite edges, which is sometimes called a "disphenoid." Yes, I think that's the term. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, all faces are congruent? Or just that opposite edges are equal?

Wait, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, right? So, if that's the case, then all faces are congruent, so their areas would be equal, which would make the surface area easier to compute. Let me check.

Given the edges: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. Now, let's see what triangles are formed.

Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with edges from these pairs. Let's consider face ABC: edges AB=√41, BC=√89, and AC=√80. Similarly, face ABD: edges AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89. So, faces ABC and ABD have the same edge lengths, so they are congruent triangles. Similarly, the other faces should be congruent as well.

So, yes, all four faces are congruent triangles, which means it is a disphenoid. Thus, all faces have the same area, which will be helpful.

So, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's pick triangle ABC with sides √41, √80, √89.

Wait, let me compute the area of triangle ABC. Using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semiperimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2

But Heron's formula requires squaring, which might get complicated. Alternatively, since it's a right triangle? Let me check if the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

Compute (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 = 41 + 80 = 121. And (√89)^2 = 89, which is not 121. So, no, it's not a right triangle.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Heronian triangle? Let's see:

Compute 41 + 80 = 121, 41 + 89 = 130, 80 + 89 = 169. Hmmm. 169 is 13^2, but 121 is 11^2, 130 isn't a square. So, maybe not.

So, I'll have to use Heron's formula. Let's proceed.

First, compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2

But this is going to get messy. Maybe instead, find the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let me try that.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0, 0). Let me assign coordinates to other points such that I can satisfy the given edge lengths.

But given the symmetry, maybe I can place the points in a symmetric way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which can compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, that might be a good approach. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 a² b² c²

1 a² 0 d² e²

1 b² d² 0 f²

1 c² e² f² 0

So, let me arrange the given edge lengths.

Given:

AB = √41 => a² = 41

AC = √80 => b² = 80

AD = √89 => c² = 89

BC = √89 => d² = 89

BD = √80 => e² = 80

CD = √41 => f² =41

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure I get the order right. Cayley-Menger matrix is:

[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, a², b², c²],
  [1, a², 0, d², e²],
  [1, b², d², 0, f²],
  [1, c², e², f², 0] ]

So, with a = AB, b = AC, c = AD, d = BC, e = BD, f = CD.

So, plugging in the values:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in the matrix:

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Wait, yes, so that's consistent with the given edge lengths.

So, plugging in, the matrix is as above.

Now, the determinant of this 5x5 matrix will be used to compute the volume.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is quite tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry we can exploit.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry which allows us to compute the determinant more easily.

Looking at the matrix:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

I notice that the matrix is symmetric across the main diagonal. So, it's a symmetric matrix.

Also, the lower right part is a mirror of the upper left. For example, Row 1 and Row 4 are mirror images in terms of edge lengths.

Wait, maybe we can find a pattern here to compute the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps the volume can be found another way, given the symmetry.

Wait, let's think about the volume.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / 12

Wait, no, that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Maybe my memory is off.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edge lengths.

Wait, I found a resource earlier that says for a disphenoid, the volume is (4/3) times the square root of the product of the areas of the three pairs of opposite edges divided by something? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles hinged along a common edge. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Let me write out the determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |

| 1   0   41   80   89 |

| 1  41    0   89   80 |

| 1  80   89    0   41 |

| 1  89   80   41    0 |

So, the determinant of this matrix is needed.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So, M is a 5x5 matrix. The Volume squared is (1/288) * |M|.

Computing |M| would give Volume squared.

But computing a 5x5 determinant is not trivial. However, perhaps I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

First, let me note that the first row and first column have a 0 and four 1s. Maybe subtract the first row from the other rows to create zeros.

Wait, let's try that.

Subtract Row 0 from Rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, Row 1 becomes Row1 - Row0:

Row1: 1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1 => 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Similarly, Row2 becomes Row2 - Row0: 1-0, 41-1, 0-1, 89-1, 80-1 => 1, 40, -1, 88, 79

Row3 becomes Row3 - Row0: 1-0, 80-1, 89-1, 0-1, 41-1 => 1, 79, 88, -1, 40

Row4 becomes Row4 - Row0: 1-0, 89-1, 80-1, 41-1, 0-1 => 1, 88, 79, 40, -1

So, the transformed matrix is:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Row2: 1, 40, -1, 88, 79

Row3: 1, 79, 88, -1, 40

Row4: 1, 88, 79, 40, -1

Hmm, now the matrix still looks complicated, but perhaps we can see some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe subtract the first column from other columns to create more zeros.

Looking at the first column, which is [0,1,1,1,1]^T. If I subtract the first column from, say, columns 2,3,4,5, that might help.

Wait, column operations can also help in computing determinants.

Let me perform the following column operations:

C2 = C2 - C1

C3 = C3 - C1

C4 = C4 - C1

C5 = C5 - C1

So, after these operations, the new columns 2,3,4,5 will be:

For Row0: columns 2-5 become [1-0, 1-0, 1-0, 1-0] = [1,1,1,1]

Wait, no. Wait, column operations: each column is subtracted by column 1.

So, for Row0:

Column0: 0

Column1: 1 - 0 = 1

Column2: 1 - 0 = 1

Column3: 1 - 0 = 1

Column4: 1 - 0 = 1

So, Row0 becomes [0,1,1,1,1]

For Row1:

Column0: 1

Column1: -1 -1 = -2

Column2: 40 -1 = 39

Column3: 79 -1 = 78

Column4: 88 -1 = 87

Similarly for other rows:

Row2:

Column0:1

Column1:40 -1=39

Column2:-1 -1=-2

Column3:88 -1=87

Column4:79 -1=78

Row3:

Column0:1

Column1:79 -1=78

Column2:88 -1=87

Column3:-1 -1=-2

Column4:40 -1=39

Row4:

Column0:1

Column1:88 -1=87

Column2:79 -1=78

Column3:40 -1=39

Column4:-1 -1=-2

So, the transformed matrix is now:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, -2, 39, 78, 87

Row2: 1, 39, -2, 87, 78

Row3: 1, 78, 87, -2, 39

Row4: 1, 87, 78, 39, -2

Hmm, this is still a bit messy, but maybe we can see some patterns.

Looking at the rows 1 to 4, each has a -2 in a different position, and the other entries are symmetric.

Let me see if the determinant can be expanded. Alternatively, perhaps we can exploit the symmetry.

Wait, note that rows 1-4 are permutations of each other in terms of their entries, except for the position of the -2. So, perhaps we can perform some more row operations.

Alternatively, maybe we can factor some common terms.

Looking at Row1: 1, -2, 39, 78, 87

We can factor 3 from some elements: 39=3*13, 78=6*13, 87=3*29.

Similarly, Row2: 1,39,-2,87,78. Again 39=3*13, 87=3*29, 78=6*13.

Row3:1,78,87,-2,39. 78=6*13, 87=3*29, 39=3*13.

Row4:1,87,78,39,-2. 87=3*29, 78=6*13, 39=3*13.

So, perhaps factor 3 from certain columns.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract rows from each other.

Wait, let me consider the following: subtract Row1 from Rows 2,3,4.

So:

Row2_new = Row2 - Row1:

1-1=0, 39 - (-2)=41, -2 -39=-41,87 -78=9,78 -87=-9

Similarly, Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:

1-1=0,78 - (-2)=80,87 -39=48,-2 -78=-80,39 -87=-48

Row4_new = Row4 - Row1:

1-1=0,87 - (-2)=89,78 -39=39,39 -78=-39,-2 -87=-89

So, the matrix after these operations becomes:

Row0: 0,1,1,1,1

Row1:1,-2,39,78,87

Row2:0,41,-41,9,-9

Row3:0,80,48,-80,-48

Row4:0,89,39,-39,-89

Hmm, maybe we can factor some terms from these new rows.

Looking at Row2: 0,41,-41,9,-9

We can factor 41 from the first two elements: 41*(1, -1) and then 9*(1, -1)

Similarly, Row3: 0,80,48,-80,-48

Factor 16*(5, 3), and then -16*(5, 3). Wait, 80 = 16*5, 48=16*3, -80=-16*5, -48=-16*3.

So, Row3 can be expressed as 16*(5,3, -5, -3). Or, 8*(10,6,-10,-6), but 80,48 is 16*(5,3), so that's better.

Similarly, Row4: 0,89,39,-39,-89

Factor 89 and 39: 89*(1, -1) and 39*(1, -1). So, 89*(1, -1) + 39*(1, -1) = (89+39)(1, -1) = 128*(1, -1). Hmm, wait, no, because Row4 is [0,89,39,-39,-89], which can be written as 89*(1,0,0,0,-1) +39*(0,0,1,-1,0). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, notice that Row2 and Row4 have similar structures.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 9 from Row2.

Row2: 0,41,-41,9,-9 => 0, 41(1, -1), 9(1, -1)

Similarly, Row4: 0,89,39,-39,-89 => 0, 89(1, -1), 39(1, -1)

So, perhaps we can factor (1, -1) from some parts.

But maybe it's better to proceed with expanding the determinant now.

Wait, the matrix is now:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, -2, 39, 78, 87

Row2: 0,41,-41,9,-9

Row3:0,80,48,-80,-48

Row4:0,89,39,-39,-89

Since the first column has a 0 in Row0, and 1s in Rows1-4, perhaps we can expand along the first column.

The determinant would then be:

0 * minor(0,0) - 1 * minor(1,0) + 0 * minor(2,0) - 0 * minor(3,0) + 0 * minor(4,0)

So, determinant = -1 * minor(1,0)

Where minor(1,0) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.

So, minor(1,0) is:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row2:41,-41,9,-9

Row3:80,48,-80,-48

Row4:89,39,-39,-89

So, the minor is the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

Let me write it down:

| 1   1    1    1  |

|41 -41   9   -9 |

|80  48 -80  -48 |

|89  39 -39  -89 |

Hmm, now compute this 4x4 determinant. Again, perhaps perform row operations to simplify.

First, perhaps subtract Row0 from Rows1,2,3,4.

So, Row1_new = Row1 - Row0:

41 -1 =40, -41 -1 =-42, 9 -1=8, -9 -1=-10

Row2_new = Row2 - Row0:80-1=79,48-1=47,-80-1=-81,-48-1=-49

Row3_new = Row3 - Row0:89-1=88,39-1=38,-39-1=-40,-89-1=-90

So, the transformed matrix is:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row1:40,-42,8,-10

Row2:79,47,-81,-49

Row3:88,38,-40,-90

Now, perhaps factor common terms from the rows.

Looking at Row1: 40,-42,8,-10. Maybe factor 2: 2*(20, -21,4,-5)

Row2:79,47,-81,-49. Doesn't seem to have a common factor.

Row3:88,38,-40,-90. Factor 2: 2*(44,19,-20,-45)

So, maybe proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps subtract Row1 from Row2 and Row3.

Row2_new = Row2 - Row1:

79 -40=39,47 - (-42)=89,-81 -8=-89,-49 - (-10)=-39

Row3_new = Row3 - Row1:

88 -40=48,38 - (-42)=80,-40 -8=-48,-90 - (-10)=-80

So, the new matrix is:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row1:40,-42,8,-10

Row2:39,89,-89,-39

Row3:48,80,-48,-80

Hmm, perhaps factor from Row2 and Row3.

Row2:39,89,-89,-39. Let's see, 39 and -39 can be factored. 89 and -89 as well.

So, Row2 = 39*(1,0,0,-1) + 89*(0,1,-1,0). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe factor 13 from 39 and -39.

Row2: 39=13*3, 89 is prime, -89, -39=13*(-3)

So, perhaps factor 13 from first and last elements: 13*(3, (89)/13, -89/13, -3). But 89 isn't divisible by 13, so that's messy.

Alternatively, notice that Row2 can be written as 39,89,-89,-39. So, the first and last elements are negatives: 39 and -39, 89 and -89.

Similarly, Row3:48,80,-48,-80: 48 and -48, 80 and -80.

So, perhaps factor out 16 from Row2 and Row3.

Wait, Row2: 39,89,-89,-39. Hmm, 39=3*13, 89 is prime.

Alternatively, perhaps write Row2 as [39,89,-89,-39] = [39,89,-89,-39]. Not much better.

Wait, maybe perform column operations.

For example, Column3 = Column3 - Column1.

So, in Row1: 8 - (-42) =50

Wait, no, column operations on the entire matrix.

Wait, the current matrix is:

Row0:1,1,1,1

Row1:40,-42,8,-10

Row2:39,89,-89,-39

Row3:48,80,-48,-80

Let me perform Column3 = Column3 - Column1.

So, Column3 becomes:

Row0:1-1=0

Row1:8 - (-42)=50

Row2:-89 -89= -178

Row3:-48 -80= -128

Similarly, Column4 = Column4 - Column1:

Row0:1 -1=0

Row1:-10 - (-42)=32

Row2:-39 -89= -128

Row3:-80 -80= -160

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0:1,1,0,0

Row1:40,-42,50,32

Row2:39,89,-178,-128

Row3:48,80,-128,-160

Hmm, now the first two rows have 0s in columns 3 and 4.

Looking at Row0:1,1,0,0.

This might be helpful. Now, perhaps expand the determinant along Row0.

The minor's determinant is:

1 * det(minor(0,0)) - 1 * det(minor(0,1)) + 0 - 0.

So, determinant = 1 * det of the 3x3 matrix:

Row1: -42,50,32

Row2:89,-178,-128

Row3:80,-128,-160

Minus 1 times the determinant of:

Row1:40,50,32

Row2:39,-178,-128

Row3:48,-128,-160

So, determinant = det(M1) - det(M2), where M1 is the first minor and M2 is the second.

First, compute det(M1):

| -42   50    32  |

| 89  -178  -128 |

|80   -128  -160 |

Compute this 3x3 determinant.

Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

Let me compute it:

= -42 * det[ -178, -128; -128, -160 ] - 50 * det[89, -128; 80, -160 ] + 32 * det[89, -178; 80, -128]

Compute each minor:

First term: -42 * [ (-178)(-160) - (-128)(-128) ] = -42 * [ 28480 - 16384 ] = -42 * (12096) = -42 * 12096

Second term: -50 * [89*(-160) - (-128)*80 ] = -50 * [ -14240 + 10240 ] = -50 * (-4000) = 200,000

Third term: 32 * [89*(-128) - (-178)*80 ] = 32 * [ -11392 + 14240 ] = 32 * (2848) = 32*2848

Compute each part:

First term: -42 * 12096

Let me compute 42 * 12096.

12096 * 40 = 483,840

12096 * 2 = 24,192

Total: 483,840 + 24,192 = 508,032

So, first term: -508,032.

Second term: +200,000.

Third term: 32 * 2848.

Compute 2848 * 32:

2848 * 30 = 85,440

2848 * 2 = 5,696

Total: 85,440 + 5,696 = 91,136.

So, third term: +91,136.

Adding all together: -508,032 + 200,000 + 91,136 = (-508,032 + 291,136) = -216,896.

So, det(M1) = -216,896.

Now compute det(M2):

| 40   50    32  |

|39  -178  -128 |

|48  -128  -160 |

Compute this determinant.

Again, using cofactor expansion.

= 40 * det[ -178, -128; -128, -160 ] -50 * det[39, -128; 48, -160 ] +32 * det[39, -178;48, -128 ]

Compute each minor:

First term: 40 * [ (-178)(-160) - (-128)(-128) ] = 40 * [ 28,480 - 16,384 ] = 40 * 12,096 = 483,840.

Second term: -50 * [39*(-160) - (-128)*48 ] = -50 * [ -6,240 + 6,144 ] = -50 * (-96) = 4,800.

Third term:32 * [39*(-128) - (-178)*48 ] =32 * [ -4,992 + 8,544 ] =32 * 3,552 = 113,664.

So, adding all together:

483,840 + 4,800 + 113,664 = 483,840 + 4,800 = 488,640; 488,640 + 113,664 = 602,304.

So, det(M2) = 602,304.

Thus, determinant of the minor is det(M1) - det(M2) = (-216,896) - 602,304 = -819,200.

Wait, wait, no. Because the determinant expansion was:

determinant = det(M1) - det(M2). Because expanding along Row0, which had 1,1,0,0.

So, determinant = 1* det(M1) -1* det(M2) = (-216,896) - (602,304) = -819,200.

Therefore, the minor determinant is -819,200.

So, going back, the original determinant of the 5x5 matrix was -1 * minor(1,0) = -1 * (-819,200) = 819,200.

But wait, wait. Let me recap.

The 5x5 determinant is equal to -1 * minor(1,0). minor(1,0) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix, which we computed as -819,200.

Wait, no. Wait, the minor(1,0) is the determinant we just computed, which was -819,200. So, the 5x5 determinant is -1 * (-819,200) = 819,200.

Therefore, the determinant is 819,200.

So, Volume squared is (1/288)* |determinant| = (1/288)*819,200.

Compute that:

819,200 / 288.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 819,200 ÷16 =51,200; 288 ÷16=18.

So, 51,200 / 18.

Simplify further: 51,200 ÷ 2 =25,600; 18 ÷2=9.

So, 25,600 /9.

So, Volume squared is 25,600 /9.

Therefore, Volume V = sqrt(25,600 /9 ) = sqrt(25,600)/sqrt(9) = 160 /3.

So, V = 160/3.

Alright, so the volume is 160/3.

Now, compute the total surface area A.

Since it's a disphenoid with four congruent faces, each face has the same area. So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Earlier, I tried Heron's formula but thought it might be messy. Let's proceed.

Compute semiperimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

Compute s^2, but maybe it's better to compute the area squared using Heron's formula.

Area^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c).

But that might be messy. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for area in terms of side lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps use vectors or coordinates.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the area using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

But that's still Heron's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the area can be computed as 1/2 * base * height, but without knowing the height, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Menger determinant for a triangle. Wait, the area of a triangle with sides a,b,c can be found using the determinant:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1

1 0 a² b²

1 a² 0 c²

1 b² c² 0

)

But wait, that's the same as Heron's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the area numerically.

Wait, let me compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

Compute each term:

√41 ≈6.4031

√80≈8.9443

√89≈9.4340

s≈ (6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4340)/2≈(24.7814)/2≈12.3907

Then, Area ≈ sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

Compute s -a≈12.3907 -6.4031≈5.9876

s - b≈12.3907 -8.9443≈3.4464

s - c≈12.3907 -9.4340≈2.9567

So, product≈12.3907 *5.9876 *3.4464 *2.9567

Compute step by step:

12.3907 *5.9876 ≈approx 12.39 *6≈74.34 (exact value: 12.3907*5.9876≈74.31)

Then, 3.4464 *2.9567≈approx3.45*3≈10.35, but exact: 3.4464*2.9567≈10.17

Then, multiply 74.31 *10.17≈approx74*10=740, plus 74*0.17≈12.58, plus 0.31*10≈3.1, plus 0.31*0.17≈0.05. So total≈740 +12.58+3.1+0.05≈755.73.

So, Area≈sqrt(755.73)≈approx27.5.

But this is an approximate value. Let me compute it more accurately.

But perhaps I can find an exact expression.

Wait, since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides √41, √80, √89, and the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, the area of each face can be found using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a² + b² + c²)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) )

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall.

Wait, for a triangle, the area can be computed using Heron's formula, which in terms of side lengths a,b,c is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]. But perhaps, in terms of a², b², c², there's another formula.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula:

16 Area² = 2(a²b² + b²c² + c²a²) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)

This is known as the formula of area in terms of side lengths squared.

Yes, that's correct. So, 16 Area² = 2(a²b² + b²c² + c²a²) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4)

So, for our triangle, a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

Compute each term:

a²=41, b²=80, c²=89.

Compute 2(a²b² + b²c² + c²a²) =2(41*80 + 80*89 +89*41)

Compute each product:

41*80=3280

80*89=7120

89*41=3649

So, sum: 3280 +7120=10400; 10400 +3649=14049

Multiply by 2: 28,098

Compute (a^4 + b^4 + c^4) =41² +80² +89² = 1681 + 6400 +7921 =1681+6400=8081; 8081 +7921=16002

So, 16 Area²=28,098 -16,002=12,096

Thus, Area²=12,096 /16=756

So, Area= sqrt(756)=sqrt(4*189)=2*sqrt(189)=2*sqrt(9*21)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6√21.

So, each face has area 6√21.

Therefore, total surface area A=4 *6√21=24√21.

So, now, the inradius r= 3V / A= 3*(160/3) / (24√21)= (160) / (24√21)= Simplify.

Simplify numerator and denominator: 160 /24= (160 ÷8)/(24 ÷8)=20/3.

So, r=20/(3√21). Rationalize the denominator:

r=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/63.

So, r= (20√21)/63.

Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but p=63 and m=20. Are m and p coprime? 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1, yes. And n=21 is square-free (21=3*7, no square factors). So, yes.

So, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 3V/A: V=160/3, A=24√21.

So, 3V=160.

So, 160/(24√21)= (160/24)/√21= (20/3)/√21=20/(3√21)=20√21/(3*21)=20√21/63. Correct.

So, yes, the distance is 20√21 /63.

Hence, m=20, n=21, p=63. So, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.


To find the inradius of the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with given edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we use the formula for the inradius \(r = \frac{3V}{A}\), where \(V\) is the volume and \(A\) is the total surface area.

1. **Volume Calculation using Cayley-Menger Determinant**:
   The volume \(V\) is computed using the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths \(AB = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = \sqrt{80}\), \(AD = \sqrt{89}\), \(BC = \sqrt{89}\), \(BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(CD = \sqrt{41}\). The determinant is:
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix}
   0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
   1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
   1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
   1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
   1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
   \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   After simplifying, the determinant is found to be \(819,200\). Thus,
   \[
   V^2 = \frac{1}{288} \times 819,200 = \frac{25,600}{9}, \quad V = \frac{160}{3}.
   \]

2. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its side lengths squared:
   \[
   16A^2 = 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4),
   \]
   where \(a^2 = 41\), \(b^2 = 80\), and \(c^2 = 89\). Substituting these values:
   \[
   16A^2 = 2(41 \times 80 + 80 \times 89 + 89 \times 41) - (41^2 + 80^2 + 89^2) = 28,098 - 16,002 = 12,096.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   A^2 = \frac{12,096}{16} = 756, \quad A = 6\sqrt{21}.
   \]
   Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area is:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}.
   \]

3. **Inradius Calculation**:
   Using the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{A}\):
   \[
   r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}.
   \]
   The inradius is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{104}\).
