Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier to handle because then I can express z in terms of its magnitude and angle.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because when you take the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form, you invert the magnitude and negate the angle. That could be helpful.

Now, substituting z into the expression, it becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ})). Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}. Let me calculate the scalar multiplication first. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So, this becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second part: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ} because 96/4 is 24 and 144/4 is 36.

So, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Remember, the real part of a complex number is the part without the imaginary unit i.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this expression would be Re[A e^{iθ}] + Re[B e^{-iθ}].

I know that for a complex number multiplied by e^{iθ}, the real part can be found using the dot product with the real and imaginary parts. Alternatively, I can use Euler's formula.

Let me write A and B in terms of their real and imaginary parts.

A = 300 + 468i, so Re(A) = 300, Im(A) = 468.

B = 24 + 36i, so Re(B) = 24, Im(B) = 36.

Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. Similarly, e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, Re[A e^{iθ}] = Re[(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)].

Let me compute that. Multiply it out:

(300)(cosθ) + (300)(i sinθ) + (468i)(cosθ) + (468i)(i sinθ).

Simplify each term:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 is -1, the last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Similarly, Re[B e^{-iθ}] = Re[(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)].

Multiplying this out:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

But since we're only interested in the real parts, let me sum the real parts from both expressions.

So, total real part is:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

That's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part of the entire expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, the problem is to find the maximum value of this real part as θ varies. So, I need to find the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that an expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Alternatively, it can be written as R sin(θ + something), but the key is that the maximum value is R.

Wait, actually, let me recall: the maximum value of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a² + b²), regardless of the signs. Because it's the amplitude of the sinusoidal function.

So, in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write this as a cosθ + b sinθ, where a = 324 and b = -432.

Then, the maximum value is sqrt(a² + b²). So, let me compute that.

Compute a²: 324². Let me calculate that. 324 squared is (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

b² is (-432)^2, which is 432². Let me compute 400² is 160,000. 32² is 1,024. And cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, 432² = (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So, a² + b² is 104,976 + 186,624 = let me add these. 104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 is 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 is 11,600. So total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) is sqrt(291600). Hmm, let me see. 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000. Wait, 540² is (500+40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 +40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. Yes, that's right.

So, sqrt(291600) is 540. Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, the expression is a cosθ + b sinθ, where a = 324, b = -432. So, the amplitude is sqrt(a² + b²) = 540, which is the maximum value.

Hence, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, but just to double-check, is this the correct approach? Another way to think about this is writing the real part as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be expressed as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² +432²). But regardless of the phase shift, the maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is R, which is 540.

Yes, that seems right. So, I think the maximum real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

Substituting \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
The real part of this expression is:
\[
\text{Re}\left[(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta}\right] +
