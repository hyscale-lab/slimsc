Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product xy given some logarithmic equations. The problem states that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula or by expressing them in exponential form. Maybe converting these log equations into their exponential forms will make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. If I rewrite this in exponential form, it should be x^10 = y^x, right? Because log base a of b equals c means a^c = b. So yes, x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, that would mean y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. So I have x and y in both the base and the exponents here. Maybe I can express y in terms of x from the first equation and substitute into the second. Alternatively, I can take logarithms of both sides to bring down the exponents. Let me try the substitution approach first.

From the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Let me solve for y. To do that, I can take both sides to the power of 1/x, so y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^(10/x). So y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x.

Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation. The second equation is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y, we get [x^(10/x)]^10 = x^{4y}.

Let me simplify the left side first: [x^(10/x)]^10 is x^(10/x * 10) = x^(100/x). So the left side is x^(100/x). The right side is x^{4y}, which is x^{4 * y}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, their exponents must be equal. So:

100/x = 4y

But from earlier, we have y = x^(10/x). So substituting that in:

100/x = 4 * x^(10/x)

Hmm, okay. So now I have an equation where both sides involve x, but x is in an exponent on the right. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to solve for x. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a substitution variable to simplify this expression.

Let me let t = x^(10/x). Then, from the equation above, 100/x = 4t. But wait, we already know that t is y, right? Because y = x^(10/x). So, 100/x = 4y, and since y = t, that would mean 100/x = 4t. But since t = y = x^(10/x), that's consistent with what we have.

Wait, maybe that substitution doesn't help much. Let me think differently. Let's take the equation 100/x = 4y and express y in terms of x.

From 100/x = 4y, we can rearrange this to y = (100/x)/4 = 25/x. So y is 25/x. Hmm, that's interesting. So now I have y expressed as 25/x.

But earlier,
