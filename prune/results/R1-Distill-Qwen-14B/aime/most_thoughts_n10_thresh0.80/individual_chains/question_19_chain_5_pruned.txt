Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and the circumcenter (O) can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Yeah, that rings a bell. So substituting the given values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that: 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

But wait, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that triangle OIA is a right triangle with the right angle at I. So in triangle OIA, IA is perpendicular to OI. Therefore, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.

Let me denote IA as the length from incenter I to vertex A. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of other triangle parameters. But I'm not exactly sure of the formula. Maybe I can derive it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry. Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think about other properties.

Wait, I recall that in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be found using the formula IA = (r)/sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me verify that. Yes, I think that's correct because the inradius is related to the angle bisectors.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, which we found is sqrt(13), maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA.

In triangle OIA, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13. IA is perpendicular to OI, so OA² = OI² + IA². Let me write that down:

OA² = OI² + IA²
13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So IA is 2*sqrt(39). But earlier, I had IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So,

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)
sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(39):

(3*sqrt(39))/(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Hmm, that's the sine of half of angle A. I need to find AB·AC, which is the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC. Let me denote AB as c and AC as b, following the standard notation where side a is BC, side b is AC, and side
