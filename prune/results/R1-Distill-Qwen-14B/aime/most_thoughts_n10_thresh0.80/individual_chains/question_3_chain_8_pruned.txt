Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Alright, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. If all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, I need to find P(A|B) which is the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize.

But wait, if she won the grand prize, that means she has all four numbers correct. Which also means she definitely has at least two correct. So, the intersection of A and B is just A. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

Right, so I need to compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize.

Let me think about how to compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So, the total possible combinations are 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four numbers Jen picked match the four chosen. Since there's only one such winning combination, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, she could have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers.

But wait, in the problem, she only wins a prize if at least two are correct, and she wins the grand prize only if all four are correct. So, P(B) is the probability that she has exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers.

Alternatively, another way to compute P(B) is to subtract the probability that she has fewer than two correct numbers from 1. So, P(B) = 1 - P(exactly 0 correct) - P(exactly 1 correct). Maybe that's easier.

Let me try both approaches and see which one is simpler.

First, the approach where I compute P(B) as the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 correct numbers.

I know that the number of ways to choose k correct numbers from her 4 and the remaining (4 - k) from the incorrect numbers.

Wait, actually, the process is that the lottery chooses 4 numbers, and Jen has 4 numbers. The number of overlapping numbers between her set and the lottery's set is k, where k can be 0,1,2,3,4.

So, the probability that exactly k numbers match is given by the hypergeometric distribution.

The formula for the hypergeometric probability is:

P(k) = [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)] / C(10,4)

Wait, hold on. Because the total set is 10 numbers, Jen has picked 4, so the remaining 6 are not her numbers. The lottery also picks 4 numbers. So, the number of ways to choose k numbers from Jen's 4 and 4 - k from the remaining 6 is C(4,k)*
