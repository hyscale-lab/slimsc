Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect the angles, and they intersect at right angles. So yeah, they bisect each other at right angles.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that suggests that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, for a rhombus ABCD, the midpoints of AC and BD are both at the origin. So if A is a point (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). So that makes sense.

So, points A and C are diametrically opposite across the origin, as are B and D. So the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, plugging each point into this equation must satisfy it.

So, for point A (x, y): x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

Similarly for point B (p, q): p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

And same for points C (-x, -y) and D (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, they
