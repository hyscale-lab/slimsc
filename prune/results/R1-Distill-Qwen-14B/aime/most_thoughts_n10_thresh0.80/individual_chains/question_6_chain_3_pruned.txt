Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we're given two functions:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))  
and  
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

We need to find the number of intersections of these two graphs. That means we need to find all pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations. 

First, let's understand the functions f and g. 

f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. Wait, that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, and then another absolute value? Hmm, actually, no, wait. Wait, the notation is f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So that's the absolute value of (|x| - 1/2). Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, so the same idea.

Let me think about how these functions behave. 

Let's consider f(x) first. Since it's absolute value, it's going to create a V-shaped graph. Let me visualize f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

The inner part is |x|, so for x >=0, |x| is x. So, f(x) becomes |x - 1/2|. Similarly, for x < 0, |x| is -x, so f(x) becomes |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|.

Wait, so f(x) is a piecewise function:

For x >=0:
f(x) = |x - 1/2|

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x=1/2, y=0.

For x <0:
f(x) = |x + 1/2|

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x=-1/2, y=0.

So overall, f(x) looks like a W or M shape? Wait, no, maybe it's two Vs connected at the origin. Let me plot some points.

At x=0: f(0)=|0 - 1/2| = 1/2. So point (0, 1/2).

For x=1/2: f(1/2)=0.

x=1: f(1)=|1 - 1/2|=1/2.

Similarly, x=-1/2: f(-1/2)=0.

x=-1: f(-1)=| -1 + 1/2 | = | -1/2 | = 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V shape on the right side with vertex at (1/2, 0) and another V shape on the left side with vertex at (-1/2, 0), both meeting at (0, 1/2). So it's like a diamond shape, actually. So f(x) is a diamond with vertices at (-1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (1/2,0).

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

For x >=0: g(x) = |x - 1/4|. So vertex at (1/4, 0), increasing on either side.

For x <0: g(x) = |-x - 1/4| = |x + 1/4|. So vertex at (-1/4, 0).

So g(x) has vertices at (-1/4, 0) and (1/4, 0), with a peak at (0,1/4).

So, now we have f and g defined.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

These are both transformations of the original functions f and g, applied to sine and cosine functions, then scaled by 4.

So, to find the intersections, we need to solve for (x,y) such that:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))  
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, it's a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the other. It's a bit tricky because x is a function of y, and y is a function of x.

Maybe I can try to substitute one into the other. Let me see.

From the first equation, y is expressed in terms of x. So, perhaps I can substitute this y into the second equation, and then we have an equation in x only.

So, substituting:

x = 4 g(f(cos(3π * y)))  
But y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

So, substituting y:

x = 4 g(f(cos(3π * (4 g(f(sin(2πx)))))))

Hmm, that's a complicated expression. Maybe it's better to analyze the behavior of these functions step by step.

Let's think about the ranges of f and g. Since f(x) and g(x) are absolute values, their outputs are always non-negative.

First, sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are periodic functions with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively. So, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, and cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3. 

But since we're dealing with f and g, which are absolute values, let's see what happens when we compose these functions.

Let's begin by considering the innermost functions.

First, f(sin(2πx)):

sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1. So, let's compute f(sin(2πx)).

f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |, where z = sin(2πx). So, since z is between -1 and 1, |z| is between 0 and 1.

So, |z| - 1/2 will range from -1/2 (when |z|=0) to 1/2 (when |z|=1). Taking the absolute value, f(z) will range from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, let's see:

If |z| >= 1/2, then |z| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(z) = |z| - 1/2, which ranges from 0 to 1/2 (since |z| can be up to 1).

If |z| < 1/2, then |z| - 1/2 is negative, so f(z) = -( |z| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |z|, which ranges from 0 (when |z|=1/2) to 1/2 (when |z|=0).

So overall, f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)): since f(z) is in [0,1/2], let's compute g(w) where w is in [0,1/2].

g(w) = | |w| - 1/4 |. But w is non-negative, so g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So, when w is in [0,1/2], g(w) is |w - 1/4|.

So, the minimum value of w is 0, so |0 - 1/4|=1/4, and at w=1/4, it's 0. At w=1/2, |1/2 - 1/4|=1/4.

So, g(w) varies between 0 and 1/4, with a minimum at w=1/4.

Therefore, 4 g(w) will scale this to 0 to 1, with a minimum of 0 at w=1/4, and maximum of 1 otherwise.

So, 4 g(f(z)) where z is sin(2πx) will range between 0 and 1.

Therefore, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) will have y between 0 and 1.

Similarly, let's analyze the second function:

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

Similarly, cos(3πy) ranges between -1 and 1, so f(cos(3πy)) will be as before, in [0,1/2].

Then, g(f(cos(3πy))) is | |f(cos(3πy))| - 1/4 |, but f(...) is non-negative, so it's |w - 1/4| where w is in [0,1/2].

As before, this ranges from 0 to 1/4, so 4 times that is from 0 to 1.

So, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) will have x between 0 and 1.

So, both x and y are in [0,1]. So, we can restrict our attention to the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].

Now, to find the number of solutions, perhaps we can analyze the number of times the curves intersect within this square.

Alternatively, maybe we can graph these functions or find symmetries or periodicities.

Given the functions involve sine and cosine with different frequencies, the problem may have a lot of intersections. Alternatively, considering the compositions, maybe it's better to look for periodicity or to find the number of solutions in a fundamental period.

Let me think about the periods.

The function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period related to sin(2πx), which has a period of 1. So, y is
