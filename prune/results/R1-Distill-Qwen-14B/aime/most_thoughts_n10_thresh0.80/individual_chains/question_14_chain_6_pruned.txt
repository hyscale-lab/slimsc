Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such N with the given property.

The key property here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N (let's say the digits are a, b, c, d, so N = abcd), changing a to 1 gives 1bcd which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives abc1. All four of these must be divisible by 7.

Wait, but N itself may or may not be divisible by 7. The problem only states that changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So N could be divisible by 7 or not, but all these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards, but that seems time-consuming. There must be a smarter way.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0-9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we change a to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Divisible by 7.

Same for changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.

And changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Also divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, these four numbers must all be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me write down these conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, four conditions. Let me see if I can express these in terms of N.

Wait, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let me see if I can relate these modified numbers to N.

When I change a to 1, the number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's see, N was 1000a + ... So, 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a - 1000) = N - 1000(a - 1). Hmm, perhaps not useful.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute each modified number modulo 7 and set them equal to zero.

First, I'll compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 divided by 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.

Now, let's rewrite the four conditions using these:

1. For changing a to 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Because 1000 mod7 is 6, 100b mod7 is 2b, 10c mod7 is 3c, d mod7 is d.

So 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0.

Similarly, changing b to 1: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0.

Because 1000a mod7 is 6a, since 1000≡6, and a is multiplied by 1000.

100 mod7 is 2, so 100*1 mod7 is 2.

So condition 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0.

Condition 3: Changing c to 1: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0.

Because 1000a is 6a, 100b is 2b, 10*1 is 3, and d is d.

Condition 4: Changing d to 1: 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0.

So four equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, so four equations.

Let me write them as:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7. Which is 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7. Which is 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5).

3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7. Which is 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4).

4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7. Which is 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

So, now we have:

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, this is a system of congruences with variables a, b, c, d.

We can try to solve this system step by step.

Let me see if I can express d from Equation (1) and substitute elsewhere.

From Equation (1): d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Similarly, d is a digit (0-9), so once we find d mod7, we can find its possible value.

Wait, but perhaps better to express d in terms of b and c.

So, d = (1 - 2b - 3c) mod7. Since d is a digit, it can be 0-9, so d = (1 -2b -3c) +7k, where k is an integer such that d remains between 0 and9.

But for now, let's proceed with the congruences.

Now, substituting d into Equation (2):

Equation (2): 6a +3c + d ≡5 mod7.

But d ≡1 -2b -3c, so substitute:

6a +3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5 mod7.

Simplify:

6a +3c +1 -2b -3c ≡5 mod7.

The 3c and -3c cancel:

6a +1 -2b ≡5 mod7.

Which simplifies to:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Equation (2a): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, substitute d into Equation (3):

Equation (3): 6a +2b + d ≡4 mod7.

Again, d ≡1 -2b -3c, so:

6a +2b +1 -2b -3c ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

6a +1 -3c ≡4 mod7.

Which becomes:

6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Equation (3a): 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Now, Equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, we have Equations (2a), (3a), and (4):

(2a): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

(3a): 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

(4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps we can find expressions for a, b, c.

Let me write down Equations (2a), (3a), (4):

Equation (2a): 6a -2b ≡4.

Equation (3a): 6a -3c ≡3.

Equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6.

I can try to solve these equations step by step.

First, let's solve Equations (2a) and (4):

From Equation (2a): 6a -2b ≡4.

Let's denote this as Equation (2a).

Equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6.

If I add Equations (2a) and (4):

(6a -2b) + (6a +2b +3c) ≡4 +6 mod7.

Which simplifies: 12a +3c ≡10 mod7.

But 12 mod7 is 5, so 5a +3c ≡3 mod7, since 10 mod7 is 3.

So, 5a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Equation (5): 5a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Now, Equation (3a): 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Let me write Equation (5) as 5a +3c ≡3.

Equation (3a): 6a -3c ≡3.

Let me add these two equations:

(5a +3c) + (6a -3c) ≡3 +3 mod7.

Which becomes: 11a ≡6 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4, so 4a ≡6 mod7.

We can solve for a:

4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 is 2, since 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 2: a ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

So, a ≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit from 1 to9 (as it's the thousands digit), possible a values are 5, 12, 19,... but since a is a single digit, a can only be 5.

So, a=5.

So, we found that a=5.

Now, substitute a=5 into Equation (3a): 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

6*5=30. 30 mod7: 7*4=28, 30-28=2. So, 2 -3c ≡3 mod7.

Which is: -3c ≡1 mod7. Multiply both sides by -1: 3c ≡-1 mod7, which is 3c≡6 mod7.

Now, solve for c: 3c ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. The inverse of 3 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c ≡6*5=30≡2 mod7. So, c=2 or c=2+7=9.

Since c is a digit (0-9), c can be 2 or 9.

So, c=2 or 9.

Now, let's go back to Equation (2a): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We have a=5, so 6*5=30≡2 mod7. So Equation becomes:

2 -2b ≡4 mod7.

Which is: -2b ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1: 2b ≡-2 mod7 → 2b≡5 mod7.

Solve for b: 2b≡5 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b≡5*4=20≡6 mod7. So, b=6 or 13, but b is a digit so b=6.

So, b=6.

Now, we have a=5, b=6.

Now, from Equation (1): d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Let's compute d for both c=2 and c=9.

Case 1: c=2.

d ≡1 -2*6 -3*2 mod7.

Compute numerator: 1 -12 -6 = 1-18=-17.

-17 mod7: 7* (-3)= -21, so -17 - (-21)=4 → -17 ≡4 mod7.

So, d ≡4 mod7. So possible d: 4, 11, 18,... but d is a digit, so d=4 or 11 is invalid, so d=4.

Case 2: c=9.

d ≡1 -2*6 -3*9 mod7.

Compute numerator: 1 -12 -27=1-39=-38.

-38 mod7: 7*5=35, so 35 from -38 is -38 +35= -3. So, -3 mod7 is 4.

Wait, wait: wait, -38 divided by7: 7*(-6)= -42, so -38 - (-42)=4. So -38≡4 mod7.

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute:

Compute 38 divided by7. 7*5=35, 38-35=3 → 38≡3 mod7. So, -38≡-3 mod7, which is 4 mod7 (since -3 +7=4).

So, d≡4 mod7 again. So in both cases, c=2 and c=9, d≡4 mod7.

So, possible d=4 or 11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Wait, but wait. When c=9, d=4 or 11? But d is a digit, so d=4.

Wait, but let me check the calculation for c=9:

d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

b=6, c=9.

So, 1 - 12 -27 = 1 - 39 = -38.

-38 mod7: Let's compute 38/7=5*7=35, remainder 3. So 38≡3 mod7, so -38≡-3 mod7, which is 4 mod7.

So, d must be 4 mod7. So d can be 4 or 11, but since d is a digit (0-9), d=4.

Wait, but if d=4, then in the case c=9, d=4.

So in both cases, c=2 and c=9, d=4.

Wait, but let's verify if that works.

So, for c=2, d=4.

So N would be a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4 → 5624.

For c=9, d=4: a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 → 5694.

Now, let's check both N=5624 and N=5694.

Wait, but wait, we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so between 5624 and 5694, 5694 is larger, so maybe N=5694 is the answer, but let's verify.

Wait, but let me check if both satisfy the conditions.

First, check N=5624.

When we change each digit to 1, we get:

1624: Check divisibility by7.

1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. Exactly, so 1624 is divisible by7.

Changing b to1: 5124. 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Yes, divisible.

Changing c to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Yes.

Changing d to1: 5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621. Yes.

So N=5624 works.

Now, check N=5694.

Changing a to1: 1694. 1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Yes.

Changing b to1: 5194. 5194 ÷7: Let's compute 7*742=5194. Yes.

Changing c to1: 5614. Same as before, 5614 ÷7=802, yes.

Changing d to1: 5691. 5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes.

So N=5694 also works.

Now, since 5694 is greater than 5624, and we're looking for the greatest such N, N=5694 is the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if there are higher N beyond 5694 that also satisfy the condition.

Wait, because 5694 is a candidate, but maybe there's a higher number. Let's think.

Since a=5, and N is a four-digit number, the maximum possible a is9, but in our solution a=5. But is there a higher a that also satisfies the conditions?

Wait, but in our system of equations, we found a must be≡5 mod7. Since a is a digit (1-9), a can only be 5 or 12 (but 12 is invalid). So a=5 is the only possibility.

So, a=5 is fixed. So N must be of the form 5bcd.

So the maximum possible N is 5999. But wait, maybe N=5994? Let's see.

Wait, but according to our earlier steps, when a=5, we can have c=2 or c=9, but in both cases, d=4.

Wait, but perhaps there's another solution where c is 9 and d=4. So N=5694. Is that the maximum possible? Or can we have higher b?

Wait, in our solution, b=6. Can b be higher than6? Let me think.

Wait, in our equations, when a=5, from Equation (2a): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7 → 6*5=30≡2 mod7. So 2 -2b ≡4 mod7 → -2b ≡2 mod7 → 2b≡-2≡5 mod7. So 2b≡5 mod7. The solution was b=6 because 2*6=12≡5 mod7. Is there a higher b that satisfies this?

Since b is a digit (0-9), let's check if b=6+7=13 is possible, but b can't be 13. So only b=6 is possible.

So, b=6 is fixed.

Now, c can be 2 or 9, as we found earlier. So, for a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4: N=5624.

For a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Which is the higher number: 5694.

Wait, but could c be higher than9? No, since it's a digit. So c=9 is the maximum.

So N=5694 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N where maybe a=5, but with higher digits beyond 5694.

Wait, N=5694 is 5694, which is less than 5994, but let's see if 5994 satisfies the conditions.

Wait, let me check N=5994.

Wait, a=5, b=9, c=9, d=4.

But according to our earlier equations, when a=5, b must be6, so N=5994 would have b=9, which doesn't fit our earlier solution where b=6.

So, let me check if N=5994 would satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but maybe there's another solution where a=5, b=9, but that would require re-solving the equations. Let me see.

Wait, no, because in our system of equations, when a=5, b is fixed to 6. So any other b would not satisfy the equations.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let's make sure there's no higher N with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694.

Wait, is there a higher number than 5694 with a=5, b=6? Like 5794, 5894, 5994.

Wait, but according to our earlier solution, for a=5, b=6, c can be 2 or9, and d=4.

So for c=9, N=5694.

If I try to make c higher than9, which isn't possible, so 5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but wait, let me think
