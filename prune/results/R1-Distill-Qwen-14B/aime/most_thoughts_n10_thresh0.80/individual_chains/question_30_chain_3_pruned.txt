Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That's good to know because it might help simplify expressions later on.

The problem involves a product over all 13th roots of unity, except when k=0 because ω^0 = 1. Wait, no, actually, k goes from 0 to 12, so it includes ω^0, which is 1. But the problem says ω ≠ 1, so perhaps k=0 is allowed? Let me double-check: the product is from k=0 to 12, so that's 13 terms. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I think the key here is to recognize that we're dealing with a product over all 13th roots of unity. Maybe I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something related to roots of unity. Let me recall that the minimal polynomial for a primitive root of unity is the cyclotomic polynomial, which for n=13 is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that directly applies here yet.

Wait, another approach: sometimes products over roots of unity can be evaluated by considering polynomials whose roots are these ω^k. So if I can find a polynomial whose roots are 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, then the product I'm looking for is the product of (x - root) evaluated at x=1 or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the product as a value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a specific point.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the expression inside the product. Let me write the term as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or write it in a more manageable form.

Hmm, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me think of this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, 2 - 2z + z². Let me rearrange it: z² - 2z + 2. Wait, that factors? Let me see, discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (z^2
