Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center. So, the torus is kind of a donut with a hole in the middle.

The sphere S has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly, when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is to figure out the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Let me recall some properties of tori and tangent spheres.

A torus can be defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, the generating circle has a radius of 3, so r = 3. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, which is 6. So R = 6.

So, the torus is T(r=3, R=6). Now, the sphere S has radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency must be at the outermost part of the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the tangency point is at the inner part of the torus.

So, for internal tangency, the sphere and torus touch at a single point on the torus's outer equator. Wait, no, probably along a circle. So, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle, meaning every point on that circle is a point of tangency.

I think I need to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus, and then relate that to the radii of the tangent circles.

Let me consider the centers. The torus is a surface of revolution, so its center (the center of the generating circle) is at some point relative to the sphere's center. Let me denote the center of the sphere S as point O, and the center of the generating circle of the torus as point C.

When T is inside S, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is resting inside. The distance between O and C must be such that the sphere and torus are tangent. Similarly, when T is outside S, the distance between O and C is different.

Wait, but the torus is a surface with a specific geometry. Let's model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus in 3D is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius, r is the minor radius.

In this case, R = 6, r = 3.

So, the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121

We need to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. For internal tangency, the torus lies inside the sphere, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, for external tangency, the torus lies outside the sphere, and they touch along a circle.

To find the points of tangency, the gradients (normals) of both surfaces at the tangent point must be the same. Alternatively, since both are surfaces of revolution, we can analyze the cross-section in the plane of the circle.

Let me think in 2D first, then extend to 3D. Imagine a cross-section through the axis of the torus. In this plane, the torus would look like two circles: the generating circle of radius 3, and the path of its center, a circle of radius 6.

Wait, no, in cross-section, the torus would look like a circle of radius 3, centered at a distance 6 from
