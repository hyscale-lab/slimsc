Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is given as m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of one event happening given that another event has already happened. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize, then since winning the grand prize automatically means she has won a prize, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, to find this, I need to compute two things: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize (which I'll call P(A)), and the probability that she wins any prize (P(B)). Then, I can divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me break it down.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). I can compute that as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible outcomes when the lottery numbers are drawn is 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. For her to win the grand prize, all four of her numbers must match the four chosen. Since Jen has picked a specific set of four numbers, there's only one possible way this can happen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability of winning at least two numbers. Winning a prize means she has at least two numbers in the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways she can have exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching the chosen ones.

Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the probability of not winning any prize (i.e., having 0 or 1 correct numbers) and subtract that from 1 to get P(B). Let me think about which approach is better.

I think computing P(B) directly might be manageable. So, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers.

Let me denote the set of numbers Jen picked as T = {a, b, c, d}. The lottery draws 4 numbers, say, randomly selected from S.

The number of ways the lottery can choose exactly k numbers from T is C(4, k), and then the remaining (4 - k) numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and 4 are in T). So, for each k (2,3,4), the number of favorable combinations is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

So, let's compute that:

For k=2:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, there are 115 favorable outcomes where she wins a prize.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when k=2, it's choosing 2 correct and 2 incorrect. For k=3, 3 correct and 1 incorrect. For k=4, all correct. So, adding those up gives all the ways she can have at least two correct. So, 115 is indeed the number of favorable outcomes for B.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, that can be simplified. Let's see: 115 divides by 5, 23. 210 divides by 5, 42. So, 115/210 = 23/42.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, we found P(A) = 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = simplify 42/210: 42 divides by 42 is 1, 210/42 is 5. So, 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, no, wait: 42/210 is 1/5, so the entire expression is (1 * 42)/(210 *23) = (42)/(210*23) = 42/(4830). Simplify 42/4830.

Divide numerator and denominator by 42: 1/115. Yes, same result.

Hmm, so the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1.

So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in calculating the number of favorable outcomes.

Wait, the number of ways where she has exactly 2 correct is C(4,2)*C(6,2). That's 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3 correct: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *6=24.

Exactly 4 correct: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1.

So total of 90 +24 +1=115, yes.

Total possible combinations: C(10,4)=210.

So, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

P(A)=1/210.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(23/42)= (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23)= (1)/(5*23)=1/115.

So, m=1, n=115, m + n=116. That seems right.

But wait, hold on, another way to compute P(B) is to subtract the probability of losing from 1.

Probability of losing is when she has 0 or 1 correct numbers.

So, let's compute that way to verify.

Number of ways to have 0 correct numbers: C(4,0)*C(6,4)=1*15=15.

Number of ways to have 1 correct number: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

Total number of losing combinations: 15 +80=95.

Thus, P(losing) =95/210.

Therefore, P(B)= 1 - 95/210= (210 -95)/210=115/210=23/42. Same as before. So that confirms P(B)=23/42. So, the earlier calculation holds.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115. So, m + n is 116.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we calculate \( P(A|B) \), with \( A \) being the event of winning the grand prize and \( B \) being the event of winning any prize.

1. **Total number of possible outcomes**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (P(A))**: There is only one favorable outcome where all four chosen numbers match Jen's numbers. Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

3. **Probability of winning a prize (P(B))**: This is the probability of having at least two correct numbers. We calculate this by considering the number of favorable outcomes for having exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers:
   - Exactly 2 correct: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
   - Exactly 3 correct: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
   - Exactly 4 correct: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
   
   Adding these, we get \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \) favorable outcomes. Thus, \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

4. **Conditional probability \( P(A|B) \)**: Using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \), we substitute the values:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), which are coprime.

5. **Final result**: \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{116}\).
