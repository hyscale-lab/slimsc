Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, say, x, y, z. The surface area is given as 54, and the volume is 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius would be half of the box's space diagonal, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius would be half of that.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Hence, the radius r is (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, my goal is to find the minimum value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, since the sphere must contain any box in B, I think I need to find the maximum value of (x² + y² + z²)/4 over all boxes in B, because the smallest sphere that can contain each box must be able to contain the largest possible box in terms of space diagonal. Because if one box has a larger space diagonal, the sphere needs to be larger to contain it. So, actually, r squared would be the maximum of (x² + y² + z²)/4 over all boxes in B. So I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Hmm, that makes sense. So, the sphere's radius squared would be the maximum of (x² + y² + z²)/4, so I need to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to the surface area being 54 and volume being 23.

Let me write down the constraints:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54.

Volume: xyz = 23.

I need to maximize x² + y² + z².

So, we can approach this using Lagrange multipliers, perhaps. Since we have two constraints, I might need to use a method with multiple constraints, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe express two variables in terms of the third and then substitute.

Alternatively, perhaps using inequalities to bound x² + y² + z².

Wait, let's think about the problem. We have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27.

2. xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I remember that for positive real numbers, x² + y² + z² is related to the square of the sum minus twice the sum of products, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz). Since xy + yz + xz is 27, then x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. So if I can find the maximum of (x + y + z)^2, then I can find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

But wait, actually, if I want to maximize x² + y² + z², then I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, because subtracting 54 would mean that a larger (x + y + z)^2 leads to a larger x² + y² + z².

So, perhaps I should look into maximizing x + y + z given the constraints.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. So, the function to maximize is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, to use Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f, g, and h must be linearly dependent. So, the gradient of f is (2x, 2y, 2z). The gradient of g is (2y + 2z, 2x + 2z, 2x + 2y). The gradient of h is (yz, xz, xy).

So, for the gradients to be linearly dependent, there must exist scalars λ and μ such that:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

So,

2x = λ(2y + 2z) + μ(yz),
2y = λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz),
2z = λ(2x + 2y) + μ(xy).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or assume that two variables are equal.

Wait, sometimes in optimization problems with symmetric constraints, the maximum or minimum occurs when two variables are equal. Let's assume that x = y.

So, let x = y, then we can write the equations in terms of x, z.

So, let x = y. Then, the surface area equation becomes 2(x^2 + 2xz) = 54 ⇒ x^2 + 2xz = 27.

The volume equation is x^2 z = 23.

So, from the volume equation, z = 23/(x²).

Plugging into the surface area equation: x^2 + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27.

Simplify: x² + (46)/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x.

Bring all terms to one side: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, need to solve this cubic equation. Let me try rational roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 - 27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x - 2) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2):

Coefficients: 1 0 -27 46

Bring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2.

Add to next term: 0 +2=2. Multiply by 2:4.

Add to next term: -27 +4= -23. Multiply by 2: -46.

Add to last term: 46 + (-46)=0.

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23).

Set each factor to zero:

x=2,

and x² +2x -23=0 ⇒ x = [-2 ±sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 ±sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ±2sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈ 3.898.

Wait, but we are assuming x=y, so if x=2, then y=2, and z=23/(2^2)=23/4=5.75.

Alternatively, if x=-1 +2√6, then y=x=-1 +2√6, and z=23/(x^2). Let's compute that.

But let's see, since x=2 is a positive real root, and the other roots are x=-1 +2√6≈3.898 and x=-1 -2√6≈-5.898. So, we can ignore the negative root, so the possible x values are 2 and -1 +2√6.

So, first, let's consider x=
