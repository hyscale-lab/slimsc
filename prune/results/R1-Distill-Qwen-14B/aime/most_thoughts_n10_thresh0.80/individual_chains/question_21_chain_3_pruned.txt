Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement: A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and these two digits sum to the square root of n. Oh, right, and the example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, first, I need to figure out how to represent a two-digit number in base b. Any two-digit number in base b can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The problem says that the sum of these two digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, we have:

a + c = sqrt(n)
But since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = a * b + c.

So substituting n into the equation, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

If I square both sides, that gives:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a * b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a relation between a, b, and c. Let's see:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

I can group terms:

a² - a b + (2ac - c) + c² = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor differently. Let's factor terms with a:

a(a - b) + c(2a - 1) + c² = 0

Not sure. Alternatively, let's express it in terms of b:

From the equation (a + c)^2 = a b + c, we can solve for b:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

So,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Simplifying:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b must be an integer (base), (c² - c) must be divisible by a. So, (c² - c) mod a should be zero.

Alternatively, (c(c - 1)) must be divisible by a.

Hmm, another way: Since both a and c are digits in base b, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but b is a base greater than or equal to 2, and a is at least 1, c is at least 0.

Wait, but since (a + c)^2 = a b + c, and a and c are digits, let's think about possible ranges.

What's the maximum possible value of n? n is a two-digit number in base b, so n can be as big as (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1. So n is up to b² -1, and sqrt(n) is up to b - 1/sqrt(b), approximately b.

But since sqrt(n) is an integer? Wait, no! Wait, the problem says the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n). So sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, so their sum a + c is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

So, n is a perfect square, and it's a two-digit number in base b.

So, n = k², where k is a positive integer, and n is a two-digit number in base b. So in base b, n is written as a* b + c, where a and c are digits (0 <= c < b, 1 <= a < b).

And k = a + c.

So, putting it all together:

k² = a*b + c

and k = a + c.

So, substituting k into the first equation:

(a + c)² = a*b + c.

So, same as before.

So, for each base b, I need to find all pairs (a,c) such that:

1. 1 <= a < b
2. 0 <= c < b
3. (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

And the number of such n (which is the same as the number of (a,c) pairs) should be more than ten.

My goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such pairs is more than ten.

So, perhaps for each base b starting from 2, I can compute the number of such (a,c) pairs and check if it exceeds 10. The first b where this happens is the answer.

But computing this for each b seems tedious, especially since b could be large. Maybe I can find a formula or pattern.

Let me try to rearrange the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Bring all terms to left:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, can I write this as:

a² - a b + 2ac + c² - c = 0

Factor terms with a:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe express b in terms of a, c.

From equation:

a b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c]
