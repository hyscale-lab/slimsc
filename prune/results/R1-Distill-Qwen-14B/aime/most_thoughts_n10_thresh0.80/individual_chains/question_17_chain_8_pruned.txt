Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then I have to find p + q.

First, let's break down the problem. I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere's diameter has to span the box entirely. So, the radius r would be half of that space diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2 = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. So, r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing (l² + w² + h²) given the constraints of surface area and volume. Once I find the minimum value of (l² + w² + h²), I can divide by 4 to get r².

Given:
1. Surface area S = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. Volume V = lwh = 23

I need to minimize l² + w² + h² under these constraints.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, which is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints. So, I need to set up the function to minimize, which is f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h², with constraints g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0 and h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

Wait, hold on, I think I need to use multiple constraints here. But maybe there's a smarter way. Perhaps by using inequalities or some substitution.

Let me think. I remember that for a given volume, the surface area is minimized when the box is a cube, but in this case, the surface area is fixed, and the volume is given. So, maybe the box that minimizes the space diagonal (and thus the sphere radius) has some symmetric properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third using the constraints and then find the minimum.

Let me try to express variables in terms of each other.

Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h.

So, we have:

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 => xy + xz + yz = 27. (Equation 1)

xyz = 23. (Equation 2)

I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Hmm. Is there a relationship between x² + y² + z² and the symmetric sums?

Yes, I recall that:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx)

So, from Equation 1, we have xy + yz + zx = 27.

Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize (x + y + z)^2 because 54 is a constant. Therefore, minimizing x + y + z will lead to minimizing x² + y² + z².

So, now, the problem is to find the minimum of (x + y + z) given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

I think using the method of Lagrange multipliers is the way to go here.

Let me set up the Lagrangian function.

Let’s define f(x, y, z) = x + y + z

Subject to constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Wait, but since I have two constraints, I need to use two multipliers. Alternatively, maybe express one variable in terms of others and substitute.

Alternatively, perhaps assume that the minimal occurs when all variables are equal, but given that the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, that might not be the case. Let me check.

If x = y = z, then the volume would be x³ = 23, so x = cube root of 23 ≈ 2.84. Then, surface area would be 6x² = 6*(23)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

23^(1/3) ≈ 2.84, so 23^(2/3) ≈ (2.84)^2 ≈ 8.07, so 6*8.07 ≈ 48.43. But the given surface area is 54, which is larger. So, in this case, the surface area is larger than that of a cube with volume 23. Therefore, the minimal x + y + z might not be when x = y = z, because in that case, the surface area is smaller than 54.

Wait, perhaps the minimal x + y + z occurs when two variables are equal? That is, maybe it's symmetric in two variables.

Let me assume that x = y. Then, with x = y, the surface area equation becomes:

xy + xz + yz = x² + 2xz = 27.

And the volume becomes x² z = 23 => z = 23/(x²).

Substituting z into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46/x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

So, x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, need to solve this cubic equation.

Let me try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0
x=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, x=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor the cubic as (x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are from x² + 2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive (length), we have x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, when x=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, when x=y=2, z=5.75.

Thus, x + y + z = 2 + 2 + 5.75=9.75.

Wait, let's compute x + y + z in this case. 2 + 2 + 5.75 = 9.75 which is 39/4.

Alternatively, when x = -1 + 2√6 ≈3
