Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some basics. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say x), width (y), and height (z). The surface area S of such a box is given by the formula:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx)

And the volume V is:

V = xyz

In this problem, S is 54 and V is 23. So,

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27

and

xyz = 23

Now, the sphere that can contain the rectangular box must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

So, the radius r of the sphere will be half of this, which is:

r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4

So, our goal is to find the minimal possible value of x² + y² + z², given the constraints on the surface area and volume, and then divide by 4 to get r². Then, express that as a reduced fraction and sum numerator and denominator.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that in such cases, the method of Lagrange multipliers is useful. Alternatively, maybe we can use inequalities like AM ≥ GM or Cauchy-Schwarz to find the minimal value.

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers might be more straightforward here, even though it's a bit involved. Let's try that approach.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z²

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx - 27 = 0
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Since we have two constraints, the method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that there exist multipliers λ and μ such that the gradient of f is equal to λ times gradient of g plus μ times gradient of h.

So, compute the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)
∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)
∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  -- (1)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)   -- (2)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)   -- (3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27        -- (4)
xyz = 23                 -- (5)

Hmm, this gives us a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This might get complicated. Let me see if I can find some symmetry or substitution to simplify.

Assume, for a moment, that x = y = z. Is this possible?

If x = y = z, then the surface area equation becomes:

3x² = 27 => x² = 9 => x = 3

Then the volume would be x³ = 27, but in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube with side 3 has volume 27, but our volume is 23, which is smaller. So, the box isn't a cube, but maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal? Let's try that.

Let me suppose that x = y ≠ z. Then, let's substitute:

From the surface area equation:

xy + yz + zx = x² + 2xz = 27

From the volume equation:

x² z = 23 => z = 23/(x²)

Substitute z into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46/x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, let's see if this cubic equation has integer roots. Let's try x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46, +46=0. So x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2):

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46 (constant)

Using synthetic division with root 2:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 0 + 2 = 2.

Multiply 2 by 2:4. Add to next coefficient: -27 +4 = -23.

Multiply -23 by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, no remainder.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23)=0

So, other roots are solutions to x² + 2x -23 = 0:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈ 3.898

So, when x=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75

So, in this case, x=y=2, z=5.75. Let's compute x² + y² + z².

x² + y² + z² = 2² + 2² + (5.75)^2 = 4 +4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625, which is 41.0625.

Alternatively, in fraction terms: 2² =4, 5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2 = 529/16.

So total sum: 4 +4 +529/16 = 8 +529/16 = (128 +529)/16 = 657/16.

So, x² + y² + z²=657/16, so r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, but wait: if x=2, y=2, z=23/4, then x, y, z are all positive, and satisfy the constraints. So that is one possible case.

But is this the minimal value? Or is there a case where even a smaller x² + y² + z² exists?

Hmm, perhaps. Maybe when all three variables are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is a cube, but in our case, the volume is less than that of the cube with surface area 54, so the cube isn't in the set. So the minimal is achieved when two variables are equal?

Wait, but in the case above, when x=y=2, z=23/4, the sum is 657/16. Let me compute that: 657 divided by 16 is 41.0625.

But maybe if I take x, y, z all different, I can get a smaller sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are equal, but as we saw, that's not possible here because the volume is different.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another approach. Let me think.

Let me express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

We know that:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx)

So,

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z).

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x + y + z, given that xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

Hmm, so perhaps we can find the minimal value of x + y + z given these constraints.

I recall that for positive real numbers, the AM ≥ GM inequality applies. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming two variables are equal.

So, going back to the Lagrangian equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  -- (1)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)   -- (2)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)   -- (3)
xy + yz + zx =27         -- (4)
xyz=23                   -- (5)

Let me try to subtract equation (1) and (2):

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ(z)(y - x)
