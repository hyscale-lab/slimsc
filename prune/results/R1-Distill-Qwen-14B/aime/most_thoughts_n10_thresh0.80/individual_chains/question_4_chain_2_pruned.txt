Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out for how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about how such games work. It's a classic combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I need to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the first player (Alice). If it's a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win, regardless of her moves.

Let me start by examining small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that last token and win. Wait, so Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 tokens, but she can't because there are only 2. So Alice's options are only to take 1, which allows Bob to win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So n=2 is a Bob win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, we know it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So Bob can't win, meaning Alice can force a win by taking 1. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but she can't. So for n=3, Alice can win. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position for Alice.

n=5: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob. Bob can then take 4 and win. Wait, that's bad for Alice. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. Therefore, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=5 is a Bob win.

n=6: Let's see. Alice can take 1 or 4 tokens.

If Alice takes 1, leaving 5. From n=5, that's a losing position for Bob, meaning Alice can force Bob into a losing position. So if Alice takes 1, Bob is in a losing position, so Alice can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 2, which is a losing position for Bob (since n=2 is a winning position for Bob when he is the first player, but in this case, Bob would be the second player, so for Alice to leave n=2, which is a losing position for the next player (Bob), that would mean Bob is in a losing position. So either way, Alice can choose to take 1 or 4, leaving Bob in a losing position. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so if Alice leaves Bob with n=5, that would be a losing position for Bob. So yes, if Alice takes 1 from n=6, she leaves Bob with n=5, which is a losing position for Bob, meaning Alice can win. So n=6 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, but n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so if Bob is faced with n=5, he can't win. So if Alice can leave Bob with n=5, she can win. So yes, n=6 is a winning position.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6 for Bob. From n=6, Bob is in a winning position, so Bob can take 1 or 4 tokens. If Bob takes 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. Wait, so if Alice takes 1, Bob can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. So Alice loses. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 3. From n=3, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can take 1, leaving 2 for Alice, which is a losing position for Alice. So either way, if Alice takes 1 or 4, Bob can win. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, so n=7 is a Bob win.

n=8: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 7, which is a losing position for Bob. Because when Bob is faced with n=7, he can't win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob is in a losing position, so Alice can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob (he can take all 4 and win). So Alice wouldn't choose that option. But since she can choose to take 1, she can force Bob into a losing position. So n=8 is a winning position for Alice.

n=9: Alice's options are take 1 or 4.

If she takes 1, leaving 8, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win. Alternatively, if she takes 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So if Alice takes 4, Bob is left with n=5, which is a losing position, so Alice can win. Therefore, n=9 is a winning position for Alice.

n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9. Bob is in a winning position. Or she can take 4, leaving 6. Bob is in a winning position. Wait, so both options leave Bob in a winning position. So n=10 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, let's check that again. If Alice takes 1, leaving n=9, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win from there. If Alice takes 4, leaving n=6, which is a winning position for Bob. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. Therefore, n=10 is a losing position for Alice, Bob can win.

Hmm, so the losing positions so far are n=2,5,7,10.

Let me list them:

n | outcome (A for Alice, B for Bob)
1 | A
2 | B
3 | A
4 | A
5 | B
6 | A
7 | B
8 | A
9 | A
10| B

Looking for a pattern here. Let's see the losing positions: 2,5,7,10.

Wait, let's see the differences between these:

5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3.

Not a clear pattern. Alternatively, let's see modulo something.

2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod 3 is 2, 7 mod 3 is 1, 10 mod 3 is 1.

Hmm, 2,2,1,1. Not consistent.

Alternatively, let's see if the losing positions follow a certain recurrence.

In such games, losing positions often satisfy a certain recurrence relation. For example, in Nim games, positions are losing if they are multiples of a certain number.

But in this case, since the allowed moves are 1 and 4, the recurrence could be more complex.

Let me think of the losing positions as positions where all moves lead to a winning position for the opponent.

So a position n is losing if for all possible moves m (1 or 4), n - m is a winning position.

Similarly, a position is winning if there exists at least one move m such that n - m is a losing position.

So, using this, I can model the positions as winning (True) or losing (False).

Let's create a table up to, say, n=15, to see if we can find a pattern.

We already have up to n=10.

n=1: A
n=2: B
n=3: A
n=4: A
n=5: B
n=6: A
n=7: B
n=8: A
n=9: A
n=10: B
n=11: Let's see.

n=11: Alice can take 1, leaving 10 (B), so Bob is in a losing position. So Alice can win by taking 1. So n=11 is a winning position for Alice.

n=12: Alice can take 1, leaving 11 (A), or 4, leaving 8 (A). So Bob is in a winning position regardless. Therefore, n=12 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Wait, no
