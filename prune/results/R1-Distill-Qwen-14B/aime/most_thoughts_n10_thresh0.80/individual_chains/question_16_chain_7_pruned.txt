Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \)."

Alright, so the problem is asking for the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, for that prime \( p \), find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Then find the minimal \( m \) for that \( p \).

I remember that primes where \( -1 \) is a fourth power residue modulo \( p \) must satisfy certain conditions. Maybe I should look into some number theory concepts here.

First, let's think about primes \( p \) for which the equation \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution. Because if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \), then it certainly must hold modulo \( p \) as well.

So, for the congruence \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) to have a solution, \( -1 \) must be a fourth power residue modulo \( p \).

I recall that the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \). So, for \( -1 \) to be a fourth power, the order of \( -1 \) must divide \( (p-1)/\gcd(4, p-1) \).

Wait, the order of \( -1 \) is 2 in the multiplicative group. So, for \( -1 \) to be a fourth power, the equation \( x^4 = -1 \) must have a solution. That means that the order of \( x \) would be 8, so 8 must divide \( p-1 \). Because the multiplicative group's order is \( p-1 \), so for an element of order 8 to exist, 8 must divide \( p-1 \).

So, primes \( p \) where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) are candidates. Because if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), then 8 divides \( p-1 \), so the multiplicative group has an element of order 8, which implies that \( x^4 = -1 \) has a solution.

Wait, but is that the only condition? Let me think again. Because the multiplicative group is cyclic, so it's isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \). So, if 8 divides \( p-1 \), then the group has an element of order 8, so there exists an \( x \) such that \( x^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). Then, \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), because \( x^8 = (x^4)^2 \equiv 1 \mod p \), so \( x^4 \) is a square root of 1, which is either 1 or -1. Since \( x \) has order 8, \( x^4 \) cannot be 1, so it must be -1.

Therefore, primes \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) have solutions to \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \).

So, the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, 193, etc. Wait, is 17 the smallest? Let me check: primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. So yes, 17 is the first prime where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

But wait, does that mean that 17 is the least prime \( p \) for which \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 +1 \)?

Not necessarily, because even if \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), it's possible that \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) but \( x^4 \not\equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). So, we need to check whether such \( p \) actually has a solution where \( x^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

Alternatively, perhaps for some primes where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), but not necessarily mod 8, maybe they can satisfy the condition. Wait, let's see.

Wait, primes where \( -1 \) is a quadratic residue are primes where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). So, for \( -1 \) to be a fourth power residue, it's a stronger condition than being a quadratic residue. So, primes \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) satisfy \( p \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), but the converse isn't true.

But I think I need to make sure whether 17 is the least prime such that \( p^2 \) divides some \( n^4 + 1 \).

Alternatively, maybe smaller primes like 2, 5, 13 can also satisfy this condition.

Wait, let's check for
