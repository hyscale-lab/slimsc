Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So, it's a 12-sided polygon, and it's regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal. The problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, so I need to count all possible rectangles that can be formed this way.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, it's definitely even, so that gives me some hope.

I think the key here is to realize that a rectangle is defined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be parallel under certain conditions. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to others via diagonals of different lengths. The number of different lengths of diagonals depends on how many steps apart the vertices are around the polygon.

Wait, so in a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to others by sides (which are equivalent to 1 step apart) and diagonals. The diagonals can be 2, 3, 4, etc., steps apart. But for a polygon, the maximum number of steps for a diagonal is half the number of sides minus one. So, for 12 sides, the maximum steps for a diagonal would be 5. Because 12/2 =6, and we subtract one because the other side is just the adjacent vertex.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But in terms of lengths, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is floor(n/2)-1. For n=12, that would be 5, because 12/2=6, and 6-1=5. So, the diagonals can be 1 step (which is the side), 2, 3, 4, 5 steps apart?

Wait, no. For n=12, the diagonals are of lengths corresponding to k=2,3,4,5,6 steps apart. Wait, but when k=6, that would be the diameter, connecting opposite vertices. So, for a 12-gon, the diagonals can be of lengths 2,3,4,5,6 steps apart. Hmm, but 6 steps would actually be the diameter, which is a straight line.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of vectors or slopes. Each side or diagonal can be represented by a vector from one vertex to another. Two sides or diagonals are parallel if they have the same slope, which would occur when the step between the vertices is the same modulo n. Hmm, but since n=12 is even, we have to be careful with the diameters.

So, in order to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair must be parallel
