Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the torus T is made by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. We need to consider two cases: when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere and when it rests on the outside. In each case, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. We need to find the radii of these circles, r_i for internal tangency and r_o for external tangency, and then compute the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Finally, we have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I should probably start by understanding what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

First, let's recall the standard equation for a torus. If we have a torus with major radius R (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and minor radius r (radius of the generating circle), then in cylindrical coordinates (where we can describe points using radius ρ, angle θ, and z-coordinate), the equation is:

(ρ - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.

But since we're dealing with tangency with a sphere, maybe it's better to think in terms of 3D coordinates. The sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle, meaning that at every point along that circle, both the torus and the sphere share a common tangent plane. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the same applies.

Let me think about the geometry here. The torus is a surface of revolution, so its centers lie along a circle of radius R (which is 6 in this case). The sphere is centered at the origin, I suppose, since the problem doesn't specify otherwise.

Wait, but the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 units from the axis. So, the major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3.

So, the torus can be thought of as all points at a distance of 3 units from a circle of radius 6. So, the torus has an outer radius of R + r = 9 and an inner radius of R - r = 3.

Wait, but the sphere has radius 11, which is bigger than the outer radius of the torus. So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it can fit entirely inside, but when placed outside, the sphere is smaller than the torus, so maybe only part of the torus is outside the sphere?

Wait, no. If the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, that means the sphere is outside the torus, touching it at a single circle. Similarly, when inside, the torus is inside the sphere and touching it along a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a cross-sectional view. Imagine looking at the torus and sphere along the axis of the torus. The cross-section of the torus would be a circle of radius 3, centered at a distance of 6 from the origin. The cross-section of the sphere would be a circle of radius 11.

So, in the cross-section, when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0) in 2D, and the sphere is centered at (0,0) with radius 11. The torus's cross-section is a circle of radius 3, so it extends from 6 - 3 = 3 to 6 + 3 = 9 on the x-axis.

Wait, but the sphere has radius 11, so it extends from -11 to +11 on the x-axis. So, in this cross-section, when the torus is inside, the circle (torus's cross-section) is entirely within the sphere's cross-section. But how does the tangency happen?

Wait, perhaps the cross-section of the torus (a circle of radius 3
