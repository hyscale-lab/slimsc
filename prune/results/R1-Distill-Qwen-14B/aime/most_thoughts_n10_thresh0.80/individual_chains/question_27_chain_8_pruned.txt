Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus is generated by rotating this circle around an axis that's 6 units away from its center.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. And when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some geometry here. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. Now, when this torus is inside the sphere of radius 11, it's tangent internally. That means the sphere and torus touch along a circle, and at that point, the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus is 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus is 11, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, I think I need to model this mathematically. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me imagine the sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is generated by rotating a circle around the z-axis. The generating circle has radius 3, and its center is at (6, 0, 0), right? Because the distance from the center to the axis is 6.

So, the equation of the torus can be described in cylindrical coordinates. In cylindrical coordinates (r, Î¸, z), the equation of a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is (r - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. So plugging in our values, R is 6 and r is 3, so the equation becomes (r - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Now, the sphere has radius 11, so its equation in Cartesian coordinates is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121. Since we're dealing with circles of tangency, these circles lie on a plane where the torus and sphere are tangent.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle. So, the distance from the origin to any point on that circle must be 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance from the origin to the point of tangency is also 11, but the direction is different.

Let me think in terms of the centers. The sphere is at the origin, the torus's center is at (6,0,0) in the generating circle. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle. Similarly, the farthest point would be in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, actually, for internal tangent, the torus is inside the sphere, so the point of tangency is such that the torus just touches the sphere from the inside. So, the distance from the sphere's center (origin) to the torus's center (6,0,0) plus the minor radius (3) must equal the sphere's radius (11). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere. The center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). The closest point on the torus to the origin would be 6 - 3 = 3 units away. But the sphere has radius 11, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere since 3 < 11. But when the torus is placed inside, the point of tangency is a circle where the sphere and torus just touch each other. So, maybe I need to find the radius of that circle of tangency.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the distance from the origin to a generic point on the torus and set that equal to 11, then find the locus of such
