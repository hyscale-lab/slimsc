Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, and each internal angle is less than 180 degrees. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon might have some symmetry, perhaps similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but here it's just equilateral and with opposite sides parallel. So maybe it's a type of affine-regular hexagon? Or maybe it's a translation of a regular hexagon?

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. So if I imagine extending these sides, they meet at points forming a triangle. Let me visualize the hexagon: ABCDEF, convex, equilateral, opposite sides parallel.

Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, no, maybe AB is parallel to ED? Hmm, maybe I should clarify the structure.

Wait, in a convex hexagon, if AB is parallel to DE, BC to EF, and CD to FA, that could make sense. So when sides AB, CD, and EF are extended, they form a triangle. Let me perhaps draw this to understand better, although I can't actually draw, but I can imagine.

So, extending AB, CD, and EF beyond the hexagon, these three lines intersect to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's side length.

I think this is a problem involving similar triangles or perhaps the properties of a triangle formed by extending sides of a hexagon. Maybe using the concept of similar triangles because of the parallel sides.

In an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will form a larger triangle, and the hexagon itself is kind of a "truncated" version of this triangle.

Wait, maybe I
