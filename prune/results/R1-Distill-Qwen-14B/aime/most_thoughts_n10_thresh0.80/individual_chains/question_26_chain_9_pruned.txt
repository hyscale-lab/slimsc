Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize the problem. There's triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, first, maybe I should check if it's a valid triangle. The sum of AB + BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC = 10. Similarly, the other combinations also satisfy the triangle inequality, so it's a valid triangle.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents. Then, the line from A through D intersects ω again at P. So, we can think of AD as a secant that starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC. That might be useful later.

I think I should draw a diagram to help me. Since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it. Point D is outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangent to ω. So, D lies on the external tangent from B and C. Then, AD is a line from A through D, which meets the circle again at P.

I need to find AP. Since AP is a segment from A to P on the circle, and we know some lengths in triangle ABC, maybe I can use some theorems related to circles, tangents, or power of a point.

Wait, the Power of a Point theorem might be helpful here. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² and DC² since DB and DC are tangents. Also, since AD is a secant, the power of D is equal to DA * DP.

So, power of point D: DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Let me express this as DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, and I can find DB, then I can solve for DP, and then AP = AD - DP or something like that. Wait, actually, AP is the segment from A to P, and AD is from A to D. Since P is on the circle and D is outside, AP would be equal to AD minus DP? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. Point A is on the circle, right? Because ABC is inscribed in ω, so A is on ω. Then, line AD starts at A, goes through D, and intersects ω again at P. So, the points are A, then P, then D. So, AP is the segment from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AP is shorter than AD. So, AP = AD - PD? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think about the order of points. Starting from A, the line goes through P (which is on the circle) and then continues to D (which is outside the circle). So, the points are in the order A, P, D. Therefore, AP is part of AD, and PD is the extension beyond P. So, AD = AP + PD. So, if I have AD and PD, I can get AP as AD - PD. Or using the power of point D, which is DB² = DA * DP.

But I don't know DA or DP yet. So, maybe I can express DA in terms of AP and DP? Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Menelaus' theorem or something similar. Or maybe use coordinates?

Wait, maybe I can find the coordinates of each point. Let me consider using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make the problem easier.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B somewhere in the plane, and point A somewhere else. Since AC is 10 units, let me place point A at (10,0). Then, point C is at (0,0), point A is at (10,0), and point B is somewhere in the plane such that AB = 5 and
