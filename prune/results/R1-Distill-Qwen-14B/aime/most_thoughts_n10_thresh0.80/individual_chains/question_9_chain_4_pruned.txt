Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's write down the given equations. 

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but I think I can simplify this. The logarithm log_b(a) is equal to the exponent you need to raise b to get a. So, log_x(y^x) = 10 means that x raised to the 10th power equals y^x. Wait, let me write that out to be clear.

So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, then by definition of logarithms, x^10 = y^x. That's equation one: x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, this would mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. So, equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to solve these equations for x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product xy.

Hmm, these equations involve exponents with variables in both the base and the exponent, which might be a bit complicated. Maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to simplify them. Let me try that.

Starting with equation one: x^10 = y^x.

Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Using the logarithm power rule: ln(a^b) = b*ln(a):

10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y)

Similarly, for equation two: y^10 = x^{4y}

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Again, applying the power rule:

10 * ln(y) = 4y * ln(x)

So now, I have two new equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, so now I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Maybe I can express both in terms of ln x or ln y and then substitute.

Let me solve equation 1 for ln y. From equation 1:

10 ln x = x ln y => ln y = (10 / x) ln x

Similarly, from equation 2:

10 ln y = 4y ln x => ln y = (4y / 10) ln x => ln y = (2y / 5) ln x

So now, from both equations, ln y is expressed as (10/x) ln x and also as (2y/5) ln x. Since they're equal, I can set them equal to each other:

(10 / x) ln x = (2y / 5) ln x

Wait, I can divide both sides by ln x, assuming ln x is not zero, which it isn't because x > 1, so ln x > 0. So dividing both sides by ln x gives:

10 / x = (2y) / 5

Now, solving for y:

Multiply both sides by x:

10 = (2y / 5) * x

Then, multiply both sides by 5:

50 = 2y x

Divide both sides by 2:

25 = y x

Hmm, so yx = 25? That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.

So, starting from the two expressions for ln y:

(10/x) ln x = (2y/5) ln x

We divided both sides by ln x, which is valid because x > 1, so ln x â‰  0.

Then, 10/x = 2y/5

Cross-multiplying: 10 * 5 = 2y * x

So, 50 = 2xy

Divide by 2: 25 = xy

So, xy = 25. That seems to be the answer. But wait, I should check if this is consistent with the original equations. Because sometimes when you manipulate equations, you might introduce extraneous solutions or overlook constraints.

Let me see. If xy = 25
