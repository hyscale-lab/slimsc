Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the equations. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. So, we're dealing with nonnegative integers that add up to 300. The second equation looks more complex. Let's write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of a square and another variable. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow or find a way to relate it to the sum a + b + c.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the expression. Let me see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Yes, that's right. Because a²b + a²c is a²(b + c), and similarly for the other terms. So, the expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So, now the equation is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let's rearrange that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300 gives:

a² + b² + c² - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000.

Wait, that introduces fractions, which might complicate things because a, b, c are integers. Maybe there's a better way to handle this.

Alternatively, let's think about the original equation again:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, each of the terms (b + c), (a + c), (a + b) is 300 minus the respective variable. So, as I did before, that substitution seems necessary.

But maybe instead of substituting, I can find some relation between the variables. Let me think about symmetry.

Wait, the problem is symmetric in a, b, c. So, perhaps we can assume, without loss of generality, that a ≤ b ≤ c or something like that, to reduce the number of cases.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the equation differently. Let me see:

a²
