Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are 900 residents in total. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem mentions four items: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and a bag of candy hearts. Wait, actually, the candy hearts are something everyone owns. Because it says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that means 100% of the population has candy hearts. That's important.

Now, the numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- All 900 own candy hearts.

Then, it's stated that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay, so this is a problem about sets and their overlaps. I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion for four sets would involve adding up the individual sets, subtracting the pairwise intersections, adding back the triple intersections, and so on. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the exact numbers for each pairwise or triple intersections, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, but maybe I can use the given information about exactly two and exactly three to find the overlaps. Let me think.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- D: owns a diamond ring
- G: owns golf clubs
- S: owns a spade
- C: owns candy hearts

Since every resident owns a candy heart, C is the universal set here. So, the total number of residents is the same as the number in set C, which is 900.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Because the problem is about residents owning some combination of these four items, but since everyone has candy hearts, it's kind of a given. So maybe I can model this as the other three items plus candy hearts.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of all four items, considering that C is universal. So, the problem is about the number of people who have subsets of D, G, S, and C. But since everyone has C, it's always included. So, for each resident, they might have some combination of D, G, S, and C. But since C is always present, we can think of each person as having some combination of D, G, S, plus C.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Maybe an alternative approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but since C is universal, it might make the math a bit simpler.

Alternatively, since every resident has a candy heart, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the four items, but C is automatically included in all counts.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, when they talk about the other items, it's in addition to the candy hearts. So, when they say 195 own a diamond ring, that's 195 who own D, and since C is universal, those 195 also own C. Similarly, all other ownerships include C.

So, perhaps I should model the problem as four sets: D, G, S, and C. But since C is the universal set, the problem is really about the other three items. But wait, no, because the problem mentions four items. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem with four sets, but since C is universal, the number of people who own C is 900, so any overlaps will include C. So, for example, the number of people owning both D and C is the same as the number owning D, which is 195, right? Because everyone in D also has C.

Wait, that's correct. So, the intersection of D and C is D itself because C is universal.
