Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B belongs to A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what exactly Bob is doing. He's listing all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum. Since B has to be a finite nonempty set, each such B corresponds to a subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} (because the elements of B must be less than a, except for a itself). Wait, actually, B's elements can be any positive integers, but the maximum is a, so all other elements must be less than a. But they don't necessarily have to be consecutive or anything, right? So, for each a in A, the number of possible B sets where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of the positive integers less than a. But wait, that can't be right because the positive integers less than a are infinite if a is just any positive integer. Oh, but wait, B is a finite set, so the other elements must also be finite. So, for each a, the number of such B sets is equal to the number of finite subsets of the positive integers less than a. Hmm, but that's still infinite because the positive integers less than a are a finite set, but the number of finite subsets is 2^{a-1}, since each element can be either included or not. But wait, B is a non-empty set, so for each a, the number of possible B sets where a is the maximum is 2^{a-1} - 1. Wait, no, because the set {a} itself is also a valid B. So, the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1}, which includes the empty set as well. But since B must be non-empty, we subtract 1, so it's 2^{a-1} -1? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

If B is a non-empty set with maximum a, then the rest of the elements are any subset of {1,
