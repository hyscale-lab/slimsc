Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than halfway to (0,1), since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) on the x-axis to some point Q(0, q) on the y-axis, with the length of PQ being 1. 

I remember that the length of PQ can be found using the distance formula: sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1. That means all such points P and Q lie on the unit circle, but since they are on the axes, P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), and p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1, right? So, for each p between 0 and 1, there's a corresponding q = sqrt(1 - p²), and vice versa. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)). 

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one such segment in F? Let me check: AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB. 

Using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a member of F. So, AB is one of these PQ segments.

So, the point C is on AB, not A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F. So, for all other segments PQ (other than AB), the point C is not on them. So, our goal is to find OC², where O is the origin.

So, first, let's figure out what AB looks like. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be described by a linear equation. Let's find that equation.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0) / (0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, starting from point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. That's the equation of AB.

So, any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). Let me denote point C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, OC² is x² + y², which would be x² + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]².

But before that, we need to find the specific point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F, except AB. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ, the only PQ that contains C is AB itself.

So, we need to find the point C on AB such that there's no other PQ (from F) that passes through C. So, to find this point, perhaps we can parametrize all possible PQ segments and see where they intersect with AB, then find a point on AB that is only intersected by AB.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of the envelope of all possible PQ segments, and the point C would lie on the boundary of this envelope. Or perhaps, the point C is where the envelope is tangent to AB.

Wait, another approach: For each point C=(x,y) on AB, we can find the number of PQ segments in F that pass through C. We need to find the point C where this number is exactly one (only AB itself).

So, for a general point (x, y), how many PQ segments pass through it? Each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p² + q² = 1. So, the line PQ has equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, right? Since it's intercept form.

So, if a point (x, y) lies on this line, then (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. But since p² + q² =1, we have q = sqrt(1 - p²), but maybe we can use another substitution.

Alternatively, we can express the line PQ in terms of a parameter. Let me think: Let’s denote p as a parameter varying from 0 to 1. Then q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/(sqrt
