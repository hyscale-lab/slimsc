Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. O is the circumcenter, and I is the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI—that's an interesting condition. I should probably visualize this or maybe draw a diagram to get a better sense.

Wait, but since I'm just thinking, let me jot down the given information:

- Triangle ABC, circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6.
- IA ⊥ OI (so the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O).
- Need to find AB * AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let me compute OI.

OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that seems small compared to R. Well, maybe.

Now, the condition given is IA ⊥ OI. IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. Wait, no, IA is the segment from I to A, not the length. But in any case, the vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.

Hmm, perhaps I can set up vectors here. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would help.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point O would be somewhere else, say at (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), point A must lie somewhere such that the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.

Wait, vector IA is from I (0,0) to A (let's say A is at (x,y)), so IA is (x,y). Vector OI is from O to I, which is from (h,k) to (0,0), so it's (-h, -k). But since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.

So, (x, y) • (-h, -k) = 0 => -h x -k y = 0 => h x + k y = 0.

But O is the circumradius, which is
