Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored red or blue independently. So, each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. But we're looking for the number of colorings where there's some rotation that maps the blue vertices to the red ones.

Wait, actually, the problem says that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red. So, it's like a permutation of the vertices where blue moves to red positions and vice versa. But since rotation is involved, the mapping is a rotation symmetry.

I think this problem is related to group theory and Burnside's lemma, which is used for counting orbits under group actions. But maybe I don't need to get that complicated. Let me think differently.

Suppose we fix a coloring. For this coloring, we want that there exists some rotation (by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to where a red vertex was. So, the set of blue vertices must map, under some rotation, to the set of red vertices.

But in a regular octagon, the set of red and blue vertices must be mapped onto each other via a rotation. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices because a rotation is a bijection. Therefore, the number of blue vertices must be 4, since the octagon has 8 vertices. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the number of blue vertices is 4—it just says each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability. So, actually, the number of blue vertices can be 0 to 8, but for the mapping to exist, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices. Because if we have a rotation mapping blues to reds, the number must be the same.

So, actually, the only colorings that satisfy the condition are those where there are exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. Because otherwise, you can't have a bijection between blue and red positions. So, the first thing is that the number of blue vertices must be 4. The probability of having exactly 4 blue vertices is C(8,4) * (1/2)^8. But even among those colorings, only some of them satisfy the condition that a rotation exists mapping all blue to red.

So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

But wait, the problem isn't restricted to colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red. It's any coloring, but with the condition that such a rotation exists. Hmm, but if the number of blue vertices isn't 4, can such a rotation exist?

Wait, no. Because a rotation permutes the positions. For the blue set to be mapped to the red set, the size must be the same. So, if the number of blue vertices isn't 4, you can't have such a rotation. Therefore, only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red are candidates.

So, the first step is that the number of blue vertices must be 4. The probability for that is C(8,4)*(1/2)^8 = 70/256. But not all such colorings satisfy the condition. So, we need to find how many of those 70 colorings are such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but in this case, the blue set is the complement of the red set. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set is a rotation of the blue set. So, the two colorings are related by a rotation.

Wait, but if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, that means that the set of blue vertices is a shifted version of the red set by some rotation. So, for example, if you rotate the octagon by k positions, the blue vertices move to where the reds were.

Another way to think about this is that the set of blue vertices is a rotated copy of the set of red vertices. So, for the octagon, the set of red and blue vertices must form what's called a "rotationally symmetric" pair.

So, how many such colorings are there? Each such coloring corresponds to a pair of complementary subsets of the octagon's vertices that are rotations of each other.

Alternatively, each such coloring is determined by a rotation that maps blue to red. So, for each rotation, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation is equal to the number of colorings where blue is a rotation of red. Hmm, perhaps Burnside's lemma is applicable here.

Wait, Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply it here. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me think in terms of necklaces. The octagon can be thought of as a necklace with 8 beads, each colored red or blue. The group acting on it is the cyclic group of order 8. We want the number of necklaces where there exists a rotation that maps the blue beads to the red beads. Alternatively, for a necklace with 4 blue and 4 red beads, it must be symmetric in some way.

Wait, no. Because for some necklaces, there might be a rotation that swaps blue and red. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of aperiodic necklaces with 4 blue and 4 red beads, considering rotational symmetry.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe each such coloring is counted as a necklace where the coloring is fixed by some rotation that maps blue to red. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the number of such colorings as the number of pairs (R, B) where R and B are complementary subsets of the vertex set, and there exists a rotation that maps R to B.

Wait, but in this case, R and B are complements, so if a rotation maps R to B, that would mean the rotation maps R to its complement. So, the rotation is an involution? Not necessarily. Wait, no, because a rotation of order 8 could map R to B, which is another subset.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is better. Let's think about how the colorings can be rotated to swap red and blue. That is, for each rotation, we can count the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, such that applying the rotation swaps red and blue.

Wait, but in reality, the rotation doesn't necessarily swap red and blue; it's that the image of the blue set under the rotation is the red set. So, for each rotation, the number of colorings where blue is mapped to red is equal to the number of colorings where blue is the rotation of red. So, for a given rotation, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, where blue is the image of red under the rotation. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe let me think about each rotation. The group of rotations of the octagon is cyclic of order 8. So, the rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. For each rotation, we can see if applying it maps blue to red.

If a rotation by k positions maps blue to red, then the coloring must be fixed under that rotation in a certain way. Because if you rotate the octagon by k and the blue vertices end up where the red ones were, then the coloring must be periodic with period k. Wait, not exactly. Because the entire coloring is just a shift.

Wait, perhaps for a specific rotation, say rotation by k positions, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation is equal to the number of colorings that are periodic with period k. So, for example, if k=4, then the coloring must alternate red and blue every other vertex.

But in our case, the condition is stronger: that applying the rotation maps blue to red. So, for each rotation, the number of colorings where blue is mapped to red is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a shift of the red set by k positions.

So, perhaps for each rotation, the number of such colorings is 1 if the rotation is trivial (i.e., k=0, which is the identity rotation), but in that case, the blue set must equal the red set, which isn't possible unless all are red and blue, which isn't the case.

Wait, no. For the identity rotation, the condition is that blue is mapped to red, which would mean that all blue vertices are red, which only occurs if there are zero blue vertices. But we already know that only colorings with 4 blue and 4 red can satisfy the condition. So, perhaps for each non-identity rotation, the number of colorings where blue is shifted to red is equal to the number of colorings fixed by that rotation.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this using group actions. Let G be the cyclic group of order 8, acting on the set of colorings. Each group element is a rotation. We are looking for the number of colorings where there exists a group element g such that g(blue) = red, where red is the complement of blue.

But since blue and red are complements, we have g(blue) = red, which is equivalent to g(blue) = blue^c. So, this would mean that blue is a subset that is mapped to its complement under some group element g. So, blue is a subset such that g(blue) = blue^c.

Hmm, so for each rotation g, we can compute the number of subsets blue for which g(blue) = blue^c. Then, the total number we're seeking is the union over all g of these subsets, but we have to account for overlaps where a coloring satisfies the condition for multiple g's.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

Alternatively, another approach: For a given coloring with 4 blue and 4 red, the number of rotations that map blue to red is equal to the number of symmetries (rotations) that map the blue set to its complement. So, for each such coloring, if the blue set is a rotation of its complement, then there exists at least one such rotation.

So, the question becomes: How many 4-element subsets of the octagon's vertices are such that the subset is a rotation of its complement.

Wait, that sounds familiar. Such subsets are called "symmetric difference" sets or something else?

Wait, in combinatorics, a subset S of a group is called a "difference set" if every nonidentity element of the group can be expressed as the product of two elements of S in a certain number of ways. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps these are called "balanced incomplete block designs," but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the number of such subsets. For an octagon, which is a cyclic group of order 8, the number of subsets S where S is a rotation of its complement.

So, S is a subset of size 4, and there exists some rotation (element of the group) such that r(S) = S^c.

So, how many such subsets S exist?

Let me think about the properties of such a subset S. If r(S) = S^c, then applying r again, we get r^2(S) = r(S^c) = (r(S))^c = (S^c)^c = S.

So, r^2(S) = S. Therefore, S is fixed under rotation by r^2.

Similarly, applying r^4(S) = S, since r^4 is rotation by 180°, which is order 2.

Wait, but if r^2(S) = S, then S is fixed under rotation by 2 positions. So, S must be a union of orbits under rotation by 2 positions.

But the octagon under rotation by 2 positions has orbits of size 4 (since 8 / gcd(2,8) = 8/2=4). Wait, no, that's not correct. The number of orbits when rotating by 2 positions is equal to the gcd(2,8)=2, so there are 2 orbits, each of size 4.

Wait, no, let me correct: when you rotate by k positions, the number of orbits is equal to gcd(k, n), where n is the total number of elements. So, for n=8, k=2, the number of orbits is gcd(2,8)=2, each of size 8/2=4.

So, the group generated by rotation by 2 positions has two cycles, each containing 4 vertices. So, each orbit is a set of four vertices equally spaced.

Wait, in the octagon, rotating by 2 positions is like stepping every other vertex. So, the two orbits are {v1, v3, v5, v7} and {v2, v4, v6, v8}.

So, if S is fixed under rotation by 2 positions, then S must be a union of entire orbits. So, S can be either one of these two orbits or the union of both. Wait, but S has size 4, so it would have to be exactly one of these two orbits.

Therefore, the only subsets S fixed under rotation by 2 positions are the two orbits {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}. So, S must be one of these two sets.

But wait, earlier we concluded that if r(S) = S^c, then r^2(S) = S. So, S must be fixed under rotation by 2 positions, meaning S is one of these two sets.

So, let's check if these sets satisfy r(S) = S^c.

Take S = {1,3,5,7}. Let me define rotation by 1 position as moving each vertex to the next one. So, r(S) would be {2,4,6,8}. The complement of S is {2,4,6,8}, so indeed, r(S) = S^c.

Similarly, for S = {2,4,6,8}, r(S) would be {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as {1,3,5,7} shifted, but S^c is {1,3,5,7}, so r(S) = S^c as well.

Therefore, the only subsets S of size 4 that satisfy r(S) = S^c for some rotation r are the two sets {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}.

Wait, but wait, that's only considering rotation by 1 position. What about other rotations?

Suppose we take a rotation by k=3 positions. Then, r^3(S) would be a rotation by 135 degrees. Let's see if any subset S of size 4 satisfies r^3(S) = S^c.

Hmm, maybe there are other subsets besides the two we found. Let me think.

Suppose S is another subset of size 4. For some rotation r, r(S) = S^c. So, the rotation r must map S exactly to its complement. Since the octagon is regular, this would imply that the subset S is such that it's a "shifted" version of its complement.

So, for example, if S is {1,2,5,6}, then rotation by 3 positions would give {4,5,8,1}, but that's not the complement of S.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure of such subsets. If S is a subset of size 4, and its complement is a rotation of S, then the subset S must be a "rotational complement" of itself. So, S and S^c are related by a rotation.

Wait, in the case of the two subsets we found earlier, {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}, they are complements of each other under rotation by 1 position.

Are there other such subsets?

Let me try to find another subset. Suppose S = {1,2,4,5}. Let's see if rotating S by some k positions gives its complement.

The complement of S is {3,6,7,8}. If we rotate S by k positions, can we get {3,6,7,8}?

Let me try k=2: rotating {1,2,4,5} by 2 positions gives {3,4,6,7}. Not equal to {3,6,7,8}.

k=3: rotating gives {4,5,7,8}. Not equal.

k=4: rotating gives {5,6,8,1}. Not equal.

k=5: rotating gives {6,7,1,2}. Not equal.

k=6: rotating gives {7,8,2,3}. Not equal.

k=7: rotating gives {8,1,3,4}. Not equal.

Hmm, none of these rotations of S give the complement. So, S = {1,2,4,5} doesn't seem to work.

What about S = {1,2,3,4}? Its complement is {5,6,7,8}. Rotating S by 4 positions gives {5,6,7,8}, which is its complement. So, in this case, rotation by 4 positions swaps S with its complement. So, this is another subset where a rotation maps S to its complement.

Wait, but wait, S = {1,2,3,4} is four consecutive vertices. Rotating by 4 positions (180 degrees) maps each vertex to the one opposite. So, 1→5, 2→6, 3→7, 4→8. So, indeed, rotation by 4 positions maps S to its complement.

So, S = {1,2,3,4} is another subset where rotation by 4 positions maps S to its complement.

Similarly, S = {2,3,4,5} would have its complement as {1,6,7,8}, and rotation by 4 positions maps S to {6,7,8,1}, which is not the complement. Wait, the complement is {1,6,7,8}, but rotating S by 4 positions gives {6,7,8,1}, which is the same as {1,6,7,8} except for the order. Wait, but sets are unordered, so {6,7,8,1} is the same as {1,6,7,8}, which is the complement of S. So, yes, rotation by 4 positions swaps S with its complement.

Wait, but S = {1,2,3,4} and S = {2,3,4,5} are different subsets, but both are fixed under rotation by 4 positions (since rotation by 4 positions maps each to the other half). So, let's see how many such subsets exist.

In the octagon, the subsets that are fixed under rotation by 4 positions are those that consist of two adjacent pairs of opposite vertices. For example, {1,2,5,6}, but wait, no, {1,2,5,6} when rotated by 4 positions becomes {5,6,9,10}, which is not the same as the original. Wait, in an octagon, each vertex is connected to another vertex across the center.

Wait, perhaps the subsets that are fixed under rotation by 4 positions are those that are unions of pairs of opposite vertices.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: a subset is fixed under rotation by 4 positions if when you rotate it by 4 positions, it maps to itself. So, S = r^4(S). So, S must be a union of orbits under rotation by 4 positions.

Since rotation by 4 positions is an involution (applying it twice brings you back), the orbits are pairs of opposite vertices. So, the octagon has 4 such pairs: {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, {4,8}.

Therefore, a subset fixed under rotation by 4 positions must be a union of some of these pairs. Since each pair has size 2, and our subset S has size 4, S must be the union of two such pairs.

So, how many such subsets are there? The number is C(4,2) = 6. Each subset is a union of two opposite pairs.

Wait, but in our earlier example, S = {1,2,3,4} isn't a union of opposite pairs. Because {1,2,3,4} includes adjacent vertices, not opposite ones. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion was wrong.

Wait, no, because S = {1,2,3,4} isn't fixed under rotation by 4 positions. Rotating it by 4 positions gives {5,6,7,8}, which is its complement. So, S isn't fixed under rotation by 4; instead, the rotation maps it to its complement.

Therefore, S is not fixed under rotation by 4 positions, but rather, it's mapped to its complement. So, in this case, S and its complement are swapped by rotation by 4 positions. So, S isn't fixed, but rather, it's part of a pair of subsets swapped by the rotation.

So, perhaps the number of such subsets S where r(S) = S^c for some rotation r is more than the two we found earlier.

Wait, earlier, we found two subsets: {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}, which are swapped by rotation by 1 position. And another subset {1,2,3,4}, which is swapped by rotation by 4 positions with its complement {5,6,7,8}.

Similarly, there's another subset {2,3,4,5}, which is swapped by rotation by 4 positions with its complement {1,6,7,8}.

Wait, but {1,2,3,4} and {2,3,4,5} are different. How many such subsets are there?

Wait, let's consider all possible subsets S of size 4 that are swapped with their complements by some rotation.

So, for rotation by 1 position, we have S = {1,3,5,7} and S = {2,4,6,8}.

For rotation by 3 positions (which is equivalent to rotation by -1 positions, since 8-1=7, but 3 is co-prime to 8 as 1 is), would that give us other subsets?

Wait, let me try. Let's take S = {1,2,5,6}. Let's see what happens when we rotate by 3 positions.

Rotating {1,2,5,6} by 3 positions gives {4,5,8,1}. The complement of S is {3,4,7,8}. So, {4,5,8,1} is not equal to {3,4,7,8}, so S isn't mapped to its complement by rotation by 3 positions.

Hmm, maybe only certain rotations lead to subset swaps.

Wait, perhaps the only non-identity rotations that can swap a subset with its complement are those with orders dividing 2, i.e., rotations by 0°, 180°, etc. Because a rotation that swaps a subset with its complement must be an involution (applying it twice gives the identity). So, the only such rotations are those of order 2. In an octagon, the rotations by 0° (identity), 180°, 90°, 270°, 45°, 135°, etc.

Wait, no. A rotation of order 2 would be 180°, because 360° / 2 = 180°. So, in the octagon, the only non-identity rotation that is an involution is 180°, which is rotation by 4 positions. So, only rotations by 0° and 4 positions are involutions.

Wait, no. 90° is a rotation of order 4, since 4*90°=360°. So, it's not an involution. So, only rotation by 180° is an involution (order 2). So, the only non-identity rotation that is its own inverse is rotation by 4 positions.

Therefore, only rotation by 4 positions can swap a subset with its complement, because applying it twice brings you back to the original.

Therefore, the subsets that are swapped with their complements by a rotation must be swapped by rotation by 4 positions.

So, for each such subset S, r^4(S) = S^c.

But earlier, we saw that S = {1,2,3,4} satisfies r^4(S) = {5,6,7,8} = S^c.

Similarly, S = {2,3,4,5} would have r^4(S) = {6,7,8,1} = {1,6,7,8} = S^c.

Wait, but S = {1,2,3,4} is a block of four consecutive vertices. Similarly, S = {2,3,4,5}, etc.

How many such subsets S are there?

In the octagon, the number of consecutive 4-vertex blocks is 8, because you can start at any vertex. For example, {1,2,3,4}, {2,3,4,5}, ..., {8,1,2,3}.

Each of these subsets, when rotated by 4 positions, gives their complements. So, each such subset S is paired with its complement under rotation by 4 positions.

Therefore, each such S is a subset of four consecutive vertices, and their complements are also four consecutive vertices.

So, how many such subsets are there? There are 8 such subsets, each corresponding to a starting vertex. But since each pair {S, S^c} is counted twice in this list, the number of distinct pairs is 4.

Wait, for example, {1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8} form a pair, {2,3,4,5} and {6,7,8,1} form another pair, etc. So, each consecutive block is part of a unique pair with its complement.

Therefore, the number of such subsets S is 8, but since each pair is counted twice, the number of unique pairs is 4. But in our case, we are counting subsets, not pairs. So, each subset S is unique, so there are 8 such subsets.

Wait, no. Each consecutive subset of 4 is unique. So, {1,2,3,4}, {2,3,4,5}, ..., {8,1,2,3} are 8 different subsets. Each of these subsets is mapped to its complement by rotation by 4 positions.

So, each of these 8 subsets satisfies the condition that rotation by 4 positions maps S to S^c.

So, that's 8 subsets.

Earlier, we found two more subsets: {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}, which are swapped with their complements under rotation by 1 position. Wait, but those are also subsets of size 4, and their rotation by 1 position maps them to their complements.

So, that's two more subsets.

But wait, are these subsets already included in the 8 consecutive subsets? Let's check.

Take S = {1,3,5,7}. Is this a consecutive subset? No, because the vertices are not consecutive. So, this is a separate subset.

Similarly, {2,4,6,8} is another subset not in the consecutive ones.

So, in total, we have 8 subsets that are consecutive blocks and 2 subsets that are alternating vertices, making a total of 10 subsets S where there exists a rotation that maps S to its complement.

Wait, but earlier I thought that only rotations by 1 and 4 positions could swap S with its complement. So, for each subset S in the consecutive blocks, rotation by 4 positions swaps it with its complement. For the alternating subsets, rotation by 1 position swaps them with their complements.

So, in total, we have 8 + 2 = 10 subsets S of size 4 where there exists a rotation that maps S to its complement.

But let me confirm: when we have a subset S which is a union of two opposite pairs, such as {1,3,5,7}, which is {1,5} and {3,7}, then rotation by 2 positions would map {1,5} to {3,7}, but that's not the complement. Wait, no, the complement of S is {2,4,6,8}. So, rotation by 1 position maps S to {2,4,6,8}.

Wait, but S = {1,3,5,7} is mapped to {2,4,6,8} under rotation by 1 position, which is its complement. So, that's correct.

Similarly, S = {2,4,6,8} is mapped to {3,5,7,1} under rotation by 1 position, which is its complement, {1,3,5,7}.

So, these are two more subsets that satisfy the condition.

So, in total, how many such subsets are there?

We have 8 subsets that are consecutive 4-vertex blocks, each of which is swapped with its complement under rotation by 4 positions.

And we have 2 subsets that are alternating vertices (like the ones we found earlier), each of which is swapped with its complement under rotation by 1 position.

So, 8 + 2 = 10 subsets.

Are there any other subsets that satisfy this condition?

Let me think about another example. Suppose S = {1,2,5,6}. Let's see if rotating S by any k positions will give its complement {3,4,7,8}.

Rotating S by 3 positions (135°) gives {4,5,8,1}.

Is {4,5,8,1} equal to {3,4,7,8}? No.

Rotating S by 2 positions gives {3,4,7,8}, which is exactly its complement.

Wait, so S = {1,2,5,6} is another subset where rotation by 2 positions maps S to its complement.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that subsets fixed under rotation by 2 positions are only the two alternating subsets. But S = {1,2,5,6} is a union of two adjacent pairs, not the alternating ones.

Wait, let me check again. Rotating S = {1,2,5,6} by 2 positions gives {3,4,7,8}.

Yes, which is the complement of S.

So, that's another subset. So, now I'm confused because earlier I thought only the two alternating subsets, but now I found another subset S = {1,2,5,6} that also satisfies the condition under rotation by 2 positions.

Wait, so maybe there are more than 10 subsets. Let me try to find all such subsets.

Let me consider that a rotation by k positions, where k is co-prime to 8, will generate different subsets. For example, rotation by 1 and 3 and 5 and 7 positions are co-prime, but rotation by 2,4,6 are not.

Wait, let me see. So, for a subset S, if there exists a rotation by k positions such that r^k(S) = S^c, then S is such that the rotation by k positions swaps S with its complement.

If k is co-prime to 8, then the rotation is a generator of the group, so it'll cycle through all positions. For example, k=1, which cycles through all 8 positions.

If k is not co-prime, like k=2, the rotation has order 4.

So, let's consider different cases based on the rotation.

Case 1: Rotation by 1 position (k=1). This is a generator. So, if S is a subset such that r(S) = S^c, then applying r again, we get r^2(S) = r(S^c) = (r(S))^c = (S^c)^c = S. So, r^2(S) = S. So, S must be fixed under rotation by 2 positions.

As we saw earlier, the only subsets fixed under rotation by 2 positions are the two alternating subsets {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}.

Therefore, under rotation by 1 position, only these two subsets satisfy r(S) = S^c.

Case 2: Rotation by 2 positions (k=2). Let's see what subsets satisfy r^2(S) = S^c.

If r^2(S) = S^c, then applying r^2 again, we get r^4(S) = r^2(S^c) = (r^2(S))^c = (S^c)^c = S. So, r^4(S) = S. Therefore, S must be fixed under rotation by 4 positions.

So, subsets fixed under rotation by 4 positions are those that are unions of pairs of opposite vertices. So, as we saw earlier, these are subsets like {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}, etc.

Wait, let me clarify. The subsets that are fixed under rotation by 4 positions are those that are unions of pairs of opposite vertices. So, each such subset is composed of two pairs of opposite vertices.

But wait, if S is fixed under rotation by 4 positions, then S must be equal to r^4(S). So, for example, S = {1,2,5,6}. Rotating by 4 positions gives {5,6,9,10}, but in an octagon, it's {5,6,1,2}, which is the same as S. Wait, no, because {1,2,5,6} rotated by 4 positions becomes {5,6,1,2}, which is the same as S. So, S is fixed under rotation by 4 positions.

Wait, but earlier we saw that when you rotate S by 2 positions, S maps to its complement. So, in this case, S is fixed under rotation by 4 positions, but when rotated by 2 positions, it maps to its complement.

So, for rotation by 2 positions, we can have subsets that are fixed under rotation by 4 positions, but when rotated by 2 positions, they map to their complements.

Wait, but earlier, S = {1,2,5,6} is fixed under rotation by 4 positions, but when rotated by 2 positions, it maps to {3,4,7,8}, which is its complement.

So, that's another subset.

How many such subsets are there? Each such subset is a union of two pairs of opposite vertices, but arranged such that rotating by 2 positions maps it to its complement.

Wait, actually, each such subset is made by selecting two opposite pairs, but spaced in such a way that a rotation by 2 positions moves each pair to the next pair.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: For a subset S to satisfy r^2(S) = S^c, S must be a union of two orbits under rotation by 2 positions. Wait, no, because rotation by 2 positions partitions the octagon into two orbits: {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}.

Wait, so if S is a union of entire orbits under rotation by 2 positions, then S would be either {1,3,5,7} or {2,4,6,8}. But these are the two subsets we found earlier, which are fixed under rotation by 2 positions.

But earlier, we found another subset S = {1,2,5,6}, which is not a union of such orbits. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

If a subset S satisfies r^2(S) = S^c, then r^4(S) = r^2(S^c) = (r^2(S))^c = (S^c)^c = S. So, S is fixed under rotation by 4 positions.

Therefore, S must be fixed under rotation by 4 positions. So, S must be a union of orbits under rotation by 4 positions, which are the pairs of opposite vertices.

Each orbit under rotation by 4 positions is a pair of opposite vertices. So, S must be a union of some number of these pairs.

Since S has size 4, which is two pairs. So, how many such subsets S are there?

There are C(4,2) = 6 possible subsets, each being a union of two opposite pairs.

Wait, let me list them:

1. {1,5,2,6}
2. {1,5,3,7}
3. {1,5,4,8}
4. {2,6,3,7}
5. {2,6,4,8}
6. {3,7,4,8}

Wait, but some of these might not be unique. Wait, no, each pair of opposite pairs is unique.

Wait, for example, subset 1 is {1,5,2,6}, which is two adjacent opposite pairs.

Wait, but in reality, each opposite pair is non-adjacent. So, {1,5}, {2,6}, etc., are each pairs of opposite vertices. So, the subsets S that are unions of two such pairs are as follows:

- {1,5,2,6}
- {1,5,3,7}
- {1,5,4,8}
- {2,6,3,7}
- {2,6,4,8}
- {3,7,4,8}

So, there are 6 such subsets.

Each of these subsets is fixed under rotation by 4 positions. So, when we rotate S by 4 positions, we get S itself.

But, when we rotate S by 2 positions, let's see where it goes.

Take S = {1,5,2,6}. Rotating by 2 positions gives {3,7,4,8}, which is the complement of S, since S is {1,5,2,6} and its complement is {3,4,7,8}.

Wait, no. Wait, S = {1,5,2,6} has a complement of {3,4,7,8}. Rotating S by 2 positions gives {3,7,4,8}, which is exactly the complement.

Similarly, take S = {1,5,3,7}. Rotating by 2 positions gives {5,1,7,3}, which is the same as S. So, in this case, S is fixed under rotation by 2 positions.

Wait, that's interesting. So, for some subsets S that are unions of two opposite pairs, rotation by 2 positions maps them to themselves, while for others, it maps them to their complements.

Wait, so let's check each of the 6 subsets:

1. S = {1,5,2,6}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {3,7,4,8} = S^c.
2. S = {1,5,3,7}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {3,7,5,1} = S.
3. S = {1,5,4,8}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {3,7,6,2} = S^c.
4. S = {2,6,3,7}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {4,8,5,1} = S^c.
5. S = {2,6,4,8}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {4,8,6,2} = S.
6. S = {3,7,4,8}: Rotating by 2 positions gives {5,1,6,2} = S^c.

So, out of the 6 subsets:

- Subsets 2 and 5 are fixed under rotation by 2 positions.
- Subsets 1,3,4,6 are mapped to their complements under rotation by 2 positions.

So, for these 6 subsets:

- The ones that are fixed under rotation by 2 positions are {1,5,3,7} and {2,6,4,8}, which are the two alternating subsets we found earlier.
- The other four subsets (1,3,4,6) satisfy rotation by 2 positions mapping them to their complements.

Therefore, in total, the number of subsets S where there exists a rotation that maps S to its complement is:

- 8 subsets that are consecutive 4-vertex blocks, each swapped with their complements under rotation by 4 positions.
- 4 subsets (1,3,4,6) that are unions of two opposite pairs, each swapped with their complements under rotation by 2 positions.

So, 8 + 4 = 12 subsets.

Wait, but earlier I thought that {1,5,2,6} is one such subset. So, 4 of them.

Wait, but also, the two alternating subsets are fixed under rotation by 2 positions, so they are not being swapped. Wait, no, earlier we saw that the two alternating subsets are swapped under rotation by 1 position. So, they are part of the 8 consecutive subsets?

No, they are separate. So, perhaps the total is 8 (consecutive) + 4 (non-consecutive unions of two opposite pairs) = 12 subsets.

Wait, but let me check: earlier, we saw that S = {1,3,5,7} is a subset that is swapped with its complement under rotation by 1 position. So, that's not part of the consecutive subsets. So, it's among the 4 subsets that are unions of two opposite pairs.

Wait, no. Wait, {1,3,5,7} is a union of two opposite pairs: {1,5} and {3,7}. So, it is one of the 6 subsets we listed earlier. So, in that case, the 6 subsets include both the two that are fixed under rotation by 2 positions and the four that are swapped under rotation by 2 positions.

So, the two fixed subsets are {1,5,3,7} and {2,6,4,8}, which are the alternating subsets.

The other four subsets (1,3,4,6) are the ones that are swapped with their complements under rotation by 2 positions.

So, in total, the subsets that satisfy the condition are:

1. 8 consecutive 4-vertex blocks, each swapped with their complements under rotation by 4 positions.
2. 4 subsets that are unions of two opposite pairs, each swapped with their complements under rotation by 2 positions.

Wait, but the two alternating subsets are fixed under rotation by 2 positions, so they don't swap with their complements under rotation by 2 positions. Instead, they swap under rotation by 1 position.

So, perhaps I'm mixing up the rotations. Let me reorganize.

Let me think of all possible subsets S of size 4 where there exists some rotation r such that r(S) = S^c.

These subsets can be of two types:

Type A: Subsets that are swapped with their complements by a rotation of order 2 (i.e., 180° rotation). These are the consecutive 4-vertex blocks, as rotating by 4 positions swaps them with their complements.

Type B: Subsets that are swapped with their complements by a rotation of order 1, which is the identity, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, rotation by 1 position is order 8, not 2.

Wait, earlier, we saw that rotation by 1 position swaps the two alternating subsets {1,3,5,7} and {2,4,6,8}. So, for these subsets, rotation by 1 position maps each to the other, which is their complement.

So, these are another type of subsets that satisfy the condition.

So, the total subsets S where a rotation maps S to S^c are:

- Type A: 8 subsets (consecutive 4-blocks) swapped by rotation by 4 positions.
- Type B: 2 subsets (alternating) swapped by rotation by 1 position.

Wait, but earlier, we found that S = {1,2,5,6} is another subset where rotation by 2 positions swaps it with its complement. So, that's another type.

So, perhaps there's a third type:

Type C: Subsets that are unions of two opposite pairs, each swapped with their complements by rotation by 2 positions.

Earlier, we found four such subsets: subsets 1,3,4,6 from the six unions of two opposite pairs. So, four subsets of Type C.

Therefore, the total number is Type A (8) + Type B (2) + Type C (4) = 14.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not double-counting.

Type A: consecutive 4-blocks: 8 subsets.

Type B: alternating subsets: 2 subsets.

Type C: unions of two opposite pairs that are swapped by rotation by 2 positions: 4 subsets.

So, 8 + 2 + 4 = 14.

But wait, when I thought about S = {1,2,5,6}, that's a Type C subset, which is a union of two opposite pairs, and is swapped with its complement under rotation by 2 positions.

So, that's correct.

So, in total, 14 subsets S where a rotation maps S to its complement.

But let me confirm by another approach.

Each such subset S must form a "balanced" set under some rotation. So, for each rotation, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation where blue is mapped to red is equal to the number of such subsets S that are swapped with their complements by that rotation.

So, for each rotation, the number of such subsets is either 0 or some number.

But maybe it's better to think about the total number across all rotations.

Wait, perhaps Burnside's lemma can help here. The number of colorings where there's a rotation mapping blue to red is equal to the average number of such colorings fixed by each group element.

Wait, no, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, but in this case, we're looking for colorings that have at least one symmetry (rotation) mapping blue to red.

Alternatively, the total number is equal to the union over all rotations of the colorings fixed by that rotation (i.e., blue is mapped to red).

But calculating the union is tricky because colorings can be fixed by multiple rotations.

So, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number is equal to the sum over each rotation of the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, minus the sum over pairs of rotations of the number of colorings fixed by both, plus the sum over triples, etc.

But that seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, each coloring that satisfies the condition must have either:

1. A consecutive block of 4 blue vertices, which is swapped with its complement by a rotation of 4 positions. There are 8 such colorings (since 8 possible starting positions).

2. An alternating pattern of blue and red, which is swapped by a rotation of 1 position. There are 2 such colorings (the two alternating subsets).

3. A subset S which is a union of two opposite pairs, swapped by a rotation of 2 positions. There are 4 such colorings.

So, in total, 8 + 2 + 4 = 14 colorings.

But wait, each coloring corresponds to a subset S, so the number of such colorings is 14. But wait, each subset S corresponds to exactly one coloring where those vertices are blue and the rest are red.

But in our problem, the colorings are counted as all possible colorings where such a rotation exists. So, the number of such colorings is 14.

But wait, no. Because each subset S is unique, and each corresponds to exactly one coloring. So, the number of colorings is equal to the number of such subsets S, which is 14.

But wait, earlier I thought that the two alternating subsets each correspond to colorings that have a rotational symmetry. Similarly, the consecutive subsets and the unions of opposite pairs.

But let me confirm the counts:

- Type A: 8 subsets, each corresponds to a consecutive 4-block. So, 8 colorings.

- Type B: 2 subsets, each corresponds to an alternating pattern. So, 2 colorings.

- Type C: 4 subsets, each corresponds to a union of two opposite pairs. So, 4 colorings.

Total: 14 colorings.

So, the probability is 14 / 256.

Simplify that: 14 divides by 2, so 7/128.

But wait, 14 is the number of colorings where such a rotation exists. Wait, but is that correct? Because each of these subsets corresponds to a unique coloring, so 14 colorings.

But wait, let me think again. For each subset S, we have a unique coloring where S is blue and S^c is red. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S where a rotation maps S to S^c.

So, it's 14 colorings.

But the total number of colorings is 256.

Therefore, the probability is 14/256 = 7/128.

But wait, earlier I thought that the number of such colorings is 10, but now it's 14. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again about Type C. Earlier, I thought that for rotation by 2 positions, there are 4 subsets S that are swapped with their complements. So, Type C has 4 subsets. Type A has 8, Type B has 2, so 14.

But when I thought about S = {1,2,5,6}, I saw that it's a Type C subset, which is a union of two opposite pairs, and is swapped with its complement under rotation by 2 positions.

So, the four Type C subsets are:

1. {1,2,5,6}
2. {2,3,6,7}
3. {3,4,7,8}
4. {4,5,8,1}

Each of these is a union of two adjacent opposite pairs.

Wait, but S = {1,2,5,6} is the union of {1,5} and {2,6}, which are opposite pairs. So, each Type C subset is a union of two such opposite pairs.

So, in total, there are four such subsets.

So, yes, 4 Type C subsets.

So, in total, 8 + 2 + 4 = 14 subsets, each corresponding to a unique coloring.

Therefore, the probability is 14 / 256 = 7 / 128.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about the Type A subsets. Each of the 8 consecutive 4-blocks corresponds to a unique coloring where those four vertices are blue, and the other four are red. Each of these colorings is such that rotating by 4 positions swaps the blue and red.

Similarly, the Type B subsets correspond to colorings where the blue set is an alternating pattern, which is swapped by a rotation of 1 position.

Type C subsets correspond to colorings where the blue set is a union of two adjacent opposite pairs, swapped by a rotation of 2 positions.

So, each of these subsets is distinct, and there are 14 in total.

Therefore, the probability is 14/256 = 7/128.

Wait, but 7 and 128 are coprime, so m = 7, n = 128, and m + n = 135.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because I've seen similar problems where the answer is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I have overcounted. Let me think: are the Type C subsets already counted in Type A or Type B?

Type A are consecutive 4-blocks; Type C are unions of two opposite pairs, which are not consecutive. So, they're distinct.

Type B are the two alternating subsets, which are also distinct from Type A and Type C.

So, I think the count is correct.

Therefore, the probability is 14/256, which simplifies to 7/128. So, m + n = 7 + 128 = 135.


The problem involves a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. 

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue.
   - We need a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.
   - This implies the number of blue and red vertices must be equal, i.e., 4 each.

2. **Counting Valid Colorings**:
   - We identified three types of valid colorings:
     - **Type A**: Consecutive 4-vertex blocks, which are swapped with their complements under a 180° rotation. There are 8 such colorings.
     - **Type B**: Alternating patterns (e.g., {1,3,5,7}), swapped under a 45° rotation. There are 2 such colorings.
     - **Type C**: Unions of two opposite pairs, swapped under a 90° rotation. There are 4 such colorings.
   - Total valid colorings: \(8 + 2 + 4 = 14\).

3. **Calculating the Probability**:
   - Total possible colorings: \(2^8 = 256\).
   - Probability: \(\frac{14}{256} = \frac{7}{128}\).

4. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The fraction \(\frac{7}{128}\) is in simplest form, so \(m = 7\) and \(n = 128\).

5. **Final Answer**:
   - \(m + n = 7 + 128 = 135\).

### Answer:
\boxed{135}
