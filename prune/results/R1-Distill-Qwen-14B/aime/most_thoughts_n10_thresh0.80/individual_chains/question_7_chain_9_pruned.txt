Okay, so I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the octagon is regular, which means all sides and angles are equal, so it has rotational symmetry. Each vertex is colored independently red or blue with a 50-50 chance. So, each vertex has two possibilities, and since there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. That will be our denominator when we compute the probability.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there exists a rotation mapping all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, for a given coloring, if we can rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was red in the original coloring, then that coloring counts towards our numerator.

Wait, so another way to think about this is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if we rotate the octagon so that the blue ones are now where the reds were, that implies that the blue set is just a rotated version of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, any rotation will map the set of red vertices to another set of vertices, but whether those sets are rotations of each other depends on the coloring.

So, to rephrase, we're looking for colorings where the blue vertices form a rotated version of the red ones. But how can we count such colorings?

Wait, but each coloring is a fixed set of red and blue vertices. For a given coloring, the blue vertices might form a pattern that is rotationally symmetric or not. So, we need to find all colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Alternatively, the red set is a rotation of the blue set.

But wait, the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were red vertices. So, after rotation, the blue set becomes the red set. So, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set. So, in other words, the blue set is a translate (rotationally) of the red set.

But in the octagon, the concept of a translate is equivalent to a rotation because it's a regular polygon. So, every rotation will shift the vertices by a certain number of positions. So, for each coloring, we need to check if the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but how can we count the number of such colorings? Let me think.

First, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of group theory. The octagon has rotational symmetry group of order 8, which is cyclic. Each rotation can be represented by an element of the group, and we're looking for colorings such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, if we consider the colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then for each rotation, the number of colorings where blue is the image of red under that
