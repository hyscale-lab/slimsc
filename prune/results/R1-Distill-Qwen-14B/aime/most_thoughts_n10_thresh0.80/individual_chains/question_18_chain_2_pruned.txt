Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. The problem is about counting all possible rectangles inside it, which is a combinatorial geometry problem.

First, I need to visualize the dodecagon. It's a regular one, so all sides and angles are equal. Since it's regular, the symmetry should help in counting the rectangles. But how exactly?

I think rectangles in a regular polygon can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides. In a dodecagon, sides are straight, but the diagonals can also be parallel to each other or to the sides. So, perhaps the key is to find all sets of four points that form a rectangle, where each side is either a side or a diagonal.

Wait, but how do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals? Maybe each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that intersect each other.

In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be categorized based on their lengths and angles. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 11 others, but the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

I remember that in regular polygons, two diagonals are parallel if they connect vertices with the same number of skips. For example, in a regular hexagon, the long diagonals are all parallel. So, in a dodecagon, diagonals that skip the same number of vertices will be parallel.

So, perhaps I need to find all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that are separated by a certain distance, and then count how many rectangles can be formed by these pairs.

Wait, but how do I compute that? Maybe I should think in terms of choosing two pairs of parallel lines, each pair separated by a certain number of steps, and then the intersection of these lines forms the vertices of the rectangle.

Let me try to break it down.

First, in a regular dodecagon, each side is a line segment between two adjacent vertices. The diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that connects a vertex to the one two steps away is shorter than one that skips three vertices.

The number of different directions (slopes) of sides and diagonals in a regular dodecagon depends on the number of unique angles. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, each central angle is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the sides are at 0째, 30째, 60째, ..., up to 330째. But sides and diagonals can have different slopes.

Wait, actually, each side or diagonal can be represented by vectors from the center to the midpoint of the side or the vertex. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, for a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, the number of different directions for sides and diagonals is equal to n/2, where n is the number of sides. Because each direction is repeated twice, symmetrically opposite.

So for a dodecagon, n=12, so there are 6 different directions for sides and diagonals. Each direction corresponds to a step of k vertices apart, where k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Wait, because beyond k=6, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction.

Wait, for a dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. So, connecting vertex 1 to vertex 2 is a side (k=1), vertex
