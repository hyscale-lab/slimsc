Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. It sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to break it down.

The problem states that there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own other things: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. Wait, but it doesn't mention the number who own all four. Oh, that's what we're trying to find.

Let me list out the information:

- Total residents, N = 900
- Number owning a diamond ring, D = 195
- Number owning golf clubs, G = 367
- Number owning garden spade, S = 562
- Number owning exactly two things, exactly two = 437
- Number owning exactly three things, exactly three = 234
- We need to find the number owning all four, let's call this x.

Wait, but everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So the four things are candy hearts (C), diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spade (S). But since everyone has C, the total is 900. So when considering the other three items (D, G, S), we can model this as a three-set problem, but with the understanding that each person has at least C.

But actually, since C is universal, maybe it's easier to consider that each person has at least C, so the total number of people is the same as those owning C, which is 900. So the problem is about the overlaps between D, G, S, and C.

Wait, no. Because C is something everyone has, so when considering the other items, the ownership of D, G, S is a subset of the total 900. Hmm, maybe it's better to model it as four sets, but since C is universal, it's automatically included in everyone. So perhaps the problem reduces to the inclusion-exclusion principle with three sets (D, G, S), and the total number is 900,
