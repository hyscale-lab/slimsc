Okay, so I've got this math problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, the problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. So, each type is identical among themselves. The grid has 25 cells, each can hold at most one chip. So, I can place either a white, black, or nothing in each cell, right?

The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate the first two conditions.

Hmm, so the first two conditions mean that each row can only have all white, all black, or none. Similarly, each column can only have all white, all black, or none. But wait, if a row is all white, then every column that has a white chip in that row must also be all white in that column, right? Because the column can't have a mix of colors.

Wait, maybe that's not necessarily the case. Let me think. If I have a row that's all white, then each column that intersects with this row must be all white as well, because otherwise, if a column had a black chip somewhere else, it would conflict with the white in that row. So, if a row is all white, all columns that intersect with it must be all white too. Similarly for black.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because if I have a row with all white chips, each column can choose to have white or not. But if a column has a white chip in that row, then the entire column must be white. So, the row being all white forces any column that has a white chip in that row to also be all white.

But the problem says each row and each column can have all the same color or none. Wait, no, the problem says all chips in the same row have the same color. So, each row must be entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty. Similarly for each column.

But if a row is entirely white, then each column that has a white in that row must also be entirely white. Because a column can't have a black in another row if it's already got a white in the current row. So, this might mean that once a row is white
