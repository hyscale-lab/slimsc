Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. So Alice picks a set A, and Bob creates a list of sets B. Each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and the maximum element in B must be in A. The total number of such B is 2024. I need to figure out what A is, specifically the sum of its elements.

Let me think about how Bob's list is constructed. For each maximum element m in A, Bob can create sets B where m is the maximum. So for each m in A, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of nonempty subsets of the positive integers less than m, because each B must include m and can include any combination of numbers less than m.

Wait, okay, for each m in A, the number of possible B sets where m is the maximum is 2^{m-1}. Because the elements less than m can be included or not, but B must be nonempty, so it's 2^{m-1} since the maximum is included. Wait, no, wait. If I fix m as the maximum, the set B must include m and any combination (including none) of the numbers less than m. So the number of possible subsets for each m is 2^{m-1}, because there are m-1 elements less than m. But wait, each B must be non-empty. However, since m is included, all these subsets are non-empty. So for each m, the number of B sets is indeed 2^{m-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m-1}. And we know this total is 2024. So we have the equation:

Sum_{m ∈ A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

We need to find A such that this sum is 2024, and then compute the sum of the elements of A.

So, essentially, we're looking for a subset A of positive integers where the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A equals 2024. Then the sum of elements in A is the sum of the m's in A.

Wait, so let me think about binary representations here. Because 2^{m-1} is related to binary digits.

2024 is a number, let's see what it is in binary. Maybe that can help.

Let's compute 2024 in binary.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0.

506 /2=253, rem 0.

253 /2=126 rem 1.

126/2=63 rem 0.

63/2=31 rem 1.

31/2=15 rem 1.

15/2=7 rem 1.

7/2=3 rem1.

3/2=1 rem1.

1/2=0 rem1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count. Let me write 2024 as the sum of powers of 2.

What's the largest power of 2 less than 2024?

2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048. So 2^10 is 1024.

2024 - 1024 = 1000.

1000: largest power is 512 (2^9). 1000-512=488.

488: 256 (2^8). 488-256=232.

232:128 (2^7). 232-128=104.

104:64 (2^6). 104-64=40.

40:32 (2^5). 40-32=8.

8:8 (2^3). 8-8=0.

So 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, let me check:

2^10 = 1024

2^9=512 → 1024+512=1536

+2^8=256 → 1792

+2^7=128 → 1920

+2^6=64 → 1984

+2^5=32 → 2016

+2^3=8 → 2024.

Yes, that's correct. So 2024 in binary is 11111101000.

So, how does this relate to the sum of 2^{m-1}?

Well, the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1} is equal to 2024. So, for each m in A, we have a term 2^{m-1} in the sum. So, if we think of 2024 as a sum of powers of two, each term 2^{m-1} corresponds to a digit in the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, but in the sum, each term is 2^{m-1}, so each m corresponds to a power of 2 in the binary representation. So, if I have a set A where each m is such that 2^{m-1} is a power of two that contributes to 2024, then the sum over 2^{m-1} would be exactly 2024.

Therefore, the exponents plus one correspond to the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, let's see.

2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So the exponents here are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Each of these exponents corresponds to m-1 in our sum. So m-1 is equal to each exponent.

So m = exponent + 1.

So for each exponent in 2024's binary representation, m is exponent +1.

So looking at 2024's binary representation, the exponents where the bits are 1 are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So m's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, let me check. Because exponents are the powers, so for each 2^k in 2024, k corresponds to m-1, so m =k +1.

So, in 2024, the exponents (k) are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, m's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Now, the sum of the elements of A is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Let me compute that:

4 +6 =10

10 +7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me check each step again.

First, 2024 in binary is 11111101000. Let's count the bits. Starting from right, the positions are 0 to 10.

So the bits set are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait wait, earlier I thought 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Yes, correct. So the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So m-1 is each of these exponents, so m is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11} as above. So the sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

Wait, but let me make sure that the number of B sets is indeed 2024 when A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So for each m in A, the number of B's where m is the maximum is 2^{m-1}.

So for m=4: 2^{3}=8.

m=6: 2^5=32.

m=7:2^6=64.

m=8:2^7=128.

m=9:2^8=256.

m=10:2^9=512.

m=11:2^{10}=1024.

Summing these up: 8 +32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024. Correct.

So yes, the total is indeed 2024. So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum is 55.

Therefore, the answer is 55.


Bob's list consists of all finite nonempty sets \( B \) where the maximum element belongs to Alice's set \( A \). For each \( m \in A \), the number of such sets \( B \) is \( 2^{m-1} \). The total number of sets is given as 2024, so we have:

\[
\sum_{m \in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024
\]

Expressing 2024 in binary, we find:

\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]

Each term \( 2^{m-1} \) corresponds to a power of 2 in this sum. Thus, \( m-1 \) equals the exponents in the binary representation, so \( m \) is each exponent plus 1. The exponents are 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, giving \( m = 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Therefore, \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

\boxed{55}
