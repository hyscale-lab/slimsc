Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem to solve. Let me see what I need to do here. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths:

- AB and CD are both √41.
- AC and BD are both √80.
- BC and AD are both √89.

And the question is about finding the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is such that all its distances to the four faces are equal. So, I think this point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter in a triangle, which is equidistant from all sides.

The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I need to find m + n + p.

Alright, so I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (which is the distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area.

So, my plan is to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V / S.

But wait, to compute V, I may need coordinates for the vertices. Since the edge lengths are given in a symmetric way, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points in 3D space such that the tetrahedron is symmetric, which might make calculations easier.

Let me think about how to place the tetrahedron. Maybe I can set the points in such a way that the midpoints and symmetry are maintained. Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors or some formula for volume given edge lengths. Hmm, but I don't recall a formula for volume directly from edge lengths without coordinates or angles.

Alternatively, since the edge lengths are symmetric, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. Let me check the edge lengths.

Wait, the given edges are such that opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So this is a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, perhaps a disphenoid.

Yes, right! A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, it's a disphenoid. I remember that in a disphenoid, there are some properties that could help in calculating the volume.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²))) / 72

Wait, no, that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Maybe that's the formula for a tetrahedron with three edges emanating from one vertex, but not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the
