Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. I remember that a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon, and it's regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon, so each internal angle is... let me think, the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n. For n=12, that's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. So each internal angle is 150 degrees. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem is about rectangles formed by sides or diagonals. So, I need to figure out how to choose four points on the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. But wait, not any four pointsâ€”specifically, the sides of the rectangle must lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Hmm, so each rectangle is defined by four points on the dodecagon, and the sides of the rectangle must be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, how can I approach this?

I know that in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized based on the number of vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, each side connects two adjacent vertices, then the next diagonal connects vertices with one vertex in between, and so on.

Let me think about the structure of a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of sides is n, and the number of diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But here, we're not just counting diagonals; we're looking for rectangles.

Wait, but rectangles are four-sided figures with all angles 90 degrees. So, in a regular dodecagon, which has 12 sides, how can four of its vertices form a rectangle?

I remember that in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed if the vertices are symmetrically placed. So, perhaps the key is to find sets of four points where opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles between adjacent sides are right angles.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all equal, but the diagonals can have different lengths based on how many vertices they skip. So, for a rectangle, the sides must be equal and the diagonals must be equal as well.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. Each side of the dodecagon can be represented as a vector of a certain length and direction. If I can find two vectors that are perpendicular, their combination can form the sides of a rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the coordinates of the dodecagon's vertices would help. Let's imagine placing the dodecagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin. Then, each vertex can be represented as (r*cos(theta), r
