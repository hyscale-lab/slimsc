We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation r such that r(S) is a subset of the red vertices (complement of S). This translates to r(S) \u2229 S = \u2205, meaning the blue set must be deranged by some rotation.\n\nAfter analyzing various cases, it's determined that the only favorable subsets are those of size 4 that consist of exactly one vertex from each of the four opposite pairs, leading to 16 such subsets, plus the empty set. Thus, there are 17 favorable subsets. \n\nEach subset corresponds to a unique coloring, so the probability is 17/256. Since 17 and 256 are coprime, the final answer is m + n = 17 + 256 = 273.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, the correct answer aligns with the initial reasoning where only the empty set and the 16 size 4 subsets are favorable, leading to a probability of 17/256. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{273}$"
