Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

Now, we're supposed to have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus, ABCD. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and whose diagonals bisect each other at right angles, I think? Or wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, that's an important property.

The problem says that the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and the diagonals cross each other at (0,0). So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, and being perpendicular.

Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of both diagonals is the origin. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the opposite point C must be (-x, -y), because the midpoint between A and C is (0,0). Similarly, points B and D must be such that their midpoint is also the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, so they satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But another approach is
