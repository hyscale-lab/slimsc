Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in a list. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The list of positive integers has three properties:
1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each condition one by one and see how they can help me figure out what the list looks like.

Starting with the mode. The unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. And it's the only mode, so no other number can appear the same number of times as 9. So, I need to have at least two 9s, but maybe more. Let's note that down.

Next, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers I choose, their total has to add up to 30.

Now, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, the median is a number not in the list? That's interesting. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is an integer that's not in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers has to be an integer not present in the list. If it's odd, then the middle number is an integer not present.

Wait, but if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. But the problem says the median doesn't appear in the list. So that can't be the case. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because the median would then be the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list.

Wait, let me think again. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So that's impossible. Therefore
