Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, and that symmetry might help in counting the rectangles.

Now, the problem mentions that the sides of the rectangle can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, unlike a typical rectangle where the sides are just straight lines, here they have to align with the existing edges or diagonals of the polygon.

I remember that in regular polygons, the number of sides and the lengths of diagonals can vary. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices via diagonals (since you can't connect a vertex to itself or its two adjacent vertices). But not all diagonals are the same length. The length depends on how many vertices apart they are. For example, in a dodecagon, each vertex connects to vertices two steps away, three steps, etc., up to five steps (since beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side due to the polygon being closed).

Wait, that might be useful. So, for a regular polygon with n sides, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2, but in this case, I think the diagonals can be categorized by their lengths, which depends on the step between connected vertices.

In a dodecagon (12-gon), the steps between vertices can be from 1 to 5. Because beyond 5 steps, it's the same as stepping backward from the other side. So, for example, stepping 6 positions from a vertex brings you to the vertex directly opposite, which is a diameter.

So, the diagonals can be categorized into different lengths based on the step size s, where s ranges from 1 (which is just the side length) up to 5. Wait, step size 6 is the diameter, which is the longest possible diagonal.

But in this problem, the sides of the rectangle can lie on either a side or a diagonal. So, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair should be either sides or diagonals of the polygon.

In a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of vertices between them is the same. For example, in a dodecagon, each side is parallel to the one three positions away because 12/4 = 3? Wait, maybe I need to think about this more carefully.

Wait, no. Let me think about a regular polygon and parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps. For a regular n-gon, two sides are parallel if they are k steps apart, where 2k = n. But wait, for a dodecagon, n=12. So 2k=12 would mean k=6. Hmm, but that's the diameter. So, each side is parallel to the side six steps away.

Wait, that might not be correct because when you have 12 sides, each side is parallel to the side six positions away. So, for each side, there's exactly one other side that's parallel to it, directly opposite.

But wait, that's only for sides that are directly opposite. What about diagonals? Diagonals can also be parallel if their step sizes are the same. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with a step size of 2 is parallel to another diagonal with the same step size but starting from a different vertex.

So, in a regular polygon, all diagonals with the same step size are parallel. So, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair having the same step size.

Therefore, to form a rectangle, I need to choose two different step sizes, each of which will form two opposite sides of the rectangle.

Wait, let me think again. A rectangle has two pairs of equal and parallel sides. So, in the context of the dodecagon, each pair must be a set of parallel lines (sides or diagonals). So, each pair of opposite sides of the rectangle must be either sides of the polygon or diagonals of a certain step size.

Thus, to form a rectangle, I need two distinct step sizes, s1 and s2, where s1 corresponds to one pair of sides and s2 corresponds to the other pair.

But wait, in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals are not all of the same length, so the angles between them vary. So, for a rectangle to be formed, not only do the sides have to be parallel, but the angles between the two different step sizes must be 90 degrees. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is determined by selecting two pairs of parallel lines, each pair with the same step size, and the angle between the two
