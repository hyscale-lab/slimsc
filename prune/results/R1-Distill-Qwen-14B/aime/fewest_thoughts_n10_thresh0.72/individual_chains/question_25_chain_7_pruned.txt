Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. I need to find out how many people own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let me list out all the given information:

- Total residents: 900
- Number owning a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number owning golf clubs (G): 367
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so that's 900.

Wait, since everyone has a bag of candy hearts, that might simplify things because C is universal. So, everyone in Aimeville owns at least a candy heart. So, when considering overlaps, we can think of C as being present in every case.

Now, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. And we need to find those who own all four.

I remember that in set theory, the principle of inclusion-exclusion can be used to solve such problems. The formula for four sets would be a bit complex, but maybe I can approach this by considering the overlaps.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since everyone owns C, the presence of C might make some terms easier. Let me think about this.

Since C is universal, any intersection involving C will automatically include that element. So, for example, D∩C is just D because everyone has C. Similarly, G∩C is G, and S∩C is S. Also, any three-way intersection involving C is just the other two sets. For example, D∩G∩C is just D∩G because C is already included.

Wait, that's a good point. So, D∩C is D, which is 195. Similarly, G∩C is G, 367. S∩C is S, 562. So, when I subtract all the pairwise intersections, I'm subtracting D∩G, D∩S, G∩S, and also D∩C, G∩C, S∩C, which are D, G, S themselves. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about how the given numbers fit into the inclusion-exclusion formula. The problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two and exactly three of the items. Wait, but all four includes all four, which is what we're trying to find.

But since C is universal, perhaps the way to approach this is to model the problem with the three items D, G, S, and consider that C is always there. So, perhaps the problem reduces to finding how many people own D, G, S, and C, but since C is always owned, it's equivalent to finding those who own D, G, and S, and thus automatically have C.

Wait, no. Because in the problem, the four items are D, G, S, and C. So, in reality, the four-way intersection would be the people owning all four. But since C is always present, the four-way intersection is the same as the three-way intersection of D, G, S. So, perhaps the number of people owning all four is equal to the number of people owning D, G, and S.

Wait, that's a key point. Let me formalize this.

Since every resident owns C, then for any set of items, if someone owns D, G, and S, they
