Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the given information.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by drawing a rough diagram in my mind. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. The points D, E, C, F being collinear suggests that they lie on a straight line. So, maybe E is somewhere on DC or CF? Or perhaps E is extending from D or C? I'm not sure yet.

Given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that must mean that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, maybe ABCD and EFGH are positioned such that ADHG is cyclic.

Let me jot down the given lengths:

- BC = 16: Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of its sides. So, BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107.
- AB = 107: That's the length of the side AB in rectangle ABCD.
- FG = 17: In rectangle EFGH, FG is one of the sides, so FG = EH = 17.
- EF = 184: That's the length of the other side of rectangle EFGH, so EF = GH = 184.

So, rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16, and rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think E must be somewhere between D and C, and F is another point on that line. Alternatively, maybe E is beyond D or C. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the points are A, B, C, D in order, forming a rectangle. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me try to visualize this.

If D, E, C, F are collinear, then E is probably between D and C, and F is another point beyond C, such that D-E-C-F are in a straight line. So, the line DC is extended beyond C to point F, and E is somewhere between D and C.

Alternatively, E could be beyond D, but that might complicate the cyclic quadrilateral. Let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral part.

Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AB is 107 and BC is 16. Similarly, EFGH will have EF = 184 and FG =17.

Let me try to sketch the situation mentally. Let me consider points:

- ABCD: A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left.
- EFGH: E is top-left, F is top-right, G is bottom-right, H is bottom-left.

But wait, the problem says A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is from rectangle ABCD, and H, G are from rectangle EFGH.

Hmm, perhaps the two rectangles share some orientation or are placed such that these points lie on a circle.

Since A, D, H, G are on a circle, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, angle at A plus angle at H should be 180 degrees, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the lengths of the diagon
