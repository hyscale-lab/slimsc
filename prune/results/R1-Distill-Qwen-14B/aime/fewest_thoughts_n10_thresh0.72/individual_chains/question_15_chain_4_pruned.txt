Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, changing direction exactly four times. Each path has a length of 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid would require moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Each path is a lattice path moving only right or up. So, a path that goes from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes. Wait, direction changes would be when the path switches from going right to up or vice versa.

So, if the path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five segments? Because each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. For example, if you start going right, then change to up, then right again, etc., each change adds a new segment.

Wait, but wait. If a path has four direction changes, how many segments does it have? Let me think. Starting direction is one segment, then each change adds another. So, four changes would result in five segments. So, the path is composed of five straight lines, each either all right or all up.

Each segment must consist of at least one step, right? You can't have a segment with zero steps. So, each of these five segments must have at least one step either to the right or up.

Now, the total number of right moves needed is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8. So, I need to distribute these 8 right moves into the right segments and the 8 up moves into the up segments.

But wait, the direction of the segments alternates. Because each time you change direction, you switch from right to up or up to right. So, the path alternates between right and up segments. But how does this affect the distribution?

Let me think. The path starts either with a right or an up move. If it starts with right, then the segments alternate as R, U, R, U, etc. Similarly, if it starts with up, the segments alternate as U, R, U, R, etc.

Given that there are five segments, each path must have either three right segments and two up segments, or three up segments and two right segments. Wait, because if you start with R, the segments will be
