Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The hexagon is convex and equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length, and all its internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property because it tells me the hexagon is something called a "zonogon," but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. 

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably visualize this hexagon and the triangle formed by extending its sides.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF would meet to form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions of these sides won't overlap but will meet at some points outside the hexagon, forming a larger triangle.

I remember that in such hexagons, especially when opposite sides are parallel, there's a relationship between the side lengths of the hexagon and the sides of the triangle formed by the extended sides. But I can't recall the exact formula, so I need to derive it.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's'. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side to the opposite side.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, each of these sides is extended beyond the hexagon, and they intersect to form a triangle. Let's denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. I need to find how 's' relates to these sides.

I think this problem is related to similar triangles. Maybe the triangle T is similar to some smaller triangles inside or around the hexagon. Alternatively, the sides of triangle T could be proportional to the sides of the hexagon, but scaled by some factor.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can express the sides of the triangle in terms of 's'.

Let's assume that the hexagon is in a plane, and we can set up a coordinate system. Let me assign point A at the origin (0,0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can model it as a translation of each side.

But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the concept of similar triangles and the properties of the hexagon.

In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, each extension of a side will meet another side's extension at a point relative to the hexagon's structure. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a "prism" with a certain scaling.

Wait, another idea: maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is related to the hexagon's sides through some proportion. If the triangle has sides 200,
