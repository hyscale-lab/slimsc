Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The distance she walks is always 9 kilometers. The first scenario has her walking at a speed of s km/h and takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks at s + 2 km/h, taking her 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, so the total time given includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. That means the time spent walking alone is the total time minus t minutes. But I don't know t yet. So maybe I can set up equations based on the walking time and then solve for s and t.

Let me write down what I know:

1. When speed is s km/h, total time is 4 hours. So, walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours. But I need to make sure all units are consistent. Since speed is in km/h, time should be in hours. So, t minutes would be t/60 hours.

2. When speed is s + 2 km/h, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Converting 24 minutes to hours is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours. Again, walking time plus t minutes equals 2.4 hours. So walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours.

Wait, but walking time is distance divided by speed. So for the first scenario, walking time is 9 km / s km/h. And that equals to (4 hours - t/60 hours). So, 9/s = 4 - t/60.

Similarly, for the second scenario, walking time is 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60.

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - t/60
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

Hmm, so we have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these simultaneously.

Let me denote t/60 as, say, x. So, x = t/60.

Then the equations become:

1. 9/s = 4 - x
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

So now I have:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - x  
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate x.

So, (9/s) - (9/(s + 2)) = (4 - x) - (2.4 - x)  
Simplify the right side: 4 - x - 2.4 + x = 1.6

Left side: 9/s - 9/(s + 2)  
Factor out 9: 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]  
Which is 9 [ (s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2)) ]  
Simplify numerator: 2  
So, 9 * [ 2 / (s(s + 2)) ] = 18 / (s(s + 2)).

So, 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6  
Now, solve for s.

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 1.6 to simplify:

18 / 1.6 = s(s + 2)

Calculate 18 divided by 1.6:  
1.6 goes into 18 how many times?

1.6 * 11 = 17.6  
18 - 17.6 = 0.4  
So 11.25 because 1.6 * 0.25 = 0.4.  
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 18 / 1.6:

1.6 is 8/5, so dividing by 1.6 is the same as multiplying by 5/8.

18 * (5/8) =
