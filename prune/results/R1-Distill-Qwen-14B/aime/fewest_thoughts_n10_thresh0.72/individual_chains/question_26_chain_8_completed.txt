Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So the triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me sketch this mentally. Point A is connected to B (length 5), B to C (length 9), and C back to A (length 10). So triangle ABC is a scalene triangle.

Now, the circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. So all three points lie on ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length, so DB equals DC. That must be useful.

Then, connecting A to D, this line AD intersects ω again at P. So AP is a chord of the circle starting at A and passing through D to reach P.

I think I should probably use some properties of circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. Let me recall some relevant theorems.

First, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to the circle ω. Alternatively, I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the external point from which tangents are drawn.

Another thing I remember is the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since D lies outside the circle, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = (length of tangent)^2. 

Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, by the power of point A with respect to ω, we have that AP * AD = (power of A, but wait, A is on the circle, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, that might not help directly.

Wait, but point D is outside, so maybe using power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because DA is a secant from D passing through P and A, so the power should be DP * DA = DB².

So, if I can find DA, then I can express DP as DB² / DA. But I don't know DA yet. Alternatively, maybe express AP in terms of AD and DP.

Wait, AP is the length from A to P. Since A is on the circle and P is another intersection point, AP is a chord. So, if I can find the length AD, then since AP = AD - DP? No, wait, AD is from A to D, and P is between A and D, right? Because the line AD starts at A, goes through P, and then ends at D. So AP is part of AD, specifically, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So AD = AP + PD.

But according to the power of D, DP * DA = DB². So, substituting DA = AP + DP, we have DP * (AP + DP) = DB².

Let me write that equation down:

DP * (AP + DP) = DB².

Let me denote AP as x. Then PD = AD - AP = (AD) - x. Wait, no. Wait, actually, since D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, the line AD goes from D through A and then intersects the circle again at P. Wait, no, that would mean that P is beyond A from D's perspective. Wait, no, that can't be because A is on the circle, so the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle at P. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because A is already on the circle. So, from D, the line goes through A and then intersects the circle again at P. So, the order is D, then A, then P. Wait, but A is on the circle, so does the line AD pass through A (on the circle) and then go to P, another point on the circle? That would mean that D, A, P are colinear with D outside, A on the circle, and P on the circle beyond A. But that would mean that DA is the tangent or secant?

Wait, maybe I have the order wrong. Maybe the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P beyond D. Hmm, but D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so D is outside the circle. Therefore, the line AD must pass through D, which is outside the circle, so starting at A, going through D, and then intersecting the circle again at P on the other side. Wait, no, because A is on the circle. So starting from A, going towards D (outside the circle), then passing through D and then exiting the circle on the other side at P. Wait, that would mean that the line AD passes through A, D, and P, with D outside the circle and P on the opposite side from A. Therefore, the order is A, D, P? Or A, P, D?

Wait, no, D is the external point. So line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes towards D (external point), and then exits the circle again at P beyond D. So the order is A, then P, then D. So AP is part of AD, and PD is the rest. So AD = AP + PD. So, yes, using the power of point D, DA * DP = DB².

Wait, no, hold on. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², and also, since AD is a secant from D passing through P and A, the power is DP * DA = DB².

But wait, in the standard formula, the power of D is equal to DP * DQ, where DP and DQ are the lengths from D to the two intersection points. Wait, but AD is from D to A, which is on the circle, and then from A to P, which is another point on the circle. So the two intersection points are A and P. Therefore, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, let me clarify: If a line passes through D and intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y, then the power is DX * DY. In this case, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P. So DP (distance from D to P) multiplied by DA (distance from D to A) equals DB².

So, DP * DA = DB².

But DA is the distance from D to A, which is longer than DP because P is closer to D than A is. Wait no, that depends on the order. Wait, if the line is D----P----A, then DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is the distance from D to A, which is DP + PA. So, in that case, DP * (DP + PA) = DB².

If I let AP = x, then PA = x, DA = DP + x. So, the equation becomes DP * (DP + x) = DB².

But I don't know DP or DB yet. So I need another equation to relate these variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can find DB first. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. The length of the tangent from D to ω is equal for both points B and C.

Wait, the length of the tangent from D to ω is equal to DB and DC. So, if I can find the length of DB, that would help.

But how do I find DB? Maybe using the fact that triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10, and from that, I can find the circumradius R of triangle ABC. Then, using properties of the ex-tangent point D, I can find DB in terms of R and the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe use coordinates. Let me consider placing the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to compute the necessary lengths.

Let me try that approach.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A on the x-axis at (10,0), since AC is 10 units. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10.

So, coordinates:

C = (0,0)

A = (10, 0)

We need to find coordinates of B such that AB = 5 and BC = 9.

So, let me denote B = (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is √(x² + y²) = 9, so x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is √((x - 10)² + y²) = 5, so (x -10)² + y² = 25.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(x -10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81

Expanding (x -10)^2 = x² -20x +100, so:

x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56

Simplify: -20x +100 = -56

So, -20x = -156 → x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x = 39/5.

Then, from x² + y² = 81,

(39/5)^2 + y² = 81

Calculate (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521; 1521/25 = 60.84

So, 60.84 + y² = 81 → y² = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16 → y = sqrt(20.16) = 4.489 approximately.

So, point B is at (7.8, 4.489). Let me write it as fractions to be precise.

39/5 is 7.8. y² is 81 - (39/5)^2 = 81 - 1521/25.

Convert 81 to 25ths: 81 = 2025/25.

So y² = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504).

504 = 16 * 31.5? No, let me factor it.

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 = 63

63 ÷ 3 =21

21 ÷3 =7.

So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7.

So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2) *3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, wait: 2^3 is 8, so sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2). 3^2 is 9, sqrt(9) is 3. So overall sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*9*7)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14). Wait, that can't be right because 6*sqrt(14) squared is 36*14=504. Yes, correct.

So y = sqrt(504)/5 = (6√14)/5. So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A = (10, 0)

B = (39/5, 6√14/5)

C = (0, 0)

Now, we can compute the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

The circumcircle can be found using the circumradius formula or by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the circumradius R.

Circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area.

Given sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Compute the area Δ using Heron's formula.

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Δ = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = 6√14.

So R = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14).

Compute numerator: 5*9=45; 45*10=450.

Denominator:4*6=24; 24√14.

So R = 450/(24√14) = (450/24)/√14 = (75/4)/√14.

Rationalize denominator: (75/4)/√14 = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm, that's the circumradius.

Now, the point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. To find D, perhaps we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C and then find their intersection.

First, find the equation of the tangent at B.

To find the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the formula that the tangent at point (x1, y1) on the circle with center (h, k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R². Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line is given by (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R², but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the equation of the tangent at (x1, y1) on the circle is:

If the circle has center (h, k), then the tangent at (x1, y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R²? No, wait, that's not correct. The standard equation for the tangent line at (x1, y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2 is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, actually, no, that's the equation for the circle itself. To get the tangent line, it's better to use the point-slope form.

Alternatively, the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the slope of the radius from center to B is (y_B - k)/(x_B - h), and the slope of the tangent is the negative reciprocal.

Hmm, let's first find the center of the circle ω.

The circumcircle of triangle ABC passes through points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), and C(0,0).

Let me find the circumcircle's equation. Let the center be at (h, k), and the radius R.

The equation is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2.

We can plug in the three points to get three equations:

1) For point C(0,0):

(0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = R² → h² + k² = R².

2) For point A(10,0):

(10 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = R² → (10 - h)^2 + k² = R².

3) For point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5 - h)^2 + (6√14/5 - k)^2 = R².

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(10 - h)^2 + k² - (h² + k²) = 0 → (100 - 20h + h²) - h² = 0 → 100 - 20h = 0 → 20h = 100 → h = 5.

So the x-coordinate of the center is 5.

Now plug h=5 into equation 1: 5² + k² = R² → 25 + k² = R².

Now, plug h=5 into equation 3:

(39/5 - 5)^2 + (6√14/5 - k)^2 = R².

Compute 39/5 -5: 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So first term: (14/5)^2 = 196/25.

Second term: (6√14/5 -k)^2.

So equation becomes:

196/25 + (6√14/5 - k)^2 = R².

But R² = 25 + k² from equation 1.

So:

196/25 + (6√14/5 -k)^2 = 25 + k².

Let me expand the left side:

196/25 + ( (6√14/5)^2 - 2*(6√14/5)*k + k² ) = 25 + k².

Compute (6√14/5)^2: (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

So:

196/25 + 504/25 - (12√14/5)k + k² = 25 + k².

Simplify:

(196 + 504)/25 - (12√14/5)k + k² = 25 + k².

700/25 = 28.

So:

28 - (12√14/5)k + k² = 25 + k².

Subtract 25 + k² from both sides:

3 - (12√14/5)k = 0.

So, 3 = (12√14/5)k → k = (3 *5)/(12√14) = (15)/(12√14) = (5)/(4√14).

Rationalize denominator: (5√14)/(4*14) = (5√14)/56.

So the center is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, we had:

196/25 + (6√14/5 -k)^2 = 25 + k².

Expanding the square:

= 196/25 + ( (6√14/5)^2 - 2*(6√14/5)*k + k² ) = 25 + k².

Compute 6√14/5 squared: (6²)*(√14)^2 /5² = 36*14/25 = 504/25.

So,

196/25 + 504/25 - (12√14/5)k + k² = 25 + k².

Adding 196 and 504: 700.

700/25 = 28.

So,

28 - (12√14/5)k + k² = 25 + k².

Subtract 25 + k² from both sides:

3 - (12√14/5)k = 0.

So,

(12√14/5)k = 3 → k = 3*(5)/(12√14) = (15)/(12√14) = (5)/(4√14).

Yes, that's correct. Then rationalizing:

k = (5√14)/(4*14) = (5√14)/56.

So center is at (5, 5√14/56). Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, R² = h² + k² = 5² + (5√14/56)^2.

Compute 5² =25.

(5√14/56)^2 = (25*14)/(56²) = 350/(3136) = 25/224.

So R² =25 + 25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 =25*(224 +1)/224 =25*225/224 = (625*9)/224=5625/224.

Wait, but earlier we found R as (75√14)/56. Let's check R squared.

(75√14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/(3136) = 78750/3136.

Simplify: numerator and denominator divided by 14: 78750 ÷14 = 5625, 3136 ÷14=224.

So R² =5625/224. Which matches with 25*225/224. So, correct.

So, the center is at (5, 5√14/56), R squared is 5625/224.

Now, the tangent at point B(39/5, 6√14/5) has the equation.

The tangent at point (x1, y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R² is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line at (x1,y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the tangent line can be found using the point-form. For a circle with center (h,k), the tangent at (x1,y1) is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the equation of the tangent line is indeed (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, let me test that. Let me plug in (x1,y1) into the left side:

(x1 -h)(x1 -h) + (y1 -k)(y1 -k) = (x1 -h)^2 + (y1 -k)^2 = R². So yes, it satisfies the equation, meaning that (x1,y1) lies on the line, which makes sense.

So, the tangent at B is:

(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6√14/5 -5√14/56)(y -5√14/56) = R².

Wait, let me compute each part.

First, compute (39/5 -5):

39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

So the first term is (14/5)(x -5).

Second term: (6√14/5 -5√14/56).

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56:

Convert to common denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = (336√14)/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 = (25√14)/280.

So, 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = (336 -25)√14 /280 = 311√14/280.

So, the second term is (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56).

So, the equation is:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56) = R².

But R² is 5625/224.

So, let me write the equation as:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56) = 5625/224.

This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to find the equation of the tangent using point-slope form.

Alternatively, since the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center (5,5√14/56).

So, the slope of OB is (6√14/5 -5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Let me compute that slope.

First, compute the denominator: 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

Numerator: 6√14/5 -5√14/56.

Let me convert to a common denominator, which is 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 =336√14/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 =25√14/280.

So, 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280.

So, the slope of OB is (311√14/280) / (14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14).

Simplify denominator:280*14=3920.

So, slope of OB is (1555√14)/3920.

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 5: numerator is 311√14, denominator is 784.

So, m_OB = 311√14 / 784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of this.

Slope of tangent at B: m_tangent_B = -784/(311√14).

Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

= (-784√14)/(311*14) = (-784√14)/(4354).

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 14:

784 ÷14=56; 4354 ÷14=311.

So, m_tangent_B = -56√14 /311.

So, the equation of the tangent at B is:

(y - y_B) = m_tangent_B (x - x_B).

Where y_B =6√14/5, x_B=39/5.

So,

y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C is easier since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.

Slope of OC: from center (5,5√14/56) to (0,0).

Slope is (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0) = (5√14/56)/5 = √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify: -56/√14 = -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So, the tangent at C is a line with slope -4√14 passing through (0,0).

So, equation is y = -4√14 x.

Now, to find point D, the intersection of the two tangents at B and C.

We have the equations:

1) From tangent at C: y = -4√14 x.

2) From tangent at B: y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let me substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2.

So,

(-4√14 x) -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let me factor out √14 on the left:

√14*(-4x -6/5) = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

We can divide both sides by √14:

-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

311*(-4x -6/5) = -56(x -39/5).

Compute left side:

-1244x - (311*6)/5 = -56x + (56*39)/5.

Simplify:

-1244x - (1866)/5 = -56x + (2184)/5.

Bring all terms to the left:

-1244x +56x - (1866)/5 -2184/5 =0.

Combine like terms:

(-1244 +56)x + (-1866 -2184)/5 =0.

Compute:

-1188x - (4050)/5 =0 → -1188x -810=0.

So,

-1188x =810 → x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify the fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 ÷9=90, 1188 ÷9=132.

So x= -90/132. Divide numerator and denominator by 6: -15/22.

So x= -15/22.

Now, substitute x into equation 1 (y= -4√14 x):

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point A at (10,0) and point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11). We need to find the equation of line AD and find its other intersection point P with the circumcircle ω.

But since we need AP, which is from A to P on the circle, maybe it's better to parametrize the line AD and find where it intersects the circle again.

Alternatively, since P lies on ω and on line AD, we can parametrize AD and substitute into the circle equation.

First, let's find the parametric equations for line AD.

Point A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22, 30√14/11).

The vector from A to D is D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0) = (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + t*(-235/22)

y=0 + t*(30√14/11)

Where t=0 corresponds to A, t=1 corresponds to D.

We need to find point P on line AD beyond D, but since P is another intersection with the circle, which is beyond D from A, but since D is outside the circle, the line AD passes through A, then through P on the circle, then goes to D. Wait, no, because A is on the circle, so starting from A, going towards D (outside), the line AD will intersect the circle again at P on the other side of A. So P is between A and D.

Wait, no, because D is outside, so line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through P (another point on the circle), and then continues to D. So P is between A and D.

So, parametrize with t from 0 to 1, where t=0 is A, t=1 is D, so P is somewhere between t=0 and t=1.

But since A is on the circle, the other intersection point P must be at a t between 0 and 1.

Let me plug the parametric equations into the circle equation to find t.

The circle equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = 5625/224.

Substitute x and y:

[10 - (235/22) t -5]^2 + [ (30√14/11) t -5√14/56 ]^2 = 5625/224.

Simplify each term.

First term: [10 -5 - (235/22) t]^2 = [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Second term: [ (30√14/11) t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Let me factor √14 from the second term:

√14 [ (30/11) t -5/56 ].

So, [√14 ( (30/11)t -5/56 )]^2 =14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

So, the equation becomes:

[5 - (235/22)t]^2 +14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 ) =5625/224.

Let me compute each part.

Compute [5 - (235/22)t]^2:

=25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t²

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484)t²

Simplify:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Compute 14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 ):

First, compute the square inside:

(30/11 t -5/56)^2 = (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2.

Compute each term:

(30/11 t)^2 =900/121 t²

-2*(30/11 t)*(5/56)= -2*(150/(11*56))t = -300/(616) t = -75/154 t.

(5/56)^2=25/3136.

So, (30/11 t -5/56)^2 =900/121 t² -75/154 t +25/3136.

Multiply by 14:

14*(900/121 t² -75/154 t +25/3136) = (14*900)/121 t² - (14*75)/154 t + (14*25)/3136.

Compute each term:

14*900=12600; 12600/121 =12600/121.

14*75=1050; 1050/154 = 1050 ÷14=75; 75/11.

14*25=350; 350/3136=350 ÷14=25; 25/224.

So, the second term becomes:

12600/121 t² -75/11 t +25/224.

Now, add both terms together:

First term:25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t²

Second term:+12600/121 t² -75/11 t +25/224

Total equation:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t² +12600/121 t² -75/11 t +25/224 =5625/224.

Combine like terms.

Constant terms:25 +25/224.

t terms: - (1175/11 +75/11 )t = -1250/11 t.

t² terms: (55225/484 +12600/121 ) t².

Compute each:

Constant term:

25 +25/224 = (25*224 +25)/224 = (5600 +25)/224=5625/224.

t terms: -1250/11 t.

t² terms:

55225/484 +12600/121.

Convert 12600/121 to denominator 484: 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(121*4)=50400/484.

So total t²: (55225 +50400)/484=105625/484.

So, the equation becomes:

5625/224 -1250/11 t + (105625/484)t² =5625/224.

Subtract 5625/224 from both sides:

-1250/11 t + (105625/484) t² =0.

Factor out t:

t*(-1250/11 + (105625/484) t )=0.

Solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution:

-1250/11 + (105625/484) t =0 → (105625/484) t =1250/11 → t= (1250/11) * (484/105625).

Simplify:

1250 and 105625: 105625 ÷1250=84.5. Wait, let me compute 105625 ÷1250.

1250*84=105000, 105625-105000=625, 625/1250=0.5, so total 84.5=169/2.

So,

t=(1250/11)*(484/105625)= (1250 *484)/(11*105625).

Compute numerator:1250 *484.

1250=125*10=25*5*10.

484=22²=4*121.

So,

1250 *484= (25*5*10)*(4*121)=25*4 *5*10 *121=100 *50 *121=5000*121=605,000.

Denominator:11*105625= 1151875.

So,

t=605000 /1151875.

Simplify the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25:

605000 ÷25=24200; 1151875 ÷25=46075.

24200/46075.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25 again:

24200 ÷25=968; 46075 ÷25=1843.

968/1843.

Check if 968 and 1843 have a common factor.

Compute GCD(968,1843). Let's see:

1843 ÷968=1 with remainder 875.

968 ÷875=1 with remainder 93.

875 ÷93=9 with remainder 28.

93 ÷28=3 with remainder 9.

28 ÷9=3 with remainder 1.

9 ÷1=9 with remainder 0.

So GCD is 1.

Therefore, t=968/1843.

So, the point P is parameter t=968/1843 along the line AD.

Therefore, to find point P, we can plug t=968/1843 into the parametric equations.

Compute x:

x=10 + t*(-235/22) =10 - (235/22)*(968/1843).

Compute y:

y=0 + t*(30√14/11)= (30√14/11)*(968/1843).

But since we need the length AP, which is the distance from A(10,0) to P(x,y).

Alternatively, since the parametric equations are linear, the distance from A to P is |t| times the length of vector AD. Since t is between 0 and1, AP = t * |AD|.

Wait, yes, because in parametric terms, t is the fraction along the vector from A to D. So, if t=968/1843, then AP = t * |AD|.

So, let's compute |AD|.

Point A is (10,0), point D is (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the distance AD:

√[( (-15/22 -10)^2 + (30√14/11 -0)^2 )].

Compute each component:

Δx= -15/22 -220/22= (-235)/22.

Δy=30√14/11.

So,

AD=√[ ( (-235/22)^2 + (30√14/11)^2 ) ].

Compute each square:

(-235/22)^2= (235)^2/(22)^2=55225/484.

(30√14/11)^2=900*14 / 121=12600/121.

So,

AD=√[55225/484 +12600/121].

Convert 12600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by4: 50400/484.

So,

AD=√[55225/484 +50400/484 ]=√[105625/484]=√[ (325)^2 / (22)^2 ]=325/22.

So, AD=325/22.

Therefore, AP= t * AD= (968/1843) * (325/22).

Simplify:

Compute (968 *325)/(1843*22).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, note that 1843 and 968: let's see if they have a common factor. Earlier, we found GCD(968,1843)=1, so no common factors.

Similarly, 325 and 22: GCD is 1.

So, let's compute 968*325.

Compute 968 *300=290,400.

Compute 968*25=24,200.

Total=290,400 +24,200=314,600.

Denominator:1843*22=40,546.

So,

AP=314600 /40546.

Simplify this fraction.

Let's find GCD(314600,40546).

Compute GCD(40546,314600).

314600 ÷40546=7 times 40546=283,822. Subtract:314600-283822=30,778.

Now GCD(40546,30778).

40546 ÷30778=1 with remainder 9768.

GCD(30778,9768).

30778 ÷9768=3 times 9768=29,304. Subtract:30778-29304=1474.

GCD(9768,1474).

9768 ÷1474=6 times 1474=8844. Subtract:9768-8844=924.

GCD(1474,924).

1474 ÷924=1 with remainder 550.

GCD(924,550).

924 ÷550=1 with remainder 374.

GCD(550,374).

550 ÷374=1 with remainder 176.

GCD(374,176).

374 ÷176=2 with remainder 22.

GCD(176,22).

176 ÷22=8 with remainder 0. So GCD is 22.

So, GCD(314600,40546)=22.

Therefore, divide numerator and denominator by22:

314600 ÷22=14300.

40546 ÷22=1843.

So AP=14300/1843.

Check if 14300 and1843 have common factors.

1843 ÷14300=0. So compute GCD(14300,1843).

14300 ÷1843=7 times 1843=12,901. Subtract:14300-12901=1399.

GCD(1843,1399).

1843 ÷1399=1 with remainder 444.

GCD(1399,444).

1399 ÷444=3 times 444=1332. Subtract:1399-1332=67.

GCD(444,67).

444 ÷67=6 times 67=402. Subtract:444-402=42.

GCD(67,42).

67 ÷42=1 with remainder25.

GCD(42,25).

42 ÷25=1 with remainder17.

GCD(25,17).

25 ÷17=1 with remainder8.

GCD(17,8).

17 ÷8=2 with remainder1.

GCD(8,1).

GCD is1.

So, 14300 and1843 are coprime. So AP=14300/1843.

Wait, but 14300 ÷1843: 1843*7=12,901; 14300-12901=1399; which is as above.

So, the fraction is reduced as much as possible:14300/1843.

But wait, is that correct? Because AP is the length from A to P, which is a part of AD, which we found to be 325/22. But 14300/1843 is approximately 7.76, whereas 325/22≈14.77, so AP is less than AD, which makes sense.

Wait, but 14300/1843 is approximately 7.76, which is less than 14.77.

Wait, but let me verify if 14300/1843 is correct.

Wait, let's compute 968/1843 *325/22.

(968 *325)/(1843*22)= as above, 314600/40546=14300/1843.

Yes.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy, and perhaps I made a computational error somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without coordinates.

Let me think again.

We have triangle ABC with sides 5,9,10.

We have point D as the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

We can use the harmonic division or some properties of poles and polars.

Alternatively, using inversion, but that might be overkill.

Wait, perhaps using power of a point.

From point D, the power with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

We can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the length of the tangent from D to ω is DB=DC.

We can relate DB to the sides of the triangle.

There's a formula for the length of the tangent from the ex-pole D to the circumcircle.

Wait, the length DB can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle ABC.

I recall that in a triangle, the length of the tangent from the ex-pole (the intersection of tangents at B and C) is given by DB= (a)/(2 sin (A/2)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, since ABC has sides 5,9,10, we can compute angles using the Law of Cosines.

Let me compute angle at A, angle BAC.

Using Law of Cosines:

cos A = (b² +c² -a²)/(2bc).

Here, sides:

In triangle ABC, let me denote BC=a=9, AC=b=10, AB=c=5.

So, angle at A is angle BAC.

cos A=(AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2 AB * AC )= (5² +10² -9²)/(2*5*10)= (25 +100 -81)/100=(44)/100=11/25.

So, cos A=11/25, so sin A=√(1 - (121/625))=√(504/625)=√504/25= (6√14)/25.

So, sin A=6√14/25.

Now, in triangle ABC, the circumradius R= (a)/(2 sin A)=9/(2*(6√14/25))=9/(12√14/25)=9*(25)/(12√14)= (225)/(12√14)=75/(4√14)= which matches what we found earlier:75√14/56 after rationalizing.

Now, the point D is the ex-pole, so DB=DC=?

Wait, in triangle ABC, the length of the tangent from D to ω is DB=DC= (R)/(sin (A/2)).

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, using properties of the ex-pole.

Wait, another approach: The polar of point D with respect to ω is the line BC, because D lies on the tangents at B and C.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use inversion.

Alternatively, use power of point D: DB²=DP * DA.

We can find DB in terms of R and angle A.

Wait, maybe use trigonometric identities.

In triangle ABC, the distance from D to the circumcircle can be related to the angles.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distance from D to A.

Alternatively, since we've already computed DB, maybe we can find DB in terms of R and angle.

Wait, using some formula.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the ex-pole D lies on the A-exsymmedian.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates was the right approach, even though it was tedious.

Wait, but in my coordinate approach, I found AP=14300/1843. Let me check if this reduces.

Wait, numerator:14300=100*143=100*11*13.

Denominator:1843.

Check if 1843 is divisible by 11: 1+4+3=8, 8-8=0? Wait, 1843 ÷11: 11*167=1837, 1843-1837=6. No.

1843 ÷13:13*141=1833, 1843-1833=10. No.

1843 ÷7: 7*263=1841, 1843-1841=2. No.

1843 ÷17: 17*108=1836, 1843-1836=7. No.

1843 ÷19: 19*97=1843. Yes, because 19*90=1710, 19*7=133; 1710+133=1843.

So, 1843=19*97.

Now, check if 19 or97 divide 14300.

14300 ÷19: 19*750=14250, 14300-14250=50, which is 19*2+12, so no.

14300 ÷97: 97*147=14259, 14300-14259=41, which is not a multiple of97. So, no.

So, AP=14300/1843= (100*143)/(19*97). Since 143=11*13, so the reduced form is (100*11*13)/(19*97). No common factors, so m=14300, n=1843, m +n=14300+1843=16143.

Wait, but 14300 and1843 have a GCD of 1? Earlier, when I computed GCD(14300,1843), I think it was 1, yes.

But this seems like a very large fraction, and the problem says "AP can be written as the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime integers."

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate calculations.

Wait, let me think differently.

Using power of point D: DB²=DP * DA.

We have DB=DC. Let me find DB.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the ex-pole D has DB=DC.

We can use the formula for the length of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB= (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) * (1/(sin(A/2))).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, use coordinates.

Wait, in the coordinate system, we found D at (-15/22,30√14/11), and A at (10,0), so the distance AD is 325/22, as computed earlier.

The power of D is DB².

Compute DB: distance from D to B.

Point D=(-15/22,30√14/11), point B=(39/5,6√14/5).

Compute Δx=39/5 - (-15/22)=39/5 +15/22= (858 +75)/110=933/110.

Δy=6√14/5 -30√14/11= (66√14 -150√14)/55= (-84√14)/55.

So, DB²= (933/110)^2 + (-84√14/55)^2.

Compute each term:

(933/110)^2= (933)^2/(110)^2.

933^2: 900^2=810000, 33^2=1089, 2*900*33=59400. So, 810000 +59400 +1089=869489.

So, (933/110)^2=869489/12100.

(-84√14/55)^2= (84)^2 *14 / (55)^2=7056*14 /3025=98784/3025.

So, DB²=869489/12100 +98784/3025.

Convert to common denominator 12100:

98784/3025= (98784*4)/12100=395,136/12100.

So,

DB²=869489/12100 +395136/12100= (869489 +395136)/12100=1,264,625/12100.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1,264,625 ÷25=50,585; 12100 ÷25=484.

So, 50,585/484.

Check if 50,585 and484 have common factors.

484=22²=4*121.

50,585 ÷5=10,117. So, 50,585=5*10,117.

Check if 10,117 is divisible by 11: 1+1+7=9, 0+1=1, difference 8, not divisible by 11.

Check if 10,117 ÷13: 13*778=10,114, remainder 3. Not divisible.

10,117 ÷7=1445.285… nope.

So, 50,585=5*10,117, and 484=4*121. No common factors.

So, DB²=50585/484.

So, DP * DA=50585/484.

But DA=325/22.

So, DP * (325/22)=50585/484.

Solve for DP:

DP= (50585/484) / (325/22)= (50585/484)*(22/325).

Simplify:

50585 ÷325=155.63. Wait, let me compute 325*155=50,375. 50585-50,375=210. So 50585=325*155 +210.

Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator.

50585=5*10117.

325=5*5*13.

22=2*11.

484=4*121=4*11².

So,

DP= (5*10117)/(4*121) ) * (2*11)/(5*5*13).

Simplify:

Cancel 5: numerator has 5, denominator has5*5.

Cancel one 5: numerator remains 10117, denominator has5.

Cancel 11: numerator has 11, denominator has 121=11².

So,

DP= (10117/ (4*11)) * (2)/(5*13).

Because 484=4*121, and 121=11². So, 4*121=4*11².

Wait, let me re-express:

DP= (5*10117)/(4*11²) ) * (2*11)/(5*5*13).

Simplify:

5 cancels with 5 in denominator: 5/5=1.

11 in numerator cancels with one 11 in denominator: 11/11=1.

So, remaining:

= (10117)/(4*11) * (2)/(5*13).

Wait, 4*11=44, 5*13=65.

So,

DP= (10117 *2) / (44 *65)=20234 /2860.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by2:10117/1430.

Check if 10117 and1430 have common factors.

1430=143*10=11*13*10.

10117 ÷11=919.727… nope.

10117 ÷13=778.23… nope.

10117 ÷10=1011.7, nope.

So, DP=10117/1430.

Now, since AD=AP + DP,

325/22= AP +10117/1430.

Solve for AP:

AP=325/22 -10117/1430.

Convert to common denominator: 1430.

325/22= (325*65)/1430=21125/1430.

10117/1430 remains same.

So,

AP=21125/1430 -10117/1430= (21125 -10117)/1430=11008/1430.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by2:5504/715.

Check GCD(5504,715).

715 ÷5504=0.

Compute GCD(5504,715):

5504 ÷715=7 times, 7*715=4995. Subtract:5504-4995=509.

GCD(715,509).

715 ÷509=1 with remainder206.

GCD(509,206).

509 ÷206=2 with remainder97.

GCD(206,97).

206 ÷97=2 with remainder12.

GCD(97,12).

97 ÷12=8 with remainder1.

GCD(12,1).

So GCD is1.

Thus, AP=5504/715.

Wait, but wait, 5504 and715:

Wait, 715=5*11*13.

Check if 5 divides5504: 5504 ends with4, so no.

11: 5-5+0-4= -4, not divisible by11.

13: 5504 ÷13=423.384, no.

So, no common factors. So AP=5504/715.

Wait, but earlier I found AP=14300/1843≈7.76, and 5504/715≈5504/715≈7.69, which is close but not the same. So, something must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing DP.

Wait, let me recompute DP.

We have DB²=50,585/484.

DA=325/22.

So, DP=DB² / DA= (50,585/484) / (325/22)= (50,585/484)*(22/325).

Compute 50,585 ÷325.

325*155=50,375, 50,585-50,375=210.

So, 50,585=325*155 +210.

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.

50,585=5*10,117.

Denominator:325=5*5*13.

So,

DP= (5*10,117)/(484) * (22)/(5*5*13).

Simplify:

Cancel 5: numerator 10,117, denominator 5*13.

So,

= (10,117)/(484) *22/(5*13).

Simplify 22/484=11/242.

So,

=10,117/(5*13) *11/242.

Wait, 5*13=65, 242=2*11².

So,

=10,117/65 *11/(2*11²)=10,117/(65*2*11)=10,117/(1430).

But 10,117 ÷1430≈7.07.

Wait, but 10,117 ÷1430: 1430*7=10,010. 10,117-10,010=107. So, 10,117=1430*7 +107.

So, 10,117/1430=7 +107/1430.

So, DP=7 +107/1430=7.074...

But earlier, using coordinates, I found AP=14300/1843≈7.76, and DA=325/22≈14.77, so AP≈7.76, DP≈14.77-7.76≈7.01, which is close to the 7.07 above.

Wait, but the exact calculation from coordinates gave AP=14300/1843≈7.765, and DP≈7.005.

Hmm, perhaps there was a computational error in the algebraic approach.

Wait, in the coordinate approach, I found AP=14300/1843≈7.765, but in the algebraic approach, after computing DP=10117/1430≈7.074, then AP=DA - DP=325/22 -10117/1430.

Wait, 325/22≈14.7727, 10117/1430≈7.074, so 14.7727 -7.074≈7.698≈7.7, which is close to 14300/1843≈7.765.

But they are not exactly the same, which suggests a computational error.

Alternatively, perhaps using mass point or Menelaus theorem.

Alternatively, using the formula for the length of AP in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, I found a resource that says in a triangle, if AD is a line from A intersecting the circumcircle at P, and D is the ex-pole, then AP= (bc)/(s(s-a)).

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, another formula.

Alternatively, use Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD.

But I don't know the length of AD yet.

Alternatively, use inversion centered at A.

But perhaps that's too advanced.

Alternatively, use the theorem that AP = (AB * AC)/ (BC).

Wait, in some cases, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles.

Wait, the triangle ABD and something else.

Alternatively, use coordinates again, but perhaps more carefully.

Wait, in the coordinate approach, I found AP=14300/1843, which is approximately7.765.

But when I compute using power of point D: DB²=AP * AD.

Compute DB²=50585/484≈104.514.

Compute AP * AD= (14300/1843)*(325/22)= (14300*325)/(1843*22).

Compute numerator:14300*325=4,647,500.

Denominator:1843*22=40,546.

So, AP * AD=4,647,500 /40,546≈114.63.

But DB²≈104.514.

But 114.63≠104.514, which suggests a mistake.

Wait, that's a problem.

So, either the coordinate approach is wrong, or the power of point approach is wrong.

Wait, let me recheck the coordinate approach.

We had:

Line AD parametrized as:

x=10 - (235/22) t

y= (30√14/11) t.

Plugging into the circle equation:

(x-5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

After substitution, we arrived at:

5625/224 -1250/11 t + (105625/484) t² =5625/224.

Subtracting 5625/224 from both sides:

-1250/11 t + (105625/484)t²=0.

Factor t:

t(-1250/11 +105625/484 t )=0.

Solutions t=0 and t= (1250/11)/(105625/484)= (1250/11)*(484/105625).

Compute (1250 *484)/(11*105625).

Compute numerator:1250 *484=605,000.

Denominator:11*105,625=1,161,875.

So, t=605,000 /1,161,875= 605000 ÷1161875=0.5209.

Wait, but earlier I had t=968/1843≈0.5255.

Wait, but 605000/1161875= same as 605000 ÷1161875= approx0.5209.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I had:

t=(1250/11)*(484/105625)= (1250*484)/(11*105625).

But 1250/105625=1250/(125*845)=10/(845)=2/169.

Then, 484/11=44.

So, t= (2/169)*44=88/169≈0.5207.

Wait, because 1250/105625=1250/(125*845)=10/845=2/169.

So, t= (2/169)*(484/11)= (2*484)/(169*11)=968/1859≈0.5207.

Wait, but earlier I had t=968/1843≈0.5255.

Wait, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, in the previous calculation, I think I made a mistake in denominator.

In the equation:

t= (1250/11) * (484/105625)= (1250*484)/(11*105625).

But 105625= 105625=25*4225=25*65².

Wait, but 1250=125*10=25*50.

So,

t= (25*50 *484)/(11*25*4225)= (50*484)/(11*4225).

Simplify:

50/11=50/11.

484=22².

4225=65².

So,

t=(50*22²)/(11*65²)= (50*22²)/(11*65²)= (50*484)/(74075)=24,200/74,075.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by25:968/2963.

Wait, 24,200 ÷25=968; 74,075 ÷25=2963.

Wait, 2963.

Wait, 2963=?

Check if 2963 ÷13=228, remainder - no.

Wait, perhaps 2963 is a prime.

So, t=968/2963.

So, t=968/2963≈0.326.

Wait, but I thought t was around0.52.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. I think I made a mistake in my initial coordinate approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the power of point D: DB²=DP * DA.

We have DB²=50585/484≈104.514.

We have DA=325/22≈14.7727.

So, DP=DB² / DA≈104.514 /14.7727≈7.074.

So, AP=DA - DP≈14.7727 -7.074≈7.698≈7.7.

But in the coordinate approach, I found AP=14300/1843≈7.765.

Wait, but AP is between7.7 and7.8, which is approximately 7.75.

But in any case, the exact value from coordinates was 14300/1843, which is approximately7.765.

But in the power of point approach, we get AP=DA - DP=325/22 -10117/1430.

Compute 325/22= approx14.7727.

10117/1430≈7.074.

AP≈14.7727 -7.074≈7.698≈7.7.

But 14300/1843≈7.765.

So, there's a discrepancy due to calculation errors.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 14300/1843, which reduces to 14300/1843.

But let me check if 14300 and1843 have any common factors.

Earlier, I saw that 1843=19*97.

Check if 19 divides14300: 14300 ÷19=752.63, no.

97 divides14300? 14300 ÷97=147.422, no.

So, 14300/1843 is reduced.

But wait, the problem statement says "AP can be written as the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime integers."

So, 14300 and1843 are coprime? Let me check.

Compute GCD(14300,1843).

1843 divides into14300 how many times?

14300 ÷1843≈7.765.

So, 1843*7=12901.

14300 -12901=1399.

Now, GCD(1843,1399).

1843 ÷1399=1, remainder 444.

1399 ÷444=3, remainder 67.

444 ÷67=6, remainder 42.

67 ÷42=1, remainder25.

42 ÷25=1, remainder17.

25 ÷17=1, remainder8.

17 ÷8=2, remainder1.

8 ÷1=8, remainder0.

So, GCD is1.

Therefore, 14300 and1843 are coprime, so m=14300, n=1843, m +n=16143.

But I'm not confident because the two methods gave slightly different results.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 5504/715, but in that case, 5504 and715: GCD is?

Compute GCD(5504,715):

715 divides into5504 7 times, 7*715=5005, 5504-5005=499.

GCD(715,499).

715 ÷499=1, remainder216.

499 ÷216=2, remainder67.

216 ÷67=3, remainder9.

67 ÷9=7, remainder4.

9 ÷4=2, remainder1.

4 ÷1=4, remainder0.

So, GCD is1.

Therefore, 5504/715 is reduced, m +n=5504+715=6219.

But which one is correct?

Wait, in the coordinate approach, we directly computed the parametric point, so that should be more accurate, unless I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, in the parametric approach, we had:

t= (1250/11)*(484/105625)= (1250 *484)/(11*105625).

Compute numerator:1250 *484=1250*400 +1250*84=500,000 +105,000=605,000.

Denominator:11*105,625=1,161,875.

So, t=605,000 /1,161,875= (605,000 ÷25)/(1,161,875 ÷25)=24,200 /46,475.

Again, divide numerator and denominator by5:4,840 /9,295.

Again, divide by5:968 /1,859.

Wait, 968/1859.

But earlier, I thought denominator was1843, but that was incorrect. So, correct t is968/1859.

So, AP= t * DA= (968/1859)*(325/22).

Compute numerator:968 *325=314,600.

Denominator:1859*22=40,898.

So, AP=314,600 /40,898.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by2:157,300 /20,449.

Check if they have common factors.

20,449 ÷157,300=0. So compute GCD(157300,20449).

20449 divides into157300 7 times: 20449*7=143,143. Subtract:157,300-143,143=14,157.

GCD(20449,14157).

20449 ÷14157=1, remainder6292.

GCD(14157,6292).

14157 ÷6292=2, remainder1573.

GCD(6292,1573).

6292 ÷1573=4, remainder1573*4=6292, subtract:0.

So, GCD is1573.

So, divide numerator and denominator by1573:

157300 ÷1573=100.

20,449 ÷1573=13.

So, AP=100/13.

Wait, that's a much simpler fraction!

So, AP=100/13.

Wait, that's a big difference.

So, did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, the calculation steps:

From the parametric equation, t=968/1859.

AP= t * DA= (968/1859)*(325/22).

Compute numerator:968 *325=314,600.

Denominator:1859*22=40,898.

So, AP=314600 /40898.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by2:157300 /20449.

Compute GCD(157300,20449)=1573.

So, 157300 ÷1573=100.

20449 ÷1573=13.

So, AP=100/13.

Yes! So, AP=100/13.

Which is approximately7.6923, which is close to the earlier approximate values.

Therefore, AP=100/13, which is reduced, so m=100, n=13, m +n=113.

So, the answer is113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). The tangents to the circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(ABC\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). The line \(AD\) intersects \(\omega\) again at point \(P\).

Using coordinate geometry, we place \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and find the coordinates of \(B\) using the distance formula. We determine \(B\) to be at \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\).

Next, we calculate the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) using the formula \(R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta}\), where \(\Delta\) is the area of the triangle found using Heron's formula. The circumradius is found to be \(\frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

We then find the coordinates of the circumcenter \(O\) by solving the perpendicular bisectors of two sides of the triangle. The center is determined to be at \(\left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)\).

Using the coordinates of \(B\) and \(C\), we find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The intersection of these tangents gives the coordinates of \(D\) as \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

We parametrize the line \(AD\) and substitute it into the equation of the circumcircle to find the parameter \(t\) corresponding to point \(P\). Solving the quadratic equation, we find \(t = \frac{968}{1859}\).

Finally, we calculate the length \(AP\) as \(t \times AD\), where \(AD\) is found to be \(\frac{325}{22}\). Simplifying, we find \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\).

Thus, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{100}{13}\), where \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\). Therefore, \(m + n = 113\).

\[
\boxed{113}
\]
