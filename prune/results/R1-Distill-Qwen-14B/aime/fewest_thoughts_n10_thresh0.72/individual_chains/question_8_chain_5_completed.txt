Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me try to understand the given equations. The first one is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That's a linear equation, and the variables are nonnegative integers. The second equation is a bit more complex. It has terms like a²b, a²c, etc. Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a way to simplify it.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me group terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)  
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)  
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Interesting. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

Substituting, the expression becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me write that equation out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor 300 from the a², b², c² terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, I remember that for symmetric equations involving a, b, c, sometimes it's useful to consider symmetric sums or use substitution. Since the variables are nonnegative integers and their sum is fixed, perhaps considering cases where some variables are zero might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a²b + a²c + ... in terms of (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca). Let me think. Let's calculate (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + ac² + bc² + 3abc.

Wait a minute, that expands to the terms in the second equation plus 3abc. So, from the second equation, we have:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

But according to the expansion above, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000 + 3abc.

We know a + b + c = 300, so plug that in:

300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000 + 3abc.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) = 2,000,000 + abc.

Hmm, that's a simpler equation. Let's write that down:

ab + bc + ca = (2,000,000 + abc)/100.

Which simplifies to:

ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

But since ab + bc + ca and abc are all integers, (abc) must be divisible by 100. So abc is a multiple of 100. Let's denote abc = 100k, where k is a nonnegative integer. Then, ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k.

Now, we have the following system:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k
3. abc = 100k

So, the problem reduces to finding triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers satisfying these three equations, where k is a nonnegative integer.

Wait, but k is dependent on abc. So, if I can express this in terms of the variables, maybe I can find a way to characterize a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Since for a cubic with roots a, b, c, we have:

x³ - (a + b + c)x² + (ab + bc + ca)x - abc = 0.

Given that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k, and abc = 100k, the cubic equation would be:

x³ - 300x² + (20,000 + k)x - 100k = 0.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can consider possible values of k and see if the equation has integer roots. But that might be too vague.

Alternatively, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps two of them are equal, or maybe one is zero. Let me try considering cases.

Case 1: One of a, b, c is zero.

Suppose c = 0. Then the equations become:

a + b = 300  
ab = 20,000 + k  
0 = 100k

From the third equation, 0 = 100k implies k = 0. Then, substituting into the second equation, ab = 20,000. So, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

Now, we can solve for a and b. Let me write the quadratic equation:

x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Let's compute the discriminant D:

D = 300² - 4 * 1 * 20,000  
D = 90,000 - 80,000  
D = 10,000.

So, the roots are:

x = [300 ± sqrt(10,000)] / 2  
sqrt(10,000) is 100, so:

x = (300 ± 100)/2  
x = (400)/2 = 200, or x = (200)/2 = 100.

So, a and b are 200 and 100. Therefore, the triple is (200, 100, 0), and all permutations. Since c was zero, the permutations would have the zero in each position.

So, for c=0, the number of triples is 3 (since the zero can be in any of the three positions). But wait, let me check: if a, b, c are all nonnegative integers, then each permutation is a distinct triple. So, the triples would be (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). That is 6 triples.

But wait, in this case, when c=0, we get a specific solution. But if another variable is zero, say a=0, then similarly we'd get b and c as 200 and 100. So, each case where one variable is zero would give 6 triples, but in this problem, when c=0, the solution is (200, 100, 0), but if a=0, the solution would be (0, 200, 100), etc.

Wait, but in this case, when we set c=0, we get two numbers: 200 and 100. These are fixed, so the permutations are 6. But wait, are all these permutations distinct? Yes, because the order matters for the triple.

So, Case 1 gives us 6 triples.

Case 2: None of a, b, c is zero. So, a, b, c ≥ 1.

In this case, perhaps we can find another way to express the equations.

We have:

a + b + c = 300  
ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k  
abc = 100k

Again, from the second equation, ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k, and from the third equation, k = abc / 100.

Substituting into the second equation:

ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

So, I can write:

ab + bc + ca - (abc)/100 = 20,000.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can factor this expression.

Let me factor:

ab(1 - c/100) + bc(1 - a/100) + ca(1 - b/100) = 20,000.

Wait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

ab + bc + ca - (abc)/100 - 20,000 = 0.

Hmm, not obvious. Maybe we can factor it differently.

Alternatively, let me consider that since a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can find a substitution or bound the possible values.

Given that a + b + c = 300, each of a, b, c is at most 300. But since abc = 100k, and ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k, perhaps I can bound k.

Wait, since abc = 100k, then k = abc / 100. So, substituting back into the second equation:

ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

Let me write this as:

ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + (abc)/100.

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the denominator:

100(ab + bc + ca) = 2,000,000 + abc.

Which brings us back to:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Wait, that's a cubic in variables a, b, c, but it's symmetric, so maybe I can find some symmetry or substitution.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider variables as a, b, c, and try to find possible integer solutions.

But this might be complicated. Maybe I can assume two variables are equal, to reduce the problem.

Let me try assuming that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Similarly, ab + bc + ca becomes a² + 2ac, which is a² + 2a(300 - 2a) = a² + 600a - 4a² = -3a² + 600a.

Also, abc becomes a²c = a²(300 - 2a).

Then, substituting into our equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000  
→ 100(-3a² + 600a) - a²(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000.

Compute each term:

100*(-3a² + 600a) = -300a² + 60,000a  
a²*(300 - 2a) = 300a² - 2a³.

So, putting it together:

(-300a² + 60,000a) - (300a² - 2a³) = 2,000,000  
→ -300a² + 60,000a - 300a² + 2a³ = 2,000,000  
→ 2a³ - 600a² + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0.

Let me simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots. Maybe I can factor this.

Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). So, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., but given the size, let's try small integers first.

Let me test a = 50:

50³ - 300*(50)^2 + 30,000*50 - 1,000,000  
= 125,000 - 300*2500 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000  
= 125,000 - 750,000 + 1,500,000 - 1,000,000  
= (125,000 - 750,000) + (1,500,000 - 1,000,000)  
= (-625,000) + 500,000  
= -125,000 ≠ 0.

Not zero. Let me try a = 100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000  
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000  
= (1,000,000 - 3,000,000) + (3,000,000 - 1,000,000)  
= (-2,000,000) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Yes, a = 100 is a root. So, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Dividing a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000  
          100     -20,000      1,000,000  
      1    -200    10,000          0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Now, set the quadratic equal to zero: a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Compute the discriminant:

D = 200² - 4*1*10,000  
D = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.

So, there's a repeated root at a = 200/(2) = 100. So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^2(a - 100) = (a - 100)^3.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the quadratic factor was a² - 200a + 10,000, which is (a - 100)^2.

So, the equation is (a - 100)^3 = 0. So, the only real root is a = 100.

Therefore, when a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100. So, c is also 100.

So, the triple is (100, 100, 100). But wait, let's check this solution.

Compute a + b + c: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300. Good.

Compute a²b + a²c + ... Let's compute each term:

a²b = 100² * 100 = 1,000,000  
Similarly, a²c, b²a, b²c, c²a, c²b each are 1,000,000. So, total is 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Perfect.

So, this is a valid solution. But how many triples does this correspond to? Since a = b = c = 100, this is only one unique triple.

But wait, in the case where a = b, we found that a = 100, c = 100, so the triple is (100,100,100). So, it's just one solution.

So, in Case 2 where a = b, we have one solution.

But maybe there are other solutions where two variables are equal but not 100. Let me see. Wait, in the equation above, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = c = 100. So, perhaps that's the only solution in this case.

Wait, but what if we assume a different pair is equal? Like b = c instead?

Let me try that. Suppose b = c. Then, a + 2b = 300, so a = 300 - 2b.

Compute ab + bc + ca:

ab + b² + a b = ab + b² + ab = 2ab + b².

Which is 2*(300 - 2b)*b + b² = 2*(300b - 2b²) + b² = 600b - 4b² + b² = 600b - 3b².

Similarly, abc = a*b² = (300 - 2b)*b².

Substituting into the equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Which becomes:

100*(600b - 3b²) - (300 - 2b)b² = 2,000,000.

Compute each term:

100*(600b - 3b²) = 60,000b - 300b²  
(300 - 2b)b² = 300b² - 2b³.

So, putting it together:

60,000b - 300b² - (300b² - 2b³) = 2,000,000  
→ 60,000b - 300b² - 300b² + 2b³ = 2,000,000  
→ 2b³ - 600b² + 60,000b - 2,000,000 = 0.

Divide both sides by 2:

b³ - 300b² + 30,000b - 1,000,000 = 0.

Wait, that's the same equation as before when we set a = b. So, this will have the same solution, b = 100. Then, a = 300 - 2*100 = 100, so c = b = 100. So, same triple (100,100,100). So, no new solutions here.

Similarly, if I assume a = c, I think I'll get the same result.

So, in Case 2, when two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal to 100, giving one triple.

Now, what about when all three are distinct? That is, a, b, c are all different. Hmm, this might be more complicated, but let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can find another way. Let me recall that in the second equation, after substituting, we have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to represent it as a product.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that this equation resembles the form where variables can be expressed as 100 times something, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: Let me consider the variables as x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, the equation is xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 2,000,000 = 0.

I wonder if we can factor this equation. Alternatively, perhaps set u = x - 100, v = y - 100, w = z - 100. Maybe that can help in some way, but not sure.

Wait, let's try a substitution where x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. Then, a = x + 100, etc. Let's plug into the equation.

But maybe that will complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can use the fact that a + b + c = 300, so let me express one variable in terms of the other two. Let's say c = 300 - a - b.

Substituting into the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, c = 300 - a - b. Let's plug that in:

100(ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)) - a b (300 - a - b) = 2,000,000.

Let me compute each part:

First, expand ab + bc + ca:

ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)  
= ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab  
= (ab - ab - ab) + 300b + 300a - a² - b²  
= (-ab) + 300a + 300b - a² - b².

So, 100*(ab + bc + ca) becomes:

100*(-ab + 300a + 300b - a² - b²)  
= -100ab + 30,000a + 30,000b - 100a² - 100b².

Now, compute abc:

a b (300 - a - b)  
= 300ab - a²b - ab².

So, putting it all into the equation:

(-100ab + 30,000a + 30,000b - 100a² - 100b²) - (300ab - a²b - ab²) = 2,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

-100ab - 300ab = -400ab  
30,000a + 30,000b remains  
-100a² - 100b² remains  
- (-a²b - ab²) = +a²b + ab².

So, entire equation:

-400ab + 30,000a + 30,000b - 100a² - 100b² + a²b + ab² = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a rather complicated equation. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

a²b + ab² - 100a² - 100b² - 400ab + 30,000a + 30,000b = 2,000,000.

This seems quite involved. Perhaps I can factor some terms:

a²b + ab² = ab(a + b).  
-100a² -100b² = -100(a² + b²).  
-400ab = -400ab.  
30,000a + 30,000b = 30,000(a + b).

So, putting it together:

ab(a + b) - 100(a² + b²) - 400ab + 30,000(a + b) = 2,000,000.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I can factor out (a + b) from some terms:

ab(a + b) + 30,000(a + b) - 100(a² + b²) -400ab = 2,000,000.

Factor (a + b):

(a + b)(ab + 30,000) - 100(a² + b²) -400ab = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can express a² + b² in terms of (a + b)^2 - 2ab.

So, a² + b² = (a + b)^2 - 2ab.

Let me substitute that in:

(a + b)(ab + 30,000) - 100[(a + b)^2 - 2ab] -400ab = 2,000,000.

Expanding:

(a + b)(ab + 30,000) - 100(a + b)^2 + 200ab -400ab = 2,000,000.

Simplify the ab terms:

200ab -400ab = -200ab.

So, equation becomes:

(a + b)(ab + 30,000) - 100(a + b)^2 - 200ab = 2,000,000.

Let me factor (a + b) from the first two terms:

(a + b)(ab + 30,000 - 100(a + b)) - 200ab = 2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can let s = a + b and p = ab. Then, since c = 300 - s.

Let me try that substitution. Let s = a + b, p = ab. Then:

We have the equation:

s(p + 30,000) - 100s² - 200p = 2,000,000.

Let me expand this:

s*p + 30,000s - 100s² - 200p = 2,000,000.

Rearranging terms:

s*p - 200p + 30,000s - 100s² = 2,000,000.

Factor p from the first two terms:

p(s - 200) + 30,000s - 100s² = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so p(s - 200) = 2,000,000 - 30,000s + 100s².

Therefore,

p = [2,000,000 - 30,000s + 100s²] / (s - 200).

Hmm, since p is an integer (as a and b are integers), the numerator must be divisible by (s - 200).

Let me compute the numerator:

100s² - 30,000s + 2,000,000.

Factor 100:

100(s² - 300s + 20,000).

So, p = [100(s² - 300s + 20,000)] / (s - 200).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor the quadratic in the numerator.

Let me factor s² - 300s + 20,000.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 20,000 and add up to 300. Wait, 200 and 100: 200*100=20,000 and 200+100=300. So, the quadratic factors as (s - 200)(s - 100).

So, s² - 300s + 20,000 = (s - 200)(s - 100).

Therefore, p = [100(s - 200)(s - 100)] / (s - 200).

Assuming s ≠ 200, we can cancel (s - 200):

p = 100(s - 100).

So, p = 100(s - 100).

But p = ab, and s = a + b.

So, ab = 100(s - 100) = 100(a + b - 100).

Thus, ab = 100a + 100b - 10,000.

Rearranging:

ab -100a -100b +10,000 = 0.

Hmm, adding 10,000 to both sides:

ab -100a -100b +10,000 = 0.

Let me factor this. Maybe I can add 10,000 to both sides and factor:

ab -100a -100b +10,000 = 0  
ab -100a -100b = -10,000  
ab -100a -100b +10,000 = 0  
(ab -100a -100b +10,000) = 0  
( a(b -100) -100(b -100) ) = 0  
(a -100)(b -100) = 10,000.

Ah, that's a useful factorization!

So, (a -100)(b -100) = 10,000.

Therefore, a -100 and b -100 are positive integers (since a, b ≥ 1, but in this case, a, b could be less than 100, but wait: since a + b + c = 300 and a, b, c are nonnegative, a and b can't be too small. Wait, but in this case, since we're in Case 2, a, b, c are all positive, so a, b ≥ 1. But (a -100) and (b -100) can be negative or positive.

Wait, but (a -100)(b -100) = 10,000, which is positive. So, either both (a -100) and (b -100) are positive, or both are negative.

Case 2a: Both (a -100) and (b -100) are positive. Then, a > 100, b > 100.

Case 2b: Both (a -100) and (b -100) are negative. Then, a < 100, b < 100.

So, let's explore both cases.

Case 2a: a > 100, b > 100.

We have (a -100)(b -100) = 10,000.

So, let me denote x = a -100 and y = b -100. Then, x and y are positive integers, and x*y = 10,000.

We need to find the number of positive integer pairs (x, y) such that x*y = 10,000.

The number of such pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 10,000.

First, factorize 10,000.

10,000 = 10^4 = (2*5)^4 = 2^4 * 5^4.

The number of positive divisors is (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 25.

So, there are 25 positive integer pairs (x, y) such that x*y = 10,000.

Each such pair gives a unique (a, b) where a = x + 100, b = y + 100.

But since a and b are positive integers, each pair (x, y) gives a unique (a, b). However, since a and b are interchangeable (since the problem is symmetric in a and b), each pair (x, y) and (y, x) would give different triples unless x = y.

But wait, in this case, since x and y are positive integers, each divisor pair (x, y) where x ≤ y is unique, and x > y would be the reverse. So, the total number of ordered pairs is 25. But in terms of ordered triples (a, b, c), since a and b are determined by x and y, and then c is determined as 300 - a - b.

Wait, but in our substitution, we set c = 300 - a - b, so each (a, b) gives a unique c. So, for each (x, y), there is a unique triple (a, b, c).

But, in this case, since we're in Case 2a where a > 100, b > 100, each (x, y) where x, y ≥ 1, so a, b ≥ 101.

But we need to ensure that c is positive as well. Since a + b = (x + 100) + (y + 100) = x + y + 200. So, c = 300 - (x + y + 200) = 100 - (x + y).

Wait, hold on: c = 300 - a - b = 300 - (x + y + 200) = 100 - (x + y).

But c must be a nonnegative integer. So, 100 - (x + y) ≥ 0 → x + y ≤ 100.

But x and y are positive integers such that x*y = 10,000.

So, we have to find the number of positive integer pairs (x, y) where x*y=10,000 and x + y ≤ 100.

Wait, that might not be possible because x and y are positive integers whose product is 10,000. Let's see: the minimal sum of x and y occurs when x and y are as close as possible. The square root of 10,000 is 100. So, the pair (100, 100) gives x + y = 200, which is greater than 100. So, any pair where x and y are factors of 10,000 would have x + y ≥ 100 + 1 = 101 (for x=1, y=10,000 → x+y=10,001), which is way larger than 100.

Wait, so 100 - (x + y) would be negative, which would make c negative, which is not allowed because c must be nonnegative.

Therefore, in Case 2a, c would be negative, which is invalid. So, no solutions in this case.

Case 2b: (a -100) and (b -100) are negative. So, a < 100, b < 100.

Then, (a -100)(b -100) = 10,000. Since both are negative, their product is positive.

Let me write x = 100 - a and y = 100 - b, where x and y are positive integers (since a < 100, b < 100). Then, (a - 100) = -x, (b - 100) = -y, so their product is x*y = 10,000.

So, similar to Case 2a, x*y=10,000, but x and y are positive integers less than 100 (since a < 100, so x = 100 - a ≥ 1, similarly y ≥ 1).

Wait, but x is 100 - a. Since a is at least 1, x can be up to 99. Similarly for y.

So, we need to find the number of positive integer pairs (x, y) such that x*y=10,000 and x ≤99, y ≤99.

Wait, but 10,000 is a large number. Let me see the factors of 10,000 that are ≤99.

First, factorize 10,000: 10,000 = 2^4 * 5^4.

So, the positive divisors less than or equal to 99 are:

Let me list them:

1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80.

Wait, let me confirm.

The exponents for 2 are 0 to 4, and for 5 are 0 to 4.

Compute all combinations:

2^0 *5^0 =1

2^1=2; 5^1=5

2^2=4; 5^2=25

2^3=8; 5^3=125 >99, so stop.

Similarly for 2^4=16.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to list all divisors up to 99.

Compute all possible products:

1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80.

Wait, 10,000 ÷ 1 = 10,000 (too big)

10,000 ÷ 2 = 5,000 (too big)

10,000 ÷4=2500 (too big)

10,000 ÷5=2000 (too big)

10,000 ÷8=1250 (too big)

10,000 ÷10=1000 (too big)

10,000 ÷16=625 (too big)

10,000 ÷20=500 (too big)

10,000 ÷25=400 (too big)

10,000 ÷40=250 (too big)

10,000 ÷50=200 (too big)

10,000 ÷80=125 (too big)

Wait, but these are all the divisors, but they're all too big except for the smaller ones. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Since x and y are both ≤99, their product x*y=10,000. But 99*99=9801 <10,000. So, it's impossible for x and y to be both ≤99 and have a product of 10,000. Because 100*100=10,000, which is the minimum product when x and y are 100 each, but since x and y must be less than 100, their product can't reach 10,000.

Wait, that can't be. Because 100*100=10,000, but x and y are less than 100, so x*y <10,000. So, there are no solutions in this case either.

Therefore, in Case 2b, there are no solutions because x*y=10,000 cannot be achieved with x, y ≤99.

So, in Case 2, when none of a, b, c is zero, the only solution is when a = b = c = 100, which gives one triple.

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed a = b, I found that a = b = c = 100 is the only solution. So, that's consistent.

So, summarizing:

Case 1: One variable is zero. We found 6 triples.

Case 2: No variable is zero. Only one triple where a = b = c = 100.

Wait, but wait a minute. Earlier, when I considered c =0, I found that (200, 100, 0) is a solution. But in that case, a + b = 300, ab =20,000, so the quadratic equation had solutions 200 and 100. So, that's correct.

But in Case 2, when I assumed none of a, b, c is zero, the only solution is (100,100,100). So, that's another triple.

So, total number of triples is 6 (from Case 1) + 1 (from Case 2) = 7.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, in Case 1, when c=0, the triple is (200,100,0) and its permutations. Which are 6 distinct triples because each of a, b, c can be zero.

But in the case where a=0, the triple would be (0, 200, 100), which is a different permutation. So, 6 triples in total.

In Case 2, the triple is (100,100,100). So, only one unique triple.

Thus, total number of triples is 6 + 1 =7.

But wait, earlier when I considered two variables equal, I found only (100,100,100). But is that the only solution?

Wait, perhaps I should check another case where two variables are equal, but not 100.

Wait, suppose a = b, but a ≠100. Let me see if that's possible.

Wait, when I considered a = b earlier, the only solution was a =100, so maybe there are no other solutions with a = b besides (100,100,100).

Alternatively, perhaps there are other solutions where a, b, c are all different, but none are zero.

Wait, but in the equation (a -100)(b -100)=10,000, we saw that in Case 2a and 2b, there are no solutions because c would be negative or the product can't be achieved with x, y <=99.

So, in Case 2, only (100,100,100) is the solution.

Therefore, total triples are 6 (from Case 1) +1 (from Case 2) =7.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other cases?

Wait, in Case 1, I considered one variable being zero. But perhaps I should also check if two variables are zero. Let's see.

If two variables are zero, say b = c =0, then a =300. Then, check the second equation: a²b + a²c + ... would be zero, which is not 6,000,000. So, no solutions in this case.

Thus, only triples where exactly one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100, or all variables are 100.

So, total number of solutions is 6 +1=7.

Wait, but earlier, I thought in Case 1, each permutation of (200,100,0) gives 6 triples, and in Case 2, only one triple where all are 100. So, total 7.

But let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute the number of triples for Case 1.

When c=0, we have a=200, b=100. The permutations are:

(200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). That's 6 distinct triples.

In Case 2, the triple is (100,100,100). So, adding 1.

So, 6 +1=7.

But wait, earlier I thought that when a=0, then another solution exists, but in reality, when a=0, then b + c=300, and the second equation becomes 0 +0 +0 +0 +0 +0 + ... Wait no, when a=0, then the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b =0 +0 +0 + b²c +0 + c²b= b²c + c²b = bc(b + c).

Since a=0, b + c=300.

So, bc*300 =6,000,000 → bc =6,000,000 /300=20,000.

So, bc=20,000, and b + c=300.

So, solving for b and c:

b + c=300  
bc=20,000.

So, quadratic equation: x² -300x +20,000=0.

Compute discriminant: 90,000 -80,000=10,000. So, sqrt(10,000)=100.

Solutions: (300 ±100)/2=200 and 100. So, same as before.

So, yes, when a=0, the solution is (0,200,100) and permutations. So, Case 1 includes all triples where one variable is zero.

So, total solutions: 6 (from Case 1) +1 (from Case 2)=7.

Wait, but let me check if the triple (100,100,100) is included in Case 1. No, because all variables are positive. So, it's a separate case.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 7.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when a=100, b=100, c=100, this is the only solution where none are zero. So, yes, 7 in total.

Wait, but let me see if there are any other solutions where none are zero and none are equal.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me consider if a, b, c are all different and positive. Could there be such solutions?

From earlier, when I assumed none are zero, I ended up with the equation (a -100)(b -100)=10,000, but found no solutions because in Case 2a, c would be negative, and in Case 2b, x and y couldn't be small enough.

But perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me re-examine the equation.

In Case 2, when none are zero, we had (a -100)(b -100)=10,000.

So, either a -100 and b -100 are both positive, but then c=300 -a -b would be negative, which is invalid.

Or, both are negative, meaning a <100, b <100, but then (100 -a)(100 -b)=10,000.

But as we saw, 100 -a and 100 -b are positive integers, and their product is 10,000. But 100 -a ≤99, 100 -b ≤99, so their product can't reach 10,000 because 99*99=9801 <10,000. So, no solutions here.

Therefore, indeed, in Case 2, only (100,100,100) is the solution.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 6 (from Case 1) +1 (from Case 2)=7.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in Case 1, each permutation is distinct, so 6. And in Case 2, one more triple. So, the total is 7.

But let me make sure there are no more cases. For example, what if two variables are equal, but I didn't consider all possibilities?

Wait, earlier, when I set a = b, I found that only (100,100,100) is the solution. Similarly, setting a = c or b = c leads to the same solution.

So, in that case, no other solutions from that approach.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 7.

Wait, but the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers. So, 7 should be the answer.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if when a=0, b=200, c=100 is a distinct triple from a=100, b=200, c=0, etc. Yes, each permutation is a different triple.

So, (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200) → 6.

Plus (100,100,100) → 1.

Total 7.

So, I think the answer is 7.


The problem requires finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Given Equations:**
   - \(a + b + c = 300\)
   - \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

2. **Simplify the Second Equation:**
   - Factor the expression: \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)\).
   - Substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\):
     \[
     300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
     \]
   - Divide by 300:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{300} = 20,000
     \]

3. **Alternative Approach Using Symmetric Sums:**
   - Recognize that \((a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b + 3abc\).
   - Substitute \(a + b + c = 300\):
     \[
     300(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000 + 3abc
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + \frac{abc}{100}
     \]
   - Let \(abc = 100k\), then:
     \[
     ab + bc + ca = 20,000 + k
     \]

4. **Case 1: One Variable is Zero:**
   - Assume \(c = 0\). Then:
     \[
     a + b = 300 \quad \text{and} \quad ab = 20,000
     \]
   - Solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\):
     - Discriminant: \(D = 300^2 - 4 \times 20,000 = 10,000\)
     - Roots: \(x = 200\) and \(x = 100\)
   - The triples are permutations of \((200, 100, 0)\), yielding **6 distinct triples**.

5. **Case 2: No Variable is Zero:**
   - Assume \(a, b, c \geq 1\). Using the equation:
     \[
     (a - 100)(b - 100) = 10,000
     \]
   - Factor pairs of 10,000 are considered, but due to constraints, only \(a = b = c = 100\) satisfies all conditions, yielding **1 additional triple**.

6. **Total Solutions:**
   - From Case 1: 6 triples
   - From Case 2: 1 triple
   - **Total: 7 triples**

**Answer:** The number of triples is \(\boxed{7}\).
