Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that's a specific condition. I need to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw right now, I'll try to imagine it. So IA is a segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the incenter to the circumcenter. These two are perpendicular.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check if that's correct. Yes, I think that's right. So plugging in R = 13 and r = 6, OI² would be 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA. OA is the circumradius, so OA = 13. Let me write that down.

In triangle OIA:
- OA = 13
- OI = sqrt(13)
- IA is perpendicular to OI, so triangle OIA is right-angled at I.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
OI² + IA² = OA²
So (sqrt(13))² + IA² = 13²
13 + IA² = 169
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, what
