Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Alice and Bob game problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There's a stack of n tokens, and Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm. So, this is a combinatorial game theory problem. It's about determining the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So, the game is similar to Nim but with limited moves. Let's think about small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let me list n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=0: Well, that's the end. The last token was taken by the previous player. So, if n=0, the previous player has won, so the current player loses. So n=0 is a losing position. But since the game starts with n ≥ 1, maybe I can consider n=0 as a losing position.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: Current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Then opponent can take 1 and win. Wait, but if the current player takes 1, opponent is left with n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, when you have n=2, you can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. But the opponent can then take that 1 and win. So, the current player (at n=2) is forced to leave the opponent in a position where the opponent can win. So, n=2 is a losing position? Or maybe not. Wait, no, because the current player can choose to take 1 or 4, but at n
