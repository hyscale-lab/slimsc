Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The goal is to find the length of AP, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, since ABC is inscribed in ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that? Not sure, but I know that D is the ex-pole with respect to BC, maybe. 

Let me recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω, and similarly for the tangent at C. So, point D is the intersection of these two tangents, which are perpendicular to OB and OC.

Since D lies on both tangents, maybe we can use some properties of poles and polars here. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point would be helpful. Because D is outside the circle ω, the power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC², since DB and DC are tangent lengths. Therefore, DB = DC, right? Because both are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the lengths of the two tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, yes, DB = DC. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC. That's a useful piece of information.

Given that, maybe I can find some relations in triangle DBC. But before that, perhaps I should find some properties of triangle ABC first, given the sides.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute its circumradius. That might come in handy later.

To find the circumradius R of triangle ABC, I can use the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

So, first, let's compute the area Δ of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.

Compute the semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt(504). 504 factors into 16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't a whole number. Let me factor it differently.

504 = 16 * 31.5 is not helpful. Let me do prime factorization.

504: divide by 2, 252. Again by 2, 126. Again by 2, 63. Then 63 is 7*9, so 7*3^2.

So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7.

So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 * 7) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check:

sqrt(2^3) = 2^(1.5) = 2*sqrt(2)
sqrt(3^2) = 3
sqrt(7) = sqrt(7)
So altogether, 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, that's correct.

So Δ = sqrt(504) = 6*sqrt(14).

Now, compute R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)).

Calculate numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24, 24*sqrt(14).

So R = 450 / (24*sqrt(14)).

Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 450/6=75, 24/6=4.

So R = 75/(4*sqrt(14)).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(14):

R = (75*sqrt(14))/(4*14) = (75*sqrt(14))/56.

Simplify 75 and 56: they have no common factors, so R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm. Okay, so the circumradius is 75√14 /56.

Wait, I'm not sure if I'll need this right away, but it's good to have.

Let me think about the point D. Since
