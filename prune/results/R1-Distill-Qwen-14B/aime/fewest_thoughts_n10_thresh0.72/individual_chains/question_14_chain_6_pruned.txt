Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number is a multiple of 7.

I think the approach is to find such a number N where this condition holds for all four digits. Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

But wait, checking each number one by one might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the properties of numbers divisible by 7 and how changing a digit affects divisibility.

Divisibility by 7 can sometimes be tricky, but the rule is that you can take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if that helps here directly.

Alternatively, since each modified number (changing a digit to 1) must be divisible by 7, maybe we can express some equations based on that.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits.

So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, if we change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, changing B to 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = N2.

Changing C to 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = N3.

Changing D to 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N itself is N = ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

We can write the conditions as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) mod 7 = 0

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) mod 7 = 0

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) mod 7 = 0

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) mod 7 = 0

Hmm, that's four conditions. Let me see if I can find a way to relate them.

I know that 1000 mod 7 is equal to 1000 / 7 = 142 * 7 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7 =14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So, let me compute each part modulo 7:

1. N1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

2. N2: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

3. N3: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7

4. N4: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

Hmm, that's a system of four equations. Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between A, B, C, D.

Let me label the equations for clarity:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 → 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7)

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 → 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod7 (because -2 mod7 is 5)

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4)

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7 → 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod7 (as -1 mod7 is 6)

Hmm, so now we have four equations with four variables (A, B, C, D). Let's see if we can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Looking at Equation (1) and Equation (2):

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡5

Subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (2):

(6A +3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡5 -1 →6A -2B ≡4 mod7

Simplify: 6A - 2B ≡4 → Let's divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7 → Equation (5): B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Similarly, let's take Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡4

And Equation (2): 6A +3C + D ≡5

Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

(6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) ≡5 -4 →3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

So, 3C -2B ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (6).

Now, from Equation (5): B ≡3A -2 mod7. Let's substitute B into Equation (6).

Equation (6): 3C -2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7 →3C -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify: 3C -6A ≡-3 → 3C -6A ≡4 mod7 (because -3 mod7 is 4).

Let me write this as: 3C ≡6A -4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: since 3 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 5: C ≡5*(6A -4) mod7.

Compute 5*(6A -4)=30A -20.

30 mod7: 30/7=4*7=28, 30-28=2 → 30≡2 mod7.

-20 mod7: 20/7=2*7=14, 20-14=6 → -20≡-6 mod7 → which is same as 1 mod7 (since -6+7=1).

So, 30A -20 ≡2A +1 mod7.

Thus, C ≡2A +1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (7).

So now, from Equation (5): B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Equation (7): C ≡2A +1 mod7.

Now, let's look at Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

We can substitute B and C in terms of A into this equation.

From Equation (5): B=3A -2 +7k, but since we're working mod7, we can represent B≡3A-2 mod7.

Similarly, C≡2A+1 mod7.

So, substitute into Equation (4):

6A +2*(3A -2) +3*(2A +1) ≡6 mod7.

Let me compute each term:

2*(3A -2) =6A -4.

3*(2A +1)=6A +3.

So, Equation becomes:

6A + (6A -4) + (6A +3) ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:

6A +6A +6A =18A.

-4 +3 = -1.

So, 18A -1 ≡6 mod7.

18 mod7: 18-14=4 → 4A -1 ≡6 mod7.

So, 4A ≡6 +1 mod7 →4A≡7 mod7→4A≡0 mod7.

Because 7≡0 mod7.

So, 4A ≡0 mod7.

Since 4 and 7 are coprime, the only solution is A≡0 mod7.

But A is a digit in a four-digit number, so A can be 1 to 9. And A≡0 mod7, so A must be 7.

Because 7 is the only digit from 1-9 that is 0 mod7.

So, A=7.

Now, plug A=7 into Equations (5) and (7):

Equation (5): B ≡3*7 -2 mod7 → 21 -2 =19 →19 mod7: 19-14=5 → B≡5 mod7. Since B is a digit, B can be 5 or 12, but since it's a digit, B=5.

Equation (7): C ≡2*7 +1 mod7 →14 +1=15 →15 mod7=1 → C≡1 mod7. So, C can be 1 or 8.

So, A=7, B=5, C is either 1 or 8.

Now, let's find D.

We can use Equation (1):2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Plug in B=5 and C=1 or 8.

Case 1: C=1.

Equation (1):2*5 +3*1 + D ≡1 mod7 →10 +3 + D ≡1 mod7 →13 + D ≡1 mod7.

13 mod7=6, so 6 + D ≡1 mod7 → D ≡1 -6= -5≡2 mod7. So D=2 or 9.

Case 2: C=8.

Equation (1):2*5 +3*8 + D ≡1 mod7 →10 +24 + D ≡1 mod7.

10 mod7=3, 24 mod7=3 (since 24=3*7+3). So 3 +3 + D ≡1 mod7 →6 + D≡1 mod7 → D≡1 -6= -5≡2 mod7. So D=2 or 9.

So, D can be 2 or 9 in either case.

So, now, the possible numbers are:

If C=1, D=2 or 9 → 7512 or 7519.

If C=8, D=2 or 9 →7582 or 7589.

But since we are looking for the greatest four-digit number, we should choose the largest possible N. So, let's see which among 7512, 7519, 7582, 7589 is the largest.

Looking at the thousands digit is 7 for all, hundreds digit is 5, tens digit: 1 vs 8. So 8 is larger. So 7582 and 7589 are larger than the others. Between them, 7589 is larger.

So, N=7589 is a candidate. Let's verify whether this number satisfies all four conditions.

Let me compute N1, N2, N3, N4 and check divisibility by 7.

N =7589.

N1: Change A to 1 →1589.

Check if 1589 is divisible by 7.

Let me divide 1589 by 7: 7*227=1589? Let's check:

7*200=1400, 7*27=189; 1400+189=1589. Yes! So N1 is divisible by 7.

N2: Change B to 1 →7189.

Check 7189 /7.

7*1000=7000, 7189-7000=189. 189/7=27. So 7189=7*(1000+27)=7*1027. So yes, divisible by 7.

N3: Change C to 1 →7519.

Wait, 7519: Let me check if 75
