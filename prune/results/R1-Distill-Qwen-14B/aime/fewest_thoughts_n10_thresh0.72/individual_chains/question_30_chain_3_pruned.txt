Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, right? Because the roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity, and since 13 is prime, all roots except 1 are primitive.

Wait, but in this problem, ω is a 13th root of unity, but it's not equal to 1. So ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. That’s good to note.

Now, the product we're dealing with is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that's a product over all 13th roots of unity, isn't it? Because ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, ω ≠ 1. So when k=0, ω^0 = 1, which is the root we're excluding. So the product is actually over all ω^k where k=0 to 12, but when k=0, the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So including that term won't change the product. So perhaps I can treat the product as over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the product in terms of polynomials. Because products over roots can often be related to evaluating polynomials at certain points. For example, if I have a polynomial P(x) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then P(x) = ∏_{i=1}^{n} (x - r_i). But in this case, I have a product of terms like (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each root ω^k. I need to find a way to express this product in terms of a polynomial evaluated at a specific point.

Wait, let's try to manipulate the expression inside the product. Let me consider each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I can write this as 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. Let me denote x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x², which is a quadratic in x.

So, for each x = ω^k, the term is x² - 2x + 2. So, the entire product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. So, that's equal to ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x runs through all 13th roots of unity.

But wait, the product of (x² - 2x + 2) for all x being the 13th roots of unity. Hmm, so that is the same as the product over all roots x of Φ₁₃(x) of (x² - 2x + 2). Wait, no, because Φ₁₃(x) has roots all the primitive 13th roots of unity, which are ω^k for k=1 to 12. But in our case, we're including k=0, which is 1, so x=1 is also a root in the product.

Wait, but when x=1, the term becomes 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, so including that doesn't change the product. So, the product is actually equal to the product over all primitive 13th roots of unity of (x² - 2x + 2) multiplied by the term at x=1, which is 1. So, the entire product is equal
