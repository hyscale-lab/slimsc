Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, we draw line AD, which intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm, so first, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic quadrilateral, but since it's a triangle, it's just inscribed.

The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the exsimilicenter or the ex-similicenter of the circle ω with respect to B and C. Remember, the ex-similicenter is the point outside the circle from where two equal tangents can be drawn to the circle.

So, the tangents from D to ω touch at B and C. Therefore, DB = DC. Because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal.

Then, AD is drawn, intersecting ω again at P. So P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.

We need to find AP. Hmm, okay.

Given the sides of triangle ABC, maybe I should first compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, coordinates, or maybe use power of a point.

Power of a point could be useful here. Since D is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to ω at B and C. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = (something). Maybe that can help.

So, let me recall that the power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent). Also, since D is outside ω, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC², which is also equal to DA × DP, because AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P.

Wait, that's the key. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA × DP. So if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then since AP = DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the points are arranged as A --- D --- P on line AD. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects ω again at P. So actually, the points are A --- P --- D on line AD. Wait, no. Wait, no, because D is outside the circle, so the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (external point), and then must intersect the circle again at P. So the order is A, then D, then P? No, wait, that can't be. Because D is outside the circle, the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (external point), and then to P. Wait, no, actually, the line AD goes from A, through D, and then extends beyond D to meet the circle again at P? No, that's not right. If D is outside the circle, then the line AD would enter the circle at A, exit at another point, but D is outside, so maybe the order is A, then P, then D?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The line AD connects A to D, which is outside the circle. So starting from A (on the circle), moving towards D (external point), the line AD would intersect the circle again at some point P between A and D. Because
