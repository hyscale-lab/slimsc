Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. Her walking speed affects how long the walk takes, and the problem gives me two different scenarios with different speeds and times. I need to find out how long her walk will take when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop, which is t minutes.

Let me jot down the given information:

1. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including t minutes at the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at speed s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes.

I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including t.

Hmm, okay. So, the walk is 9 km each time, right? So, the time she spends walking alone would be different based on her speed. But each time, she includes t minutes at the coffee shop. So, the total time is walking time plus t minutes.

Let me convert all the times to hours to make it easier because the speeds are in km/h. 

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours. But wait, 4 hours includes t minutes. So, the time she actually spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. But since t is in minutes, I need to convert that to hours.

Wait, let me think. Maybe it's easier to work entirely in hours or entirely in minutes. Let me see.

Let me convert t minutes to hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, in the first scenario:
Walking time = total time - t/60 hours
Walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours.

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km, speed is s km/h. So,

Walking time = 9 / s hours.

So, equation one is:
9 / s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, in the second scenario:
She walks at s + 2 km/h.
Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total.

Again, walking time is total time minus t/60 hours.

Walking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

But walking time is also 9 / (s + 2) hours.

So, equation two is:
9 / (s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I need to solve these two equations to
