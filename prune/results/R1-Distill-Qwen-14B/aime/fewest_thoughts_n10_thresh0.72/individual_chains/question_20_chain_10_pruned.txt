Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for color. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. Also, once I place the chips, adding any more would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. Each row has to be all white or all black. Similarly, each column has to be all white or all black. But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we can't have all rows or all columns being the same color. Wait, but the grid has 25 cells, and we have 25 white and 25 black chips. Wait, no, the grid is 5x5, so 25 cells, but there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips? Wait, that doesn't make sense because each cell can hold at most one chip. So, we must be placing exactly 25 chips in total, but with the possibility of using all white, all black, or a mix. But the problem states 25 white and 25 black chips, but we can place some of them. Oh, wait, so maybe the total number of chips on the grid can be up to 25, but we can have fewer?

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips." So the number of chips placed on the grid is any number from 0 up to 25, but under the conditions given. But the last condition says that adding any additional chip would violate the previous conditions. So that means that our arrangement is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules.

So, to rephrase, each row must be all white or all black, and each column must be all white or all black. But the arrangement must be such that every cell not occupied is either in a row that's already all white (so you can't place a white in that row) or all black (so you can't place a black in that row), and similarly for columns.

Wait, no. Each row can be all white or all black. So, for example, if a row is all white, then you can't place a black chip
