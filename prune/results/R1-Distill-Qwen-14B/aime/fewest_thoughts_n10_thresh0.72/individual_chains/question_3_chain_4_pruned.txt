Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four randomly chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, it means she definitely won a prize because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A) when A is winning the grand prize and B is winning a prize.

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(grand prize) / P(prize). 

Let me define the events more clearly:
- Let A be the event that Jen wins the grand prize, which means all four of her numbers are chosen.
- Let B be the event that Jen wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen.

So, we need to compute P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

First, I need to figure out P(A), the probability of the grand prize. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because Jen has picked a specific set of 4 numbers, and the lottery must match that exactly. So, P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

Let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. 

Hmm, "at least two" means two, three, or four of her numbers are chosen. So, to compute this, it might be easier to compute the complementary probability and subtract from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero of her numbers are chosen) - P(exactly one of her numbers is chosen).

Let's compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210 as before.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's numbers is choosing all 4 from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). That's C(6,4). Let me compute that: 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's is 15. So, P(zero) = 15 / 210.

Next, the number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's numbers and 3 from the non-Jen numbers. So, the number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me calculate that.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, multiplying gives 4*20 = 80. So, P(exactly one) = 80 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 15 (none) + 80 (one) = 95, so 210 - 95 is 115, yes. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Simplify that fraction. 115 and 210 can both be divided by 5: 115 ÷5 = 23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation for exactly one. So, C(4,1) is 4, C(6,3) is 20. 4*20=80. So, 80/210 is correct. Then, 15 (none) +80 (one
