Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, involving compositions of absolute values, sine, and cosine functions. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's write down the functions to make sure I understand them correctly.

The first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). The second function is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, both functions involve the composition of f and g, but with different trigonometric functions and arguments. I need to figure out where these two graphs intersect.

I think the strategy here is to analyze each function separately to understand their periodicity and possible ranges, then find their points of intersection by solving for x and y. But since both functions involve compositions, maybe I should start by understanding what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Let me define f(x) and g(x) first:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

These are both functions that take the absolute value of |x| minus some constant, then take the absolute value again. So, they are transformations of the absolute value function, which I know is V-shaped.

Let me graph f(x) first.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

The inner function is |x| - 1/2. This is a V-shape shifted down by 1/2. The absolute value of that would create a W-shape, I think. Because taking the absolute value of |x| - 1/2 would reflect any negative parts back up.

Let me think: For f(x), if |x| - 1/2 is positive, then f(x) is |x| - 1/2. If |x| - 1/2 is negative, then f(x) is -( |x| - 1/2 ) = -|x| + 1/2.

So, where is |x| - 1/2 positive? When |x| > 1/2. So for |x| > 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, going upwards. For |x| ≤ 1/2, f(x) = -|x| + 1/2, which is an upside-down V between -1/2 and 1/2.

So f(x) is a piecewise function:

f(x) =
- -x + 1/2, for x in (-1/2, 1/2)
- x - 1/2, for x ≥ 1/2
- -x - 1/2, for x ≤ -1/2

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

No, wait. When x is positive, |x| = x. So for x ≥ 0, f(x) is |x - 1/2|. Similarly, for x < 0, f(x) is | -x - 1/2 | = |x + 1/2|. So actually, f(x) is symmetric in both positive and negative x.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|, which is the same as | |x| - 1/2 |.

So, the graph of f(x) would have vertices where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. So, from x = -1/2 to x = 1/2, the expression inside is negative, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. Outside of that, it's |x| - 1/2.

So, f(x) has a V shape that goes down from x = -infty to x = -1/2, then a peak at x = -1/2, goes down to a minimum at x=0, then up again to x=1/2, then continues rising beyond x=1/2.

Wait, no, actually, let me plot f(x) at various points.

At x=0, f(x) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x=1/2, f(x) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

At x=1, f(x) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Similarly, at x=-1, f(x) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, for x positive, it's |x - 1/2|, which is a V-shape with vertex at x=1/2. Similarly, for x negative, it's | -x -1/2 |, which is |x + 1/2|, another V-shape with vertex at x=-1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is two V shapes: one centered at x=1/2 going upward, another at x=-1/2, also going upward. But the minima at x=±1/2 are 0. Between x=-1/2 and x=1/2, the function f(x) is 1/2 - |x|, which is a downward V with maximum at 1/2 at x=0.

So, the graph of f(x) is a diamond shape with vertices at (-1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1/2, 0). Wait, no. Because at x=1/2, f(x)=0, and as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, right?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For x ≥ 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2. So as x increases beyond 1/2, f(x) increases linearly with slope 1. Similarly, for x ≤ -1/2, f(x) is (-x) - 1/2, which is a line with slope -1 as x decreases.

So, putting it all together, f(x) has a "W" shape
