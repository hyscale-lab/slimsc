Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. That means if z = a + bi, then a² + b² = 16. But I think it might be easier to represent z in polar form because dealing with magnitude and angles can sometimes simplify things, especially when dealing with multiplication and division of complex numbers. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Since |z|=4, that's straightforward.

So substituting z into the expression, we have:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) / (4e^{iθ}).

Let me simplify each part separately. Let's compute the first term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

First, factor out the 4: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}), which is (24 + 36i)/e^{iθ} because 96/4=24 and 144/4=36.

Wait, actually, 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36, so yes, that's correct. So the second term becomes (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}, since 1/e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}.

So now, the expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of sine and cosine to make it easier to find the real part. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So let me denote A = 75 + 117i, and B = 24 + 36i. Then, the expression becomes:

4*A*(cosθ + i sinθ) + B*(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each part:

4*A*cosθ = 4*(75 + 117i)*cosθ = [4*75*cosθ] + [4*117i*cosθ] = 300 cosθ + 468i cosθ.

Similarly, 4*A*i sinθ = 4*(75 + 117i)*i sinθ = 4*(75i + 117i²) sinθ. Wait, i² is -1, so this becomes 4*(75i - 117) sinθ = [4*(-117) sinθ] + [4*75 i sinθ] = -468 sinθ + 300i sinθ.

Similarly, for the second part: B*cosθ = (24 + 36i) cosθ = 24 cosθ + 36i cosθ.

B*(-i sinθ) = (24 + 36i)*(-i) sinθ = (-24i -36i²) sinθ = (-24i +36) sinθ, because i² is -1.

So combining all these terms:

Real parts:
300 cosθ -468 sinθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:
468i cosθ + 300i sinθ -24i sinθ -36i cosθ.

Wait, let me make sure. So:

First part (from 4A e^{iθ}):

Real: 300 cosθ
Imaginary: 468 sinθ

Second part (from 4A i sinθ):

Real: -468 sinθ
Imaginary: 300 sinθ

Third part (from B cosθ):

Real: 24 cosθ
Imaginary: 36 sinθ

Fourth part (from B (-i sinθ)):

Real: 36 sinθ
Imaginary: -24 sinθ

Wait, no, let's re-express this correctly. Maybe I should expand each term.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to recompute more carefully.

The first term is 4*A*e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ).

Let me compute this:

= 4*(75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i² sinθ)
= 4*(75 cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ -117 sinθ)  (since i² = -1)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)
Imaginary: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)

Similarly, the second term is B*e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

= 24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ -36i² sinθ
= 24 cosθ -24i sinθ + 36i cosθ +36 sinθ  (since i² = -1)

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ
Imaginary: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)

So now, combining all terms:

Total Real Part = 4*(75 cosθ -117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ +36 sinθ)

Total Imaginary Part = 4*(75 sinθ +117 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)

But since the problem asks for the largest possible real part, we can focus on the real part.

So the real part Re = 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ +36 sinθ)

Let me compute this:

First, distribute the 4:

= 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:

cosθ terms: 300 +24 = 324
sinθ terms: -468 +36 = -432

So Re = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ

Hmm, okay. So the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ is some angle. Alternatively, the maximum value is R. Wait, but in this case, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So the coefficients are 324 and -432.

So let me compute R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2)

Compute 324 squared: 324*324. Let's see, 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, and cross terms: 2*300*24 = 14,400. So (300+24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 105, 105, 105? Wait, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400² is 160,000, 32² is 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So 432² = (400+32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, what's the square of 540? 540² is 291,600. Yes, because 500² is 250,000, 40² is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000, so (500+40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 +40² = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So R is 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re is R, which is 540. So the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the signs. Because the expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which is equivalent to a cosθ + b sinθ where a=324 and b=-432.

So R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² +432²). Which is the same as sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ), which is the same as sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value is 540.

Wait, so that's the maximum real part. So the answer should be 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in expanding the expression earlier.

Let me go through the steps again to verify.

We have z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Wait, no: 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}, because |z|=4, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Wait, in the expression, it's (96 +144i)/z. So that would be (96 +144i) * (1/z) = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{iθ})) = (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Yes, that's correct. So the second term is (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}.

Then, when I expanded 4*A*e^{iθ}, where A=75+117i, I correctly expanded it to 4*(75+117i)(cosθ +i sinθ) leading to 300 cosθ -468 sinθ in the real part, and 468 cosθ + 300 sinθ in the imaginary part.

Similarly, for the second term, (24 +36i)e^{-iθ} expands to 24 cosθ +36 sinθ in the real part and (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) in the imaginary part.

Adding the real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ from the first term, and 24 cosθ +36 sinθ from the second term. So total real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So that looks correct.

Then, to find the maximum of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, I correctly calculated R as sqrt(324² +432²) = 540.

So yes, the maximum real part is 540.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting \(z\) into the expression, we have:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \((75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\), which expands to:
   \[
   300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \quad \text{(real part)}.
   \]

2. \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\), which expands to:
   \[
   24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \quad \text{(real part)}.
   \]

Combining the real parts:

\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

This expression can be rewritten in the form \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\), where \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\). The maximum value of such an expression is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\):

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
