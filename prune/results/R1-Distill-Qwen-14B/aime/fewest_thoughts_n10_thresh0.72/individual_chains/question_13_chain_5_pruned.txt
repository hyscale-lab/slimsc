Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is asking, if Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the coffee shop time is the same in both scenarios, which is 't' minutes. So, the difference in the total time she spends each day is purely due to the difference in her walking speed. 

Let me break this down. First, maybe I can write equations for both scenarios. The total time she spends each day is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop. 

In the first case, when she walks at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time and 't' minutes. Wait, but 't' is in minutes, so I should convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let's convert 't' to hours because the walking speed is in km per hour.

So, 4 hours is equal to the walking time plus 't' hours. Similarly, in the second case, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours is the total time, which is the walking time plus 't' hours.

So, if I let 't' be in hours, I can set up two equations.

First scenario:
Walking time at speed 's' km/h: distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. Then, plus 't' hours coffee time. So total time is 9/s + t = 4 hours.

Second scenario:
Walking speed is 's + 2' km/h. So walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. Plus 't' hours coffee time. Total time is 9/(s+2) + t = 2.4 hours.

So now I have two equations:
1. 9/s + t = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t = 2.4

Hmm, so now I can subtract the two equations to eliminate 't' and solve for 's'.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(9/s + t) - (9/(s + 2) + t) = 4 - 2.4
Simplify the left side:
9/s - 9/(s + 2) + t - t = 1.6
So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Now, let's compute this difference. Let me write it as:
9(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Compute the expression in the parentheses:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [(s + 2) - s]/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 9*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Which simplifies to:
18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Now, I can write this as:
18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6s(s + 2) = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

So, equation is:
18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

Let me rearrange this into standard quadratic form:
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0

Hmm, working with decimals might be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

16s^2 + 32s - 180 = 0

Wait, wait. Let me check: 1.6 *10=16, 3.2*10=32, 18*10=180. Yes, correct.

So, 16s^
