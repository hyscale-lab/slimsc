Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it properly.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest possible one, with a specific property. Whenever any one of its digits is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

First, I need to figure out what N could be. Since it's the greatest four-digit number, I'm thinking it's probably 9999 or close to it. But it must satisfy that condition: changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

Let me break down the problem. Let's denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits from 0 to 9, and A is at least 1 because it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that if I change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, if I replace A, B, C, or D with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

So, for example:

- Changing A to 1 gives 1BCD. So 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
- Changing B to 1 gives A1CD. So A1CD must be divisible by 7.
- Changing C to 1 gives AB1D. So AB1D must be divisible by 7.
- Changing D to 1 gives ABC1. So ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each position, we have a condition on N.

Let me think about how to model this. Let me write N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Now, when we change A to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, when changing B to 1, N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

When changing C to 1, N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

When changing D to 1, N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Alternatively, N1 ≡ N2 ≡ N3 ≡ N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, perhaps I can write equations for each of these.

Let me think about N1 first. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 can be expressed as (N - 1000A) + 1000.

Wait, because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = (1000 - 1000A) + N.

Wait, no. Let me think differently.

N1 is 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

So N1 mod 7 is (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) mod 7.

Similarly, N mod 7 is (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) mod 7.

But perhaps it would be helpful to consider the difference between N and N1.

Wait, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N - N1 = 1000A - 1000 = 1000(A - 1).

So, N = N1 + 1000(A - 1).

Since N1 is divisible by 7, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, let's compute 1000 mod 7. 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So 1000(A-1) ≡ 6(A-1) mod 7.

So N ≡ 6(A-1) mod 7.

But N must also satisfy that when we change other digits to 1, the result is divisible by 7. So maybe I can find N mod 7 in terms of other conditions as well.

Let me consider another case. Let's take N2, which is when B is changed to 1. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Similarly, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So N2 = N - (100B - 100) = N - 100(B - 1).

Since N2 is divisible by 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7. So N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7. So N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7.

Compute 100 mod 7. 100 ÷7 is 14*7=98. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

So 100(B-1) ≡ 2(B - 1) mod 7.

So N ≡ 2(B - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, for N3, which is when C is changed to 1. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

So N3 = N - (10C - 10) = N - 10(C - 1).

So N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 implies N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7.

10 mod7 is 3, so 10(C-1) ≡ 3(C - 1) mod7.

So N ≡ 3(C - 1) mod7.

Similarly, N4 is when D is changed to 1. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

So N4 = N - (D - 1).

So, N4 ≡ 0 mod7 implies N ≡ (D -1) mod7.

So, putting it all together:

From N1: N ≡ 6(A - 1) mod7.

From N2: N ≡ 2(B - 1) mod7.

From N3: N ≡ 3(C - 1) mod7.

From N4: N ≡ (D - 1) mod7.

Since all four expressions are equal to N mod7, they must be equal to each other.

So, 6(A - 1) ≡ 2(B - 1) ≡ 3(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod7.

Let me denote this common value as K mod7, where K = N mod7.

So, 6(A - 1) ≡ K mod7.

Similarly,

2(B - 1) ≡ K mod7,

3(C - 1) ≡ K mod7,

(D - 1) ≡ K mod7.

So, I can write equations for each digit:

1. 6(A - 1) ≡ K mod7 → 6A -6 ≡ K mod7 → 6A ≡ K +6 mod7.

2. 2(B - 1) ≡ K mod7 → 2B -2 ≡ K mod7 → 2B ≡ K +2 mod7.

3. 3(C - 1) ≡ K mod7 → 3C -3 ≡ K mod7 → 3C ≡ K +3 mod7.

4. (D -1) ≡ K mod7 → D ≡ K +1 mod7.

So, for each digit, I can express it in terms of K.

Let me write each digit's value modulo7.

1. 6A ≡ K +6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, because 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, A ≡ (K +6)*6 mod7.

Compute (K +6)*6 = 6K +36. 36 mod7 is 1, because 7*5=35, 36-35=1.

So, A ≡ (6K +1) mod7.

2. 2B ≡ K +2 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, B ≡ (K +2)*4 mod7.

Compute (K +2)*4 =4K +8. 8 mod7 is 1, so B ≡ (4K +1) mod7.

3. 3C ≡ K +3 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C ≡ (K +3)*5 mod7.

Compute (K +3)*5 =5K +15. 15 mod7 is 1, so C ≡ (5K +1) mod7.

4. D ≡ K +1 mod7.

So, each digit can be expressed in terms of K.

Now, since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), but A is at least 1 because it's a four-digit number.

But since A ≡ (6K +1) mod7, A can be written as 7m + (6K +1 mod7), but we can also compute A as a digit (0-9), so A can be (6K +1) mod7 or (6K +1) mod7 +7, considering that digits go up to 9.

Wait, let me think. For each digit, it's between 0 and 9, but for A, it's 1-9.

So, for each digit, their expressions modulo7 can give possible digit values.

Let me think of each digit as follows:

A ≡ (6K +1) mod7. So, A can be (6K +1) + 7t, where t is 0 or 1, because 6K+1 can be at most 6*6+1=37, but since K is mod7, K can be 0-6.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Wait, K is N mod7, so K can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

So for each K, we can find A, B, C, D mod7, and then see what digits they correspond to.

But since each digit is between 0 and 9, for A, which is between 1 and 9, the value of A must satisfy A ≡ (6K +1) mod7, which implies A can be (6K +1) or (6K +1) +7, depending on whether that's less than 10 or not.

Similarly, for B, C, D, which are between 0 and 9, their possible values are (for B: 4K +1 mod7, and either that or plus 7 if it's less than 10).

Wait, this might get a bit complicated, but perhaps I can approach this by considering possible K values (0-6) and for each K, compute A, B, C, D mod7, and then see what digits they can be, then reconstruct N, and find the maximum possible N.

Since N is a four-digit number, the maximum N is 9999, but it has to satisfy all these conditions.

So, let me proceed step by step. Let me list K from 0 to 6, and for each K, compute A, B, C, D, and then see what N would be.

Wait, but that's a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can find a way to represent A, B, C, D in terms of K, then express N in terms of K, and find the maximum N.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K such that all the digits (A, B, C, D) are as large as possible, since we're looking for the maximum N.

Let me try to express each digit in terms of K.

So:

A ≡ (6K +1) mod7.

But A is 1-9.

Similarly,

B ≡ (4K +1) mod7.

C ≡ (5K +1) mod7.

D ≡ (K +1) mod7.

But since A, B, C, D are digits, perhaps I can write each as:

A = (6K +1) + 7a,

B = (4K +1) + 7b,

C = (5K +1) + 7c,

D = (K +1) + 7d,

where a, b, c, d are integers such that each digit is between 0 and 9 (and A ≥1).

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to compute for each possible K (0-6), what each digit would be, and see which K allows the digits to be as large as possible, leading to the maximum N.

So let's start by considering K=0:

K=0:

A ≡ (6*0 +1) mod7 =1 mod7 → A=1 or 8.

But since we want the maximum N, we should take A=8 if possible.

B ≡ (4*0 +1) mod7 =1 mod7 → B=1 or 8.

Similarly, take B=8.

C ≡ (5*0 +1) mod7=1 mod7 → C=1 or 8.

Take C=8.

D ≡ (0 +1) mod7=1 mod7 → D=1 or 8.

Take D=8.

So N would be 8888.

Wait, but let's check if this N=8888 satisfies the condition. Let's see: if we change any digit to 1, does the number become divisible by 7?

So, numbers to check:

1888, 8188, 8818, 8881.

Check if each is divisible by 7.

1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5 → remainder 5. Not divisible by 7. So N=8888 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so K=0 gives N=8888, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So K=0 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check N=8888. When we change A to 1, we get 1888. Let's compute 1888 mod7.

Compute 1888 ÷7:

Well, 7 * 269 = 1883, as before. 1888 - 1883 =5, so 1888 ≡5 mod7. So not divisible by7. Hence N=8888 is invalid.

So K=0 is invalid.

Next, K=1:

Compute each digit mod7:

A ≡6*1 +1 =7 ≡0 mod7. So A can be 0 or 7. But A must be at least 1, so A=7.

B ≡4*1 +1=5 mod7. So B can be 5 or 12, but 12 is not a digit, so B=5.

C ≡5*1 +1=6 mod7. So C can be 6 or 13, which is invalid, so C=6.

D ≡1 +1=2 mod7. So D=2 or 9. To maximize N, take D=9.

So N=7 5 6 9 → 7569.

Now, let's check if this N=7569 satisfies the condition.

When we change each digit to 1, we get:

1569 → 1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, remainder 1. Not divisible by7.

So N=7569 is invalid.

Hmm, so K=1 gives N=7569 which doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, maybe I should check all four changes.

Change A to 1: 1569 → 1569 mod7: 1569 ÷7=224*7=1568, remainder 1. Not 0.

So yes, invalid.

Proceed to K=2.

K=2:

A ≡6*2 +1=13≡6 mod7. So A=6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So A=6.

B ≡4*2 +1=9≡2 mod7. So B=2 or 9. Take B=9.

C ≡5*2 +1=11≡4 mod7. So C=4 or 11→ invalid. So C=4.

D ≡2 +1=3 mod7. So D=3 or 10→ invalid. So D=3.

N=6 9 4 3 →6943.

Check the condition.

Change A to 1: 1943. Check 1943 ÷7.

7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4→ remainder 4. Not divisible by7.

So N=6943 invalid.

K=2 doesn't work.

K=3:

A ≡6*3 +1=19≡5 mod7. So A=5 or 12→ invalid. So A=5.

B ≡4*3 +1=13≡6 mod7. So B=6 or 13→ invalid. So B=6.

C ≡5*3 +1=16≡2 mod7. So C=2 or 9. Take C=9.

D ≡3 +1=4 mod7. So D=4 or 11→ invalid. So D=4.

N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Check condition.

Change A to 1: 1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694 → exactly divisible. So 1694 is good.

Change B to1: 5194.

5194 ÷7: Let's see, 7*742=5194. So yes, divisible.

Change C to1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614 → yes, divisible.

Change D to1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691 → yes, divisible.

So N=5694 satisfies the condition. Hmm, but we're looking for the greatest four-digit number. So maybe I can find a higher N with a different K.

Wait, but let's check for K=4.

K=4:

A ≡6*4 +1=25≡4 mod7. So A=4 or 11→ invalid. So A=4.

B ≡4*4 +1=17≡3 mod7. So B=3 or 10→ invalid. So B=3.

C ≡5*4 +1=21≡0 mod7. So C=0 or7. To maximize, take C=7.

D ≡4 +1=5 mod7. So D=5 or 12→ invalid. So D=5.

N=4 3 7 5 →4375.

Check condition.

Change A to1: 1375.

1375 ÷7: 7*196=1372, remainder 3→ not divisible.

So N=4375 invalid.

K=4 invalid.

K=5:

A ≡6*5 +1=31≡3 mod7. So A=3 or 10→ invalid. So A=3.

B ≡4*5 +1=21≡0 mod7. So B=0 or7. Take B=7.

C ≡5*5 +1=26≡5 mod7. So C=5 or 12→ invalid. So C=5.

D ≡5 +1=6 mod7. So D=6 or 13→ invalid. So D=6.

N=3 7 5 6 →3756.

Check condition.

Change A to1: 1756.

1756 ÷7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6→ remainder 6. Not divisible.

So N=3756 invalid.

K=5 invalid.

K=6:

A ≡6*6 +1=37≡2 mod7. So A=2 or9. Take A=9.

B ≡4*6 +1=25≡4 mod7. So B=4 or11→ invalid. So B=4.

C ≡5*6 +1=31≡3 mod7. So C=3 or10→ invalid. So C=3.

D ≡6 +1=7 mod7≡0. So D=0 or7. Take D=7.

N=9 4 3 7 →9437.

Now, check if this N=9437 satisfies the condition.

Change each digit to1:

- Changing A to1: 1437. Check 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2→ remainder 2. Not divisible.

So N=9437 invalid.

Hmm, that's a problem. So with K=6, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating N for K=6.

Wait, let me recheck:

K=6:

A ≡6*6 +1=37 mod7. 37 ÷7=5*7=35, remainder 2. So A=2 or 9. Since we want maximum N, take A=9.

B ≡4*6 +1=25≡4 mod7. So B=4 or 11, but 11 is invalid, so B=4.

C ≡5*6 +1=31≡3 mod7. So C=3 or 10, which is invalid, so C=3.

D ≡6 +1=7≡0 mod7. So D=0 or7. Take D=7.

So N=9437.

Now, when changing A to1, we get 1437. Let's compute 1437 mod7.

Another way: 1437 ÷7:

7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2, so 1437≡2 mod7. Not divisible.

So N=9437 doesn't satisfy condition.

Hmm, so so far, only K=3 gave us a valid N=5694. But perhaps there's a larger N possible with a higher K?

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any K. So K=0,1,2,3,4,5,6. We tried all, and only K=3 gave a valid N.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in checking K=3.

Wait, N=5694. Let's check each condition again to be thorough.

Change A to1: 1694. 1694 ÷7=242 exactly, since 7*240=1680, 1680 +14=1694. So yes, divisible.

Change B to1: 5194. Let me compute 5194 ÷7. 7*742=5194, because 7*(700)=4900, 7*40=280→ 4900+280=5180. Then 5180 +14=5194. So 742*7=5194. Correct.

Change C to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7. Let's see: 7*800=5600. 5600 +14=5614. So 802*7=5614. Correct.

Change D to1: 5691. 5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Because 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. Correct.

So N=5694 works.

But wait, is there a larger N than 5694 that satisfies the condition? Because 5694 is less than 9437, which we saw didn't work, but maybe there's another N between 5694 and 9999 that works.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, for K=3, N=5694 is the maximum. But perhaps I should check other possibilities where digits can be higher, but still satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps N doesn't have to be the maximum possible value for each digit based on K, but perhaps a different combination of digits could result in a higher N that still satisfies the conditions.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that for each digit, when changed to 1, the number is divisible by7. So perhaps N itself must be congruent to something mod7, and all these conditions tie together.

Wait, from N1: N ≡6(A−1) mod7.

From N2: N ≡2(B−1) mod7.

From N3: N ≡3(C−1) mod7.

From N4: N ≡D−1 mod7.

But all four are congruent to N mod7, so they must all be equal.

So, 6(A−1) ≡2(B−1)≡3(C−1)≡D−1 mod7.

Let me denote this common value as K. So,

6(A−1) ≡ K mod7,

2(B−1) ≡ K mod7,

3(C−1) ≡ K mod7,

D−1 ≡ K mod7.

So each digit can be expressed in terms of K, as I did before.

But perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me note that since N must be the largest possible four-digit number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the condition.

But that might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct N such that each digit, when replaced by 1, gives a number divisible by7.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as N being such that for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 gives a number ≡0 mod7.

So, perhaps I can write equations for each digit.

Let me denote N as ABCD, and write each condition:

1. 1BCD ≡0 mod7 → 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. A1CD ≡0 mod7 → 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. AB1D ≡0 mod7 → 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. ABC1 ≡0 mod7 → 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

Each of these four equations must hold.

I can express each equation in terms of N.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, 1BCD = 1000 + 100B +10C + D = (N - 1000A) + 1000.

So, (N - 1000A) +1000 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡1000A -1000 mod7.

Similarly, 1000 ≡6 mod7, as before.

So, N ≡6(A -1) mod7.

Similarly, for the second condition:

A1CD =1000A +100 +10C + D = (N -100B -10C -D) +100 +10C + D.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider N2 = A1CD =1000A + 100 +10C + D.

So, N2 ≡0 mod7 →1000A +100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7.

But N =1000A +100B +10C + D. So N2 = N -100B +100.

So, N2 = N + (100 -100B).

So, N2 ≡ N + (100 -100B) ≡0 mod7.

But 100 ≡2 mod7, so 100 -100B ≡2 -2B mod7.

So, N + (2 -2B) ≡0 mod7 → N ≡2B -2 mod7.

Similarly, from the first condition, we have N ≡6(A -1) mod7.

So, 6(A-1) ≡2B -2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4.

So, 6*4 (A-1) ≡ (2B -2)*4 mod7.

24(A-1) ≡8B -8 mod7.

But 24 mod7 is 3 (since 3*7=21, 24-21=3).

Similarly, 8 mod7 is 1, so 8B mod7 is B, and -8 mod7 is 6.

So, 3(A-1) ≡ B +6 mod7.

So, 3A -3 ≡ B +6 mod7 → 3A ≡ B +9 mod7 → 3A ≡ B +2 mod7 (since 9 mod7 is 2).

So, 3A ≡ B +2 mod7.

Similarly, from the third condition: AB1D ≡0 mod7.

AB1D =1000A +100B +10 + D.

Which is N -10C +10.

So, N -10C +10 ≡0 mod7.

Since N ≡ K mod7, and 10 ≡3 mod7, so:

N -10C +10 ≡ K -3C +3 ≡0 mod7 → K ≡3C -3 mod7.

But K is N mod7, so N ≡3(C -1) mod7.

Similarly, from the fourth condition: ABC1 =1000A +100B +10C +1.

Which is N - D +1.

So, N - D +1 ≡0 mod7 → N ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, N ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, putting it all together:

From condition1: N ≡6(A-1) mod7.

Condition2: N ≡2(B-1) mod7.

Condition3: N ≡3(C-1) mod7.

Condition4: N ≡ D -1 mod7.

And earlier we derived that 3A ≡ B +2 mod7.

So, that's another equation.

Maybe we can use these equations to find the digits.

Let me list the equations:

1. 3A ≡ B +2 mod7.

2. N ≡6(A−1) mod7.

3. N ≡2(B−1) mod7.

4. N ≡3(C−1) mod7.

5. N ≡D−1 mod7.

From equations 2 and 3:

6(A−1) ≡2(B−1) mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3(A−1) ≡ B−1 mod7.

So, 3A -3 ≡ B -1 mod7 →3A ≡ B +2 mod7, which is consistent with equation1. So that's consistent.

Similarly, from equation2 and equation4:

6(A−1) ≡3(C−1) mod7.

Divide both sides by3: 2(A−1) ≡ C−1 mod7.

So, 2A -2 ≡ C -1 mod7 →2A ≡ C +1 mod7.

Similarly, from equation2 and equation5:

6(A−1) ≡D−1 mod7.

So, 6A -6 ≡ D -1 mod7 →6A -5 ≡ D mod7.

So, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Now, let's try to express all digits in terms of A.

From equation1: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From 2A ≡C +1 mod7 → C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, B, C, D can be expressed in terms of A.

But we also know that each digit must be between 0-9 (except A, which is 1-9).

So, let's try possible A values from 9 down to 1, to find the maximum N.

Since we're looking for the greatest N, we'll start with A=9 and see if the other digits can be valid.

Case A=9:

B ≡3*9 -2=27-2=25≡4 mod7. So B=4 or 11→ invalid. So B=4.

C ≡2*9 -1=18-1=17≡3 mod7. So C=3 or 10→ invalid. So C=3.

D ≡6*9 -5=54-5=49≡0 mod7. So D=0 or7. To maximize, take D=7.

So, N=9437.

Wait, but earlier when I checked N=9437, changing A to1 gave 1437, which was not divisible by7. So N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier check. Let me double-check.

Wait, N=9437. Let's compute N1=1437.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2→ remainder 2. Not divisible by7.

So N=9437 invalid.

Proceeding to A=8.

A=8:

B ≡3*8 -2=24-2=22≡1 mod7. So B=1 or8. Take B=8.

C ≡2*8 -1=16-1=15≡1 mod7. So C=1 or8. Take C=8.

D ≡6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7. So D=1 or8. Take D=8.

So N=8888.

As before, check if N=8888 satisfies the condition.

Change A to1: 1888.

1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, remainder 5→ not divisible.

So N=8888 invalid.

A=7:

B ≡3*7 -2=21-2=19≡5 mod7. So B=5 or12→ invalid. So B=5.

C ≡2*7 -1=14-1=13≡6 mod7. So C=6 or13→ invalid. So C=6.

D ≡6*7 -5=42-5=37≡2 mod7. So D=2 or9. Take D=9.

N=7569.

Check condition:

Change A to1: 1569.

1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, remainder 1→ not divisible.

So N=7569 invalid.

A=6:

B ≡3*6 -2=18-2=16≡2 mod7. So B=2 or9. Take B=9.

C ≡2*6 -1=12-1=11≡4 mod7. So C=4 or11→ invalid. So C=4.

D ≡6*6 -5=36-5=31≡3 mod7. So D=3 or10→ invalid. So D=3.

N=6943.

Check condition:

Change A to1:1943.

1943 ÷7:7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4→ remainder4→ invalid.

So N=6943 invalid.

A=5:

B ≡3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So B=6 or13→ invalid. So B=6.

C ≡2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So C=2 or9. Take C=9.

D ≡6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So D=4 or11→ invalid. So D=4.

N=5694.

As before, this works. All four changes result in numbers divisible by7.

So, N=5694 is a valid number.

But wait, perhaps there's a higher N. Let's check A=5.

Wait, but we started from A=9 and went down, and only A=5 gives a valid N. So maybe N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, maybe for A=5, there's a way to get higher digits for B, C, D.

Wait, let's check A=5 again.

A=5:

B=6 (from earlier calculation).

C=9.

D=4.

So N=5 6 9 4=5694.

Is there a way to make N higher with A=5?

Wait, perhaps if B can be higher than 6 without violating the conditions.

Wait, B is determined by B ≡3A -2 mod7. For A=5, 3*5=15, 15-2=13≡6 mod7. So B must be 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So B=6.

Similarly, C=9 as the higher option, D=4. So N=5694.

Is there a higher N with a different A?

Let me try A=4.

A=4:

B ≡3*4 -2=12-2=10≡3 mod7. So B=3 or10→ invalid. So B=3.

C ≡2*4 -1=8-1=7≡0 mod7. So C=0 or7. Take C=7.

D ≡6*4 -5=24-5=19≡5 mod7. So D=5 or12→ invalid. So D=5.

N=4375.

Check condition:

Change A to1:1375.

1375 ÷7:7*196=1372, remainder3→ invalid.

So N=4375 invalid.

A=3:

B ≡3*3 -2=9-2=7≡0 mod7. So B=0 or7. Take B=7.

C ≡2*3 -1=6-1=5≡5 mod7. So C=5 or12→ invalid. So C=5.

D ≡6*3 -5=18-5=13≡6 mod7. So D=6 or13→ invalid. So D=6.

N=3756.

Check condition:

Change A to1:1756.

1756 ÷7:7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6→ remainder6→ invalid.

So N=3756 invalid.

A=2:

B ≡3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So B=4 or11→ invalid. So B=4.

C ≡2*2 -1=4-1=3 mod7. So C=3 or10→ invalid. So C=3.

D ≡6*2 -5=12-5=7≡0 mod7. So D=0 or7. Take D=7.

N=2437.

Check condition:

Change A to1:1437.

1437 ÷7:7*205=1435, remainder2→ invalid.

So N=2437 invalid.

A=1:

B ≡3*1 -2=3-2=1 mod7. So B=1 or8. Take B=8.

C ≡2*1 -1=2-1=1 mod7. So C=1 or8. Take C=8.

D ≡6*1 -5=6-5=1 mod7. So D=1 or8. Take D=8.

N=1888.

Check condition:

Change A to1:1888. Wait, that's the same as N, which is 1888.

Wait, 1888 ÷7:7*269=1883, remainder5→ not divisible.

So N=1888 invalid.

So, among all possible A values from 9 down to1, only A=5 gives a valid N=5694.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check if there are any other possibilities when A=5.

Wait, when A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. But perhaps if D can be 11, but that's invalid since D must be a single digit. So D=4 is the maximum possible.

So, N=5694 is the maximum possible four-digit number satisfying the condition.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of K=3, I got N=5694. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R when N is divided by1000. So, N=5694.

Dividing 5694 by1000, the quotient Q is 5, and the remainder R is 694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm N=5694 is indeed the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier when I tried K=3, I got N=5694, which worked. But I thought of a larger N=9437, but it didn't work. So perhaps N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

But another thought: perhaps there's a higher N than 5694 that satisfies all the conditions. Let me think.

Wait, let me try A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, which gives N=5694.

If I try to increase D to 8, would that work? Let's see.

Wait, D is determined by D ≡6A -5 mod7. For A=5, D≡6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So D=4 or 11→ D=4 is the only valid digit.

So, D must be 4 when A=5. So, I can't make D=8 in this case.

Similarly, can I make C=9 or higher? Well, C=9 is the maximum possible when C≡2A -1 mod7.

For A=5, 2A-1=10-1=9≡2 mod7→ C=9 is possible.

So, yes, C=9 is the maximum.

Similarly, B=6 is the maximum possible for B≡3A-2 mod7 when A=5.

So, I think N=5694 is indeed the maximum possible.

Thus, Q=5, R=694, Q+R=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) and \( R \) are the quotient and remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - Let \( N \) be a four-digit number \( ABCD \).
   - Changing any digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7:
     - \( 1BCD \), \( A1CD \), \( AB1D \), \( ABC1 \) must all be divisible by 7.

2. **Expressing \( N \) in Terms of Its Digits**:
   - \( N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D \).
   - When a digit is changed to 1, the new number must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

3. **Deriving Congruences**:
   - From each condition, we derive:
     - \( 6(A - 1) \equiv 2(B - 1) \equiv 3(C - 1) \equiv D - 1 \pmod{7} \).
   - Let this common value be \( K \pmod{7} \).

4. **Expressing Digits in Terms of \( K \)**:
   - \( A \equiv (6K + 1) \pmod{7} \).
   - \( B \equiv (4K + 1) \pmod{7} \).
   - \( C \equiv (5K + 1) \pmod{7} \).
   - \( D \equiv (K + 1) \pmod{7} \).

5. **Checking Possible Values of \( K \) (0 to 6)**:
   - For each \( K \), compute \( A, B, C, D \) and check if \( N \) satisfies all conditions.
   - After testing all \( K \) values, only \( K = 3 \) yields a valid \( N = 5694 \).

6. **Verifying \( N = 5694 \)**:
   - Changing each digit to 1 results in numbers divisible by 7:
     - \( 1694 \div 7 = 242 \) (exact).
     - \( 5194 \div 7 = 742 \) (exact).
     - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact).
     - \( 5691 \div 7 = 813 \) (exact).

7. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - Divide \( N = 5694 \) by 1000:
     - \( Q = 5 \), \( R = 694 \).
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
