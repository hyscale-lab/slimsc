Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. 

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that's an interesting condition. I think I can use coordinates or vector methods, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach using triangle properties.

Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: 

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me check the formula. Oh, right, the formula is indeed OI² = R² - 2Rr. So plugging in R = 13 and r = 6, we get OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use some right triangle properties here. Let me consider triangle OIA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at A. Wait, is that correct? No, wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is between IA and OI. So the triangle is actually OIA with a right angle at I? Wait, no, because IA is the segment from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So point A is such that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram. Let me visualize this. Point O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. IA is a segment from I to A,
