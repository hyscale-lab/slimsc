Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what exactly that means.

The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, my goal is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy those two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

First, let's break down what it means for n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. So d1 must be between 1 and b-1, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, n = d1 * b + d0, with d1 ∈ {1, 2, ..., b-1} and d0 ∈ {0, 1, ..., b-1}.

The second condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, let's write that out:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n) → sqrt(n) = s, where s is a positive integer.

Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So, n = s².

Putting it all together, we have:

s² = d1 * b + d0

and

s = d1 + d0.

So, substituting s into the first equation:

(d1 + d0)² = d1 * b + d0

Let me expand the left side:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to collect like terms:

d1² + 2*d1*d0 + d0² - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it differently or factor it somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps express b in terms of the other variables. Let me try that.

From the equation:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me solve for b:

b = [ (d1 + d0)^2 - d0 ] / d1

Simplify numerator:

(d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0) / d1

Which can be written as:

d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1

Since b must be an integer (as it's a base), this expression must result in an integer. Therefore, (d0^2 - d0) must be divisible by d1.

So, (d0^2 - d0) mod d1 must be zero.

Let me write that condition:

d0^2 ≡ d0 mod d1

Which simplifies to:

d0(d0 - 1) ≡ 0 mod d1

So, d1 must divide d0(d0 - 1).

Given that d0 and d0 -1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, d1 must divide either d0 or d0 -1, but since d1 is a digit in base b, it's at least 1 and at most b-1.

Wait, but d0 can be from 0 to b-1, and d1 is from 1 to b-1.

So, for each base b, and digits d1 and d0, we have to check whether d1 divides d0(d0 - 1). But since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, they can vary based on b.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this problem by fixing d1 and d0, then solving for b.

But since b is the base, and d1 and d0 are digits, they are dependent on b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this equation and see for each possible d1 and d0, whether b is an integer, and then count how many such n exist for each b.

But considering that b must be at least 2, and n must be a two-digit number in base b, the smallest n is 10_base_b which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1. So n must be between b and b² -1.

Moreover, n is s², so s² must be in [b, b² -1], which implies that s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.

So, s is an integer such that ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ s ≤ b-1.

Let me note that:

s = d1 + d0

And from n = s² = d1*b + d0.

So, for each s, we can write:

d1*b + d0 = s²

And d1 + d0 = s.

So, subtracting the second equation from the first:

d1*b + d0 - (d1 + d0) = s² - s

Which simplifies to:

d1*(b - 1) = s(s - 1)

So, we have d1 = [s(s - 1)] / (b - 1)

But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, [s(s - 1)] must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer d1 in [1, b-1].

Additionally, since d0 = s - d1, d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1.

So, given s, we can express d1 as s(s - 1)/(b -1), and then check if d1 is integer, and if d0 is within 0 to b-1.

But perhaps it's easier to express b in terms of s and d1.

Wait, from d1*(b -1) = s(s -1), we can write:

b = [s(s -1) / d1] + 1

Since b must be an integer, s(s -1) must be divisible by d1.

Also, since d1 is a digit, 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b -1.

But b is expressed in terms of s and d1, so perhaps we can approach this by fixing s and d1, then compute b, and check whether d0 is within the allowed range.

Wait, but s and
