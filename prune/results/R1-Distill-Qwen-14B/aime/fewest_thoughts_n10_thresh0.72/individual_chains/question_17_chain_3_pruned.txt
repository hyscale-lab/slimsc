Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set 𝒜. Each box in this set has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So, given those, I can set up equations.

Let me write down the given information:

Surface area, S = 54 = 2(lw + lh + wh)
Volume, V = 23 = lwh

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² = (d²)/4 = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (l² + w² + h²). Thus, I need to find the minimum value of l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to minimize l² + w² + h² with the given constraints. This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some other method. Alternatively, perhaps by using inequalities like AM ≥ GM or something else.

Wait, let me think. Maybe I can express l² + w² + h² in terms of the surface area and volume. I remember that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). So, from that, l² + w² + h² = (l + w + h)² - 2(lw + lh + wh). 

We know that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54, so lw + lh + wh = 27. Therefore, l² + w² + h² = (l + w + h)² - 2*27 = (l + w + h)² - 54.

So, if I can find (l + w + h), I can compute l² + w² + h². But how?

I also know that the volume V = lwh = 23. So, perhaps I can relate l + w + h to lw + lh + wh and lwh.

I know that for three variables, the relationship between their sum, sum of products, and product is part of the symmetric polynomials in algebra. Maybe I can set variables a = l, b = w, c = h. Then, a + b + c = S, ab + ac + bc = 27, and abc = 23. Then, I need to find a² + b² + c², which is S² - 2*27.

But I don't know S. So, perhaps I can find S in terms of something else. Alternatively, if I can find the minimum of S² - 54, which would be the same as minimizing S², since 54 is a constant.

Wait, but I don't know if S is constrained. Maybe I can find the minimal possible value of S² given the constraints on ab + ac + bc and abc.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the relationship between the arithmetic mean and other means, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality on the terms a, b, c.

The AM-GM inequality says that (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

Given that abc = 23, (abc)^(1/3) = 23^(1/3). So, (a + b + c)/3 ≥ 23^(1/3). Therefore, a + b + c ≥ 3 * 23^(1/3). So, S ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3). But is this the minimal S?

Wait, but I also have the constraint that ab + ac + bc = 27. So, perhaps S can't be just any value; it's linked via the constraints. Maybe I need to use Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me try that. Let's set up the problem using Lagrange multipliers. We have two constraints:

1. ab + ac + bc = 27
2. abc = 23

And we want to minimize S² = (a + b + c)^2, which is equivalent to minimizing a + b + c.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier I thought that l² + w² + h² = S² - 54, so if I minimize l² + w² + h², that would be equivalent to minimizing S². So, the problem reduces to minimizing S² given ab + ac + bc = 27 and abc = 23.

So, I can set up the Lagrangian function:

L = a + b + c + λ(27 - ab - ac - bc) + μ(23 - abc)

Wait, no, actually, since we are minimizing (a + b + c)^2, but perhaps it's better to directly set up to minimize a + b + c, since the square is a monotonic function for positive values.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set up the Lagrangian for the function f(a,b,c) = a + b + c, subject to the constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + ac + bc = 27 and h(a,b,c) = abc = 23.

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = a + b + c + λ(27 - ab - ac - bc) + μ(23 - abc)

Then, to find the extrema, we take the partial derivatives of L with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂a = 1 - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂b = 1 - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0
∂L/∂c = 1 - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

And the constraints:
ab + ac + bc = 27
abc = 23

So, we have a system of equations:

1. 1 - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0
2. 1 - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0
3. 1 - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0
4. ab + ac + bc = 27
5. abc = 23

Hmm, this looks complicated, but perhaps we can find symmetry here. Suppose that a = b = c. Then, the box would be a cube. Let's check if this is possible.

If a = b = c, then ab + ac + bc = 3a² = 27 → a² = 9 → a = 3.

Then, the volume would be a³ = 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not possible here. Therefore, the minimal S may not correspond to a cube, so a, b, c are not all equal.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume that a = b ≠ c.

Then, let me denote a = b. So,

From the constraints:

ab + ac + bc = a² + 2ac = 27
abc = a²c = 23

Let me solve for c from the second equation: c = 23/(a²)

Substitute into the first equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) = 27
Simplify:

a² + (46/a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

a³ + 46 = 27a
Bring all terms to left:

a³ -27a +46 =0

Hmm, so we have a cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 =0

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test a=1: 1 -27 +46 =20 ≠0

a=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So, factor out (a -2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a -2):

Coefficients: 1, 0, -27, 46

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2   -23 0

So, the cubic factors as (a -2)(a² + 2a -23)=0

Thus, the other roots are from a² +2a -23=0 → a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since a is a length, it must be positive. So, a=2, or a= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898, or a= -1-2√6, which is negative, so discard.

So, possible a are a=2 and a= -1 + 2√6.

So, when a=2, then from c=23/(a²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be a=b=2, c=23/4.

Then, let's compute S = a + b + c =2 +2 +23/4 =4 +5.75=9.75=39/4.

Compute l² + w² + h² = a² + a² + c² = 4 +4 + (23/4)²=8 + 529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

Thus, r²= (657/16)/4=657/(64)=657/64.

Wait, but let me check the other solution where a= -1 +2√6.

Compute a= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898.

Then, c=23/(a²). Let's compute a²:

a² = (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, c=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]= (23*(25 +4√6))/(625 - 16*6)= (23*(25 +4√6))/(625 -96)= (23*(25 +4√6))/529.

Simplify 529 is 23², so 529=23².

Thus, c=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, a = -1 +2√6, b=a, c=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now compute S= a + b + c = 2a + c = 2*(-1 +2√6) + (25 +4√6)/23.

Compute this:

2*(-1 +2√6)= -2 +4√6.

Add (25 +4√6)/23:

So, S= (-2 +4√6) + (25 +4√6)/23.

Let me write -2 as (-46/23) so that it has the same denominator as the other terms.

So, S= (-46/23) +4√6 +25/23 + (4√6)/23.

Combine the constants: (-46 +25)/23 = (-21)/23.

Combine the √6 terms:4√6 + (4√6)/23 = (92√6 +4√6)/23 = (96√6)/23.

So, S= (-21/23) + (96√6)/23 = ( -21 +96√6 ) /23.

Hmm, that's positive because 96√6 ≈96*2.45≈235.2, so 235.2-21≈214.2, so 214.2/23≈9.313, which is positive.

So, S≈9.313, which is less than the previous case where S=39/4=9.75. So, this is a better (smaller) value of S, leading to a smaller l² +w² +h².

Therefore, perhaps the minimal l² +w² +h² is achieved when two variables are equal to -1 +2√6, and the third is (25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, but let me compute l² +w² +h² in this case.

Since a = b = (-1 +2√6), and c=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, a² + b² + c² = 2a² + c².

Compute a² = (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, 2a²=50 -8√6.

Compute c²= [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]²= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, total l² +w² +h²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 and -8√6 to over denominator 529:

50 = 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6 *529/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, l² +w² +h²= [26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6 ] /529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171.

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6).

So, numerator=27171 -4032√6.

Therefore, l² +w² +h²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Then, r²= (l² +w² +h²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the minimal l² +w² +h² occurs when a = b ≠ c, but perhaps it's when all are equal, but that's not possible because volume is 23, which is less than 27.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not assume a = b, but instead use Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, from the earlier Lagrangian equations:

1. 1 - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0
2. 1 - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0
3. 1 - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

From equations 1 and 2:

1 - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 1 - λ(a + c) - μ(ac)

Subtract 1 from both sides:

-λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = -λ(a + c) - μ(ac)

Multiply both sides by (-1):

λ(b + c) + μ(bc) = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)

Bring like terms to one side:

λ(b + c - a - c) + μ(bc - ac) =0

Simplify:

λ(b - a) + μ c (b - a) =0

Factor out (b - a):

(λ + μ c)(b - a) =0

So, either b = a, or λ + μ c =0.

Similarly, comparing equations 1 and 3:

1 - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 1 - λ(a + b) - μ(ab)

Subtract 1, rearrange:

λ(b + c - a - b) + μ(bc - ab)=0

Simplify:

λ(c - a) + μ b (c - a)=0

Factor out (c - a):

(λ + μ b)(c - a)=0

So, either c = a, or λ + μ b =0.

So, from the above, either a = b = c (which we saw is not possible because volume would be 27, but we have 23), or some relations where some variables are equal, or expressions involving λ and μ.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal l² +w² +h² occurs when two variables are equal, which is what I tried earlier, leading to a=2, c=23/4, but then I found another solution with a= -1 +2√6, c=(25 +4√6)/23, which gave a smaller S, but I'm not sure if that's the minimal.

Wait, but perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible, given the constraints. Let me check if when a=2, c=23/4, which is 5.75, which is a box with dimensions 2,2,5.75.

Alternatively, when a= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898, and c≈ (25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, the dimensions are approximately 3.898,3.898,1.513.

Wait, but then the space diagonal would be sqrt(3.898² +3.898² +1.513²)≈sqrt(15.19 +15.19 +2.289)≈sqrt(32.669)=~5.715. So, radius would be ~2.857, so r²≈8.16.

In the earlier case, when a=2, c=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(2² +2² +5.75²)=sqrt(4+4+33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.409, so r²≈10.09.

So, the second case gives a smaller r², so it's better. So, perhaps the minimal r² occurs when a=b≈3.898 and c≈1.513.

But wait, perhaps that's not the minimal. Maybe the minimal occurs when all three variables are different. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substituting variables.

Let me consider that from ab + ac + bc =27, I can write this as ab + c(a + b)=27.

And from abc=23, c=23/(ab).

Substitute into the previous equation:

ab + (23/(ab))*(a + b) =27.

Let me denote s = a + b and p = ab.

Then, the equation becomes:

p + (23/p)*s =27.

But I also know that in terms of s and p, a² + b² = s² - 2p.

Wait, but in our problem, we have a² + b² + c² = (a² + b²) + c² = (s² - 2p) + (23/(ab))² = s² -2p + (529)/(p²).

So, the expression to minimize is s² -2p + 529/p².

But we also have the equation p + (23 s)/p =27.

So, perhaps I can express s in terms of p, and substitute into the expression to minimize.

From p + (23 s)/p =27 → (23 s)/p =27 - p → s= [p*(27 - p)]/(23).

So, s= [p(27 - p)]/23.

Now, substitute s into the expression for a² + b² + c²:

E = s² -2p + 529/p².

Substituting s² = [p²(27 - p)^2]/(23²).

So,

E = [p²(27 - p)^2]/(529) -2p + 529/p².

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can find the derivative of E with respect to p and find the minimum.

Let me denote E(p) = [p²(27 - p)^2]/529 -2p + 529/p².

Compute the derivative E’(p):

First term: d/dp [p²(27 - p)^2 /529]
Use product rule:

Let me write it as (p²)(27 - p)^2 /529.

Derivative = [2p*(27 - p)^2 + p²*2*(27 - p)*(-1)] /529.

Simplify numerator:

2p(27 - p)^2 -2p²(27 - p) = 2p(27 - p)[(27 - p) - p] = 2p(27 - p)(27 -2p).

So, derivative of first term is [2p(27 - p)(27 -2p)] /529.

Second term: d/dp (-2p) = -2.

Third term: d/dp (529/p²) = -2*529/p^3 = -1058/p^3.

So, overall,

E’(p) = [2p(27 - p)(27 -2p)]/529 -2 -1058/p^3.

Set E’(p)=0:

[2p(27
