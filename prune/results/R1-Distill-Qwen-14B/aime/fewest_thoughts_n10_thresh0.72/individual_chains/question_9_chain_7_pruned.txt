Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but there are some properties that might help here. Let me recall the change of base formula. The logarithm of a number a with base b is equal to log(a)/log(b), right? So maybe I can apply this to both equations.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the change of base formula, this would be equal to log(y^x)/log(x). But wait, there's another logarithm property: log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a). So log(y^x) is x*log_x(y). So putting it all together, the first equation becomes x*log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same approach, that's log(x^{4y})/log(y) which is 4y*log_y(x). So the second equation is 4y*log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I notice that in both equations, the logarithm terms are log_x(y) and log_y(x). I also remember that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the first equation, we have x*k = 10. And the second equation becomes 4y*(1/k) = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. x*k = 10
2. (4y)/k = 10

I can solve these two equations to find x and y in terms of k, and then maybe find k.

From the first equation, x = 10/k. From the second equation, (4y) = 10k, so y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

Now, I also know that log_x(y) = k. Let me express this as log_x(y) = k.

Since log_x(y) is k, that means x^k = y. Because by definition, if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So from this, we have x^k = y. But we already have x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2.

So substituting x and y into x^k = y, we get:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2].

Using the logarithm power rule on the left side: k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2).

So, k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5k/2).

Let me write that out:

k*(ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5k/2).

Expanding the left side:

k*ln(10) - k*ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

Wait, because ln(5k/2) is ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2). So, that's the right side.

So the equation becomes:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

Let me collect like terms. Bring all terms to the left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0.

Hmm, looks a bit messy. Let me factor where possible.

Looking at the terms with ln(k):

- k ln(k) - ln(k) = - (k + 1) ln(k).

And the constants:

k ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2).

Wait, let's compute the numerical values of the constants where possible. Let me calculate ln(10), ln(5), ln(2):

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585093

ln(5) ≈ 1.609437912

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147181

So substituting these values in, the equation becomes:

k*(2.302585093) - (k +1)*(ln(k)) - (1.609437912) + 0.693147181 = 0.

Simplify the constants: -1.609437912 + 0.693147181 = -0.916290731.

So:

2.302585093 * k - (k + 1)*ln(k) - 0.916290731 = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe I can
