Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles in a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And the problem says that the sides of the rectangles can be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not too important right now. What's more important is how the sides and diagonals can form rectangles.

I remember that in a regular polygon, the number of sides determines the number of diagonals. But wait, for a rectangle, we need four points that form right angles. In a regular dodecagon, how can four points form a rectangle?

Let me think. In a regular polygon, if you select four vertices such that the sides between them are equal and the angles are right angles, then you have a rectangle. Alternatively, maybe the sides can be made up of sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, the problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle is either an edge of the dodecagon or a diagonal. That means that the sides of the rectangle can be of varying lengths, depending on how many edges apart the vertices are.

I think the key here is to find all possible sets of four points in the dodecagon that form a rectangle, where the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

How can I approach this? Maybe by looking at the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetry. So perhaps rectangles can be categorized based on their orientation or the lengths of their sides.

An alternative approach is to consider that in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be thought of as vectors. So, if I can find two vectors that are perpendicular and of the same length, their combinations can form rectangles.

Wait, but how do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals?

Let me think differently. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles can be determined by considering how many pairs of parallel sides can form the opposite sides of a rectangle.

But in a regular
