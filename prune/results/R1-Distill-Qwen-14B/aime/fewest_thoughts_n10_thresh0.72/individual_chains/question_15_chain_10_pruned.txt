Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, each path is made up of a series of steps either to the right or upwards. For an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, the total number of possible paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's the total number, and I need only those that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction... So, each time the path changes from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. For example, starting by going right several times, then switching to up, then back to right, and so on. Each switch counts as a direction change.

So, if the path changes direction exactly four times, how does that translate into the number of segments of right and up moves? Let me think. Each direction change alternates between right and up. So, if I start with a right move, the first change would be to up, the second change back to right, third to up, and the fourth would be back to right. So, the path would have 5 segments: right, up, right, up, right. Alternatively, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. Either way, four direction changes result in five segments.

But wait, in the grid, the path can't have more segments than the number of direction changes plus one. So, exactly four direction changes mean five segments. Each segment is a consecutive set of steps either to the right or up.

Now, each segment must consist of at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of zero length; otherwise, that would mean not moving in that direction at all, which isn't allowed since you need to reach the opposite corner. So, each of the five segments must have at least one step.

But how do these steps distribute between right and up? Let's consider the starting direction. Let's assume the path starts by moving right.
