Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then figure out r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh, right? So the box has surface area 54 and volume 23. So, I can write those down as equations:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
lwh = 23

I think I need to find the dimensions of the box that would minimize the maximum distance from the center to any corner, because the sphere's radius would be half of the space diagonal of the box. So, the space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), and the radius r would be d/2, so r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize (l² + w² + h²)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Let me see, how do I approach this? Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers because it's a constrained optimization problem. That sounds right.

So, I need to minimize f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h², subject to the constraints:

g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0
h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0

Since there are two constraints, I might need to use two Lagrange multipliers, say λ and μ, and set up the system of equations.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

Then, taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ(2w + 2h) - μ(wh) = 0
∂L/∂w = 2w - λ(2l + 2h) - μ(lh) = 0
∂L/∂h = 2h - λ(2l + 2w) - μ(lw) = 0

And of course, the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
lwh = 23

Hmm, this gives me a system of five equations with four variables l, w, h, λ, μ. Maybe I can find some symmetry or relations between l, w, h.

Looking at the partial derivatives, I notice that the equations for l, w, h are symmetric. If I assume that l = w = h, is that possible? Wait, but if all sides are equal, then it's a cube. Let me check if a cube can satisfy the given surface area and volume.

For a cube, surface area is 6l² = 54, so l² = 9, so l = 3. Then, volume would be l³ = 27, but the volume given is 23. So that's not a cube. So, the box isn't a cube, so l, w, h aren't all equal. So I can't assume that. Hmm.

But maybe two sides are equal? Let's suppose l = w. Then perhaps I can reduce the variables.

Let me set l = w, so let's let l = w = a, and h = b. Then, the surface area becomes 2(a² + ab + ab) = 2(a² + 2ab) = 54. So, a² + 2ab = 27. And the volume is a²b = 23.

I have two equations:

1. a² + 2ab = 27
2. a²b = 23

I can try to solve for b from the second equation: b = 23/(a²). Then plug into the first equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) = 27
Simplify:

a² + (46/a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 = 27a

So, a³ -27a +46 = 0

Hmm, cubic equation. Let me see if I can find a real root
