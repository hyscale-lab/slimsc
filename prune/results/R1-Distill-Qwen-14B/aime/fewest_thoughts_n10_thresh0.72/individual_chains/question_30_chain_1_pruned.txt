Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω¹³ = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which I think is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not entirely sure if that's relevant here. Let me think.

The expression I need to compute is the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). So that's a product over all the 13th roots of unity, except ω⁰ = 1, since ω ≠ 1. Wait, no, the product starts at k=0, so it includes ω⁰ = 1 as one of the factors. Hmm, but the problem says ω ≠ 1, so maybe when k=0, ω⁰ = 1, but in that case, the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1²) which is (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So that first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can consider the product from k=1 to 12 instead, but it shouldn't make a difference since multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything.

So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but since the term for k=0 is 1, it's effectively the same as the product from k=1 to 12. So maybe I can work with that.

Now, looking at each term, 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let me see if I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form. Let's factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ωᵏ) + ω²ᵏ. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can see if this is a geometric series or something.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the expression can be related to ωᵏ somehow. Let me denote z = ωᵏ, so each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So the term is z² - 2z + 2. Let's see if that quadratic factors or has roots. The discriminant is ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So each term in the product is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) where z = ωᵏ. So the whole product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (ωᵏ - (1 + i))(ωᵏ - (1 - i)).

Wait, but since the product is over all ωᵏ, which are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1, but as I saw earlier, maybe it's symmetric.

I recall that the product over all roots of unity of (x - ωᵏ) is equal to x¹³ - 1. Because the roots of x¹³ - 1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So, more formally, we have:

Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ωᵏ) = x¹³ - 1.

But in this case
