Alright, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So right away, I remember that hyperbolas have two branches, and this one opens to the left and right because the positive term is with x². The center is at the origin, which makes sense because there are no shifts in the equation.

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay. So the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, and since they intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other, right? So that means the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. Also, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. 

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, I can think of the points A and C as being endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D as endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). 

Wait, but ABCD is a rhombus, so the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must all be equal in length. So, perhaps I can express the coordinates of these points in terms of some parameters, and then use the properties of the rhombus to set up equations.

Let me think about the coordinates. Let's suppose that the points are as follows:
- Point A is (x, y)
- Point C is (-x, -y)
- Point B is (p, q)
- Point D is (-p, -q)

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must all have the same length. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

Alternatively, since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, perhaps I can use vector approaches or coordinate geometry to find the conditions.

Wait, maybe I can parametrize
