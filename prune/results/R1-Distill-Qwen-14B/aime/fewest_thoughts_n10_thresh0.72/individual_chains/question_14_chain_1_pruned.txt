Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again carefully.

We need to find the greatest four-digit number, let's call it N. The special property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once we find N, we have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient (Q) and the remainder (R).

Hmm, four-digit number, so N is between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with that property. Interesting.

So, the main challenge is figuring out what N is. Let's break down the problem.

First, let's understand the property: changing any single digit to 1 should make the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the resulting number is a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

So, replacing each digit one by one with 1:

1. Replace A with 1: 1BCD. This number must be divisible by 7.
2. Replace B with 1: A1CD. This must be divisible by 7.
3. Replace C with 1: AB1D. This must be divisible by 7.
4. Replace D with 1: ABC1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, N is such that all these four numbers are divisible by 7.

We need to find the largest such N.

Since N is the greatest, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number that satisfies all four conditions.

But checking each number one by one might take too long. So maybe we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model each condition mathematically and find constraints on N.

Let me try that approach.

First, let's write N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Replacing C with 1 gives N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Replacing D with 1 gives N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So:

N1 ≡ 0 mod7
N2 ≡ 0 mod7
N3 ≡ 0 mod7
N4 ≡ 0 mod7

Which can be written as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7

So we have four congruences.

Let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

Since 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, because 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So now, let's rewrite the four congruences with these values.

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So now we have four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 --> 2B + 3C + D ≡-6 ≡1 mod7 (since -6 +7=1)
Equation 2: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 -->6A + 3C + D ≡-2 ≡5 mod7
Equation 3:6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7 -->6A + 2B + D ≡-3 ≡4 mod7
Equation 4:6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7 -->6A + 2B + 3C ≡-1 ≡6 mod7

So now, we have:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 ...(1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7 ...(2)
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7 ...(3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7 ...(4)

Now, let's see if we can express D from some equations and substitute.

From Equation (1):

2B + 3C + D ≡1 ⇒ D ≡1 - 2B -3C mod7 ...(1a)

From Equation (2):

6A + 3C + D ≡5 ⇒ D ≡5 -6A -3C mod7 ...(2a)

Set (1a) and (2a) equal:

1 -2B -3C ≡5 -6A -3C mod7

Simplify:

1 -2B ≡5 -6A mod7

Bring all terms to left:

1 -2B -5 +6A ≡0 ⇒6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

3A - B -2 ≡0 mod7 ⇒3A - B ≡2 mod7 ...(5)

So equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's try to get another equation involving A and B.

From Equation (3):

6A + 2B + D ≡4 ⇒D ≡4 -6A -2B mod7 ...(3a)

From Equation (1a): D ≡1 -2B -3C mod7.

Setting equal:

4 -6A -2B ≡1 -2B -3C mod7

Simplify:

4 -6A ≡1 -3C mod7

Bring all terms to left:

4 -6A -1 +3C ≡0 ⇒-6A +3C +3 ≡0 mod7

Multiply both sides by (-1):

6A -3C -3 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6A -3C ≡3 mod7

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

2A - C ≡1 mod7 ...(6)

So equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Now, from equation (4):

6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7.

But from equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7 ⇒ B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So substitute B in equation (4):

6A + 2*(3A -2) +3C ≡6 mod7

Compute:

6A +6A -4 +3C ≡6 mod7 ⇒12A -4 +3C ≡6 mod7.

Simplify 12A mod7: 12 mod7 is 5, so 5A.

So 5A -4 +3C ≡6 mod7.

Bring constants to right:

5A +3C ≡6 +4 mod7 ⇒5A +3C ≡10 mod7 ⇒10 mod7 is 3.

So now, equation (4a): 5A +3C ≡3 mod7.

But from equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7 ⇒ C ≡2A -1 mod7.

Substitute C into equation (4a):

5A +3*(2A -1) ≡3 mod7.

Compute:

5A +6A -3 ≡3 mod7 ⇒11A -3 ≡3 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4, so:

4A -3 ≡3 mod7 ⇒4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 4 is 2.

So A ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

So A ≡5 mod7. Since A is a digit (1-9), possible values are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid, so A=5.

So A=5.

Now, from equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7. Since A=5, 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So 1 - B ≡2 mod7 ⇒-B ≡1 mod7 ⇒B ≡-1 ≡6 mod7.

So B can be 6 or 13, but since B is a digit (0-9), B=6.

Now from equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7. A=5, so 2*5=10≡3 mod7.

So 3 - C ≡1 mod7 ⇒-C ≡-2 mod7 ⇒C ≡2 mod7.

So C can be 2 or 9 (since 2+7=9). But since N is the greatest possible four-digit number, we should try higher digits first. So let's try C=9 first and see if it works, and if not, try C=2.

So C=9.

Now, from equation (1a): D ≡1 -2B -3C mod7. B=6, C=9.

Compute 2B=12, 3C=27.

So 12 mod7 is 5, 27 mod7 is 6.

So 1 -5 -6 =1 -11=-10≡-10+14=4 mod7.

So D ≡4 mod7. So possible D values are 4 and 11, but since D is a digit, D=4.

So now, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

So N=5694.

But wait, let's check if this N satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, but before that, let's see if C=2 is possible, because maybe N could be higher.

Wait, C=9 gives N=5694. If we try C=2, then N would be 5624, which is smaller. So since we're looking for the greatest N, we'd prefer C=9, which gives a higher N.

But let's confirm whether N=5694 satisfies all four conditions.

So, let's generate N1, N2, N3, N4 and check divisibility by 7.

First, N=5694.

Replace A with 1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by 7?

Compute 1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694? Let's see: 7*240=1680, 7*2=14, so 1680+14=1694. Yes, correct.

Replace B with1: 5194. Check 5194 ÷7.

Let me compute 7*742=5194? 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes.

Replace C with1: 5614. Check 5614 ÷7.

7*802=5614? 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. Yes.

Replace D with1: 5691. Check 5691 ÷7.

7*813=5691. Let's see: 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. Yes.

So all four numbers are divisible by 7. So N=5694 seems to satisfy all conditions.

But wait, is there
