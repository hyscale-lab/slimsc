Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along x because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). The b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). 

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, since it's a rhombus, both diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square, but wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, I think I was confused. Let me double-check. 

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, in this case, the origin is the intersection point of the diagonals, which are perpendicular. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, this means that if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). 

So, all four points are on the hyperbola. So, substituting A into the hyperbola equation: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly, B must satisfy p²/20 - q²/24 = 1. 

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, and so on. Wait, but given that the diagonals are perpendicular, there might be another way to approach this. Because in a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals, the sides can be calculated using the lengths of the diagonals.

Wait, let me recall: in a rhombus, each side can be expressed as (d1/2 * d2/2) / (sin(theta/2)), but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the area is (d1*d2)/2, and the sides can be found using the Pythagorean theorem if the diagonals are perpendicular. Because each side would be half the length of each diagonal.

Wait, no. If the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). So, that's the formula for the side length of a rhombus with diagonals d1 and d2. So, in this case, the side length squared would be ( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ), which is (d1² + d2²)/4.

But in our case, we need to ensure that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, perhaps we can parameterize the points A and B, then find the conditions on their coordinates such that all four are on the hyperbola.

Alternatively, maybe there's a parametrization for points on a hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization can be (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Hmm, not sure which is easier.

Alternatively, since the points are in pairs (A and C, B and D) symmetric about the origin, maybe I can represent A as (x, y), C as (-x, -y), B as (u, v), D as (-u, -v). So, all four points must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc. Let me write down the distances.

Distance AB: sqrt( (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 )

Distance BC: sqrt( (u - (-x))^2 + (v - (-y))^2 ) = sqrt( (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2 )

Since AB = BC, so:

sqrt( (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 ) = sqrt( (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2 )

Squaring both sides:

(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2

Expanding both sides:

x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v² = x² + 2xu + u² + y² + 2yv + v²

Simplify:

-2xu - 2yv = +2xu + 2yv

Bring all terms to left:

-4xu -4yv = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

xu + yv = 0

So, equation (1): xu + yv = 0

Similarly, we can enforce AB = CD, but maybe that's redundant because of the symmetry.

Alternatively, since in a rhombus, all sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use that the diagonals are perpendicular.

Wait, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and since it's a rhombus, they are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Vector AC is from A to C: (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). But wait, actually, the diagonal AC goes from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so its direction vector is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, diagonal BD goes from (u, v) to (-u, -v), direction vector (-2u, -2v).

Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC connects A(x, y) to C(-x, -y). So, the vector AC is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD connects B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so the vector BD is (-2u, -2v).

For the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So:

(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0

Which is:

4xu + 4yv = 0

Divide by 4:

xu + yv = 0

Wait, that's the same as equation (1) we got earlier. So, that condition is redundant. So, the perpendicularity of diagonals is the same as the equality of sides in this case. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular if and only if all sides are equal, which is the case here.

So, the key equation is xu + yv = 0.

Additionally, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

So, we have three equations:

1. xu + yv = 0

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

3. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

We need to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.

BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so its length is sqrt( (u - (-u))^2 + (v - (-v))^2 ) = sqrt( (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(u² + v²). So, BD² is (2*sqrt(u² + v²))² = 4(u² + v²).

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²). Our aim is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi, but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi, which is the infimum. Alternatively, maybe it's the minimum value of BD², but since it's asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, it's the infimum, which is the minimum if it exists.

So, our target expression is 4(u² + v²). We need to find the minimum possible value of this expression given the constraints.

So, let's see. We have equations:

1. xu + yv = 0

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

3. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

We need to express u and v in terms of x and y, or find some relationship between u and v, then plug into BD².

From equation (1): xu = -yv

So, v = -(xu)/(y), provided y ≠ 0.

But then, substituting into equation (3): u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

Replace v with -(xu)/y:

u²/20 - ( (x² u²)/(y²) ) /24 = 1

Factor out u²:

u² [1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²)] = 1

Similarly, from equation (2): x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, which can be rearranged as x² = 20(1 + y²/24) = 20 + (20 y²)/24 = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

Plugging this into the equation above:

u² [1/20 - ( (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) )/(24 y²) ) ] = 1

Let me compute the term in the brackets:

1/20 - [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) / (24 y²) ]

Let me compute the numerator:

20 + (5 y²)/6 = (120 + 5 y²)/6

So, [ (120 + 5 y²)/6 ] / (24 y²) ) = (120 + 5 y²)/(6 * 24 y²) ) = (120 + 5 y²)/(144 y²)

So, the term in brackets is:

1/20 - (120 + 5 y²)/(144 y²)

Let me compute this:

Let me write 1/20 as (144 y²)/(20*144 y²) = 7.2 y² / (2880 y²) Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me find a common denominator.

1/20 = (7.2 y²)/(144 y²) because 144 y² /20 = 7.2 y². Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's compute:

Compute 1/20 - (120 +5 y²)/(144 y²).

First, write 1/20 as (7.2 y²)/(144 y²). Wait, 1/20 is equal to (144 y²)^(-1) * 7.2 y²? Let me see: 144 y² /20 = 7.2 y², so 1/20 = (7.2 y²)/144 y². So, 1/20 = (7.2 y²)/(144 y²).

So, 1/20 - (120 +5 y²)/(144 y²) = [7.2 y² - (120 +5 y²)] / 144 y².

Compute numerator:

7.2 y² -120 -5 y² = (7.2 -5) y² -120 = 2.2 y² -120.

Wait, 7.2 is 7.2, 5 is 5, so 7.2 -5 is 2.2? Wait, 7.2 -5 = 2.2. Yes.

So, numerator is 2.2 y² -120.

So, the term in brackets is (2.2 y² -120)/(144 y²).

Therefore, the equation becomes:

u² * (2.2 y² -120)/(144 y²) = 1

So, u² = 144 y² / (2.2 y² -120)

But u² must be positive, so denominator must be positive:

2.2 y² -120 > 0 => y² > 120 /2.2 = 54.545... So, y² > 54.545.

Wait, but 2.2 is 11/5, so 2.2 y² = (11/5)y².

So, (11/5)y² -120 >0 => (11/5)y² >120 => y² > (120 *5)/11 ≈ 54.545.

So, that seems okay.

So, u² = 144 y² / ( (11/5)y² -120 )

Let me write this as:

u² = 144 y² / ( (11 y² - 600)/5 ) ) = (144 y² *5 ) / (11 y² -600) = (720 y²)/(11 y² -600)

So, u² = (720 y²)/(11 y² -600)

Now, our target is BD² =4(u² + v²). Since v = -(xu)/y, let's compute v²:

v² = (x² u²)/y²

We have x² from equation (2): x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, v² = [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) * u² ] / y²

Substitute u²:

v² = [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) * (720 y²)/(11 y² -600) ] / y²

Simplify:

v² = [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) *720 y² ] / [ (11 y² -600) y² ]

= [ (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) *720 ] / (11 y² -600 )

Factor numerator:

Let me compute (20 + (5 y²)/6 ) *720:

= 20 *720 + (5 y²)/6 *720

= 14400 + (5 y² * 120 )

= 14400 + 600 y²

So, v² = (14400 + 600 y² ) / (11 y² -600 )

Therefore, BD² =4(u² + v²) =4 [ (720 y²)/(11 y² -600 ) + (14400 +600 y²)/(11 y² -600 ) ]

Combine the numerators:

=4 [ (720 y² +14400 +600 y² ) / (11 y² -600 ) ]

=4 [ (1320 y² +14400 ) / (11 y² -600 ) ]

Factor numerator:

=4 [ 1320 y² +14400 ) / (11 y² -600 ) ]

=4 [ (1320 y² +14400 ) / (11 y² -600 ) ]

Factor numerator and denominator:

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1320 y² +14400 = 1320(y²) +14400. Let's factor 120: 120*(11 y² +120)

Denominator:11 y² -600.

So,

BD² =4*(120*(11 y² +120 )) / (11 y² -600 )

=4*120*(11 y² +120)/(11 y² -600 )

=480*(11 y² +120)/(11 y² -600 )

Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:

Let me set z =11 y². Then, since y² > 54.545 (approx 54.545), so z > 600 (because 11*54.545≈600). Wait, 11 *54.545 is 599.995, about 600. So, z >600.

So, substituting z=11 y², then y² = z/11.

So, BD² becomes:

480*(z +120)/(z -600 )

So, BD²=480*(z +120)/(z -600 )

We can write this as 480*(z +120)/(z -600 )=480*( (z -600 +720 )/(z -600) )=480*(1 +720/(z -600 ))=480 + (480*720)/(z -600 )

But since z>600, z-600 is positive, so as z increases, 720/(z -600) decreases, so BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, the minimal value of BD² is approached as z approaches infinity, so BD² approaches 480. But BD² can't be less than 480. Wait, no, when z approaches 600 from above, z-600 approaches 0, so the term 720/(z-600) approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

Wait, that contradicts. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, when z approaches 600 from above, z-600 approaches 0+, so 720/(z-600) approaches +infinity. So, BD² approaches 480 + infinity, which is infinity.

When z approaches infinity, 720/(z-600) approaches 0, so BD² approaches 480.

So, BD² can get as close to 480 as desired, but can't be less than 480. So, the minimal value of BD² is 480.

Wait, but in our earlier substitution, BD² is expressed as 480*(z +120)/(z -600). Let me check for z>600.

Let me compute the expression (z +120)/(z -600):

= (z -600 +720)/(z -600 )=1 +720/(z -600 )

So, as z increases beyond 600, this expression approaches 1, making BD² approach 480*1=480.

But BD² is 480*(1 +720/(z -600 )) which is greater than 480 for all z>600.

So, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480. So, the infimum of BD² is 480.

But the question asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, since BD² can be made as close to 480 as we like, but never less than it, the greatest number less than all BD² is 480. Because BD² is always greater than 480, but we can get as close as we want to 480.

Wait, no. Wait, if BD² is always greater than 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480 itself, since 480 is a lower bound, and it's the greatest such lower bound. So, 480 is the infimum.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So, 480 is the infimum, so it's the greatest lower bound. So, 480 is the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if BD² can actually be equal to 480. From our earlier analysis, as z approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480. But does BD² ever actually reach 480? Or is 480 just a limit?

So, if we take z = infinity, BD² approaches 480, but for any finite z>600, BD² is greater than 480. So, 480 is the infimum, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because for any epsilon>0, you can find a rhombus where BD² is less than 480 + epsilon, but BD² is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the greatest lower bound, hence the answer is 480.

Alternatively, is there a mistake in the earlier steps? Let me double-check.

We had:

BD² =4(u² + v² )=480*(z +120)/(z -600 ), where z=11 y²>600.

As z increases, BD² approaches 480.

So, the minimal value BD² can approach is 480, but never actually reaches it. So, for all rhombi, BD² is greater than 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² is 480.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{480}


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

1. The hyperbola equation is \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).
2. Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, meaning \(A = (x, y)\), \(C = (-x, -y)\), \(B = (u, v)\), and \(D = (-u, -v)\).
3. The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \(xu + yv = 0\).
4. Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the hyperbola, giving the equations:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{u^2}{20} - \frac{v^2}{24} = 1
   \]
5. Using the condition \(xu + yv = 0\), we express \(v\) as \(v = -\frac{xu}{y}\).
6. Substituting \(v\) into the hyperbola equation for \(B\), we derive:
   \[
   u^2 = \frac{720 y^2}{11 y^2 - 600}
   \]
7. Expressing \(BD^2\) in terms of \(u\) and \(v\), we find:
   \[
   BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)
   \]
8. Substituting \(u^2\) and \(v^2\) into the expression for \(BD^2\), we find:
   \[
   BD^2 = 480 \left( \frac{z + 120}{z - 600} \right)
   \]
   where \(z = 11 y^2\).
9. As \(z\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 480.

\[
\boxed{480}
\]
