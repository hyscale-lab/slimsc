Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24, so:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

So now, a = log₂(x) = -7/24,
b = log₂(y) = -3/8,
c = log₂(z) = -5/12.
