Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem where Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (i.e., all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize (i.e., at least two numbers match). Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). I remember that C(n,k) is n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, C(10,4) is 10! / (4! 6!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, let's compute P(A), which is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen is picking 4 specific numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only one way for all four to be chosen). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, we need P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen. To find this, it might be easier to calculate the complementary probability (the probability she doesn't win a prize) and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one number matches.

So, let's calculate the number of ways she can have zero or one number matching. 

First, zero numbers matching: the number of ways the lottery picks 4 numbers, none of which are in Jen's set. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). Let me compute that: C(6,4) = 15.

Next, one number matching: the number of ways exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. So, we choose 1 from Jen's 4 and 3 from the other 6. That's C(4,1) × C(6,3). 

Calculating those: C(4,1) = 4, and C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 × 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of ways she doesn't win a prize is 15 (zero matches) + 80 (one match) = 95. So, the number of ways she does win a prize is total possibilities minus this, which is 210 - 95 = 115. So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait a second, let me confirm that. So, 210 total, subtract 95 non-winning cases, gives 115 winning cases. Yes, that seems right.

So, now P(A|B) is P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210). The 210 denominators cancel out, so it's 1/115. 

Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I compute P(A), it's the probability of all four matching, which is 1/210. And P(B) is 115/210. So, the conditional probability is (1/210) divided by (115/210) which is indeed 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common divisors except 1, so yes. Therefore, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit low. Let me go through the steps again.

Total number of possible lottery outcomes: C(10,4) = 210. Correct.

Number of ways to win the grand prize: 1. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Number of ways to win a prize (at least two matches): 115. So, P(B) = 115/210.

Therefore, conditional probability is 1/115. That seems correct, but let me think differently.

Alternatively, when given that she won a prize, the probability she has all four is 1 divided by the number of prize-winning outcomes, which is 115. So, 1/115. So, 1 and 115 are coprime, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but let me think if another approach is better. Maybe using hypergeometric distribution or something else. Let me consider the possible overlaps.

Jen picks 4 numbers. The lottery picks 4 numbers. Let X be the number of overlapping numbers. We need to find P(X=4 | X ≥ 2).
