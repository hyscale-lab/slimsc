Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But maybe that's not super relevant here.

Now, the problem is about rectangles formed inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I need to figure out how many such rectangles exist.

I think a good starting point is to consider the properties of a rectangle. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must align such that their sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and they must meet at right angles.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have various lengths, and the angles between them can vary. So, for two lines to form right angles inside the dodecagon, they must intersect at 90 degrees. So, perhaps the diagonals that are perpendicular would form the sides of such rectangles.

But how do I systematically count all possible rectangles? Maybe I can think about the symmetries and how rectangles can be placed.

I remember that in regular polygons, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. Since a dodecagon has many sides and diagonals, perhaps the number of rectangles can be determined by counting how many pairs of parallel lines exist, and then how many intersections form the right angles.

Wait, but rectangles require four lines: two pairs of parallel lines, each pair perpendicular to the other. So, perhaps I should first find all possible sets of two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other.

But first, let's think about the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon. A regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle, right? So each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees.

Hmm, so if I consider two vertices, the central angle between them is 30 degrees times the number of sides they skip. For example, adjacent vertices have a central angle of 30 degrees, the next would be 60 degrees, and so on, up to 175 degrees (since beyond that, it's the same as the other side). Wait, actually, for n-gon, the maximum distinct central angle is 180 degrees, so for dodecagon, the maximum is 180, so 30*6=180 degrees. So, the diagonals can have central angles of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180
