Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and related formulas. The circumradius R is 13, so that's given. The inradius r is 6. IA is perpendicular to OI, which seems like a specific condition that might relate to some known theorem or formula.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh, right, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

Plugging in the given values, R = 13 and r = 6.

So OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangles IAO and IBO and ICA might have some right angles here.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IAO is right-angled at I.

Let me visualize this. Point O is the circumcenter, I is the incenter. IA is one of the angle bisectors, going from incenter I to vertex A. OI is the line connecting the incenter to the circumcenter.

So in triangle IAO, we have a right angle at I. So by Pythagoras, AO² = AI² + OI².

But AO is the distance from circumradius to vertex A. Wait, AO is the distance from circumcenter O to vertex A, which is just the circumradius R, so AO = R = 13.

So AO² = 13² = 169.

And OI² is 13, as we calculated earlier.

So that gives us 169 = AI² + 13.

Solving for AI², we get AI² = 169 -13 = 156. So AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).

So AI = 2√39.

Now, I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semiperimeter. The inradius r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the length of AI can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. There's a formula that gives AI in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall that.

I think AI = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius r is related to the angle bisectors. I believe the formula is AI = r / sin(A/
