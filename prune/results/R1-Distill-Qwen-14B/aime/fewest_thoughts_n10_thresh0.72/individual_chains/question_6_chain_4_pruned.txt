Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all these functions nested inside each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. These are absolute value functions, so they'll create V-shaped graphs with possible reflections and shifts.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) in my mind. Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. The inner |x| makes it symmetric about the y-axis. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2 unit. Taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up. So, f(x) will have a V shape with its vertex where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. The value at x=0 is |0 - 1/2| = 1/2, and it decreases to 0 at x=±1/2, then increases again beyond that.

Similarly, g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |. The same idea applies here. The vertex is where |x| - 1/4 = 0, so at x = ±1/4. The value at x=0 is 1/4, decreasing to 0 at x=±1/4, and then increasing beyond.

Now, both f and g are applied inside each other in the functions y and x. Let me look at y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). So, the outer function is g, which is applied to f(sin(2πx)). Similarly, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, both equations involve 4 times g(f of something). Since f and g are both absolute functions, their outputs are non-negative, so when multiplied by 4, they'll range between 0 and 4.

Wait, actually, let me think about the ranges. The inner function is sin(2πx) or cos(3πy), which both range between -1 and 1. Then f is applied, which is | |x| - 1/2 |. So, for x in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1]. So, |x| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2. So, f(sin(2πx)) will be in [0, 1/2], and similarly for f(cos(3πy)).

Then, g is applied to these. Since g(x) is | |x| - 1/4 |, and the input is in [0, 1/2], let me see what values g can take. For x in [0, 1/2], |x| is x, so g(x) = |x - 1/4|. So when x is in [0, 1/4], g(x) = 1/4 - x, and when x is in [1/4, 1/2], g(x) = x - 1/4. Therefore, the range of g(f(...)) is [0, 1/4], because the maximum of g occurs at x=1/4, where g(1/4)=0, and the extremes at x=0 and x=1/2, where g(0)=1/4 and g(1/2)=1/4. So 4 times that would make the range [0,1]. So both y and x are in [0,1].

Wait, no. Wait, f(sin(2πx)) is in [0,1/2], and then g of that is | |x| - 1/4 | where x is in [0,1/2]. So, as I thought, g's output ranges from 0 to 1/4. So, 4 times that is 0 to 1. So, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is in [0,1], and similarly for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, the equations are:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) with y ∈ [0,1]

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) with x ∈ [0,1].

We need to find the number of intersection points between these two curves. An intersection occurs when y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, substituting one into the other, perhaps?

Wait, but since both equations are in terms of x and y, it's a system of equations. It's a bit tricky because y is a function of x in the first equation, and x is a function of y in the second. So, it's a system where each variable is defined in terms of the other.

Hmm, maybe I can parameterize the solutions or find symmetries. Alternatively, perhaps I can plot or analyze the functions' periodicity.

Let me think about the periodicity of the functions inside. The first equation has sin(2π
