Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin. Then point A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit less than halfway up to (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length (so each PQ is 1 unit long), lying in the first quadrant. Points P are on the x-axis and Q are on the y-axis. So each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, stays in the first quadrant, and has length 1. 

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, which is different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except for AB. So, AB is part of the family F, right? Because AB is a segment connecting A on the x-axis to B on the y-axis, and its length must be 1 as well. Wait, let me check that. 

Wait, A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me calculate the distance between A and B to see if it's 1. The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So substituting the points:

Distance AB = sqrt[(0 - 1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment in family F, since it's of unit length, in the first quadrant, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. 

So, the problem states that C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), point C is not on PQ. We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm. So, to find point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is such that it's only on AB and not on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find C such that for every other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

I think this point C is the point where the envelope of all segments in F touches AB. Because the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each member of the family, so the point where AB is tangent to the envelope would be the unique point C not lying on any other PQ in F.
