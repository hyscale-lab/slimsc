Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me think. So, each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. The octagon has 8 vertices, so each coloring is a sequence of 8 red and blue. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the problem is about rotations. A regular octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which gives 8 different rotational symmetries. Each rotation corresponds to shifting the vertices by a certain number of positions. For example, a 45° rotation shifts each vertex by 1 position, a 90° rotation shifts by 2 positions, and so on.

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation such that when we apply this rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, in other words, after rotation, the set of blue vertices is exactly the set of red vertices from the original coloring.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, each blue vertex is now on a spot that was red before. That means that the rotation maps blue vertices to red vertices. So, in other words, the blue set is a subset of the red set after rotation—no, wait, not exactly. Because each blue vertex is mapped to a red vertex, but multiple blue vertices could map to the same red vertex? No, because each vertex is only mapped to one vertex. So, actually, the set of blue vertices must be a permutation of the set of red vertices? Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.

Wait, let me think again. The octagon is being rotated, so each blue vertex moves to a new position. For the condition to hold, every blue vertex must land on a position that was originally red. So, the image of the blue vertices under the rotation must be entirely within the red vertices. So, the blue set must be mapped via rotation to a subset of the red set.

But in the original coloring, red and blue are just two colors. So, the original red set and blue set are complements of each other. So, for a rotation r, r(blue set) must be a subset of red set. But since the octagon is regular, the size of the blue set must equal the size of the red set for this to be possible. Wait, no, because if blue is mapped via rotation into the red set, but the red set is also a certain size.

Wait, suppose the blue set has size k, then the rotated blue set must have
