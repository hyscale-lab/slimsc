Okay, so I've got this problem here about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that you can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Then, they mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. So, each vertex is independently colored red or blue. Then, after coloring, we can rotate the octagon (which has 8 sides, so possible rotations are 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, right?), and we want all the blue vertices after rotation to be in positions that were previously red.

Wait, so another way to think about this: after coloring, there exists some rotation of the octagon where the set of blue vertices maps exactly to the set of red vertices. Because if I rotate the octagon, the blue positions move to where the reds were, meaning the original reds are now where the blues were. So, it's like swapping red and blue through rotation.

But since it's a regular octagon, the symmetries are rotations by multiples of 45°, which correspond to the dihedral group D8, but I might not need group theory here.

Let me think about the possible colorings. Each vertex can be red or blue, so there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings. Now, I need to count how many of these colorings satisfy the condition that there's a rotation where all blue vertices become red and vice versa.

Alternatively, for a given coloring, is there a rotation such that when you apply it, every blue vertex moves to a position that was red, and every red vertex moves to a position that was blue. So, essentially, the color sets are swapped via rotation.

Wait, but the octagon's rotation symmetry group is of order 8. So, for each coloring, we can check if any of these 8 rotations (including identity) results in the blue set being mapped to the red set.

But perhaps it's easier to model this as the coloring being symmetric in some way. Because if such a rotation exists, the coloring must have a certain periodicity or symmetry.

But I'm not sure yet. Maybe another approach: think about the orbit of each vertex under rotation. Since the octagon is regular, each vertex is part of a single orbit under rotation, but since we can rotate it, the colorings must be symmetric in a way that when you rotate by some multiple, the colors flip.
