Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so red and blue each have a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then we need to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. So, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue. We're looking for colorings where there's some rotation that maps blue vertices to red positions and vice versa.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, every blue vertex is now at a position that was red before the rotation. That implies that the set of blue vertices is mapped to the set of red vertices via some rotation. So, the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the set of blue vertices is just the complement of the set of red vertices. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the blue set must be a rotation of its own complement. So, the set of blue vertices must be equal to some rotation of the set of red vertices, which is the same as saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of blue vertices itself? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original coloring has some red and blue vertices. Then, after a rotation, the blue vertices are mapped to where the red vertices were. So, the set of blue vertices in the original coloring is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Since the set of red vertices is the complement of blue vertices, this would mean that the blue set is a rotation of its own complement.

So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices, which is the same as saying that the blue set is a rotation of its complement. Therefore, the blue set is a rotationally symmetric set that is a shift of its own complement.

Wait, maybe that's a bit abstract. Let me consider the structure of such colorings. If we have a rotation that maps each blue vertex to a red vertex, then the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Because each blue is mapped to a red, so the counts must match. So, that's an important point: the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Since the octagon has 8 vertices, which is even, that means there are 4 blue and 4 red vertices.

So, first, the probability that the number of blue and red vertices is equal is C(8,4) * (1/2)^8.
