Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So, A is some set of positive integers. Bob is creating all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me think about how Bob is constructing these sets B. Each set B must be nonempty and finite. The key is that the maximum element of B has to be in A. So for each element a in A, Bob can create sets where a is the maximum. The rest of the elements in B can be any positive integers less than a, right?

Wait, actually, they don't necessarily have to be positive integers. Wait, no, the problem says that B is a set of positive integers, so all elements must be positive integers. So, given that, for each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because for each such a, the other elements of B can be any subset of the numbers less than a.

But wait, since B must be non-empty, and the maximum is a, then the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can be either included or excluded, giving 2^{a-1} subsets. But since B must be non-empty, but since a is included as the maximum, each such set is at least {a}, so they are all non-empty.

So, for each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets in Bob's list is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, the problem says that the total is 2024. So,

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Therefore, I need to find all a in A such that when I sum 2^{a
