Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the grid is 8x8, which I think means it's an 8 by 8 square grid, so it has 9 horizontal lines and 9 vertical lines. But wait, when they say "paths of length 16," that probably refers to the number of steps, right? Because moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights and 8 ups.

Now, these paths are moving from the southwest corner to the northeast corner. Each path can be represented as a sequence of moves, either right (R) or up (U). So, the total number of such paths without any restrictions is the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's, which is the binomial coefficient C(16,8). But that's without considering direction changes.

The problem is asking for the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, direction changes occur when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time the path switches direction, that's a direction change.

Wait, how do direction changes relate to the sequence of moves? Let's think. Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, each time it switches to up, that's a direction change. Similarly, if it switches back to right, that's another change. So, each switch between R and U is a direction change.

But how many direction changes are in a path? Well, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if a path has, say, 5 runs of R and 5 runs of U, then the number of direction changes is 9, because each switch between runs counts as a change.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If a path starts with R, then each time it switches to U, that's a direction change, and then switching back to R is another. So, if there are k runs in total, the number of direction changes is k-1. Because each run after the first requires a direction change.

Wait, no. Let's say a path has m runs. The number of direction changes would be m-1, since each run after the first requires a direction change. So, if the path starts with R, then to start a U run, that's one direction change, and so on.

So, for example, a path that alternates R and U every step would have 16 runs (each step is a run of length 1) and 15 direction changes. But that's the maximum possible. On the other hand, a path that goes all R first and then all U has 2 runs and 1 direction change.

So, if the problem is asking for exactly four direction changes, that implies the path has five runs. Because 5 runs would mean 4 direction changes. Because each run after the first requires a direction change.

Wait, is that right? Let's see. Starting with R, then switching to U is one direction change, then switching back to R is another, so each switch is a direction change. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. So, if a path has k runs, the number of direction changes is k-1.

Therefore, four direction changes mean 5 runs in total.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of paths from (0,0) to (8,8) that consist of exactly 5 runs, with the direction changes happening four times. Now, these runs can be either sequences of R's or U's. The key is to figure out how many such paths there are, considering the starting direction.

Wait, but the path can start with either R or U. So, we have two cases: paths that start with R and have five runs, and paths that start with U and have five runs. But since the grid is square and symmetric, the number of such paths starting
