Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, when you spin that circle around the axis, it creates a torus.

Now, there's also a sphere with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. And when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. I think I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Then subtract them to get the difference.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3. So, the torus has R = 6 and r = 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases, then relate that to the radii r_i and r_o.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center must be offset in a particular way. Let me think about the geometry.

When the torus is resting inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside. The point of tangency is along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, but the torus is outside, and they touch along another circle.

Wait, actually, when the torus is on the inside of the sphere, it's like the sphere is larger, and the torus is nestled inside it, touching along a circle. Conversely, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

So, in both cases, the centers of the sphere and the torus must lie along the same axis, and the distance between their centers will affect the point of tangency.

Let me try to model this.

Let me assume that the sphere is centered at the origin. The torus, when tangent, will have its center along the same axis as the sphere's center. Let's say the axis is the z-axis for simplicity.

In the internal tangent case, the torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Wait, the major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center (which is on the axis of rotation) must be such that the closest point on the torus touches the sphere.

Wait, actually, in the internal case, the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be the point where the torus is closest to the center of the sphere, and this point must lie on the sphere's surface.

Similarly, in the external case, the far
