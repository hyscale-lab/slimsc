Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, say, x, y, z. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance within the box, right? So the sphere's diameter would be the space diagonal, meaning the radius would be half of that.

So first, I need to find the space diagonal in terms of x, y, z. The space diagonal d is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r would be d/2, so r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So to minimize the sphere's radius, I need to minimize the space diagonal, which in turn means minimizing x² + y² + z².

Given that all boxes in B have surface area 54 and volume 23, I can express x, y, z in terms of these constraints. The surface area S of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume V is xyz = 23.

So, I have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

I need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

I remember from algebra that for three variables, x² + y² + z² can be expressed in terms of (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know xy + yz + xz is 27, I can write x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2*27 = (x + y + z)² - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize (x + y + z)². That is, minimize x + y + z.

Wait, but how can I relate x + y + z to the given constraints? I know that x, y, z are positive real numbers because they represent dimensions of a box.

Let me think. I have from the AM ≥ GM inequality: (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3). Since xyz =23, (xyz)^(1/3) is cube root of 23, which is roughly 2.84, but I can keep it as 23^(1/3) for exactness.

So, x + y + z ≥ 3*(23)^(1/3). But wait, is this the minimum? Because AM ≥ GM gives a lower bound, but whether this bound is achievable depends on whether the equality condition holds, which is when x = y = z. But in our case, x = y = z would mean the box is a cube. Let me check if a cube with surface area 54 and volume 23 exists.

If it's a cube, then all sides are equal, so x = y = z = a. Then surface area is 6a² =54 ⇒ a² =9 ⇒ a=3. So volume would be a³=27, but our volume is 23. So a cube isn't in set B because volume doesn't match. So, the minimal x + y + z might be higher than 3*(23)^(1/3). Hmm.

So, perhaps I need to approach this using Lagrange multipliers since we're dealing with optimization under constraints. Let me set up the problem.

We need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27

h(x, y, z) = xyz =23

So, this is a constrained optimization problem with two constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for multiple constraints.

In such a case, the gradients of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.

So, ∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Computing the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)

∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, the equations become:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)   ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)   ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)   ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27         ...(4)

xyz =23                  ...(5)

So, we have five equations with five unknowns: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or assume some variables are equal.

Wait, suppose two variables are equal. Let's say x = y. Is that possible?

If x = y, then equations (1)
