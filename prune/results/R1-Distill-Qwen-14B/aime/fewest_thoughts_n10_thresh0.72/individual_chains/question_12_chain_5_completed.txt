Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. The grid has two rows and three columns. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, the sum should be 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the sum should be 99. 

Let me visualize the grid first. It's a 2x3 grid, so each row has three cells, and each column has two. Let me denote the grid like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the top row forms the number abc, which is a three-digit number. Similarly, the bottom row forms def, another three-digit number. The problem says the sum of these two numbers should be 999. So, mathematically, that's:

abc + def = 999.

Then, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So:

ad + be + cf = 99.

So, the constraints are:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write down both equations:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments (a, b, c, d, e, f) that satisfy both equations. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9, but a and d cannot be zero because they are the first digits of three-digit and two-digit numbers, respectively. Wait, actually, in the top row, a can't be zero because abc is a three-digit number, so a must be 1-9. Similarly, in the bottom row, d is the first digit of def, so d must be 1-9 as well. For the columns, a and d are already non-zero, so the columns ad, be, cf don't have leading zeros since a and d are already 1-9.

But wait, in the example given, the top row starts with 0. Wait, no, looking at the example:

The grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, the top row is 008, which is 8, but it's written as 008. So, does the leading zero count? Hmm, the problem says "the numbers formed by reading left to right" and "reading top to bottom". So, 008 is 8, and 991 is 991. Their sum is 8 + 991 = 999. Similarly, the columns are 09, 09, 81, which are 9, 9, 81. Their sum is 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So, it seems that leading zeros are allowed for the numbers formed by the rows. Wait, but for the rows, in the example, the top row is 008, which is a three-digit number with leading zeros allowed. But for the columns, they are two-digit numbers, and the example has 09, which is 9 as a two-digit number, so leading zeros are allowed there as well.

Wait, but let's check: in the example, a=0, which is allowed in the top row because it's written as 008, but the bottom row's d=9, which is fine. So, for the rows, a and d can be zero? Wait, no, in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008, which is 8. So, in this case, a is 0, which is allowed. But in the bottom row, d=9, so it's okay. So, perhaps a and d can be zero? But wait, in the problem statement, when it says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right", the numbers could have leading zeros, so a can be zero. Similarly, when reading top to bottom, the two-digit numbers could have leading zeros because a is zero in the example, but d is non-zero. So, in the grid, a can be zero, but d must be non-zero because it's the first digit of a three-digit number.

Wait, no. Wait, in the top row, it's a three-digit number, but in the example, it's 008, which is 8, a single-digit number. So, the problem allows leading zeros in the row numbers. So, a can be zero. Similarly, the bottom row is 991, which is a three-digit number, so d must be non-zero, because it's the first digit of a three-digit number. So, d must be from 1-9, but a can be 0-9. Similarly, for the columns, ad is a two-digit number, which could have a leading zero if a is zero, but d must be non-zero. So, a can be zero, d must be 1-9.

So, to summarize: a can be 0-9, d must be 1-9. Similarly, in the columns, the first digit is a (can be 0) and the second is d (must be 1-9), but wait, for the columns, the numbers are formed as top to bottom, so each column is a two-digit number. So, the first digit is a cell from the top row, the second is from the bottom. So, for example, the first column is a top digit (a) and a bottom digit (d), forming the number 10a + d. Since a can be zero, the two-digit number could be 0d, which is a single-digit number, but in the problem statement, it's considered a two-digit number. Wait, but in the example, the first column is 0 and 9, which is 09, which is 9, but written as a two-digit number. So, perhaps the two-digit numbers can have leading zeros, meaning a can be zero, and d must be 1-9, but the two-digit number is 10a + d, regardless of whether a is zero. So, a can be 0-9, d must be 1-9.

So, with that in mind, let's get back to the equations.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables.

Let me write equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99

Compute the left side:

100a -10a +10b -10b +c -10c +100d -d +10e -e +f -f = 

90a - 9c +99d +9e = 900.

Factor out the 9:

9(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that's a useful equation.

So, Equation 3: 10a - c +11d + e = 100.

Now, I need to relate this to the original equations. Maybe I can express e from equation 3 and substitute into equation 2.

From equation 3:

e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

Now, plug this into equation 2:

10a + d +10b + (100 -10a + c -11d) +10c + f = 99.

Simplify:

10a + d +10b +100 -10a + c -11d +10c + f =99

Simplify terms:

(10a -10a) + (d -11d) +10b + (c +10c) +100 +f =99

So,

0 -10d +10b +11c +100 +f =99

Bring constants to the right:

-10d +10b +11c +f =99 -100

Which is:

-10d +10b +11c +f = -1

Hmm, that's equation 4.

Now, let's see. Let me write equation 4:

10b -10d +11c +f = -1.

This seems tricky because all variables are digits (0-9 for a, except d which is 1-9, and a can be 0-9). Let me think about possible values.

Wait, let me note that 10b and 10d are multiples of 10, so 10(b - d) is a multiple of 10. Then, 11c is 11 times a digit (0-9), so 0-99. f is 0-9.

So, 10(b - d) +11c +f = -1.

Wait, but 10(b - d) is an integer, and 11c +f is also an integer. So, 10(b - d) +11c +f = -1.

But all variables are digits. Let me see what possible values b, d, c, f can take to make this equation hold.

Let me rearrange the equation:

10(b - d) +11c +f = -1.

Since 10(b - d) is a multiple of 10, and 11c can be 0,11,22,...,99, and f is 0-9.

Let me denote X = 10(b - d). So, X can be any multiple of 10, from (since b and d are digits 0-9 and 1-9 respectively):

b can be 0-9, d can be 1-9, so (b - d) can be from (0-9) - (1-9) = -9 to 9-1=8.

So, X can be from -90 to 80, in steps of 10.

So, X can be -90, -80, ..., 0, ..., 80.

Similarly, 11c can be 0,11,22,...,99.

f is 0-9.

So, X +11c + f = -1.

But X is a multiple of 10, and 11c is a multiple of 11, so X +11c is a multiple of gcd(10,11)=1, so any integer. But since X is multiple of 10 and 11c is multiple of 11, their sum is 10k +11m, which can be any integer.

But in any case, let's think about possible values of X, c, f such that X +11c +f = -1.

Let me consider possible values of X. Let's try to find possible (X, c, f) combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think modulo 10.

Looking at equation 4:

10(b - d) +11c +f = -1.

Let's take both sides modulo 10.

Left side: 10(b - d) mod10 is 0. 11c mod10 is (11 mod10)*c = 1*c. f mod10 is f.

So,

0 + c + f ≡ (-1) mod10.

Which simplifies to:

c + f ≡ 9 mod10.

So, c + f = 9 or 19.

Because c and f are digits (0-9), their sum can be at most 18, so c + f can be 9 or 19. But 19 is possible only if c and f are 9 and 10, but f can't be 10. So, c + f can only be 9.

Wait, wait. Let me see: c is 0-9, f is 0-9, so their maximum sum is 18. So, c + f can be 9 or 19? No, 19 is not possible because the maximum sum is 18. So, only c + f =9.

Wait, but 9 is possible. So, c + f =9.

So, equation 5: c + f =9.

So, from equation 4, we have:

10(b - d) +11c +f = -1

But since c + f =9, then f =9 -c.

Substitute into equation 4:

10(b - d) +11c + (9 - c) = -1

Simplify:

10(b - d) +10c +9 = -1

So,

10(b - d + c) = -10

Divide both sides by 10:

b - d + c = -1

So, equation 6: b + c = d -1.

Hmm, that's useful.

So, let's recap:

From equation 5: c + f =9.

From equation 6: b + c =d -1.

So, since d is from 1-9, d -1 is from 0-8.

But b and c are digits (0-9), so b + c can be from 0 (if b=0, c=0) up to 18 (if b=9, c=9). But according to equation 6, b + c must be equal to d-1, which is 0-8.

So, b + c can be 0,1,2,...,8.

But since b and c are digits (0-9), their sum can be 0 to 18, but equation 6 restricts it to 0-8.

So, let me think about the possible values for d:

d can be 1-9. So, d -1 is 0-8. Therefore, the possible values for b + c are 0-8.

But since b and c are digits, their sum can be 0-18, but in this case, it's limited to 0-8.

So, equation 6: b + c = k, where k = d -1, and k is 0-8.

So, for each d from 1-9, k = d-1, and b + c must equal k.

Now, let's go back to equation 3:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

From equation 3, and knowing that e = 100 -10a + c -11d.

So, e must be a digit (0-9). So,

0 ≤ e ≤9

Which implies:

0 ≤ 100 -10a + c -11d ≤9.

So,

10a - c +11d ≥ 100 -9 =91,

and

10a - c +11d ≤100.

So,

91 ≤10a - c +11d ≤100.

But 10a - c +11d is equal to 100 - e, which from equation 3 is 100 - e, so since e is 0-9, 100 - e is 100 down to 91.

So, 10a -c +11d must be between 91 and 100 inclusive.

But 10a is from 0 (a=0) to 90 (a=9), and 11d is from 11 (d=1) to 99 (d=9). So, 10a - c +11d can range from (0 -9 +11)=2 (if a=0, c=9, d=1) to (90 -0 +99)=189. But according to the constraints, it must be 91-100.

So, 10a -c +11d is in [91,100].

Let me think about this. So,

10a -c +11d = 91 to 100.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of 11d as a multiple of 11, which is 11,22,...,99.

Let me write 10a -c = 91 -11d to 100 -11d.

Wait, no, 10a -c = 91 -11d to 100 -11d? No, equation is 10a -c +11d = 91 to 100. So, 10a -c = 91 -11d to 100 -11d.

Wait, no, for each d, 10a -c must be in [91 -11d, 100 -11d].

But 10a -c must be an integer between 0 (if a=0, c=9) to 90 (a=9, c=0).

So, for each d from 1 to 9, let's see what possible 10a -c can be.

Let's go through each d:

d=1:

11d=11.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-11=80, 100-11=89].

So, 80 ≤10a -c ≤89.

But 10a -c is 10a -c.

Since a is 0-9, c is 0-9.

10a can be 0,10,20,...,90.

So, 10a -c can be from 0-90 minus 0-9, so 0-90-0=0 to 90-0=90, but here it's 80-89.

So, 80 ≤10a -c ≤89.

Which implies:

For d=1, 10a -c must be 80-89.

But 10a -c is equal to 10a minus c.

So, 10a -c = k, where k is 80-89.

Since 10a is a multiple of 10, and c is 0-9, 10a -c can only be numbers ending with 0 -9, but in 80-89, all numbers end with 0-9.

So, for each k from 80-89:

k = 10a -c.

So, a = (k +c)/10.

But a must be an integer between 0-9.

So, for each k, c must be such that k +c is divisible by 10.

But c is 0-9.

So, for k=80:

c must be 0, because 80 +0=80, which is divisible by10.

So, a=8, c=0.

Similarly, for k=81:

81 +c must be divisible by10. So, c=9, because 81+9=90, which is divisible by10. So, a=9, c=9.

Wait, but 10a=90, so a=9, c=9. 90-9=81, which matches k=81.

Similarly, for k=82:

82 +c must be 90, so c=8. a=9, c=8.

But 10a=90, so 90-8=82.

Wait, but c=8. So, a=9, c=8.

Similarly, k=83: 83 +c=90 → c=7.

a=9, c=7.

k=84: c=6.

k=85: c=5.

k=86: c=4.

k=87: c=3.

k=88: c=2.

k=89: c=1.

Wait, but wait, for k=80, c=0, a=8.

But wait, 10a=80, c=0.

So, a=8, c=0.

Similarly, for k=80: a=8, c=0.

So, for d=1:

Possible pairs (a,c):

For k=80: a=8, c=0.

For k=81: a=9, c=9.

k=82: a=9, c=8.

k=83: a=9, c=7.

k=84: a=9, c=6.

k=85: a=9, c=5.

k=86: a=9, c=4.

k=87: a=9, c=3.

k=88: a=9, c=2.

k=89: a=9, c=1.

So, for d=1, possible a and c:

When k=80: a=8, c=0.

k=81-89: a=9, c=9 down to 1.

So, total of 10 possibilities for (a,c) when d=1.

Now, let's check if these are valid:

a can be 8 or 9, which is allowed.

c is 0-9, allowed.

So, for each d, I can compute possible a and c.

Similarly, let's proceed to d=2.

d=2:

11d=22.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-22=69, 100-22=78].

So, 69 ≤10a -c ≤78.

Again, 10a -c must be in 69-78.

So, k=69,70,...,78.

Each k=10a -c.

So, for each k, 69-78, find a and c.

Let's take k=69:

10a -c=69.

So, c=10a -69.

But c must be between 0-9.

So, 10a must be ≥69, so a≥7 (since 10*7=70).

So, a=7: c=70-69=1.

a=8: c=80-69=11. But c can't be 11. So, invalid.

a=9: c=90-69=21. Invalid.

So, only a=7, c=1 is valid for k=69.

Similarly, k=70:

10a -c=70.

c=10a -70.

a must be ≥7.

a=7: c=0.

a=8: c=10 → invalid.

a=9: c=20 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=0.

k=71:

10a -c=71.

c=10a -71.

a must be ≥8 (since 10a ≥71 → a≥8).

a=8: c=80-71=9.

a=9: c=90-71=19 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=9.

k=72:

10a -c=72.

c=10a -72.

a must be ≥8 (72/10=7.2, so a≥8).

a=8: c=80-72=8.

a=9: c=90-72=18 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=8.

k=73:

10a -c=73.

c=10a -73.

a must be ≥8 (73/10=7.3, a≥8).

a=8: c=80-73=7.

a=9: c=90-73=17 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=7.

Similarly, k=74:

10a -c=74.

c=10a -74.

a=8: c=80-74=6.

a=9: c=90-74=16 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=6.

k=75:

c=10a -75.

a=8: c=80-75=5.

a=9: c=15 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=5.

k=76:

c=10a -76.

a=8: c=80-76=4.

a=9: c=90-76=14 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=4.

k=77:

c=10a -77.

a=8: c=80-77=3.

a=9: c=90-77=13 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=3.

k=78:

c=10a -78.

a=8: c=80-78=2.

a=9: c=90-78=12 → invalid.

So, a=8, c=2.

So, for d=2, possible (a,c) pairs:

k=69: a=7, c=1.

k=70: a=7, c=0.

k=71: a=8, c=9.

k=72: a=8, c=8.

k=73: a=8, c=7.

k=74: a=8, c=6.

k=75: a=8, c=5.

k=76: a=8, c=4.

k=77: a=8, c=3.

k=78: a=8, c=2.

Wait, but for k=69 and 70, a=7, c=1 and 0.

So, total of 10 possibilities for d=2.

But let's check if a can be 7 in these cases.

Yes, a can be from 0-9, so a=7 is allowed.

So, for d=2, 10 possible (a,c) pairs.

Proceeding similarly for d=3.

d=3:

11d=33.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-33=58, 100-33=67].

So, 58 ≤10a -c ≤67.

Similarly, for each k from 58-67.

Let's start with k=58:

10a -c=58.

c=10a -58.

a must be ≥6 (58/10=5.8 → a≥6).

a=6: c=60-58=2.

a=7: c=70-58=12 → invalid.

a=8: c=80-58=22 → invalid.

a=9: c=90-58=32 → invalid.

So, only a=6, c=2.

k=59:

10a -c=59.

c=10a -59.

a≥6.

a=6: c=60-59=1.

a=7: c=70-59=11 → invalid.

So, a=6, c=1.

k=60:

10a -c=60.

c=10a -60.

a≥6.

a=6: c=0.

a=7: c=10 → invalid.

So, a=6, c=0.

k=61:

10a -c=61.

c=10a -61.

a≥7 (since 61/10=6.1, a≥7).

a=7: c=70-61=9.

a=8: c=80-61=19 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=9.

k=62:

c=10a -62.

a≥7.

a=7: c=70-62=8.

a=8: c=80-62=18 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=8.

k=63:

c=10a -63.

a=7: c=70-63=7.

a=8: c=80-63=17 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=7.

k=64:

c=10a -64.

a=7: c=70-64=6.

a=8: c=80-64=16 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=6.

k=65:

c=10a -65.

a=7: c=70-65=5.

a=8: c=80-65=15 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=5.

k=66:

c=10a -66.

a=7: c=70-66=4.

a=8: c=80-66=14 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=4.

k=67:

c=10a -67.

a=7: c=70-67=3.

a=8: c=80-67=13 → invalid.

So, a=7, c=3.

So, for d=3:

k=58: a=6, c=2.

k=59: a=6, c=1.

k=60: a=6, c=0.

k=61: a=7, c=9.

k=62: a=7, c=8.

k=63: a=7, c=7.

k=64: a=7, c=6.

k=65: a=7, c=5.

k=66: a=7, c=4.

k=67: a=7, c=3.

Again, 10 possibilities.

Similarly, for d=4:

11d=44.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-44=47, 100-44=56].

So, 47 ≤10a -c ≤56.

k=47:

k=22: a=3, c=8.

k=23: a=3, c=7.

Again, 10 possibilities.

Proceeding to d=8:

11d=88.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-88=3, 100-88=12].

So, 3 ≤10a -c ≤12.

k=3:

10a -c=3.

c=10a -3.

a must be ≥1 (3/10=0.3 → a≥1).

a=1: c=10-3=7.

a=1: c=10-6=4.

a=2: c=20-6=14 → invalid.

So, a=1, c=4.

k=7:

c=10a -7.

a=1: c=10-7=3.

a=2: c=20-7=13 → invalid.

So, a=1, c=3.

k=8:

So, a=2, c=9.

c=10a -12.

a=2: c=20-12=8.

a=3: c=30-12=18 → invalid.

So, a=2, c=8.

So, for d=8:

k=10: a=1, c=0.

k=11: a=2, c=9.

k=12: a=2, c=8.

So, 10 possibilities.

Finally, d=9:

11d=99.

So, 10a -c must be in [91-99= -8, 100-99=1].

But 10a -c must be ≥0, since 10a ≥ c (as c is 0-9 and a is 0-9).

So, 0 ≤10a -c ≤1.

So, k=0 and k=1.

k=0:

10a -c=0.

So, c=10a.

But c must be ≤9, so 10a ≤9 → a=0, c=0.

k=1:

10a -c=1.

So, c=10a -1.

a must be ≥1 (since c≥0).

a=1: c=10-1=9.

a=2: c=20-1=19 → invalid.

So, a=1, c=9.

So, for d=9:

k=0: a=0, c=0.

k=1: a=1, c=9.

So, only two possibilities.

Wait, but 10a -c must be between -8 and 1, but since 10a -c can't be negative (as 10a ≥c), it's between 0 and 1.

So, only k=0 and 1.

Thus, for d=9, two possible (a,c) pairs: (0,0) and (1,9).

So, summarizing:

For each d from 1 to 8, there are 10 possible (a,c) pairs, and for d=9, there are 2.

So, total number of (a,c,d) possibilities:

d=1:10

d=2:10

d=3:10

d=4:10

d=5:10

d=6:10

d=7:10

d=8:10

d=9:2

Total: 8*10 + 2 = 82.

Wait, 8*10 is 80, plus 2 is 82.

But wait, let me double-check if for d=9, indeed only two possibilities.

Yes, for d=9, 10a -c can be 0 or 1.

So, for each of these, a and c are set accordingly.

So, each d from 1-8 contributes 10, d=9 contributes 2, total 82.

But wait, in the earlier calculations for each d, I had 10 possibilities, but for d=9, only 2.

But let me think: when d=9, 10a -c can be 0 or 1, so only two possibilities.

So, total possibilities for (a,c,d): 82.

But wait, no. Wait, for each d, the number of (a,c) pairs is 10 for d=1-8, and 2 for d=9, so total 8*10 + 2=82.

But let's think: Each d has a certain number of (a,c) pairs, and for each such pair, we can find e and f based on the equations.

From equation 6: b + c =d -1.

And from equation 5: c + f=9.

So, for each (a,c,d), we can determine f=9 -c.

Then, from equation 6, b= (d -1) -c.

Then, from equation 3, e=100 -10a +c -11d.

But we have to make sure that e is a digit (0-9).

So, e must be between 0 and 9.

So, for each (a,c,d), compute e =100 -10a +c -11d.

We need 0 ≤ e ≤9.

So, let me see, for each d, does e fall into this range?

Because earlier, I considered 10a -c +11d between 91-100.

So, 10a -c +11d =91-100, so 100 - (10a -c +11d) = e.

So, e=100 - (10a -c +11d).

Which is 100 - [91-100]=9-10.

Wait, no, 10a -c +11d is between 91-100.

So, 100 - (91-100) =9 to 100 -91=9 down to 100-100=0? Wait, no.

Wait, 10a -c +11d is in [91,100], so e=100 - (something from 91-100) → e is from 0-9.

Because if 10a -c +11d=91, e=9.

If 10a -c +11d=100, e=0.

So, e will always be between 0-9, as required.

So, for each (a,c,d), e is 100 - (10a -c +11d), which is a digit.

Thus, for each (a,c,d), e is valid.

So, for each (a,c,d), we can compute b from equation 6: b = (d -1) -c.

But we have to ensure that b is a digit (0-9).

So, b = (d-1) -c.

Given that c is from 0-9, and d is from 1-9, so (d-1) can be 0-8.

So, b = (d-1) -c.

But c can be 0-9, so (d-1) -c can be from (d-1) -9 to (d-1) -0.

Which is (d-10) to (d-1).

But since d is 1-9, d-1 is 0-8, so (d-1) -9 can be as low as -9 (when d=1, (1-1)-9= -9).

Wait, but b must be a digit, 0-9.

So, if b = (d-1) -c is negative, that's invalid.

Thus, for each (a,c,d), we have to check whether b is between 0-9.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed (a,c) for each d, I didn't consider whether b would be non-negative.

So, perhaps in some cases, b would be negative, which would be invalid.

So, perhaps I need to go back and check for each (a,c,d) pair whether b is non-negative.

Because b is a digit, it can't be negative.

So, for each (a,c,d), compute b= (d-1)-c.

If b is between 0-9, then it's valid.

Otherwise, it's invalid and should be discarded.

So, for each d, when I have 10 or 2 (d=9) (a,c) pairs, I need to check how many of them have b= (d-1)-c ≥0.

Because if b is negative, that's invalid.

So, let's go back to each d and compute how many (a,c) pairs result in b ≥0.

Starting with d=1:

d=1:

b = (1-1) -c = 0 -c.

So, b= -c.

But c is 0-9, so b= -c would be 0- -9.

Which is invalid because b must be ≥0.

Wait a minute, this is a problem.

Wait, for d=1, b=0 -c = -c.

So, unless c=0, b would be negative.

But when c=0, b=0.

So, for d=1, only when c=0, b=0 is valid.

In our earlier analysis for d=1, the possible (a,c) pairs are:

k=80: a=8, c=0.

k=81: a=9, c=9.

k=82: a=9, c=8.

k=83: a=9, c=7.

k=84: a=9, c=6.

k=85: a=9, c=5.

k=86: a=9, c=4.

k=87: a=9, c=3.

k=88: a=9, c=2.

k=89: a=9, c=1.

So, for d=1, when c=0, b=0.

For other c's, b= -c <0, which is invalid.

So, only one valid (a,c) pair for d=1: a=8, c=0.

So, for d=1, only 1 valid possibility.

Similarly, let's check for d=2:

d=2:

b= (2-1) -c =1 -c.

So, b=1 -c ≥0.

Thus, c ≤1.

So, c can be 0 or 1.

Looking at the (a,c) pairs for d=2:

k=69: a=7, c=1.

k=70: a=7, c=0.

k=71: a=8, c=9.

k=72: a=8, c=8.

k=73: a=8, c=7.

k=74: a=8, c=6.

k=75: a=8, c=5.

k=76: a=8, c=4.

k=77: a=8, c=3.

k=78: a=8, c=2.

So, c can be 0 or 1.

Looking through the pairs:

k=69: c=1 → b=1-1=0.

k=70: c=0 → b=1-0=1.

The other pairs have c=2,3, etc., which would make b=1 -c negative.

So, only two valid pairs for d=2: a=7,c=1 and a=7,c=0.

Thus, d=2 contributes 2 possibilities.

Similarly, for d=3:

b= (3-1)-c=2 -c.

So, b=2 -c ≥0 → c ≤2.

Looking at the (a,c) pairs for d=3:

k=58: a=6, c=2.

k=59: a=6, c=1.

k=60: a=6, c=0.

k=61: a=7, c=9.

k=62: a=7, c=8.

k=63: a=7, c=7.

k=64: a=7, c=6.

k=65: a=7, c=5.

k=66: a=7, c=4.

k=67: a=7, c=3.

So, c can be 0,1,2.

Thus:

k=58: c=2 → b=0.

k=59: c=1 → b=1.

k=60: c=0 → b=2.

The rest have c≥3, which makes b negative.

Thus, d=3 contributes 3 possibilities.

Similarly, d=4:

b= (4-1)-c=3 -c.

So, b=3 -c ≥0 → c ≤3.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=4:

k=47: a=5, c=3.

k=48: a=5, c=2.

k=49: a=5, c=1.

k=50: a=5, c=0.

k=51: a=6, c=9.

k=52: a=6, c=8.

k=53: a=6, c=7.

k=54: a=6, c=6.

k=55: a=6, c=5.

k=56: a=6, c=4.

So, c can be 0,1,2,3.

Thus:

k=47: c=3 → b=0.

k=48: c=2 → b=1.

k=49: c=1 → b=2.

k=50: c=0 → b=3.

The rest have c≥4, which makes b negative.

Thus, d=4 contributes 4 possibilities.

d=5:

b= (5-1)-c=4 -c.

So, c ≤4.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=5:

k=36: a=4, c=4.

k=37: a=4, c=3.

k=38: a=4, c=2.

k=39: a=4, c=1.

k=40: a=4, c=0.

k=41: a=5, c=9.

k=42: a=5, c=8.

k=43: a=5, c=7.

k=44: a=5, c=6.

k=45: a=5, c=5.

So, c can be 0,1,2,3,4.

Thus:

k=36: c=4 → b=0.

k=37: c=3 → b=1.

k=38: c=2 → b=2.

k=39: c=1 → b=3.

k=40: c=0 → b=4.

The rest have c≥5, leading to b negative.

Thus, d=5 contributes 5 possibilities.

d=6:

b= (6-1)-c=5 -c.

So, c ≤5.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=6:

k=25: a=3, c=5.

k=26: a=3, c=4.

k=27: a=3, c=3.

k=28: a=3, c=2.

k=29: a=3, c=1.

k=30: a=3, c=0.

k=31: a=4, c=9.

k=32: a=4, c=8.

k=33: a=4, c=7.

k=34: a=4, c=6.

So, c can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Thus:

k=25: c=5 → b=0.

k=26: c=4 → b=1.

k=27: c=3 → b=2.

k=28: c=2 → b=3.

k=29: c=1 → b=4.

k=30: c=0 → b=5.

The rest have c≥6, making b negative.

Thus, d=6 contributes 6 possibilities.

d=7:

b= (7-1)-c=6 -c.

So, c ≤6.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=7:

k=14: a=2, c=6.

k=15: a=2, c=5.

k=16: a=2, c=4.

k=17: a=2, c=3.

k=18: a=2, c=2.

k=19: a=2, c=1.

k=20: a=2, c=0.

k=21: a=3, c=9.

k=22: a=3, c=8.

k=23: a=3, c=7.

So, c can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Thus:

k=14: c=6 → b=0.

k=15: c=5 → b=1.

k=16: c=4 → b=2.

k=17: c=3 → b=3.

k=18: c=2 → b=4.

k=19: c=1 → b=5.

k=20: c=0 → b=6.

The rest have c≥7, which makes b negative.

So, d=7 contributes 7 possibilities.

d=8:

b= (8-1)-c=7 -c.

So, c ≤7.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=8:

k=3: a=1, c=7.

k=4: a=1, c=6.

k=5: a=1, c=5.

k=6: a=1, c=4.

k=7: a=1, c=3.

k=8: a=1, c=2.

k=9: a=1, c=1.

k=10: a=1, c=0.

k=11: a=2, c=9.

k=12: a=2, c=8.

So, c can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Thus:

k=3: c=7 → b=0.

k=4: c=6 → b=1.

k=5: c=5 → b=2.

k=6: c=4 → b=3.

k=7: c=3 → b=4.

k=8: c=2 → b=5.

k=9: c=1 → b=6.

k=10: c=0 → b=7.

The rest have c=8,9 which makes b=7 -8= -1 and 7-9=-2, invalid.

So, d=8 contributes 8 possibilities.

d=9:

b= (9-1)-c=8 -c.

So, c ≤8.

Looking at (a,c) pairs for d=9:

k=0: a=0, c=0.

k=1: a=1, c=9.

So, for each:

k=0: c=0 → b=8-0=8.

k=1: c=9 → b=8-9= -1. Invalid.

So, only one valid pair: a=0, c=0.

Thus, d=9 contributes 1 possibility.

So, summarizing the valid (a,c,d) pairs:

d=1:1

d=2:2

d=3:3

d=4:4

d=5:5

d=6:6

d=7:7

d=8:8

d=9:1

Total: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+1=37.

Wait, let me add them up:

d=1:1

d=2:2 → total 3

d=3:3 → 6

d=4:4 →10

d=5:5→15

d=6:6→21

d=7:7→28

d=8:8→36

d=9:1→37.

So, 37 valid (a,c,d) triplets.

For each of these, we can compute:

b = (d-1)-c.

f =9 -c.

e=100 -10a +c -11d.

So, each triplet (a,c,d) leads to unique values of b, f, e.

Now, we need to ensure that all these are digits (0-9).

We already have:

- a: 0-9.

- c:0-9.

- d:1-9.

- b: computed as (d-1)-c, which is ≥0 as we ensured.

- f:9 -c, which is 0-9 since c=0-9.

- e:100 - (10a -c +11d), which is 0-9 as discussed.

So, all variables a,b,c,d,e,f are digits (0-9), with d≥1.

Thus, each of the 37 triplets (a,c,d) gives a valid grid configuration.

Wait, but I thought earlier that for each (a,c,d), there's a unique assignment of b, e, f.

So, for each (a,c,d), e is determined, b is determined, f is determined.

So, each triplet corresponds to exactly one grid.

Thus, the total number of grids is 37.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think.

Wait, no, the triplet (a,c,d) is fixed, and for each, b, e, f are uniquely determined.

So, each triplet gives exactly one grid.

Thus, the answer is 37.

But wait, let me recheck the sum.

d=1:1

d=2:2 →3

d=3:3→6

d=4:4→10

d=5:5→15

d=6:6→21

d=7:7→28

d=8:8→36

d=9:1→37.

Yes, 37.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, for d=8, when c=7, b=7-7=0, which is allowed.

Similarly, for d=9, only a=0, c=0 is allowed because a=1, c=9 gives b=-1, which is invalid.

So, all 37 triplets are valid.

Thus, the number of possible grids is 37.

But wait, let me double-check for d=9.

For d=9, triplet is a=0, c=0.

So, a=0, c=0, d=9.

Then:

b=8 -0=8.

f=9 -0=9.

e=100 -10*0 +0 -11*9=100 -0 +0 -99=1.

So, e=1.

So, the grid would be:

a=0, b=8, c=0

d=9, e=1, f=9

So, the grid is:

0 8 0

9 1 9

Let me check:

Left to right: 080 +919= 80 + 919= 999. Correct.

Top to bottom:

Columns: 09, 81, 09.

Sum:9 +81 +9=99. Correct.

So, this grid is valid.

Another example: d=1, a=8, c=0.

Then, b=0 -0=0.

f=9 -0=9.

e=100 -10*8 +0 -11*1=100-80 +0 -11=9.

So, e=9.

So, grid is:

8 0 0

1 9 9

Check:

800 +199=999. Correct.

Columns:81,09,09.

81 +9 +9=99. Correct.

Another example: d=2, a=7, c=1.

b=1 -1=0.

f=9 -1=8.

e=100 -10*7 +1 -11*2=100 -70 +1 -22=9.

So, grid:

7 0 1

2 9 8

Check:

701 +298=999. Correct.

Columns:72,09,18.

72 +9 +18=99. Correct.

So, all these examples work.

Thus, the total number of grids is 37.

Wait, but earlier I thought 8*10=80 and 2, but after filtering, it's 37.

So, the final answer is 37.

Thus, the number of ways is 37.


The number of valid grids is 37.

\boxed{37}
