Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. These are complex numbers that satisfy the equation ω^13 = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, we're talking about the primitive roots. There are φ(13) = 12 primitive roots because 13 is prime. So ω, ω^2, ..., ω^12 are all primitive 13th roots of unity.

The product given is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Wait a second, when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So the term for k=0 is 2 - 2(1) + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. That part is straightforward. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So I can write the product as (2 - 2ω^0 + ω^{0}) * Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 1 * Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So I can focus on calculating the product from k=1 to 12.

Now, each term in the product is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me try to simplify this expression. Let me factor out a 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it differently. Let me see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k for each k from 1 to 12.

So the product becomes Π_{k=1}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, as k runs from 1 to 12, x runs through all the primitive roots, i.e., x^13 = 1 and x ≠ 1.

Wait, so maybe I can think of this as a product over all primitive 13th roots of unity.
