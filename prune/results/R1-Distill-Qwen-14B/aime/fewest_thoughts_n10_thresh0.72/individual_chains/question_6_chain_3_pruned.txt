Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks me to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions, but with a shift inside another absolute value. That makes me think their graphs are V-shaped, but maybe with some transformations.

Let me start by analyzing f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape opening upwards with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts that graph down by 1/2 unit, making the vertex at (0, -1/2). But since it's inside another absolute value, ||x| - 1/2|, this will reflect any negative parts back up. So, if the original |x| - 1/2 goes below zero, the outer absolute value will flip it above. 

Wait, so let's think about it. For |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the outer absolute value makes it positive. So f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | is a V-shape that has its vertex at (0, 0), but it's actually two Vs. Let me sketch it mentally:

- For x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than or equal to 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative. The outer absolute makes it 1/2 - |x|. So this part is a downward-opening V with vertex at (0, 1/2) but only from x = -1/2 to x = 1/2.

- For |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is an upward-opening V starting at (1/2, 0) and going upwards as x moves away from 0.

Wait, no. Wait, when |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So for x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2, which is a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0). Similarly for x <= -1/2, f(x) = -x - 1/2, a line with slope -1 starting at (-1/2, 0).

But then, in between, for |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a peak at (0, 1/2) and slopes downward to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So the graph of f(x) is a W shape? Or is it a V with a peak in the middle and two Vs on either side?

Wait, no, maybe it's a V shape that's been modified. Let me plot some points.

At x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

At x = -1/2: same as above, 0.

At x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

At x = 3/2: f(3/2) = |3/2 - 1/2| = |1| =1.

So the graph between x = 0 and x =1/2 is a line from (0, 1/2) to (1/2, 0), then from x=1/2 to x=1, it goes from 0 to 1/2 again. Similarly on the negative side. So f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has a peak at (0, 1/2) and goes down to 0 at x = ±1/2, then up again as |x| increases beyond 1/2.

So the graph of f(x) has a sort of "W" shape but only in the middle part
