Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I might start by looking at numbers near 9999 and check the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

If I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, which must be divisible by 7.

Same goes for changing C to 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D, divisible by 7.

And changing D to 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1, also divisible by 7.

So, for each digit, replacing it with 1 leads to a number divisible by 7. Therefore, each of these four numbers must satisfy N' ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, for each digit position, the number after replacement must be 0 mod 7. Let me think about how to model this.

Let me denote the original number as N. Then, the modified numbers are:

N1 = N - (A*1000) + 1000 = 1BCD
N2 = N - (B*100) + 100 = A1CD
N3 = N - (C*10) + 10 = AB1D
N4 = N - D + 1 = ABC1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Alternatively, I can write these as:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N + ( -1000A + 1000 )) ≡ 0 mod 7

But maybe it's better to express each condition as N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, etc., and then find N.

Wait, but maybe I can express each condition in terms of N and the digit being replaced. Let me try that.

For N1 = 1BCD: N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = (N - 1000A) + 1000. Because N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, so subtracting 1000A leaves 100B + 10C + D, then adding 1000 gives 1BCD.

Similarly, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7 → N ≡ (1000A - 1000) mod 7.

Wait, maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, since N1 is divisible by 7, then N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So,

1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) = (N -
