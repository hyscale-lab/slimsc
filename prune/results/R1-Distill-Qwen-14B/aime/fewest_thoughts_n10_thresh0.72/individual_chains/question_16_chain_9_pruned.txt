Alright, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \)."

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Once I find that prime, I have to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts. If a prime \( p \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \). If I square both sides, I get \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p \). That tells me that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) divides 8. But since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \), the order can't be 4, because then \( n^4 \equiv 1 \mod p \), which contradicts \( n^4 \equiv -1 \). So the order must be 8. That implies that 8 divides \( p - 1 \), because the multiplicative group modulo \( p \) is cyclic of order \( p - 1 \). Therefore, \( p \) must be congruent to 1 modulo 8, right? So primes like 17, 97, etc., are candidates.

But wait, the problem isn't just about divisibility by \( p \); it's about divisibility by \( p^2 \). So I need to find a prime \( p \) such that there's an \( n \) with \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). And among such primes, I need the smallest one.

Let me check small primes first. Let's start with the smallest primes:

- \( p = 2 \): Let's see, \( n \) is a positive integer. Let's compute \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo \( 4 \). For \( n \) even, \( n = 2k \), so \( n^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). For \( n \) odd, \( n = 2k + 1 \), \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute modulo 4:

\( (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \). So \( 2^2 = 4 \) cannot divide \( n^4 + 1 \) because the remainder is either 1 or 2 modulo 4. So \( p=2 \) is out.

Next, \( p=3 \): Let's check if \( 3^2 = 9 \) can divide \( n^4 + 1 \). Let's compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \). The possible residues modulo 9 are 0,1,2,...,8. Let's compute \( n^4 \) for each:

- 0: 0
- 1: 1
- 2: 16 mod 9 is 7
- 3: 81 mod 9 is 0
- 4: 256 mod 9. Let's compute 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4.
- 5: 625 mod 9. 625-69*9=625-621=4, so 4.
- 6: 1296 mod 9 is 0.
- 7: 2401 mod 9. 2+4+0+1=7, which is the digital root, so 7.
- 8: 4096 mod 9. 4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1. So 1.

So \( n^4 \) modulo
