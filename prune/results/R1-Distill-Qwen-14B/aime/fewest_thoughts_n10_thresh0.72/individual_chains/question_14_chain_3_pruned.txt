Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need the greatest such number, so ideally, I should start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

The key condition is that changing any single digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

The problem states that changing any digit to 1 will make N divisible by 7. So, if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD and must be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. The same goes for C and D.

So, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a multiple of 7. Therefore, N has four such properties:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need to find N such that all four of these are true, and N is as large as possible.

Let me think about how to model this. Since N is four digits, let me write it as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When I replace the first digit A with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, replacing the second digit B with 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D, and so on.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, each of these four numbers is congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, in terms of equations:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Let me compute each of these modulo 7 to make it easier.

First, let's find 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7: 3*7=21, no, wait, 10-7=3, so 10 ≡3 mod7.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, let's rewrite each equation:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

So, these are the four modular equations.

Now, we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D (digits, so 0-9 except A which is 1-9). We need to find A, B, C, D such that all four equations are satisfied.

Since we are looking for the greatest four-digit number, we should aim for the largest possible A, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's try to find A=9 first, then B=9, etc., but ensuring that the four conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express D in terms of the other variables from each equation and find a common D.

Let me see.

From equation 1: 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡ (-6 -2B -3C) mod7

From equation 2: 6A +2 +3C +D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡ (-6A -2 -3C) mod7

From equation3: 6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡ (-6A -2B -3) mod7

From equation4: 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 → 6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7 → 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

So, equation4 gives a relation between A, B, and C: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Now, since D must satisfy all four congruences, the expressions for D from equations 1,2,3 must all be congruent mod7.

Therefore, let's set the expressions for D equal to each other.

From equation1 and equation2:

-6 -2B -3C ≡ -6A -2 -3C mod7

Simplify:

-6 -2B -3C +6A +2 +3C ≡0 mod7

Simplify terms:

(-6+2) + (-2B) + ( -3C +3C) +6A ≡0 mod7

(-4) -2B +6A ≡0 mod7

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7

Let me write that as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's compare equation1 and equation3.

From equation1: D ≡ (-6 -2B -3C) mod7

From equation3: D ≡ (-6A -2B -3) mod7

Set equal:

-6 -2B -3C ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7

Simplify:

-6 -3C +6A +3 ≡0 mod7

( -6 +3 ) + (-3C) +6A ≡0 mod7

(-3) -3C +6A ≡0 mod7

So, 6A -3C -3 ≡0 mod7 → 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

We can factor out 3: 3*(2A - C) ≡3 mod7 → 2A - C ≡1 mod7, since 3 and 7 are coprime.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

That's another equation: 2A - C =1 +7k, where k is an integer.

Similarly, let's compare equation2 and equation3.

From equation2: D ≡ (-6A -2 -3C) mod7

From equation3: D ≡ (-6A -2B -3) mod7

Set equal:

-6A -2 -3C ≡ -6A -2B -3 mod7

Simplify:

-2 -3C +2B +3 ≡0 mod7

( -2 +3 ) + ( -3C + 2B ) ≡0 mod7

1 -3C +2B ≡0 mod7 → 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7 → 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

So, that's another equation: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Now, so far, we have the following equations:

1. 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 (from eq1 and eq2)
2. 2A - C ≡1 mod7 (from eq1 and eq3)
3. 2B -3C ≡6 mod7 (from eq2 and eq3)
4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (from eq4)

Wait, equation4 is 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, so we can try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation2: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From equation1: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let's write this as 6A -4 ≡2B mod7 → B ≡ (6A -4)/2 mod7.

But division by 2 mod7 is equivalent to multiplying by the inverse of 2 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7.

Compute (6A -4)*4:

= 24A -16

24 mod7: 24 ÷7=3*7=21, remainder 3 → 24≡3 mod7.

-16 mod7: 16 ÷7=2*7=14, remainder 2 → 16≡2 → -16≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, (6A -4)*4 ≡3A +5 mod7.

Thus, B ≡3A +5 mod7.

Similarly, from equation3: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

But we have C ≡2A -1 mod7 from equation2, and B ≡3A +5 mod7.

Substitute these into equation3:

2*(3A +5) -3*(2A -1) ≡6 mod7

Compute:

6A +10 -6A +3 ≡6 mod7

Simplify:

(6A -6A) + (10 +3) ≡6 mod7 → 13 ≡6 mod7.

13 mod7 is 6, so 6 ≡6 mod7. Which is true. So, equation3 is satisfied once equations1 and 2 are satisfied. So, no new info there.

So, now, we can express B and C in terms of A.

Let me summarize:

C ≡2A -1 mod7

B ≡3A +5 mod7

But since B and C are digits (0-9), their values modulo7 can be extended to 0-9.

So, for each value of A, B and C can be determined modulo7, but we have to make sure that when we compute them, they stay within 0-9.

Let me try to express B and C as:

B = (3A +5) mod7, but since B is a digit, B can be written as (3A +5 +7k), where k is such that B is between 0 and9.

Similarly, C = (2A -1) mod7. C can be written as (2A -1 +7m), where m is such that C is between 0 and9.

But perhaps it's better to find B and C for each A from 9 down to 1, ensuring that B and C are digits, and then check equation4.

Because equation4 is another condition.

Equation4: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

But since B and C are expressed in terms of A, perhaps equation4 is automatically satisfied? Let me check.

From equation4: 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

We have B =3A +5 mod7, and C=2A -1 mod7.

Substituting:

6A +2*(3A +5) +3*(2A -1) mod7

Compute:

6A +6A +10 +6A -3 mod7

Total: (6A +6A +6A) + (10 -3) =18A +7 mod7.

18 mod7: 18-14=4,
