Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, Alice picks some set A, and Bob is creating sets B where each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and importantly, the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I'm supposed to find the sum of all elements in A.

First, I think I need to understand how Bob's list is constructed. Each set B has a maximum element, say m, which is in A. So for each m in A, Bob can create sets B where m is the maximum. These sets B would consist of any combination of elements from the positive integers less than m, plus m itself as the maximum.

Wait, so for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of the positive integers less than m, right? Because each such subset can be combined with m to form a set B where m is the maximum.

But wait, the subsets can include any number of elements less than m. So for each m, the number of possible B's where max(B) = m is 2^{m-1}. Because the elements less than m are 1, 2, ..., m-1, and each can be included or not in the subset. So that's 2^{m-1} subsets. But since the set B must be non-empty, do I need to subtract 1 for the empty set? Wait no, because the maximum is m, which is included, so the subsets of the lower elements can be empty. So actually, each B is formed by taking a subset S of {1,2,...,m-1} (including the empty subset) and adding m. So the number of such B's for each m is 2^{m-1}.

Wait, but the problem says that B is a finite non-empty set. So when m is the maximum, the set B must have at least m, so it's non-empty. So for each m, the number of B's is 2^{m-1}. Because you can choose any subset of {1,2,...,m-1} and add m to it, including the empty subset which gives just {m}.

So the total number of B's that Bob can list is the sum over all m in A of 2^{m-1}. And this sum is given as 2024.

So the equation is: sum_{m ∈ A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

I need to find the sum of the elements of A, which is sum_{m ∈ A} m.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for all m in A is equal to 2024.

Wait a minute, this looks like binary representation. Because 2^{m-1} are powers of two, so the sum would be a sum of distinct powers of two. So
