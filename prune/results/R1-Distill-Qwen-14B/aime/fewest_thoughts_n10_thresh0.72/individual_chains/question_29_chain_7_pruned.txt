Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16. So, AB is the longer side, so ABCD is a tall, narrow rectangle. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. D, E, C, F are on a straight line. So, points D and C are adjacent corners of the first rectangle, and E and F are corners of the second rectangle, lying on the same line as D and C.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic. That must mean that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, that gives some properties we can use, maybe something with cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16, which is the length of the side of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is equal to AD, and AB is equal to CD. So, AB=107, so CD=107 as well.

- FG=17: In rectangle EFGH, FG is one of the sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so FG=EH=17, and EF=GH=184.

Wait, EF is given as 184. So, EF is a horizontal side of rectangle EFGH, assuming the standard orientation.

But wait, I need to be careful. Without knowing the orientation, I can't assume which sides are horizontal or vertical. So, maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make sense of it.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's fix a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, with AB=107 and BC=16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (0,16), because BC=16 is vertical. Then, A is at (107,0), because AB=107 is horizontal. Wait, no, hold on: Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107, then BC is 16, meaning that AB is horizontal and BC is vertical.

Wait, let me think again. If ABCD is a rectangle, with AB=107, BC=16, then the sides are AB (horizontal), BC (vertical), CD (horizontal opposite to AB), and DA (vertical opposite to BC). So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (0,16), B at (107,16), and A at (107,0). Wait, no, that doesn't
