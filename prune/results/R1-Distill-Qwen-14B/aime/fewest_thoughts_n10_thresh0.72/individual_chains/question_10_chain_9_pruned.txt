Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, A is a set of positive integers. Bob is considering all finite nonempty sets B where each B has a maximum element that's in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. My goal is to find the sum of the elements in A.

First, I should think about how the size of A relates to the number of such sets B. Let's denote the elements of A as a1, a2, ..., an, where a1 < a2 < ... < an. So, A has n elements.

Now, for each element ai in A, how many sets B can have ai as their maximum? Well, for each ai, the set B must include ai and any combination of numbers less than ai. Since B is a finite nonempty set, the number of possible subsets for the elements less than ai is 2^{(ai - 1)}. Wait, why is that?

Because for each number less than ai, say 1, 2, ..., ai-1, each can be either included or excluded from B, except that B must be non-empty. But wait, no, actually, the condition is that the maximum is ai, so B must include ai and any subset of the numbers less than ai. So for each ai, the number of possible B's where the maximum is ai is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, including the empty set. But wait, B has to be non-empty. Wait, no, because B must contain at least ai, so even if all the other elements are excluded, {ai} is a valid set. So, the number of subsets is 2^{ai - 1}.

Therefore, for each ai, the number of sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai - 1}.

So, the total number of such sets B is the sum over all ai in A of 2^{ai - 1}. So, total B = sum_{ai in A} 2^{ai - 1} = 2024.

So, sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{a_k -1} = 2024.

Now, I need to find the set A such that the sum of 2^{(ai -1)} for all ai in A is 2024. Then, once I find A, I can compute the sum of its elements.

Wait, but how do I find A given this condition? It seems like I need to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2, but each term is 2^{(ai -1)}, which is 2^{ai}/2.

Alternatively, the sum can be thought of as (sum_{ai in A} 2^{ai}) / 2 = 2024. So, sum_{ai in A} 2^{ai} = 4048.

So, 4048 is equal to the
