Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that its distances to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in the form m sqrt(n)/p, and then find m + n + p.

Hmm, first, I remember that the point equidistant from all faces of a tetrahedron is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think the formula involves the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces. The formula is something like r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. Wait, is it 3V/S? Because in a tetrahedron, the volume can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the total area. Let me recall: for a tetrahedron, the volume is equal to one-third of the inradius multiplied by the total surface area. So, V = (1/3) * r * S_total. Therefore, r = 3V / S_total.

So, I need to find the volume V and the total surface area S of the tetrahedron. 

But wait, how do I compute the volume when I know the edge lengths? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for that. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1
1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2
1 a^2 0 d^2 e^2
1 b^2 d^2 0 f^2
1 c^2 e^2 f^2 0

So, let me assign the given edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) ⇒ a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) ⇒ b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) ⇒ c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) ⇒ d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) ⇒ e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) ⇒ f = sqrt(41)

So, let's compute the squares:

a² = 41, b² = 80, c² = 89, d² = 89, e² = 80, f² = 41.

Now, the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The second row is [1, 0, a², b², c²] which is [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]. Third row: [1, a², 0, d², e²] which is [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]. Fourth row: [1,
