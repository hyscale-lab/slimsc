Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, an 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns. To move from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, you have to move right 7 times and up 7 times because each step moves you one unit either right or up. Wait, no, actually, each move from one intersection to another is a step, so from the lower left to the upper right, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up? Wait, no, waitâ€”the grid is 8x8, so it's divided into squares, so the number of steps is actually 15 in each direction, because an 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, think of it as a grid with lines. If it's an 8x8 grid, that means it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns, but the number of points is 9x9. So to go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up. Each path is a sequence of right and up moves. The total number of steps is 16, right? Because 8 right + 8 up = 16 steps. So the length of the path is 16. 

Now, the problem asks for paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm. So, normally, a path can be a straight line if you go all rights first and then all ups, or all ups first and then all rights. But in this case, the path changes direction four times. So, each time you switch from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, how does that work? Let's think about the number of direction changes. If you have a path that alternates right and up each step, that would change direction 15 times, but that's the maximum. But here, we're looking for exactly four direction changes.

So, how does a path with exactly four direction changes look? Let me visualize it. Each direction change is a switch from moving in one direction to the other. So, if you have four direction changes, that means the path is made
