Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x, so we can write y z = x / 2^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24 - 12/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So, y z = 2^(-19/24)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We can write y = 2^(1/3) * x * z

But x is 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z = 2^( (8/24 -7/24) ) * z = 2^(1/24) z

So, y = 2^(1/24) z

Now, from equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y

But x is 2^(-7/24), y is 2^(1/24) z. So substitute:

z = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-7/24) * 2^(1/24) z

Simplify the exponents:

1/4 is 6/24. So,

z = 2^(6/24 -7/24 +1/24) * z = 2^(0/24) * z = 2^0 * z = 1 * z = z

Wait, so z = z? That doesn't give me any new information. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the expressions from equations (1), (2), (3), we can set up a system of equations.

Let me denote a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z.

Then, since log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2, that's equivalent to log₂x - log₂y - log₂z = 1/2, which is a - b - c = 1/2.

Similarly, log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 becomes log₂y - log₂x - log₂z = 1/3, which is -a + b - c = 1/3.

And log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 becomes log₂z - log₂x - log₂y = 1/4, which is -a - b + c = 1/4.

So now I have a system of three linear equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Let me write them as:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

This seems more manageable. It's a linear system in a, b, c.

Let me write this in matrix form or try to solve step by step.

First, let's add equations (1) and (2):

(1) + (2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Simplify: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6

So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12

Wait, but c is log₂z, and z is a positive real number, so c can be negative. So, c = -5/12.

Hmm, okay. Now, let's add equations (1) and (3):

(1) + (3): (a -a) + (-b -b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4

Simplify: 0 -2b + 0 = 3/4

So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/8

So, b = -3/8. So, log₂y = -3/8, which implies y = 2^(-3/8).

Now, let's
