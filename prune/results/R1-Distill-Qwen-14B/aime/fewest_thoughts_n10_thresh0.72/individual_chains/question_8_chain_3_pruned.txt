Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out.

First, I should understand what the problem is asking. We have three variables a, b, c, which are all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals six million. I need to find how many such triples exist.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation can be factored or perhaps simplified. Let me look at it again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Wait, I can factor terms. Let's see:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That seems right. Since b + c = 300 - a, because a + b + c = 300. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b and a + b = 300 - c.

So substitute those in:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this. Maybe I can express this as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Is there a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to the sum a + b + c? Maybe. Let me recall some identities.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, from this, we can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c) and (ab + bc + ac):

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Given that a + b + c = 300, so:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Similarly, perhaps I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums. I recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

So substituting the known sum:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

Calculate 300³: 300*300=90,000, 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

Now, going back to the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substitute a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)):

= 300*90,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac)

= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac)

Then, subtract [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc]:

= 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600(ab + bc + ac) + 900(ab + bc + ac) = 300(ab + bc + ac)

Then, minus 3abc.

So overall, the equation becomes:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Let me write this as:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Hmm, I can factor 3 out:

3[100(ab + bc + ac) - abc] = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

So now, we have:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ac.

So, this equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

But I also know that S = 300. So, perhaps I can relate Q and P using S.

Wait, another identity: (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, another identity: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b + 3abc. Or wait, actually, no. Wait, let me think.

Wait, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ac) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ac) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ac). Hmm, that's a bit more complicated.

Wait, let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) term by term:

Each term is a*(ab) + a*(bc) + a*(ac) + similarly for b and c.

So,

= a²b + a b c + a² c + a b² + b² c + a b c + a c² + b c² + a c².

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c) * (ab + bc + ac)

Which can be expanded as:

a(ab + bc + ac) + b(ab + bc + ac) + c(ab + bc + ac)

= a²b + a b c + a²c + a b² + b²c + a b c + a c² + b c² + a c
