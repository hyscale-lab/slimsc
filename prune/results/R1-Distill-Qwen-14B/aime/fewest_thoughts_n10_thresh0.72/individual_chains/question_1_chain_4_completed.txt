Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let me write that expression in terms of logarithms.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

So I need to find 4a + 3b + 2c, where a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z.

Alternatively, I can let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z, then express the given equations in terms of a, b, c.

Let me try that.

Given:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2

Which is log₂x - log₂(y z) = 1/2

Which is a - (b + c) = 1/2

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1b)

Equation (2): log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3

Which is log₂y - log₂(x z) = 1/3

Which is b - (a + c) = 1/3

Equation (2b): -a + b - c = 1/3  ...(2b)

Equation (3): log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Which is log₂z - log₂(x y) = 1/4

Which is c - (a + b) = 1/4

Equation (3b): -a - b + c = 1/4  ...(3b)

So now I have a system of three equations in variables a, b, c:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1b)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2b)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3b)

This is a linear system, which I can solve using substitution or elimination.

Let me write the equations:

Equation (1b): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2b): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3b): -a - b + c = 1/4

Let me add all three equations together to see if that helps.

Left side: (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) 

= a - a - a + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c)

= (-a) + (-b) + (-c)

Right side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Compute right side:

Convert to common denominator, which is 12.

1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12.

Total: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13/12.

So left side: (-a - b - c) = 13/12

Which implies that a + b + c = -13/12  ...(5)

So, equation (5): a + b + c = -13/12

Now, let's see if I can find individual values.

From equation (1b): a - b - c = 1/2

From equation (5): a + b + c = -13/12

Maybe I can add equation (1b) and (5) to eliminate b and c.

Adding (1b) + (5):

(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)

Left side: 2a

Right side: 1/2 - 13/12 = 6/12 -13/12 = (-7)/12

So 2a = -7/12 → a = (-7/12)/2 = -7/24

So a = -7/24

Similarly, perhaps subtract equation (1b) from equation (5) to find b + c.

Wait, let's see.

From equation (5): a + b + c = -13/12

From equation (1b): a - b - c = 1/2

If we subtract equation (1b) from equation (5):

(a + b + c) - (a - b - c) = (-13/12) - (1/2)

Left side:

a - a + b + b + c + c = 2b + 2c

Right side:

-13/12 - 6/12 = (-19)/12

So 2b + 2c = (-19)/12 → b + c = (-19)/24  ...(6)

Similarly, let's use equation (2b): -a + b - c = 1/3

We know a = -7/24, so substitute that in:

-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 → 7/24 + b - c = 1/3

Convert 1/3 to 8/24:

7/24 + b - c = 8/24 → b - c = 1/24  ...(7)

Now, from equation (6): b + c = (-19)/24

And equation (7): b - c = 1/24

We can add these two equations to eliminate c.

Adding (6) and (7):

(b + c) + (b - c) = (-19/24) + (1/24)

Left side: 2b

Right side: (-18)/24 = (-3)/4

So 2b = -3/4 → b = (-3/4)/2 = -3/8

So b = -3/8

Now, from equation (7): b - c = 1/24

We have b = -3/8, so:

-3/8 - c = 1/24

Let's solve for c.

- c = 1/24 + 3/8

Convert 3/8 to 9/24:

So 1/24 + 9/24 = 10/24 = 5/12

So -c = 5/12 → c = -5/12

Wait, but c is supposed to be log₂z, and z is a positive real number, so c can be negative, which is fine.

So now, we have:

a = log₂x = -7/24

b = log₂y = -3/8

c = log₂z = -5/12

So now, the expression we need is 4a + 3b + 2c.

Compute that:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

So total: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, let's find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have LCD 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 3.

-75 ÷3= -25, 24 ÷3=8.

So -25/8.

But the question asks for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, which is |4a + 3b + 2c|.

So | -25/8 | = 25/8

So 25/8 is the value. Now, 25 and 8 are coprime because 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

So m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the signs or fractions.

Starting from the top:

We had a = log₂x = -7/24

b = log₂y = -3/8

c = log₂z = -5/12

Compute 4a: 4*(-7/24)= -28/24 = -7/6

3b: 3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2c: 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -5/6

Now sum these:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Combine the first and third terms: (-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2

So total: -2 -9/8 = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25/8)

Absolute value is 25/8, as I thought.

So yeah, the value is 25/8, which is m/n=25/8, so m+n= 25+8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

We then multiply all three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x y z}{(y z)(x z)(x y)} = \frac{1}{x y z}
\]

The right side simplifies to:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). This transforms the given equations into:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Adding these three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12} \implies a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

We solve the system of equations to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

1. Adding \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\), we get \(2a = -\frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}\).
2. Subtracting \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\) from \(a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}\), we get \(2(b + c) = -\frac{19}{12} \implies b + c = -\frac{19}{24}\).
3. Using \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\), we substitute \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\) and solve to find \(b - c = \frac{1}{24}\).

Solving these, we find:

- \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\)
- \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\)

We then compute \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a = 4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) = -\frac{7}{6}
\]
\[
3b = 3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) = -\frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
2c = 2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Summing these:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
