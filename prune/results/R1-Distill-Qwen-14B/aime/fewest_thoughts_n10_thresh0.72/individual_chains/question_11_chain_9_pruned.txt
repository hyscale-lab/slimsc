Okay, so I have this problem to solve: Find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand what's given. z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z could also be written as a + bi, where a^2 + b^2 = 16, but maybe using the exponential form will be more helpful here because it relates to the real and imaginary parts through sine and cosine.

The expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this as E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. We need to find the maximum real part of E, Re(E).

Since z has a magnitude of 4, 1/z will have a magnitude of 1/4. So, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me substitute z and 1/z into the expression E.

E = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Simplify the coefficients first. Let's compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4 = 75*4 + 117i*4 = 300 + 468i. So, the first part is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i. So, the second part is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, e^{iθ} is cosθ + isinθ, and e^{-iθ} is cosθ - isinθ. Maybe I can expand both terms using this.

Let me write E as:

E = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + isinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - isinθ)

Now, I'll distribute each part:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + isinθ)

= 300cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Similarly, for the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - isinθ)

= 24cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, i^2 = -1:

= 24cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Now, let's combine these two results.

First, let's collect the real parts and the imaginary parts.
