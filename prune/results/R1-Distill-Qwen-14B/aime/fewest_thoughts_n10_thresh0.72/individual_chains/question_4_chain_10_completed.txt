Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game problem between Alice and Bob. The game involves a stack of n tokens, and they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.

Hmm. So first, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. It reminds me of the classic Nim game, but with specific move options—only removing 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So, I should probably look into the concept of winning and losing positions.

A losing position is one where no matter what move you make, the opponent can force a win. Conversely, a winning position is one where there's at least one move that leads the opponent into a losing position.

Let me try to model this. Let's start by examining small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice leaves 1 token, then Bob can take it and win. So if n=2, Alice can't force Bob to lose. Wait, wait—no, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, in n=2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes the last token and wins. So if Alice plays optimally, she can win when n=2. But wait, is that the case?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of whose turn it is. Let me make a table of n and whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the current player.

n | Outcome (Current Player Can Win)
--- | ---
0 | L (no moves to make, so lose)
1 | W (take 1 and win)
2 | W (take 1, leaving 1 for opponent, who then can win. Wait, no—if n=2, current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take 1 and win. So if n=2, current player can't force a win? Wait, no, because the current player can only take 1 or 4 tokens. Wait, but 4 is more than n=2, so only option is to take 1, leaving n=1. Then opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So when n=2, current player loses if opponent plays optimally.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express this.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the current player can only take 1 or 4 tokens. So for n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1. Then the next player can take 1 and win. So for n=2, the current player cannot force a win; thus, n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, but wait, that's if the current player is the first to move and leaves n=1 for the opponent. So in this case, the current player would lose.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this by defining for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let me try to build the table step by step.

n=0: L (no move possible)
n=1: W (take 1, win)
n=2: Let's see. From n=2, possible moves are to take 1, leading to n=1 (which is W for the next player). So if the current player takes 1, the next player can win. Therefore, n=2 is L for the current player.
Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if n=2 is L, then the next player can win. So yes.

n=3: From n=3, possible moves are to take 1, leading to n=2 (which is L for the next player). So if the current player takes 1, leaving n=2 (a losing position for the next player), then the current player can win. So n=3 is W.

n=4: Possible moves: take 1 leading to n=3 (W), or take 4 leading to n=0 (L). So if the current player takes 4, the next player can't move and loses. So n=4 is W.

n=5: Possible moves: take 1 leading to n=4 (W), or take 4 leading to n=1 (W). Both options leave the next player in a winning position. So n=5 is L.

n=6: Possible moves: take 1 → n=5 (L), or take 4 → n=2 (L). So if the current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L), then the next player is in a losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Possible moves: take 1 → n=6 (W), or take 4 → n=3 (W). Both options leave the next player in a winning position. So n=7 is L.

n=8: Possible moves: take 1 → n=7 (L), take 4 → n=4 (W). So if the current player takes 1, leaving n=7 (L), then the next player is in a losing position. So n=8 is W.

n=9: Possible moves: take 1 → n=8 (W), take 4 → n=5 (L). So if the current player takes 4, leaving n=5 (L), then the next player is in a losing position. So n=9 is W.

Wait, but wait: n=5 is a losing position, so if you can take 4 from n=9 to leave 5, then n=9 is a winning position.

Wait, but let me double-check:

Wait, when n=5, the current player can take 1 or 4. Taking 1 leads to n=4, which is W for the next player. Taking 4 leads to n=1, which is W for the next player. So n=5 is L. So yes, taking 4 from n=9 leads to n=5, which is L. So n=9 is W.

n=10: Possible moves: take 1 → n=9 (W), take 4 → n=6 (W). Both options leave the next player in a winning position. So n=10 is L.

n=11: Take 1 → n=10 (L). So if current player takes 1, next player is in L. So n=11 is W.

n=12: Take 1 → n=11 (W), take 4 → n=8 (W). Both options leave next player in W, so n=12 is L? Wait, no. Wait, if both options lead to W, then the current player can't force a L for the next player. So n=12 is L.

Wait, but wait: n=12: Let's see. If you take 1, you leave n=11 (W) for the next player. If you take 4, you leave n=8 (W). So both moves leave the next player in a W position. Therefore, the current player can't force a loss, so n=12 is L.

Hmm, I think I see a pattern emerging here. Let me list the positions I have so far:

n | Outcome
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
11| W
12| L

Looking at this, let me see if I can find a cycle or a pattern.

Looking at the sequence from n=0 to n=12:

L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L.

Hmm. Let me see the positions where n is a losing position: 0,2,5,7,10,12.

Wait, the differences between these are:

2-0=2,

5-2=3,

7-5=2,

10-7=3,

12-10=2.

So the pattern is alternating between adding 2 and 3. So 0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, and so on.

So the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22, etc.

Wait, let me check n=13,14,15.

n=13: Can take 1 → n=12 (L), so current player can win by taking 1. So n=13 is W.

n=14: Can take 1 → n=13 (W), or take 4 → n=10 (L). So taking 4 leaves n=10 (L), so n=14 is W.

n=15: Can take 1 → n=14 (W), or take 4 → n=11 (W). Both lead to W for the next player. So n=15 is L.

Yes, that fits the pattern: after 12 comes 15.

So the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... So every 5 steps, the losing positions seem to be at intervals of 2 and 3 alternately.

So the losing positions are when n ≡ 2 mod 5 or n ≡ 0 mod 5? Wait, let's check:

0 mod 5 is 0,

2 mod 5 is 2,

5 mod 5 is 0,

7 mod 5 is 2,

10 mod 5 is 0,

12 mod 5 is 2,

15 mod5 is 0,

17 mod5 is 2,

20 mod5 is 0,

22 mod5 is 2,

So yes, the losing positions are when n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, but 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, etc.

So the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, let me confirm with n=16,17, etc.

n=16: Can take 1 → n=15 (L). So current player can take 1 and win. So n=16 is W.

n=17: If n=17 is a losing position, then current player can't force a win. Let's see: possible moves are take1 leading to n=16 (W), take4 leading to n=13 (W). So both options leave the next player in a W position, so n=17 is L.

Yes, that's consistent with the pattern. So n=17 mod5 is 2.

So the losing positions occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let me check n=20: n=20 is 0 mod5, so it's a losing position.

n=21: Take1 → 20 (L), so current player can win by taking1. So n=21 is W.

n=22: 22 mod5 is 2, so it's a losing position.

Yes, that fits.

So, in general, the losing positions are n where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, for a given n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then the current player is in a losing position, i.e., Bob can win if Alice starts at n where n is a losing position.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the problem, Alice goes first. So if n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, meaning Bob can win.

So the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So now, I need to count how many numbers less than or equal to 2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.

So for each modulus 5, the possible residues are 0,1,2,3,4.

We're interested in residues 0 and 2.

In each block of 5 consecutive numbers, there are exactly 2 such numbers: one ≡0, another ≡2.

So total blocks in 2024 would be 2024//5 = 404 full blocks, each contributing 2 numbers, plus the remaining numbers.

Wait, 5*404=2020, so 2024-2020=4. So the last partial block is 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Now, let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

In each full block of 5, 0 and 2 contribute 2 numbers.

Number of full blocks: 404, so 404*2=808.

Now, the remaining numbers are 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Check which of these are ≡0 or 2 mod5:

2021 ÷5: 5*404=2020, so 2021=2020+1→1 mod5.

2022=2020+2→2 mod5.

2023=2020+3→3 mod5.

2024=2020+4→4 mod5.

So in the last partial block, only 2022 is ≡2 mod5.

So in the partial block, we have 1 number that's ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So total numbers= 404*2 +1=808+1=809.

Wait, but let me check: 2024 is included, so 2024 is 4 mod5, so not 0 or 2.

So in the last 4 numbers, only 2022 is 2 mod5, so 1 number.

So total numbers where n≡0 or 2 mod5 ≤2024 is 404*2 +1=809.

Wait, but let me double-check the counts.

Each full block of 5 numbers (like 1-5,6-10,...2021-2025) would have exactly two numbers: 0 and 2 mod5. But wait, 2021 is 1 mod5, 2022 is 2, 2023 is 3, 2024 is 4, and 2025 would be 0 mod5. But since we're only going up to 2024, the last partial block is 2021,2022,2023,2024.

In that last block, only 2022 is 2 mod5, so 1 number.

So total numbers =404 blocks *2 +1=809.

Wait, but let me think: the first block is 1-5, but wait, actually, for n=0, it's a losing position, but n starts from 1. So when I'm counting n>=1, the first number is 1.

Wait, let me see: n=0 is not counted because the problem is about positive integers, so n starts at 1.

So when I count the numbers up to 2024, n=0 isn't included.

So in each block of 5 numbers, from 1 to 5, 6 to10, etc., how many are ≡0 or 2 mod5?

Wait, for example, in 1-5: 2 and 5 are the losing positions. So 2 numbers.

Similarly, 6-10:7 and10.

So each block contributes 2 numbers.

So 404 blocks from 1 to 2020: 404*2=808.

Now, 2021-2024: check which are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

2021:1, 2022:2, 2023:3, 2024:4.

So only 2022 is 2 mod5, so 1 number.

So total is 808+1=809.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is 809.

Therefore, the answer is 809.


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens, with Alice starting first. The player who removes the last token wins.

We define a position as a "winning position" (W) if the current player can force a win, and a "losing position" (L) if the current player cannot avoid losing, assuming optimal play from the opponent.

By examining small values of \( n \), we identify the following pattern for losing positions:
- \( n = 0 \): L (no move possible)
- \( n = 1 \): W (take 1 token and win)
- \( n = 2 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)
- \( n = 3 \): W (take 1 token, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 4 \): W (take 4 tokens and win)
- \( n = 5 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)
- \( n = 6 \): W (take 1 token, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 7 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)
- \( n = 8 \): W (take 1 token, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 9 \): W (take 4 tokens, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 10 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)
- \( n = 11 \): W (take 1 token, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 12 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)
- \( n = 13 \): W (take 1 token, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 14 \): W (take 4 tokens, leaving the opponent in a losing position)
- \( n = 15 \): L (any move leads to a winning position for the opponent)

From this, we observe that losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To find the number of such \( n \) up to 2024:
1. Each block of 5 consecutive numbers contributes exactly 2 losing positions (one \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), another \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)).
2. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) full blocks, each contributing 2 losing positions, totaling \( 404 \times 2 = 808 \) losing positions.
3. In the partial block from 2021 to 2024, only 2022 (\( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)) is a losing position, adding 1 more.

Thus, the total number of losing positions is \( 808 + 1 = 809 \).

\boxed{809}
