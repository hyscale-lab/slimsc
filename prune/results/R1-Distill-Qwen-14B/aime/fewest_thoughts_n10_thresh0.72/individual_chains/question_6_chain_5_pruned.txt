Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are given by the equations:

\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
and
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

Here, the functions f and g are defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's start by understanding what f and g do.

First, \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \). So, if I take any x, I first take its absolute value, subtract 1/2, and then take the absolute value again. Similarly, \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \) is the same process but with 1/4 instead of 1/2.

I think it would help to graph these functions f and g to see what they look like. Let me visualize f(x):

1. The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
2. Subtract 1/2: So, this would shift the graph down by 1/2. The vertex would move to (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, it would reflect any negative parts back up.
3. So, the resulting graph of f(x) would be a V-shape that touches the points where |x| - 1/2 is zero, which is at x = ±1/2. So, f(x) will have a W-shape? Wait, no, maybe a V with a flat bottom.

Wait, maybe I should compute f(x) for some values.

- At x = 0: |0| = 0; 0 - 1/2 = -1/2; absolute value is 1/2. So f(0) = 1/2.
- At x = 1/2: |1/2| = 1/2; 1/2 - 1/2 = 0; absolute value is 0. So f(1/2) = 0.
- At x = -1/2: same as above, so f(-1/2) = 0.
- At x = 1: |1| = 1; 1 - 1/2 = 1/2; absolute value is 1/2. So f(1) = 1/2.
- At x = 3/2: |3/2| = 3/2; 3/2 - 1/2 = 1; absolute value is 1. So f(3/2) = 1.

So, the graph of f(x) would have a V shape with the minimum at x = ±1/2, y=0, and maximum at x=0, y=1/2, and then increasing again beyond x=1/2 and x=-1/2.

Similarly for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's see:

- At x=0: 0 - 1/4 = -1/4; absolute value is 1/4. So g(0)=1/4.
- At x=1/4: |1/4| = 1/4; 1/4 - 1/4 = 0; absolute value is 0. So g(1/4)=0.
- At x= -1/4: same as above, g(-1/4)=0.
- At x=1/2: |1/2|=1/2; 1/2 - 1/4=1/4; absolute is 1/4. So g(1/2)=1/4.
- At x=3/4: |3/4|=3/4; 3/4 -1/4=1/2; absolute is 1/2. So g(3/4)=1/2.

So, the graph of g(x) has minima at x=±1/4, y=0, and it goes up to y=1/4 at x=0, then increases to y=1/2 at x=1/2, etc.

Now, let's think about the functions inside the main equations.

First equation: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Second equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Since both involve 4 g(f(...)), let's first analyze what 4 g(f(z)) looks like as z varies.

Let me define h(z) = 4 g(f(z)).

So, h(z) is 4 times g(f(z)).

Given that f(z) takes z to 0 at z=±1/2, and 1/2 at z=0, etc.

Wait, so f(z) is symmetric in z, so h(z) will also be symmetric. Let's find h(z) for different z.

But z here is sin(2πx) in the first equation and cos(3πy) in the second.

Wait, but since sine and cosine functions have outputs between -1 and 1, but since they are inside absolute value functions, f(z) and g(z) would process their absolute values.

But let's see: First, let's find the range of f(z) when z is in [-1,1].

Since z can be any real number, but in our case, z is sin(2πx) or cos(3πy), which are between -1 and 1.

So, z ∈ [-1,1].

Let me compute f(z) for z ∈ [-1,1].

f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

So, for z ∈ [-1,1], |z| is between 0 and 1.

So, |z| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.

- When |z| - 1/2 >= 0 → |z| >= 1/2 → z ∈ [-1, -1/2] ∪ [1/2, 1].

In that case, ||z| - 1/2| = |z| -1/2.

- When |z| < 1/2, ||z| - 1/2| = (1/2 - |z|).

So, f(z) is a piecewise function:

f(z) = |z| - 1/2, when |z| >= 1/2,
f(z) = 1/2 - |z|, when |z| < 1/2.

So, f(z) is a V shape that goes down from z=0 to z=±1/2, reaching 0, then goes up again for |z| beyond 1/2.

Similarly, let's compute g(f(z)). Since f(z) is in [0, 1/2], because:

- When |z| >=1/2, f(z) = |z| -1/2, which ranges from 0 to 1 -1/2 =1/2.

- When |z| <1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|, which ranges from 1/2 down to 0 as |z| approaches 1/2.

So f(z) ∈ [0,1/2].

Then, g(f(z)) = ||f(z)| - 1/4|.

But since f(z) is already non-negative, this simplifies to |f(z) -1/4|.

So, g(f(z)) is |f(z) -1/4|.

So, let's find g(f(z)) as a function of f(z).

Let me denote w = f(z).

Since w ∈ [0, 1/2], g(w) = |w -1/4|.

So, when w >= 1/4, g(w) = w -1/4.

When w <1/4, g(w) = 1/4 - w.

So, g(w) is a V-shape with minimum at w=1/4, 0 there, and increases to 1/4 when w=0 or w=1/2.

Wait, let me compute g(f(z)):

If f(z) >=1/4, then g(f(z)) = f(z) -1/4.

If f(z) <1/4, then g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z).

So, h(z) =4 g(f(z)) would be:

If f(z) >=1/4, h(z)=4(f(z)-1/4).

If f(z) <1/4, h(z)=4(1/4 -f(z))=1 -4f(z).

So, h(z)=4g(f(z)) is piecewise linear.

Now, let's see what h(z) looks like.

We can consider different cases based on the value of f(z).

But perhaps it's better to express h(z) in terms of z.

But since f(z) is itself a function of z, maybe we can write h(z) in terms of |z|.

So, let's express h(z) as:

h(z) = 4 * |f(z) -1/4|.

But f(z) is | |z| - 1/2 |.

So, h(z) =4 * | | |z| -1/2 | -1/4 |.

Hmm, that's a bit nested, but maybe I can break it down.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find h(z) in terms of |z|.

Let me let t = |z|, so t ∈ [0,1] (since z is in [-1,1]).

Then, f(z)=| t -1/2 |.

So, f(z) = |t - 1/2|.

Thus, g(f(z))=| |t -1/2| -1/4 |.

So, h(z)=4 * | |t -1/2| -1/4 |.

So, h(z) is a function of t, which is |z|.

So, let's analyze h(t) =4 * | |t -1/2| -1/4 | for t ∈ [0,1].

I can consider different cases for t:

Case 1: t >= 3/4.

In this case, |t -1/2|= t -1/2, which is >= 1/4 (since t >=3/4 ⇒ t-1/2 >= 1/4).

So, | |t -1/2| -1/4 | = (t-1/2) -1/4 = t - 3/4.

Thus, h(t) =4*(t -3/4) =4t -3.

Case 2: t ∈ [1/4, 3/4].

In this interval, |t -1/2| can be either >=1/4 or <1/4.

Wait, 1/4 is 0.25; 1/2 is 0.5.

So, t from 1/4 to 3/4: when t < 1/2, |t -1/2|= 1/2 -t.

So, in t ∈ [1/4, 1/2):

|t -1/2|=1/2 -t. So, |(1/2 -t) -1/4| = |1/
