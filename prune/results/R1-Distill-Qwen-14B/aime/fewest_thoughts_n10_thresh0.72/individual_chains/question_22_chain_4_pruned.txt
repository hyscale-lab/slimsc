Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

"Let ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon."

Alright, so it's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. Since it's equilateral, all its sides are equal in length. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, I should visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Because it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is what's called a "parallelogon," but specifically for hexagons. I think in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating a triangle in some way, but I'm not entirely sure.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... Hmm, so if I extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines will form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, this triangle is larger than the hexagon, and the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Let's denote the side length as 's.'

I think I can model this as follows: each side of the triangle is divided into segments by the extensions of the hexagon's sides. Since the hexagon is convex and opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will meet at points forming a triangle. Each extension will cut the sides of this triangle into two parts: one part is the side of the triangle, and the other is something related to the hexagon.

Wait, maybe it's similar to how a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle with each side divided into three parts, but in this case, it's not regular, just equilateral and with opposite sides parallel.

I recall that in such cases, the triangle can be divided into smaller similar triangles, and the hexagon is formed by connecting certain points on the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can use similar triangles here. Since opposite sides are parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF will form a triangle similar to the original triangle, but scaled down.

Wait, no, the triangle formed by the extensions is given, with sides 200, 240, and 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle.

Let me think about how the hexagon is situated. Each side of the hexagon is parallel to the opposite side, so the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off three smaller similar triangles from the corners of the larger triangle.

But wait, in this case, the hexagon
