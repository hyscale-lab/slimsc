Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again and make sure I understand each part.

The problem says: Torus T is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that's a distance 6 from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11. When T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, let's visualize the torus. A torus is like a donut, created by rotating a circle around an external axis. The radius of the original circle is 3, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they're tangent internally, and when it's outside, they're tangent externally. The points of tangency are along circles, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, then compute their difference.

I think the key here is to figure out how the torus and sphere are positioned relative to each other in both cases—internally and externally tangent.

Let me recall that the torus can be parameterized, but maybe I don't need to get into that. Instead, perhaps I can think about the geometry of the situation.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere contains the torus, touching it at exactly one circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is tangent to the torus at another circle.

I should probably find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus in each case, then relate that to the radii of the circles of tangency.

Wait, but the torus is a bit more complicated because it's a surface of revolution. The sphere is a surface too, but it's spherically symmetric.

Maybe I can model the torus as a surface with a specific center. Let me consider the torus as having a central point, but actually, the torus doesn't have a single center point. Instead, it's generated by rotating a circle around an axis. So, perhaps the center of the sphere is at a certain distance from the center of the generating circle.

Wait, when the torus is placed inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere's center must be along the axis of the torus. Similarly, when it's externally tangent, the center is also along that axis.

So, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface where any point on it is at a certain distance from the center of the sphere.

Let me consider the torus equation. In cylindrical coordinates, a torus can be represented as (R - r cos θ)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. But here, R would be 6 and r is 3.

Wait, actually, the standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is given in cylindrical coordinates as (R - sqrt(x^2 + y^2))^2 + z^2 = r^2.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the distance from the center of the sphere to a point on the torus.

Let me think. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere's radius is
