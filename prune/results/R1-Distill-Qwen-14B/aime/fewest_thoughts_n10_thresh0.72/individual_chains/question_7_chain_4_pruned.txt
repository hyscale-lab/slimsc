Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention the answer will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I need to find m + n.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a regular octagon, so it's an eight-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So, for each vertex, there's a 1/2 chance it's red and 1/2 chance it's blue.

Now, the key part is that we want the probability that after some rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps (like rotating it so that each vertex moves to the next one's position), the blue ones should now occupy the red positions, and the red ones should now be where the blues were.

Wait, actually, I think the problem is asking that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, the blue ones should map to red ones, but the red ones can be anywhere, including where blue ones were. Hmm, no, actually, it's that all blue vertices are moved to red positions. So, each blue vertex must be rotated to a position that was red, but the red vertices can be anywhere.

But wait, no, actually, the rotation must send each blue vertex to a red vertex's position. So, each blue vertex must be mapped via rotation to a position that was originally red. That is, every blue vertex is in the preimage of a red vertex under some rotation.

But since the rotation is a permutation of the vertices, this is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the image of the red vertices under some rotation. Or, perhaps more accurately, that the blue set is a subset of the red set under some rotation.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the colorings. Suppose I have a coloring C, which is a function from the set of vertices to {red, blue}. Then, I want to find a rotation r such that for every vertex v, if C(v) is blue, then C(r(v)) is red. Wait, no, maybe that's not quite right. Because when you rotate, the color of each vertex moves to the next position.

Hold on, perhaps it's better to model the octagon as a graph with vertices
