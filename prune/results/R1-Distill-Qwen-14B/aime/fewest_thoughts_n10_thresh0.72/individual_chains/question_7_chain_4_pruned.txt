Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's some rotation of the octagon that moves all the blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with probability 1/2 each. So, each vertex has a 50% chance of being red or blue. Now, the question is about the probability that some rotation can map all blue vertices to red ones. 

Wait, so essentially, if I can rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. That means, after rotation, all the blue colors are on the red positions, and the reds are either on blue or another red? Or maybe that all blues are moved to red positions, regardless of what's originally there? Maybe I need to think in terms of functions or transformations.

Let me visualize the octagon. It's regular, so it has rotational symmetry of order 8. That means we can rotate it by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, right? Each rotation corresponds to shifting the vertices by a certain number of positions. For example, a 45° rotation moves each vertex to the next one clockwise, effectively shifting the entire octagon by one position.

So, the problem is about whether there's a rotation such that the set of blue vertices is exactly the set of red vertices in the original coloring. Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me clarify: if I have a coloring, and I rotate it by some k positions (where k is from 0 to 7), then each blue vertex in the original coloring should end up on a red vertex after rotation.

Hmm, perhaps another way to look at it: for each vertex i, if it's blue, then after rotating by k positions, it lands on
