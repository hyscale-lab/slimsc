Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus inscribed in it. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. That is, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound for BD².

Hmm, okay, let me break this down. First, I know that a rhombus has its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, that's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and they bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, wait, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Given that, each of the points can be represented in terms of vectors from the origin. So, if A is (a, b), then C, being the opposite vertex, would be (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D would be (-c, -d). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the rhombus can also be characterized by the vectors of its diagonals. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily the sides. The sides are the edges between the vertices. So, each side is equal in length.

But since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, the coordinates of the points can be expressed as A = (p, q),
