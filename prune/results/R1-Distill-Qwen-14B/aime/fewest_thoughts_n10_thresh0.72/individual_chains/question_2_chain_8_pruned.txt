Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points are in the coordinate plane. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1.

Then, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from family F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), so the distance from A to B should be 1 unit. Let me check that quickly.

Calculating the distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so it's in the family F.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F. So, for any other segment PQ in F, except AB itself, the point C doesn't lie on them. So, we need to find such a point C on AB, and compute OC squared. Then, express OC^2 as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

Alright, so I need to find this point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe parametrize AB. Since AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write parametric equations for AB.

Let me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1. So when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So the parametric equations would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t) + 0 * t = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = 0*(1 - t) + (sqrt(3)/2)*t = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, point C would have coordinates ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1, not equal to 0 or 1.

Now, we need to find the point C on AB that is not on any other PQ in F. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Wait, but how can a point not lie on any other PQ in F except AB? Maybe the point C is such that for any other PQ in F, the lines PQ don't pass through C. So, we need to find a point C on AB that is not an intersection point of any other PQ in F besides AB.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point on AB where for every other PQ in F, PQ does not pass through C. So, we need to find C such that it's not on any PQ in F except AB.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the envelope of the family F, and then find the point C where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because points on the envelope are touched by exactly one member of the family, while points inside might be touched by more than one. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope of F, then the point of tangency would be the unique point C on AB that's only on AB and no other PQ in F.

Hmm, that seems plausible. So, if I can find the envelope of the family F, then find where AB is tangent to this envelope, that point of tangency would be C.

So, how do I find the envelope of the family F?

Each PQ in F is a line segment from P(p,0) to Q(0,q), with p and q positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, for each PQ in F, the condition is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, each PQ can be represented by the line equation. The line PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q), so its equation is x/p + y/q = 1. But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can parameterize p and q in terms of an angle θ, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe we can parameterize p and q as p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p^2 + q^2 = 1, so θ is the angle made with the axes. Then, the equation of PQ would be x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1.

Wait, but then the family of lines would be x/cosθ + y/sinθ = 1, for θ between 0 and π/2. Because p and q are positive, so θ would be in the first quadrant.

So, the envelope of a family of curves
