Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of them in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, any additional chip placed would violate these conditions. So, the placement should be maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules.

Let me think about how to approach this. First, the grid is 5x5, so there are 25 cells. Each row and each column must be monochromaticâ€”so each row is either all white, all black, or has some chips of one color only. But wait, no, actually, each row can have some chips, but all the chips in the same row must be the same color. Hmm, but if a row has no chips, that's fine too. Similarly for columns.

Wait, no, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color." So if a row has chips, all of them must be the same color. But if a row has no chips, it doesn't violate any condition. So each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But there's another condition: any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the placement must be such that every empty cell is in a row that's already monochromatic and a column that's already monochromatic, but adding a chip there would force that row or column to have two different colors.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me rephrase. After placing the chips, every empty cell is such that if you add a chip there, either its row would have chips of two different colors, or its column would. So for every empty cell, either the row already has all its cells filled with one color, or the column is already filled with one color. Or perhaps something else.

Alternatively, maybe the current placement is such that every row is either completely filled with one color or has no chips, and the same for every column. That might be a way to ensure that any additional chip would cause a row or column to have mixed colors.

Wait, no, because if a row is partially filled
