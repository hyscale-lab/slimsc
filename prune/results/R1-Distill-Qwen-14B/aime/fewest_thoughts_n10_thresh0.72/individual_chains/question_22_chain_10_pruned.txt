Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. That's interesting. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular since the angles might not be equal. But in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are 120 degrees, and opposite sides are parallel. So maybe this hexagon is a stretched or compressed version of a regular hexagon.

But wait, the problem says it's convex, so all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal, but the angles can vary as long as the opposite sides remain parallel.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me think about how that triangle is formed.

In a regular hexagon, if you extend every other side, you might get a triangle. But in this case, the hexagon isn't regular, but it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So, extending AB, CD, and EF would create a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

I think the key here is to relate the sides of this outer triangle to the side length of the hexagon. Maybe using similar triangles or some proportionality.

Let me consider the structure of the hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being composed of three pairs of parallel sides: AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, AB, CD, and EF are three sides of the hexagon, each separated by one side. So, AB is between A and B, CD between C and D, and EF between E and F.

Extending these sides would form a triangle. Let me imagine how that would look. For example, extending AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. The intersections of these extensions would form the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

Wait, actually, no. The triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these segments is extended beyond a vertex, and their extensions meet to form the triangle.

Let me try to draw this mentally. If I have a hexagon ABCDEF, convex, equilateral, opposite sides parallel. Extending AB beyond A, CD beyond C, and EF beyond E would meet at some point, forming a triangle. Similarly, extending AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F would meet at another triangle. But the problem says the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. So,
