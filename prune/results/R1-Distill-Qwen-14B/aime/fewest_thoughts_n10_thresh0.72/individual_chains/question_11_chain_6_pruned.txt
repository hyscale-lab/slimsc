Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help me here.

First, since |z| = 4, that means z is a complex number lying on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. So z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can be expressed as a + bi, but maybe using the polar form will be more convenient here because it relates directly to the magnitude and angle.

Wait, the expression involves both z and 1/z. Since |z| = 4, |1/z| = 1/4, right? Because if |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4. So, 1/z is another complex number with magnitude 1/4. That might be useful.

Let me write down the expression again:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

I need to find the maximum real part of this expression. Let me denote this expression as E for simplicity.

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since z has magnitude 4, maybe I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, and 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let me try substituting that.

So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ})).

Simplify each term:

First term: (75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i. So, the first term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, this looks like a combination of exponentials. Maybe I can express this in terms of sine and cosine. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. Then E = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

So, E = A (cosθ + i sinθ) + B (cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me expand this:

E = (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ.

Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Expanding A e^{iθ}:

= (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + 468i cosθ + 300i sinθ - 468 sinθ
= (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Similarly, expanding B e^{-iθ}:

= (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding A e^{iθ} and B e^{-iθ}:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, E = (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ).

But we are only interested in the real part of E, which is Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, our goal is to maximize Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a function of θ, and we need to find its maximum value. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = √(a² + b²), which gives the maximum value of R.

Wait, let me make sure: the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is indeed √(a² + b²). Because a cosθ + b sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = √(a² + b²), and φ is the angle such that cosφ = a/R, sinφ = b/R. Therefore, the maximum value is R.

In this case, our Re(E) is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write it as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, a = 324, b = -432.

Then, R = √(324² + (-432)²).

Compute R:

First, compute 324². Let me calculate that.

324 * 324: 300² = 90,000, 24² = 576, cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So, 324² = (300 + 24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432²: Let's compute that.

400² = 160,000, 32²=1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600.

So, (400 + 32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So R = √(104,976 + 186,624) = √(291,600).

What's √291,600?

Well, 500² = 250,000; 600²=360,000. So between 500 and 600.

Let me see: 540² = (500 + 40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So √291,600 = 540.

So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. The expression Re(E) is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = 540. So its maximum is R, which is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Is that the final answer? It seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, I had E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Then,
