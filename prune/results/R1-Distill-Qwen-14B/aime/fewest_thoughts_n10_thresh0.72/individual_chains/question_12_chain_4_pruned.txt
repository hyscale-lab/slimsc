Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits (from 0 to 9) in each cell of a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The example given is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

In this example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, which satisfies the first condition. Then, reading down the columns, the first column is 0 and 9, which sums to 9; the second column is 0 and 9, also 9; the third column is 8 and 1, which sums to 9. So 9 + 9 + 9 = 27? Wait, wait, no—hold on. Oh wait, maybe I misread. The problem says the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, wait no, the example says 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the grid is read top to bottom as three separate numbers, each column. So each column is a single digit? Or is each column a number formed by reading top to bottom? Wait, the grid is 2 rows, 3 columns. So if I read top to bottom, each column would form a two-digit number, not a single digit. But the example says:

In the example, the columns are:

- First column: 0 and 9 → 09, which is 9
- Second column: 0 and 9 → 09, which is 9
- Third column: 8 and 1 → 81, which is 81
So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Got it. So each column is read as a two-digit number, top to bottom, and their sum is 99. Similarly, each row is read as a three-digit number, left to right, and their sum is 999.

So, the grid has two rows and three columns. Each cell has a digit. Let's label the grid as follows:

a b c  
d e f  

So, the top row is abc, which is a three-digit number: 100a + 10b + c.

The bottom row is def, another three-digit number: 100d + 10e + f.

The sum of these two numbers is 999: (100a +10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Also, each column is read as a two-digit number:

- First column: ad → 10a + d
- Second column: be → 10b + e
- Third column: cf → 10c + f

The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I can try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the digits.

Let me write equation 1 as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Equation 2 can be written as:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me denote the top row number as N1 = 100a + 10b + c.

The bottom row number as N2 = 100d + 10e + f.

So, N1 + N2 = 999.

From equation 2: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

But notice that 10a + d is part of N2, because N2 is 100d + 10e + f. Wait, no. Wait, 10a + d is a two-digit number, but in N2, the digits are d, e, f. Hmm, maybe not directly related. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can express equation 2 in terms of N1 and N2.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me group terms:

(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But 10a +10b +10c is 10*(a + b + c).

So, 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm,
