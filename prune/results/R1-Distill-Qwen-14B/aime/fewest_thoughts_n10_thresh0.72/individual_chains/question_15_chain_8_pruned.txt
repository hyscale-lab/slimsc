Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that the paths can only move along the grid lines, and they must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I know that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid means you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So, the total number of steps is 16. That makes sense because each path is of length 16. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right moves (or up moves), which is C(16,8). But here, we have a constraint on the number of direction changes.

Wait, so what's a direction change exactly? Every time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path moves right several times in a row, then up several times, that's one change. If it alternates every single step, that's a lot of changes.

But the problem wants exactly four direction changes. So, the path will have segments where it moves in one direction, then changes once, and so on, ending up with four changes. Let me think about how this works.

If a path has four direction changes, that means it has five segments. Because each change starts a new segment. So, the path would go right for some steps, then up, then right, then up, and so on, ending with either right or up. Similarly, it could start with up and then alternate.

Wait, but does the starting direction matter? Let me consider both cases. The path can start by moving right or up. So, I need to account for both possibilities.

Wait no, actually, in an 8x8 grid from lower left to upper right, you must start by moving right or up, but not down or left because that would take you out of the grid. So, the first direction is either right or up. So, the path can start with right, then up, then right, etc., or start with up, then right, then up, etc.

But wait, the problem states that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, if you start with right, the number of segments would be five: right, up, right, up, right, etc. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each direction change increases the number of segments by one. So, if you have four direction changes, you have five segments.

So, for example, starting with right, the path would have right, up, right, up, right. That's five segments with four changes. Similarly, starting with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up, which is five segments with four changes. So, for each case, starting with R or starting with U, we have two different scenarios.

So, the total number of such paths would be the sum of paths starting with R and having four direction changes, plus the paths starting with U and having four direction changes.

So, maybe I can model this by considering two cases: starting with right (R) or starting with up (
