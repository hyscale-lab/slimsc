Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: In triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment from I to A is perpendicular to the line segment from O to I. That seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use vector methods or coordinate geometry, but perhaps there's a more straightforward approach using triangle properties.

Let me write down what I know:

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6.
2. IA ⟂ OI.
3. Need to find AB · AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Oh, right, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, substituting the given values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but that's a fixed value regardless of the triangle? Hmm, no, actually, that formula is correct for any triangle. So, in this case, OI is sqrt(13).

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the inradius IA is perpendicular to the segment OI. That might imply something about the triangle's angles or sides.

Let me visualize this. The incenter I is inside the triangle, and O is the circumcenter. Depending on the triangle type, O can be inside (acute), on (right), or outside (obtuse). Since O is the circumcenter, if the triangle is acute, O is inside; if it's right, O is at the midpoint of the hyp
