Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so maybe I should start by thinking about the largest four-digit number and see if it fits the property, but I doubt it does.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be a multiple of 7.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

So, if I change A to 1, I get 1BCD. Similarly, changing B gives A1CD, changing C gives AB1D, and changing D gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me write that down:

1. Changing A: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Changing B: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Changing C: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Changing D: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

I need to find N such that all these four conditions are satisfied.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should aim for the largest possible N. So, perhaps I can start by considering the largest four-digit numbers and check if they satisfy these conditions.

But checking each number one by one would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find some constraints on the digits to narrow down the possibilities.

Let me consider each condition:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four numbers must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, when I change each digit:

1. 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, for each condition, I can write an equation modulo 7.

Let me denote N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's compute these modulo 7.

First, let me compute the coefficients modulo 7 because 1000, 100, 10, 1 mod 7.

Compute:

1000 mod 7: 1000 ÷ 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 mod7: 100 ÷7=14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, since 10-7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.

So, let's compute each of the four conditions:

1. 1BCD: 6*(1) + 2*B + 3*C + D ≡0 mod7.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, 1BCD is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Which is 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Yes.

Similarly, A1CD: 6A + 2*1 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

AB1D: 6A + 2B + 3*1 + D ≡0 mod7.

ABC1: 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from 1BCD)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from A1CD)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (from AB1D)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (from ABC1)

So, these are four congruence equations.

Our goal is to solve for A, B, C, D (digits from 0-9, with A≠0) such that these are satisfied.

Let me write these equations again:

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7.

Equation 2: 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7.

Equation 3: 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7.

Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7.

Hmm, so we have four equations with four
