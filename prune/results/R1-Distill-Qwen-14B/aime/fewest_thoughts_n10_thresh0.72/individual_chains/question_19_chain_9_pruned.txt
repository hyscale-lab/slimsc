Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, the problem states that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Alright, so let's jot down what we know:

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6.
2. IA ⊥ OI.
3. We need to find AB · AC.

First, I should recall some basic properties and formulas related to triangle centers and their properties.

The circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula R = (a)/(2 sin A) = (b)/(2 sin B) = (c)/(2 sin C). But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

The inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter by r = area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

Also, the distance between the incenter I and circumcenter O is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Wait, hold on: OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me plug in the given values:

R = 13, r = 6.

So OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's good to know.

Now, we know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA ⊥ OI. Let me think about what that implies.

IA is the inradius from I to side BC, right? Wait, no. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A. Wait, no, IA is the segment from the inradius to vertex A? No, the inradius is the distance from I to BC, but IA is the segment from I to A. So IA is not an altitude or anything, it's just a segment from the incenter to a vertex.

Wait, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI.

Let me try to visualize this. So
