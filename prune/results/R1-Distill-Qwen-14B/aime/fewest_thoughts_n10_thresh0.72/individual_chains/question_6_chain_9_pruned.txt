Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, but I'll try to break them down step by step.

First, the functions involved are f(x) and g(x). They are defined as:
- f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
- g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

And the equations of the curves are:
1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points these two graphs intersect. That means I have to solve for (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what f and g do. Both are absolute value functions with some transformations.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, f takes x, takes its absolute value, subtracts 1/2, and then takes the absolute value again. Let me visualize this function.

The inner absolute value |x| creates a V-shape. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2 unit. But since we take the absolute value again, any negative parts will flip back up. So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has its vertex where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. At x = 0, |0| - 1/2 = -1/2, so f(0) = |-1/2| = 1/2. As x moves away from 0, the value increases by 1/2 for each unit in x. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape with its minimum at (0, 1/2) and it slopes upward on both sides.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The same idea applies here. The inner absolute value creates a V, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value again. The vertex of g(x) is where |x| - 1/4 = 0, which is at x = ±1/4. At x=0, g(0) = | -1/4 | = 1/4. So, the graph of g is V-shaped with a minimum at (0, 1/4) and slopes upward on both sides.

Now, both f and g are applied to some trigonometric functions inside the equations for y and x.

Looking at the first equation: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)), and then y = 4 * g(h(x)).

Similarly, the second equation: x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me denote k(y) = f(cos(3πy)), so x = 4 * g(k(y)).

So, to find intersections, we need to find (x, y) such that both equations hold. That is:

y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))  
x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

This seems a bit recursive, as y depends on x, and x depends on y. It's like a system of equations where each variable is a function of the other. Solving this directly might be tricky, so perhaps I can analyze the behavior of these functions and see how they interact.

Let me consider the possible ranges of the inner functions first.

Starting with sin(2πx): The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. So, sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1]. Then f is applied to this. Let me compute f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, let's see what f does to it. Remember f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's think about |x| first. Since x is sin(2πx), which is between -1 and 1, |x| is between 0 and 1. Then, subtract 1/2 from that, so |x| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, f(x) becomes | |x| - 1/2 |, which will be between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, let me double-check that. Let's say |x| is in [0,1]. Then |x| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.

If |x| >= 1/2, then |x| -1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

If |x| < 1/2, then |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a function that has a V-shape with its minimum at |x|=1/2. So, for x in [0,1], f(x) will decrease from 1/2 to 0 at x=1/2, then increase back to 1/2 at x=1. Wait, no, actually, since for |x| from 0 to 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, so it decreases from 1/2 to 0 as |x| goes from 0 to 1/2. Then, for |x| from 1/2 to 1, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which increases from 0 to 1/2. So, the overall shape is a "W" but symmetric around the y-axis. Wait, no, because it's only a function of |x|, so it's symmetric for positive and negative x. So, for x in [0,1], the function f(x) is a V-shape that goes down to 0 at x=1/2.

Wait, perhaps an image would help, but I can't draw it. Let me think numerically. For x=0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. For x=1/2, f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. For x=1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. So, the graph is a V shape with the minimum at x=1/2, 0, and peaks at x=0 and x=1 with 1/2.

Similarly for g(x). Let's consider g(sin(2πx)) or g(cos(3πy)).

Wait, no. Let's take it step by step.

First, let's analyze f(sin(2πx)).

sin(2πx) is in [-1,1]. Then, taking absolute value, |sin(2πx)| is in [0,1]. Then f(|sin(2πx)|) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, let's compute this. Let me denote s = |sin(2πx)|, which is in [0,1].

Then, f(s) = |s - 1/2|. So, this is another V-shape function of s. When s < 1/2, f(s) = 1/2 - s; when s >= 1/2, f(s) = s - 1/2.

So, the range of f(s) is [0, 1/2], because s is between 0 and 1. When s=0, f(s)=1/2; when s=1/2, f(s)=0; when s=1, f(s)=1/2.

Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a period determined by sin(2πx). The sin function has period 1/(2π)*2π=1, so sin(2πx) has period 1. So, f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates every 1 unit in x.

Wait, but because of the absolute value, maybe the period is half that? Let me think. Since |sin(2πx)| has a period of 1/2, because the absolute value makes the negative part positive, effectively halving the period.

So, |sin(2πx)| has a period of 1/2. Then, f(|sin(2πx)|) is also a function with period 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) has a period of 1/2. So, every 1/2 units, the function repeats.

Similarly, the function f(cos(3πy)) will have a period based on cos(3πy). The cosine function has period 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. The absolute value of cos(3πy) will have period 1/3, since the absolute value reflects the negative part, so the period is halved.

So, |cos(3πy)| has period 1/(3π) * π = 1/3? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the period of cos(3πy) is 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. So, |cos(3πy)| will have a period of 1/3, because the absolute value reflects the negative part, so the positive and negative parts repeat every half-period of the original cosine function.

So, |cos(3πy)| has a period of 1/3.

Therefore, f(|cos(3πy)|) will have the same period, 1/3, since f is applied to |cos(3πy)|.

So, back to the original functions.

Now, let's look at the first equation: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))).

We have f(sin(2πx)) as a function that's periodic with period 1/2, oscillating between 0 and 1/2. Then, g is applied to this.

g(t) = | |t| - 1/4 |. But t is already in [0,1/2], because f(sin(2πx)) is in [0,1/2]. So, t is between 0 and 1/2.

Then, compute g(t) = | t - 1/4 |. So, t is between 0 and 1/2. So, when t < 1/4, g(t) = 1/4 - t; when t >=1/4, g(t) = t -1/4.

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) will have outputs in [0, 1/4]. Because when t=0, g(0)=1/4; when t=1/4, g(t)=0; when t=1/2, g(1/2)=1/4.

So, the function g(f(sin(2πx))) oscillates between 0 and 1/4, with a period of 1/2.

Multiplying by 4, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) will scale this to oscillate between 0 and 1. Specifically, y will vary between 0 and 1, with a period of 1/2.

Wait, let me check that. Since the period of g(f(sin(2πx))) is 1/2, then multiplying by 4 won't change the period, just the amplitude.

So, y is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period of 1/2.

So, over each interval of length 1/2, y completes a full cycle from 0 to 1 and back to 0.

Similarly, let's look at the second equation: x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))).

Again, let's break it down. f(cos(3πy)) is f applied to |cos(3πy)|, which is in [0,1].

So, f(|cos(3πy)|) is | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |.

Again, since |cos(3πy)| is in [0,1], f(|cos(3πy)|) is also in [0,1/2]. Then, g is applied to this, so g(f(...)) will be |t - 1/4| where t is in [0,1/2]. So, similar to before, g(t) is in [0,1/4].

Then, 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) will give a value in [0,1], just like the first equation.

But the period here is determined by cos(3πy). Since |cos(3πy)| has a period of 1/3, as we thought earlier, then f(|cos(3πy)|) will have the same period, 1/3, and then g(f(...)) will also have period 1/3. So, the function x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) will have a period of 1/3.

Wait, but x is
