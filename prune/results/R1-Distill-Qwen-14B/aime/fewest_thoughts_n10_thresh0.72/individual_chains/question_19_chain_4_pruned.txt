Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by recalling some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius, R, is given as 13. The inradius, r, is 6.

First, I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:

R = (a) / (2 sin A) = (b) / (2 sin B) = (c) / (2 sin C)

And the inradius r is given by:

r = Δ / s,

where Δ is the area of the triangle, and s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

But I need to find AB * AC, which are sides of the triangle. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. So, we're looking for b * c.

Wait, but perhaps I should assign the sides as AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b as per standard notation. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively. But maybe that's getting ahead of myself.

I also remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. I think yes, it's a formula that relates OI, R, and r. So,

OI² = R² - 2Rr

But wait, let me double-check. I think the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Yes, that's right. So plugging in R =13 and r=6,

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13

Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).

But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so the inradius IA is perpendicular to the line OI. Interesting.

Let me visualize this. In triangle ABC, O is the circumradius center
