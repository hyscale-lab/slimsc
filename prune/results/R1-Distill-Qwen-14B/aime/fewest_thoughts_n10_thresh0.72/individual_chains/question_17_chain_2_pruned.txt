Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the dimensions l, w, h such that the box fits inside the smallest possible sphere. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the box completely. The space diagonal d is sqrt(l² + w² + h²), so the radius r is d/2. Therefore, r² is (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize (l² + w² + h²), which will in turn minimize r². So, I need to minimize l² + w² + h² given the constraints of surface area and volume.

Let me write down the given equations again:

1. lw + lh + wh = 27 (since 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54)
2. lwh = 23

I need to minimize l² + w² + h².

Hmm, maybe I can use some optimization techniques with constraints. Lagrange multipliers perhaps? Or maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Wait, I remember that for fixed volume and surface area, the shape that minimizes the space diagonal (or maximizes the compactness) is a cube. But in this case, the surface area and volume aren't those of a cube. Let me check: if it were a cube, then l = w = h. Let's see what surface area and volume that would imply.

If l = w = h = x, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x = 3. Volume would be x³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube, but perhaps some other proportions.

So, I need another approach.

Let me denote S = l + w + h, P = lw + lh + wh = 27, V = lwh = 23.

I also know that l² + w² + h² = (l + w + h)^2 - 2(lw + lh + wh) = S² - 2P. So, l² + w² + h² = S² - 54.

So, to minimize l² + w² + h², I need to minimize S², since 54 is fixed.

Wait, that's helpful. So, minimizing S² is equivalent to minimizing l² + w² + h².

Alternatively, maybe I can express S in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, since we have P and V fixed, maybe I can relate S to these. Hmm.

I know that for three variables l, w, h, if we fix P and V, we can perhaps express S in terms of them.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality on l, w, h.

Wait, but the problem is that AM ≥ GM gives me a lower bound on S, but I don't know if that will apply directly here because I have constraints on P and V.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of symmetric functions. Let me think.

Let me consider the variables x = l, y = w, z = h.

We have:

x + y + z = S

xy + yz + zx = 27

xyz = 23

We need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

So, our target is to minimize S².

So, perhaps we can find the minimal S given the constraints.

Is there a way to express S in terms of known quantities?

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27

h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

Hmm, but since we have two constraints, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix two variables and express the third in terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up variables in terms of two variables. Let me assume l ≥ w ≥ h without loss of generality, since the problem is symmetric in l, w, h.

Let me fix h and express l and w in terms of h.

From volume: lwh = 23 => lw = 23/h

From surface area: lw + lh + wh = 27. Substituting lw = 23/h, we get:

23/h + h(l + w) = 27

Let me denote s = l + w, so:

23/h + h s = 27 => h s = 27 - 23/h => s = (27 - 23/h)/h = (27h - 23)/h²

Also, for l and w, we have:

l + w = s = (27h - 23)/h²

and

l w = 23/h

So, l and w are roots of the quadratic equation:

t² - s t + (23/h) = 0

Which is t² - [(27h - 23)/h²] t + (23/h) = 0

The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative for real solutions:

D = s² - 4*(23/h) = [(27h - 23)/h²]^2 - 4*(23/h) ≥ 0

Let me compute this:

D = [ (27h - 23)^2 ] / h^4 - 92 / h

Multiply both sides by h^4 to eliminate denominators:

(27h - 23)^2 - 92 h^3 ≥ 0

Expand (27h -23)^2:

= 729 h² - 2*27*23 h + 529 - 92 h^3 ≥ 0

Which is:

-92 h^3 + 729 h² - 1242 h + 529 ≥ 0

Multiply both sides by -1, which reverses the inequality:

92 h^3 -729 h² +1242 h -529 ≤ 0

So, we have a cubic inequality in h. Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can find the real roots.

Let me denote f(h) = 92 h^3 -729 h² +1242 h -529

We need to find h such that f(h) ≤ 0.

To find the roots, perhaps rational roots. Let's check possible rational roots.

Using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 529 over factors of 92.

Factors of 529: 1, 23, 529

Factors of 92: 1,2,4,23,46,92

So possible rational roots are ±1, ±23, ±529, ±1/2, ±23/2, etc.

Let me test h=1: f(1)=92 -729 +1242 -529= (92+1242)=1334; (1334 -729 -529)=1334 -1258=76>0.

h=2: 92*(8) -729*(4) +1242*(2) -529

= 736 -2916 +2484 -529

Calculate step by step:

736 -2916 = -2180

-2180 +2484 = 304

304 -529 = -225 ≤0. So h=2 is a root.

Therefore, (h - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.

Divide f(h) by (h - 2). Using synthetic division.

Coefficients: 92 | -729 | 1242 | -529

Bring down 92. Multiply by 2: 184.

Add to next coefficient: -729 +184 = -545.

Multiply by 2: -1090.

Add to next coefficient:1242 + (-1090)=152.

Multiply by 2:304.

Add to last coefficient: -529 +304 = -225. So remainder is -225, which is consistent with f(2)=-225.

Wait, wait, actually, I think I messed up the process.

Wait, in synthetic division, the coefficients are 92, -729, 1242, -529. Divisor is h=2.

Bring down 92.

Multiply by 2: 92*2=184. Add to next coefficient: -729 +184 = -545.

Multiply by 2: -545*2 = -1090. Add to next coefficient:1242 + (-1090)=152.

Multiply by 2:152*2=304. Add to last coefficient: -529 +304= -225.

So, the quotient is 92h² -54
