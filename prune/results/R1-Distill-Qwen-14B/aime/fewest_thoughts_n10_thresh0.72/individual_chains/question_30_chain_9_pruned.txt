Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials and cyclotomic fields. But I'm not exactly sure how to tackle this product directly. Let's think through this step by step.

First, let me recall that the 13th roots of unity satisfy ω^13 = 1, and they are the roots of the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. So, maybe I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials here.

But the expression I'm dealing with is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a lot of terms, but perhaps there's a pattern or a simplification I can apply.

Let me try to simplify the expression inside the product. Let's denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. So, each term is 2 - 2x + x^2, where x = ω^k.

Wait, 2 - 2x + x^2 can be written as x^2 - 2x + 2. That's a quadratic in x. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to a cyclotomic polynomial somehow.

Let me see if this quadratic factors. The discriminant is b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Interesting, so it's a product of two linear factors with complex roots.

But I'm not sure if that helps me immediately. Maybe I can relate this to the 4th roots of unity? Wait, 1 + i and 1 - i are 4th roots of unity, but I'm dealing with 13th roots here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the product over all k as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Since ω is a root of Φ_13(x), maybe I can express the product in terms of Φ_13(x) or another cyclotomic polynomial.

Wait, another approach: since we're taking a product over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), perhaps I can consider this as evaluating the product over all 13th roots of unity (except ω^0 = 1, but we include k=0) of f(ω^k), where f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Because for each k, ω^k is a 13th root of unity.

But actually, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the product is f(1) times the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k). But f(1) is 1, so the entire product is just the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k).

But wait, the original product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0. So, the entire product is f(1) * product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k). Since f(1)=1, it doesn't affect the product. So, the
