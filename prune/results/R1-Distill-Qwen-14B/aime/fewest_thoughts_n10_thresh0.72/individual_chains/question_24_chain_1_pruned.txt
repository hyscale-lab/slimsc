Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me jot down the details first.

Okay, the problem states that there's a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. Mode being 9 means that 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list. Since it's the unique mode, no other number can appear the same number of times as 9. So, 9 must occur at least twice, but more than any other number.

The sum is 30, so the average is 30 divided by the number of elements. But wait, I don't know how many elements are in the list. That's something I need to figure out.

The median is a positive integer that isn't in the list. That's interesting. The median is the middle value when the numbers are ordered. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is an integer and not in the list. So, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be one of the elements, right?

Wait, no. Wait, if it's even, the median would be the average of two middle numbers. If that average is an integer, then maybe both middle numbers are the same or sum to an even number. But since the median isn't in the list, that means the two middle numbers are not equal to the median. So, let's think about this.

Let me consider the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n.

Since the mode is 9, it must appear at least twice. So n can't be less than 2. But considering the median is not in the list, n must be even? Because if n were odd, the median would be one of the elements, which is a contradiction because the problem says the median doesn't appear in the list.

Wait, no. Wait, if n is even, the median is the average of the
