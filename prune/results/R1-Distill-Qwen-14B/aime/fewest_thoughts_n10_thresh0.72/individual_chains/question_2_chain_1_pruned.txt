Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the problem introduces points O, A, and B with specific coordinates. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. Point A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere on the y-axis, but exactly where? Well, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's a bit less than 1. So, points O, A, and B form a triangle, I suppose.

Next, there's this family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length (so each is 1 unit long) lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and each Q is on the y-axis. So, these are line segments starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, and each is of length 1. That makes sense.

The problem says that there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F? Wait, let's check. Let me see: the length of AB. A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so it's part of the family F. So, AB is one of these segments, and point C is on AB but not on any other segment from F.

Our goal is to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so the problem is about point C on AB such that it's only on AB among all these segments in F. So, C is the only point on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F. Thus, we need to find point C such that for every other segment PQ in F, C isn't on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense.

I think the idea is that for each PQ in F, except AB, point C is not on PQ. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by all the PQ segments.

Wait, perhaps each PQ in F is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive real numbers, such that the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1. So, all such PQ segments lie in the first quadrant and have endpoints on the axes, with the distance between P and Q being 1.

So, the family F consists of all such segments. Now, any such segment can be represented by an equation. Let's recall that the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, right? Because it's intercept form.

So, each PQ segment is part of the line x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1, with p > 0, q > 0, and p² + q² = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other line from this family except AB itself.

So, AB is one such line, and C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these
