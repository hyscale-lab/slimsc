Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here. We have a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So, the coloring is random. Now, after coloring, we want to check if there's a rotation (like turning the octagon in steps such that each vertex moves to the next position) that can make all the blue vertices align with the original red vertices. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutations. Each rotation can be thought of as a permutation of the vertices. For example, rotating by one position moves vertex 1 to position 2, vertex 2 to 3, and so on, with vertex 8 moving to position 1. So, if we have a certain coloring, we can apply these permutations (rotations) and see if any of them result in the blue vertices exactly matching the red positions from the original coloring.

But how do we calculate the probability of such a rotation existing? I think this might involve group theory or something related to Burnside's lemma, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a problem involving binary strings or something similar.

Let me think differently. Since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the entire octagon can be represented as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 0 (red) or 1 (blue). The problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation which maps the blue bits (1s) to the red bits (0s) of the original string. In other words, after some rotation, every 1 in the original string is now at a position that was originally 0, and vice versa.

Wait, actually
