Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that moves all the blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Then, express that probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better. A regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue. Each color is equally likely, so each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue, right?

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up where red vertices were. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blues should align with the original reds. That means, after rotation, every blue vertex is now sitting on a spot that was previously red.

Wait, so maybe another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if I rotate the red set, I should get the blue set. So, the blue vertices are just a rotated version of the red vertices.

But each vertex is colored independently, so the colorings are random. I need to count the number of colorings where this condition holds, and then divide by the total number of possible colorings to get the probability.

Total number of colorings is 2^8, since each of the 8 vertices has 2 choices. So that's 256 total possibilities.

Now, the tricky part is counting how many colorings satisfy the condition. Let's denote the set of red vertices as R and blue as B. After some rotation, B must be equal to R rotated by k steps, where k is the number of positions we rotate the octagon.

Wait, but the octagon can be rotated by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps, right? So there are 8 possible rotations. But 0 rotation is just the identity, so that would mean R must equal B. But each vertex is colored either red or blue, so R and B are complements. So R being equal to B would mean all vertices are both red and blue, which is impossible. So 0 rotation can't satisfy the condition unless all are red or all are blue. Wait, but if all are red, then B is empty, and rotating it would still be empty, which is the same as R being empty. But in this case, if all vertices are red, then B is empty, so after any rotation, B is still empty. Similarly, if all are blue, then R is empty, so after
