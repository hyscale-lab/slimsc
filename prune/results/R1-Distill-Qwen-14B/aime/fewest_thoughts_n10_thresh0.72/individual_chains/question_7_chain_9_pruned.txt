Okay, so I've got this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance, independently. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the original red vertices were. Then, this probability is expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue with equal probability, so each has a 1/2 chance. The colors are assigned independently, so the color of one vertex doesn't affect the others.

Now, the key part is that we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, after some rotation, every blue vertex in the original coloring should align with a red vertex. That sounds like the blue and red colorings should be the same under some rotation.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. The problem says that after some rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, if I rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since each vertex is 45 degrees apart), the positions that were blue in the original should now be where red was originally.

So, perhaps another way to put it is that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that the blue vertices align with red ones, then the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the red set.

But wait, since red and blue are complementary (every vertex is either red or blue), the set of blue vertices is just the complement of the red set. So for the blue set to be a rotation of the red set, the red set must be fixed under some rotation, or perhaps that the blue set is a shift of the red set.

Wait, maybe another approach: For each possible rotation, let's consider how the colors change. The octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°,
