Okay, so I've got this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon and then rotating it so that all blue vertices end up where red ones were. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, the setup: each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance, independently. Then, we want to find the probability that there exists some rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. The answer will be a fraction m/n, and we need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Alright, so let's break this down. I think the key here is understanding the possible rotations of the octagon and how colorings can be transformed under these rotations.

A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, right? Each of these rotations corresponds to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions respectively.

So, for each coloring, we need to check if there's a rotation (i.e., a shift by k positions for some k from 0 to 7) such that after shifting, every blue vertex is now on a position that was originally red. 

Wait, another way to phrase that: after rotation by k positions, all blue vertices in the original coloring must align with red vertices in the original coloring. So, in other words, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, when we rotate the octagon by k positions, it lands on a red vertex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the shifted coloring. If I fix a rotation k, then the shifted coloring is defined by shifting all the colors by k positions. So, in the shifted coloring, the color at position i is the original color at position (i - k) mod 8.

But we need that, for this shifted coloring, all the blue vertices (in the shifted coloring) were red in the original coloring. Wait, no, actually, the problem says that after the rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red. So, perhaps in terms of the original coloring, the blue vertices must be a subset that, when shifted by k, maps to the red vertices.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let me consider that after rotation by k, the set of blue vertices must coincide with the set of red vertices. No, not exactly. Because the rotation moves the blue vertices to positions that were red. So, the image of the blue vertices under rotation by k must be a subset of the red vertices.

Wait, hold on.
