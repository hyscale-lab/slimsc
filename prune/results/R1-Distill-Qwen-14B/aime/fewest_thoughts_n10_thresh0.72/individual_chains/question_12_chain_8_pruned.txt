Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid, so each row has three digits, and each column has two digits. Let me label the cells for clarity. Let's say the top row has cells A, B, C, and the bottom row has cells D, E, F. So the grid looks like this:

A | B | C
---|---|---
D | E | F

Now, when we read left to right, each row forms a number. The top row is ABC, which is a three-digit number, and the bottom row is DEF, another three-digit number. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

On the other hand, when we read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, to restate the problem: Assign digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that ABC + DEF = 999 and AD + BE + CF = 99. Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9, but I think in the example given, A was 0, which is allowed because it's the leading digit of a number? Wait, no, ABC is a three-digit number, so A can't be zero. Wait, in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, which would be 008, but that's actually 8, a single-digit number. Wait, maybe the problem allows leading zeros? Because in the example, they have 008 and 991, which sum to 999. So maybe ABC and DEF can have leading zeros, which means A can be zero. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but the example shows that it's allowed, so I think leading zeros are okay here.

So, digits can be 0-9 for all cells.

Alright, so let's write down the equations.

First, ABC + DEF = 999.

Expressed in terms of digits:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

Similarly, for the vertical sums:

AD + BE + CF = 99.

Which is:

10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99.

So, we have two equations:

1) 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

2) 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the digits.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1.

Equation 1: 100A +10B + C +100D +10E +F = 999.

Equation 2: 10A + D +10B + E +10C +F = 99.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100A -10A) + (10B -10B) + (C -10C) + (100D - D) + (10E - E) + (F - F) = 999 -99.

Simplify:

90A -9C +99D +9E = 900.

I can factor out 9:

9*(10A - C +11D + E) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100.

Hmm, that's a useful equation. So, 10A - C +11D + E = 100. Let me write that as equation 3.

So equation 3: 10A - C +11D + E = 100.

Now, let me think about equation 2: 10A + D +10B + E +10C + F =99.

Let me rearrange equation 2: 10A +10B +10C + D + E + F =99.

I can factor 10 from the first three terms:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) =99.

Let me denote S = A + B + C, and T = D + E + F. Then equation 2 becomes:

10S + T =99.

Which implies that T=99 -10S.

But since S and T are sums of digits, let's think about possible values of S.

Since A, B, C are digits (0-9), S can be from 0 (if all are 0) to 27 (if all are 9). Similarly, T can be from 0 to 27.

But T=99 -10S.

So, 99 -10S must be between 0 and 27, inclusive.

So, 0 ≤ 99 -10S ≤27.

Let me solve for S.

First inequality: 99 -10S ≥0 → 10S ≤99 → S ≤9.9. Since S is an integer, S ≤9.

Second inequality: 99 -10S ≤27 → 99 -27 ≤10S →72 ≤10S → S ≥7.2. So S ≥8.

So S can be 8 or 9.

Thus, S can be 8 or 9.

Therefore, T =99 -10S.

If S=8, T=99-80=19.

If S=9, T
