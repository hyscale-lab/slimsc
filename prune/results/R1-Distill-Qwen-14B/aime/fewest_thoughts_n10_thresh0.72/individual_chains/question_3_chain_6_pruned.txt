Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Jen is participating in a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

So, to rephrase, we're looking for P(Grand Prize | Prize). In probability terms, this is the conditional probability, which can be calculated using the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning any prize. But actually, if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, so A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize (which is straightforward), and the probability that she wins any prize (which includes winning two, three, or four numbers matching). Then, I'll divide the two to get the conditional probability.

First, let's compute the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). Remember, combinations are used because the order doesn't matter in lottery draws.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of her numbers match the four chosen. Since Jen picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one way this can happen—so the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Hence, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers match the chosen four. This is the same as the number of ways the chosen four numbers can intersect her four numbers in at least two numbers.

To compute this, it might be easier to calculate the total number of favorable cases for B and then divide by the total number of possible cases (210). The favorable cases for B are all the possible 4-number combinations that share at least two numbers with Jen's numbers.

Alternatively, I can compute the probability of the complementary event (she wins no prizes, i.e., fewer than two matches) and subtract that from 1.

So, let's compute P(B) as 1 - P(no match or exactly one match).

First, compute the number of ways the chosen four numbers have exactly k matches with Jen's numbers, for k=0,1,2,3,4. But since she wins a prize when k >=2, the complementary probability is when k=0 or k=1.

So, the number of ways for exactly 0 matches: the four chosen numbers are entirely from the 6 numbers Jen didn't pick (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, so 6 are not picked).

So, the number of ways for 0 matches is C(6,4). Similarly, the number of ways for exactly 1 match is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me explain:

- For exactly 0 matches: choose all 4 numbers from the 6 not picked. So, C(6,4) = 15.

- For exactly 1 match: choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 from the 6 non-picked. So, C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of non-winning cases (k=0 and k=1) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of winning cases (k >=2) is total cases (210) minus non-winning cases (95): 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, let me verify that calculation. Because 15 + 80 is indeed 95, and 210 - 95 is 115. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

Alternatively, I can compute the number directly for k=2,3,4.

Let's see:

- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *
