Okay, so I need to figure out how many ways there are to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. First, when reading the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when reading the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. The example given is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

In this example, the left-to-right numbers are 008 and 991, which sum to 8 + 991 = 999. The top-to-bottom numbers are 09, 09, and 81, which sum to 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. 

Alright, let's break this down. Let me denote the grid cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

So, the first number formed left to right is the top row: abc, which is a three-digit number. Wait, no—wait, wait. Wait, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, each row is three digits, meaning each row forms a three-digit number. So, the top row is a three-digit number, say N1 = 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row is N2 = 100d + 10e + f. The sum N1 + N2 must be 999.

So, N1 + N2 = (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second column is be, and the third column is cf. So, the sum is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me write these equations clearly:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that helps.

Let me compute Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100a - 10a) + (10b - 10b) + (c - 10c) + (100d - d) + (10e - e) + (f - f) = 999 - 99.

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d + 9e + 0f = 900.

Simplify:

90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

So, that's a new equation: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Let me note this as Equation 3.

Now, let's see if I can express variables in terms of others or find some constraints.

Equation 3: 10a - c +11d +e = 100.

Hmm, perhaps I can also try to express some variables from Equation 2.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Wait, perhaps I can solve for f.

f = 99 - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c).

So, f = 99 - 10a - d -10b -e -10c.

But f is a single digit (0-9). So, the expression 99 - ... must be between 0 and 9.

So, 0 ≤ 99 - 10a - d -10b -e -10c ≤9.

Which implies that 90 ≤ 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c ≤99.

So, the sum 10a + d +10b + e +10c is between 90 and 99.

Hmm, perhaps this can be used later.

Back to Equation 3: 10a -c +11d +e =100.

I can rearrange this to group variables:

10a +11d +e = 100 +c.

Since c is a digit, 0 ≤ c ≤9, so 100 ≤10a +11d +e ≤109.

So, 10a +11d +e is between 100 and 109.

Also, all variables a, d are digits (0-9), but note that a can't be zero because it's the first digit of a three-digit number. Similarly, d can be zero, but if a is zero, then N1 would be a two-digit number, but in the example, a is zero, and N1 is 008, which is 8. So, perhaps a can be zero; same with d. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999." So, perhaps each number can be a three-digit number, but a can be zero, leading to a two-digit or one-digit number. However, in the example, N1 is 008, which is 8, and N2 is 991. So, a can be zero.

But, in the grid, the top row is a three-digit number, which could be 000 to 999, same with the bottom row. So, a can be zero, d can be zero too.

So, variables a, b, c, d, e, f can be 0-9, with a, d possibly zero.

So, the variables:

a: 0-9

b: 0-9

c:0-9

d:0-9

e:0-9

f:0-9

Now, to handle Equation 3: 10a +11d +e =100 +c.

Since c is 0-9, the right-hand side is 100 to 109.

So, 10a +11d +e must be 100 to 109.

Let me think about possible values for d, since it's multiplied by 11.

Because 11d can contribute a significant portion.

Let me see possible d values (0-9):

d=0: 11*0=0 → 10a +e=100 +c → But 10a +e can be at most 10*9 +9=99. But 100 +c is at least 100. So, not possible.

d=1: 11 → 10a +e +11 =100 +c → 10a +e=89 +c.

But 10a +e ≤99, and 89 +c ≥89. So, possible for c≥0.

d=2:22 →10a +e=78 +c.

d=3:33 →10a +e=67 +c.

d=4:44 →10a +e=56 +c.

d=5:55 →10a +e=45 +c.

d=6:66 →10a +e=34 +c.

d=7:77 →10a +e=23 +c.

d=8:88 →10a +e=12 +c.

d=9:99 →10a +e=1 +c.

Wait, 10a +e is a two-digit number, right? Because a is a digit (0-9), e is a digit (0-9). So, 10a +e can be from 0 to 99.

But for each d, the equation becomes 10a +e = (some value) +c.

Given that c is 0-9, let me see for each d whether 10a +e can equal 100 +c -11d.

Wait, sorry, Equation 3 is 10a +11d +e =100 +c.

So, 10a +e = (100 +c) -11d.

Since 10a +e must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, let's see for each d:

d=0: 10a +e =100 +c → but 10a +e ≤99, which cannot be ≥100. So, d=0 impossible.

d=1: 10a +e =100 +c -11=89 +c. So, 89 +c must be ≤99, so c ≤10. But c is ≤9, so c can be 0-9. So, 89 ≤10a +e ≤98.

But 10a +e must be 89 +c, and c can be 0-9, so 89 ≤10a +e ≤98.

But 10a +e is a two-digit number, so a is from 0-9, e from 0-9. So, 10a +e can be 89 when a=8, e=9, or 90 when a=9, e=0, etc.

Wait, so for d=1, 10a +e =89 +c. Since c is 0-9, 89 ≤10a +e ≤98.

So, 10a +e can vary from 89 to 98.

So, possible a and e combinations for each c.

Wait, perhaps I can consider for each d, possible values of c, and then count possible a and e.

But maybe it's better to iterate through possible
