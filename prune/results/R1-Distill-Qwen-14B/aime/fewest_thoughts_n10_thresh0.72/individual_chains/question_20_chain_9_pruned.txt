Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways there are to place chips on a 5x5 grid. The grid has 25 cells, and I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. Each cell can hold at most one chip. There are some conditions I need to follow.

First, all chips in the same row must be the same color. So, if I place a chip in a row, every other cell in that row must have the same color chip or be empty. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. If I place a chip in a column, every other cell in that column must have the same color or be empty.

Additionally, the placement must be such that if I try to add any more chips, it would violate the previous two conditions. So, the grid should already be maximally filled without violating the row and column color rules.

Let me try to understand the problem better. Each row must be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, if a row is all white, then every column that intersects with this row must either be all white or empty. Because if a column has a white chip in that row, then the column must be all white. Hmm, that seems like a constraint.

Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let me think. Suppose I have a row that's all white. Then, any column that has a white chip in that row must be all white. So, if a column has a white in that row, the entire column must be white. But columns that don't have a white in that row can be either all black or all empty? Wait, no, because if a column has a black chip in any row, then the entire column must be black. So, if a column is not entirely white, it could be entirely black or entirely empty? Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, the rules are that all chips in the same row are the same color, and same for the columns. So, for each row, it's either white, black, or empty. Similarly, for each column, it's either white, black, or empty. But these choices aren't independent because the rows and columns intersect. So, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection cell must be both white and black, which is impossible.
