Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola that form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Basically, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the lower bound for BD², but since it's a hyperbola, maybe there's a specific minimum value.

First, let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, is that true? No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, for the rhombus ABCD, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Therefore, the coordinates of these points should be symmetric with respect to the origin.

So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v).

But all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting point A into the hyperbola equation, we have x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Similarly for point B, u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Let's think about the slopes. The slope of diagonal AC: since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.

Similarly, the slope of diagonal BD: since B is (u, v) and D is (-u, -v), the slope is (-v - v)/(-u - u) = (-2v)/(-2u) = v/u.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1.

So, (y v)/(x u) = -1. Therefore, y v = -x u.

That's one condition.

Another thing to remember is that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of
