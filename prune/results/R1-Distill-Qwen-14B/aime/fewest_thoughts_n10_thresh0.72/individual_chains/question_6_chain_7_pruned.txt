Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. I have two functions:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. So, these are the intersections of the graphs.

Let me start by understanding the functions f and g. They are both defined as absolute value functions.

- \( f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | \)
- \( g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 | \)

So, f and g are transformations of absolute value functions. Let me try to graph these in my mind.

Starting with f(x):

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This would shift the vertex down by 1/2, so the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But since it's an absolute value, the parts where |x| - 1/2 would be negative would flip. So, when |x| < 1/2, the expression becomes negative, so taking absolute makes it positive again.

So, f(x) is a V-shape that has its vertex at (0, 0). It goes up with a slope of 1 until x = 1/2, then it turns into another V, going down to (1/2, 0), but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps I should graph it step by step.

1. Start with |x|, which is V-shaped with vertex at (0,0).
2. Subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This will shift the graph downward by 1/2. So, the vertex is at (0, -1/2). But since it's an absolute value function, when |x| < 1/2, the expression |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value of that would flip it.

So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me find the critical points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero: |x| - 1/2 = 0 => |x| = 1/2 => x = 1/2 and x = -1/2.

So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

Outside of that interval, |x| >= 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that starts at ( -1/2, 0 ), goes up to (0, 1/2 ), then goes back down to (1/2, 0). Beyond that, it continues as |x| - 1/2, which is another V-shape increasing on either side.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. No, when x is beyond 1/2, |x| is x, so f(x) = x - 1/2 for x >= 1/2, which would be a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0). Similarly, for x <= -1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is -x - 1/2, so a line with slope -1 starting at (-1/2, 0). So the graph of f(x) is indeed a combination of different V-shapes.

Similarly, let's consider g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Again, the same method.

Find the critical points where |x| - 1/4 = 0 => |x| = 1/4 => x = 1/4, x = -1/4.

So, for |x| < 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| -
