Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. I need to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and add them together.

Let me break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number. Let's represent it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units digit. So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

The property is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1 should each result in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's denote four modified numbers:

1. If we change A to 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's call this N1.
2. If we change B to 1: A1CD = 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D. Let's call this N2.
3. If we change C to 1: AB1D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.
4. If we change D to 1: ABC1 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7  
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7  
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7  
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need to find the largest N = ABCD such that all these four modified numbers are divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the maximum N. So, perhaps I should start considering N as high as possible, like 9999, and then check each condition, but that might take a long time. Maybe I can find some patterns or constraints that the digits must satisfy.

Let me write down the four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  
2. 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7  
3. 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7  
4. 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can rewrite each of these modulo 7.

Wait, let me compute the value of each of these numbers modulo 7.

I know that 1000 mod 7 can be computed as follows: 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 14*7=98, so 100 - 98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 10-7=3.

And 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's compute each modified number modulo 7:

1. N1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ (6) + (2B) + (3C) + D mod 7  
   So, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (1)

2. N2: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ (6A) + (2) + (3C) + D mod 7  
   So, 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (2)

3. N3: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ (6A) + (2B) + (3) + D mod 7  
   So, 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (3)

4. N4: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ (6A) + (2B) + (3C) + 1 mod 7  
   So, 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (4)

So now I have four equations modulo 7:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, but wait, 6 + ... ≡0 → ... ≡1 mod7. Let me check:

Wait, 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 → 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 → but -6 mod7 is 1, so yes, Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 → 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7).

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7 → 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

Wait, let me make sure:

For Equation (2): 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 6A +3C + D ≡-2 mod7 → which is 5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7 → 6A +2B + D ≡-3 mod7 → which is 4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7 → 6A + 2B +3C ≡-1 mod7 → which is 6 mod7.

So, the four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7  
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7  
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7  
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, okay. Now, perhaps I can find some relations between these equations.

Let me see what variables are involved. We have four variables: A, B, C, D, each a digit from 0 to 9 (with A ≥1, since it's a four-digit number).

We have four equations, so maybe we can solve this system.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

First, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2.

Equation (2) minus Equation (1):

(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) = 6A - 2B ≡5 -1 =4 mod7.

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let me write that as:

6A - 2B ≡4 mod7 → Equation (5)

Similarly, subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) = 3C -2B ≡5 -4=1 mod7.

So, 3C -2B ≡1 mod7 → Equation (6)

And, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) =3C - D ≡6 -4=2 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → Equation (7)

Now, let's see what we have.

From Equation (5): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let's simplify 6A mod7 is same as (-1)A mod7, because 6 ≡-1 mod7. Similarly, 2B mod7 is same as 2B.

So, Equation (5): (-A) -2B ≡4 mod7 → -A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Multiply both sides by -1: A + 2B ≡-4 mod7 → A +2B ≡3 mod7 (since -4 ≡3 mod7). So Equation (5a): A + 2B ≡3 mod7.

From Equation (6): 3C -2B ≡1 mod7 → Let's write this as Equation (6a): 3C ≡2B +1 mod7.

From Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → Equation (7a): D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, let's try to express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (5a): A ≡3 - 2B mod7.

Since A is a digit from 1 to 9, but mod7, A can be considered as 1 to 6 or 7,8,9 with modulo 7 equivalents.

But perhaps it's better to express A as 3 -2B +7k, where k is an integer such that A is between1 and9.

Similarly, from Equation (6a): 3C ≡2B +1 mod7 → So, 3C ≡ (2B +1) mod7 → So, C ≡ (2B +1) * 3^{-1} mod7.

What is the inverse of 3 mod7? 3*5=15≡1 mod7 → So inverse is 5.

Thus, C ≡5*(2B +1) mod7 → C ≡(10B +5) mod7 → 10 mod7 is 3, so C ≡(3B +5) mod7 → Equation (6b): C ≡3B +5 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (7a): D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Substituting C from Equation (6b):

C ≡3B +5 mod7 → 3C ≡3*(3B +5) =9B +15 ≡2B +1 mod7 (since 9 mod7=2, 15 mod7=1). Wait, that's consistent with Equation (6a): 3C ≡2B +1 mod7. So that's correct.

So, D ≡3C -2 mod7. Since C ≡3B +5 mod7, then D ≡3*(3B +5) -2 mod7 → 9B +15 -2 → 9B +
