Okay, so I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to visualize this. An 8x8 grid means it's like a chessboard, right? So, starting from the lower left corner and moving to the upper right corner. Each step is along the grid lines, either right or up.

Wait, the path has length 16. Since it's moving from (0,0) to (8,8), each path consists of 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So, the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense. But the problem is about changing direction exactly four times.

Hmm, so in a path, a direction change occurs when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. For example, if you move right a few times, then switch to up, that's one direction change. Each time you switch, that's a new direction. So, starting from the first step, you have a direction, and each time you switch, that's a change.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does it consist of? Let's think. Each direction change adds a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, that would mean five segments in total. Because the first segment is the first direction, then each change adds another segment. So, four changes mean five segments.

Each segment must be a straight line, either all right or all up. So, each segment alternates between right and up. So, the path could start with right, then up, then right, then up, etc., or it could start with up and then alternate.

Wait, so the path alternates directions each time. So, if it changes direction four times, it must alternate five times in total. So, the first direction could be either right or up, and then it alternates.

But each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length. So, each segment is at least one step.

So, the problem reduces to partitioning the 8 right moves and 8 up moves into five segments, alternating between right and up. The number of segments is five because four direction changes.

Wait, but the starting direction could be right or up. So, we have two cases: starting with right or starting with up.

Let me denote the number of
