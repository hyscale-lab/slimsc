Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, right? Because any complex number with magnitude r can be written in polar form as r*(cosθ + i sinθ) or r*e^{iθ}. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, which means 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared, which is 16 in this case. So 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z into the expression, I get:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}.

Let me compute (75 + 117i)*4. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So that part becomes 300 + 468i.

Similarly, the second part: (96 + 144i)*(1/4). 96*(1/4) is 24, and 144*(1/4) is 36. So that part is 24 + 36i.

So now the expression simplifies to:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. So, I can write each term as a complex number multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}, then expand them and sum the real parts.

Let me denote the first term as A = 300 + 468i, and the second term as B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

I know that for any complex number C = c + di, C e^{iθ} = (c cosθ - d sinθ) + i(c sinθ + d cosθ). Similarly, C e^{-iθ} = (c cosθ + d sinθ) - i(c sinθ - d cosθ). 

So, let me compute the real parts of both terms.

Real part of A e^{iθ}: A_real_part = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ).

Real part of B e^{-iθ}: B_real_part = (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ).

Therefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. That is, find the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, I remember that an expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(a² + b²), and φ is some angle. The maximum value of that is R, because the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, so in this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me write it as a cosθ + b sinθ, where a = 324 and b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(324² + (-432)²). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, 324² = (300 + 24)² = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: Let me think, 400² is 160,000, 32² is 1,024, and the cross term is 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, 432² = (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 is 185,600, plus 1,024 is 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

Wait, sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that. 500² is 250,000. 600² is 360,000. So it's between 500 and 600. Let me see: 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. 250,000 +40,000 + 1,600 is 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So R is 540. Therefore, the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Wait a second, so the maximum real part
