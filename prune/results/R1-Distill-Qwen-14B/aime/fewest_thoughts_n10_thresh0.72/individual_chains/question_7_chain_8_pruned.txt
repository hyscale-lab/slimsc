Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. So, each vertex is independently colored red or blue. That means for each vertex, there's a 1/2 chance it's red and a 1/2 chance it's blue. Since there are 8 vertices, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256. So, the denominator of the probability will probably be 256, but I'm not sure yet.

The key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to where red ones were. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, say k steps, then every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. 

Wait, but what does that mean for the coloring? It means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, if I have a certain number of red and blue vertices, their arrangement must be such that one is a rotation of the other.

But wait, the octagon is regular, which means it has rotational symmetry. So, any rotation by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45) will map the octagon onto itself.

I think I need to consider the rotational symmetries of the octagon. The group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, generated by a rotation of 45 degrees. So, the rotations are by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, corresponding to rotating 0,1,2,...,7 steps.

Now, the condition is that there exists some rotation such that when we apply it, all the blue vertices move to positions that were red. So, if I let R be a rotation, then R(blue vertices) must be a subset of red vertices. Wait, no. Actually, since all blue vertices must move to positions that were red, it's more precise to say that R(blue vertices) equals red vertices. Because every blue vertex must move to a position that was red, and every red vertex must be covered by the blue vertices' rotation.

Wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think. If I have a coloring where, say, some blue vertices are rotated to red
