Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, right? Each can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rotations. A regular octagon can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees because 360/8 = 45. So, there are 8 possible rotations: 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째. Each rotation corresponds to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions respectively.

The key here is that after some rotation, all blue vertices should move to positions where the original color was red. Wait, that might not be the exact phrasing. Let me re-read: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, I think this means that if I rotate the octagon by some amount, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was previously red. So, in other words, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it's now on a red vertex's original position.

Wait, but actually, the colorings are fixed. So, when we rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. The condition is that the set of blue vertices must be exactly the image of the set of red vertices under some rotation.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon, the position of blue vertices must align with where the red ones were.

So, another way to think about this is that the coloring must be such that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since each blue vertex must land on a red vertex's original position after some rotation, which implies that the positions of blue and red vertices are related by a rotation symmetry of the octagon.

Hmm, but how does that help me compute the probability? I think I need to count the number of colorings where the blue vertices can be rotated to the red vertices. Since each coloring is a subset of the 8 vertices, the condition is that this subset is a rotation of its complement.

Wait, because the octagon is being rotated so that blue vertices move to red positions. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. But the set of red vertices is the complement of blue vertices. So, the blue set is a rotation of its complement.

Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the
