Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find the length of AP, given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let's start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. So, triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing AD, which intersects the circle again at P. So, AP is the segment we're after.

I think I remember that when dealing with tangents and points of intersection like D, the power of a point theorem might come in handy. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC² because DB and DC are tangent to ω. So, DB = DC, right? Wait, no, actually, the lengths of the two tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal. So, yes, DB = DC. That's a useful piece of information.

Let me recall the power of a point formula. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA, since AD is a secant that intersects the circle at P and A. So, DB² = DP * DA. That seems right.

But I don't know DB yet. So maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let's think about triangle ABC. Since ABC has sides 5, 9, and 10, perhaps I can compute the circumradius first. Because knowing the circumradius might help me find DB.

Wait, how is DB related to the triangle? Let me think. Since DB is the tangent from D to ω at B, the length DB is equal to the length of the tangent from D to ω, which can be related to the power of point D. But without knowing where D is, maybe I should consider the coordinates approach. Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry could help.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry is a good approach here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC is 10 units, I can place point A at (10, 0). Point B is somewhere in the plane. Given the sides AB=5 and BC=9, I can find coordinates for B.

Let me denote point B as (x, y). Then, since BC=9, the distance from B to C(0,0) is √(x² + y²) = 9 ⇒ x² + y² = 81. Also, AB=5, so the distance
