Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by S = 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. Here, S is 54 and V is 23. So, I'm dealing with two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box, which means I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by d = sqrt(l² + w² + h²). The radius of the sphere would then be half of this diagonal, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² = (d²)/4 = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to find l² + w² + h². Let's denote that as Q = l² + w² + h². So, r² = Q/4.

Given that, I need to express Q in terms of the given surface area and volume. Let me recall some algebraic identities. I know that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). From this, I can express Q as (l + w + h)² - 2(lw + lh + wh). 

We already know the surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54. So, lw + lh + wh = 27. Therefore, Q = (l + w + h)² - 2*27 = (l + w + h)² - 54.

So, if I can find (l + w + h)², I can find Q. Let's denote S = l + w + h. Then, Q = S² - 54.

Now, how can I find S? I have V = lwh = 23. Hmm. I remember that for three variables, there's the inequality that relates the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. Maybe I can use that to find the minimal sphere? Wait, but I'm supposed to find the maximal diagonal, which would correspond to the case where the box is as "stretched out" as possible. Hmm, not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of the given S and V. Let me see. Let's denote:

We have:

1. l + w + h = S
2. lw + lh + wh = 27
3. lwh = 23

So, these are the elementary symmetric sums of the variables l, w, h. So, they are the coefficients of the monic cubic polynomial whose roots are l, w, h. The polynomial would be x³ - Sx² + 27x - 23 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly. Maybe I can use some optimization here. Since I need to find the maximum possible Q, which is S² - 54, I need to find the maximum value of S² given that l, w, h satisfy the given constraints.

Wait, but is S² maximized when Q is maximized? Or is there another way? Let me think. Since Q = S² - 54, maximizing Q is equivalent to maximizing S². So, to maximize Q, I need to maximize S, the sum of l, w, h.

But how can I find the maximum S given the constraints? Hmm. Since l, w, h are positive real numbers, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers for optimization.

Let me set up the problem. I need to maximize S = l + w + h, subject to the constraints:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 => lw + lh + wh = 27
2. lwh = 23

So, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. Let me denote the function to maximize as f(l, w, h) = l + w + h. The constraints are g(l, w, h) = lw + lh + wh - 27 = 0 and h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

The method of Lagrange multipliers with multiple constraints tells us that the gradient of f should be a linear combination of the gradients of g and h. So,

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Which gives us the system of equations:

1. 1 = λ(w + h) + μ(wh)
2. 1 = λ(l + h) + μ(lh)
3. 1 = λ(l + w) + μ(lw)

And the constraints:

4. lw + lh + wh = 27
5. lwh = 23

So, we have five equations with five variables l, w, h, λ, μ.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between l, w, h.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

[1 = λ(l + h) + μ(lh)] - [1 = λ(w + h) + μ(wh)] => 0 = λ(l - w) + μh(l - w)

So, 0 = (λ + μh)(l - w)

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the third:

[1 = λ(l + w) + μ(lw)] - [1 = λ(l + h) + μ(lh)] => 0 = λ(w - h) + μl(w - h)

So, 0 = (λ + μl)(w - h)

And subtract the first from the third:

[1 = λ(l + w) + μ(lw)] - [1 = λ(w + h)
