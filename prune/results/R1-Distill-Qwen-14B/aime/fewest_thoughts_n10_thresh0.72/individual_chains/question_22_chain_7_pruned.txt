Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to understand it first.

The hexagon is named ABCDEF, and it's equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That makes sense for a convex hexagon; it's probably similar to a regular hexagon in terms of opposite sides being parallel, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal.

The problem says there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. These extensions form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. So, let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, their extensions would form a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

I think this has something to do with similar triangles or maybe some proportional relationships. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions might be similar to the hexagon's sides but scaled up.

Wait, but the sides of the triangle are 200, 240, and 300. That's a 3-4-5 triangle scaled by a factor of maybe 100? Because 3*100=300, 4*75=300? Wait, no, 200 is 200, 240 is 240, 300 is 300. So, 200:240:300 simplifies to 5:6:7.5? Wait, no, let me see:

Divide each by 40: 200/40=5, 240/40=6, 300/40=7.5. So, 5:6:7.5 ratio. Hmm, maybe that's not the most straightforward way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a right triangle? Let me check if 200² + 240² equals 300². 200² is 40,000, 240² is 57,600. Their sum is 97,600. 300² is 90,000. Oh, no, that doesn't add up. So, it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines to find some angles. Let's see, if I have a triangle with sides a=200, b=240, c=300. I can find one angle using the Law of Cosines.

Let me choose angle opposite to the largest side, which is 300. So, using Law of Cosines:

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cosθ  
300² = 200² + 240² -
