Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down and understand what's being asked.

The problem states: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. So, we have a hyperbola, and four points on it form a rhombus. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD², which is the square of the length of one of the diagonals.

Let me recall some properties:

1. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, I think I might be mixing with a square. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular. So that's a key property.

2. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the coordinates of A, B, C, D must be arranged symmetrically around the origin.

3. Given that ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if one diagonal is AC, the other is BD, and they intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

4. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily of the same length, but they are perpendicular. So, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, maybe we can consider the diagonals as vectors, and they must satisfy certain conditions.

Since the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, each point must satisfy this equation.

Let me think about how to parameterize the points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola parametrization, usually, we can use hyperbolic functions. So, points on the hyperbola can be written as (a sec θ, b tan θ), where a² = 20 and b² = 24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6).

Alternatively, another parametrization is (sqrt(20) *
