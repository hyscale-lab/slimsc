Okay, so I've got this problem here about logarithms, and I need to find the product of x and y where both are greater than 1. The equations given are log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but let's take it step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use the change of base formula or some properties of logarithms to simplify these equations. Let me write down the two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can use the power rule for logarithms, which says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). Applying that to both equations might help.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, so if I let log_x(y) = something, maybe that can help. Let's say log_x(y) = a. Then the first equation becomes x * a = 10, so a = 10 / x.

But what's a? It's log_x(y), which by definition means x^a = y. So if a = 10 / x, then y = x^{10/x}.

Okay, so now I have y expressed in terms of x: y = x^{10/x}. Let me write that down.

y = x^{10/x}.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, I can write log_y(x) in terms of log_x(y) because I know log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y). But from earlier, log_x(y) is a, which is 10/x. So log_y(x) = x / 10.

Let me plug that into the second equation: 4y * (x / 10) = 10.

Simplify that: (4y * x) / 10 = 10. Multiplying both sides by 10: 4y x = 100. Dividing both sides by 4: y x = 25.

Wait, so the product xy is 25? That seems straightforward, but let me verify if everything checks out. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me recap the steps:

1. From log_x(y^x) = 10, I got log_x(y) = 10/x, so y = x^{10/x}.
2. From log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, I used the power rule to get 4y * log_y(x) = 10.
3. Recognized that log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), which is x/10.
4. Substituted log_y(x) = x/10 into the second equation to get 4y*(x/10) = 10.
5. Simplified to find yx = 25.

That seems correct. But let me double-check by plugging xy = 25 into the expressions.

If xy = 25, then y = 25/x.

From the first equation, we have y = x^{10/x}. So 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Let me take natural logs on both sides to see if that helps: ln(25/x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Simplify left side: ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Hmm, that's a bit more complicated, but let's write it as:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10 ln x)/x.

Let me rearrange terms:

ln(25) = (10 ln x)/x + ln(x).

Factor ln(x) on the right:

ln(25) = ln(x) * (10/x + 1).

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation. Not sure if I can solve it algebraically, but maybe I can find x such that this holds.

Alternatively, since we're given that both x and y are greater than 1, perhaps I can find a value of x that satisfies this.

Wait, but earlier steps led me directly to xy=2
