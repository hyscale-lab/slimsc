Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me break this down. It's a combinatorial game, so maybe I can model it using something like the Sprague-Grundy theorem or just figure out the winning and losing positions.

First, let's define what a winning position is. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the goal is to find the losing positions because if Bob is in a losing position, he can't win regardless of Alice's moves, but actually, wait, no. Wait, in this case, Alice starts first, so if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win. So I need to find n where the starting position (n tokens) is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to find the pattern or the recurrence for the positions.

Let me think recursively. Let's denote f(n) as true if the current player can win with n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:

- If n = 0, the game is over. So the current player can't make a move and loses. So f(0) = false.

But wait, in the game, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So f(1) = true.

Similarly, if n=4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So f(4) = true.

Wait, but for n=2 and n=3, the current player can't take all tokens in one move, so they have to make a move that leaves the opponent in a position where they can win. Wait, no, the player wants to make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

So the general rule would be: f(n) is true if the current player can make a move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) that leads the opponent into a position where f
