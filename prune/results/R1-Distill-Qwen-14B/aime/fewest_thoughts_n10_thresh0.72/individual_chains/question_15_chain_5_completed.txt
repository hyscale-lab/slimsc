Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that each path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite typically involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to go from the lower left to the upper right, you need to move 8 steps to the right (east) and 8 steps up (north). So, the total number of steps is 16, which matches the problem statement.

Now, without any restrictions, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient. Specifically, it's the number of ways to choose 8 steps out of 16 to be right (or up), which is C(16,8). But here, the problem is more specific: we need paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Let's think. Each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, a path that alternates right, up, right, up, etc., would have many direction changes. But in this problem, we want exactly four direction changes.

Let me visualize a path. Starting at the lower left, let's say the first move is right. Then, when you change direction to up, that's the first change. Each subsequent switch is another change. So, a path that goes right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up would have 7 direction changes. Wait, but that's moving right for 1 step each time. But in our grid, each step is a unit move, right?

Wait, no. Actually, each move can consist of multiple steps in the same direction. So, perhaps the path is a sequence of steps where you alternate between moving right and up, but each such segment can be of any length, as long as you end up at the upper right corner.

So, for example, a path might go right for 3 units, then up for 2 units, then right for 1 unit, then up for 4 units, then right for 2 units, then up for 3 units, and so on. Each time you switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, but the total number of direction changes is the number of times you switch direction minus one? Hmm, no, let me think. Each switch is a direction change. So, if you start going right, then switch to up, that's one change. Then if you switch back to right, that's another change, and so on. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch direction, which is one less than the number of segments.

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose a path has k segments. Then, the number of direction changes is k-1. Because each segment is a straight line in one direction, and each switch between segments counts as a direction change.

So, for example, a path with two segments (all right then all up) has one direction change. A path with three segments (right, up, right) has two direction changes.

Ah, so in our problem, we want the number of paths with exactly four direction changes. That would correspond to paths with 5 segments. Because four direction changes mean five segments.

And since each direction change is a switch between right and up, the starting direction could be right or up. So, we have two cases: paths that start with right and those that start with up.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, do starting directions matter? Let me see. Suppose a path starts with right; then it would go right, up, right, up, etc. If it starts with up, it would go up, right, up, right, etc. But the grid is square, so maybe both cases are symmetric. Hmm, perhaps, but actually, the starting direction might affect the count because of the number of segments. Let me think.

Wait, if a path has five segments and starts with right, the segments would alternate right, up, right, up, right. So, the number of right segments is one more than the number of up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, the number of up segments would be one more than right segments. So, since the total right steps must be 8 and the total up steps must be 8, the number of right segments and up segments must be such that their sums are 8 each.

Wait, but if the path alternates starting with right and has five segments, the number of right segments is three and up segments is two. Because 5 segments starting with right: right, up, right, up, right – that's three rights and two ups. But then the total right steps would be the sum of the lengths of the three right segments, which needs to be 8. Similarly, the two up segments must sum to 8.

Similarly, if starting with up, the path would have three up segments and two right segments.

So, in both cases, the number of right segments and up segments depends on the starting direction.

Wait, but five segments would mean four direction changes, as four times you switch direction.

So, now, how do we count the number of such paths?

I think the problem can be broken down into two cases: paths starting with a right move and those starting with an up move.

Each case will have a certain number of paths, which we can compute and then add together.

Let me formalize this.

Case 1: Paths starting with a right move.

Number of segments: 5 (right, up, right, up, right)

So, three right segments and two up segments.

Each right segment must have a positive integer length, and the sum of all right segments must be 8. Similarly, each up segment must have a positive integer length, and their sum must be 8.

So, for the right segments: we need to partition 8 into 3 positive integers. Similarly, the up segments: partition 8 into 2 positive integers.

The number of ways to partition 8 into k positive integers is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1). So, for the right segments, it's C(7,2) = 21. For the up segments, it's C(7,1) =7.

But wait, how does this relate to direction changes? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm confusing something.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the number of ways to split the steps into segments is given by the number of compositions.

Yes, correct. The number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is indeed C(7,2), which is 21, and into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of ways for the right segments is 21, and for the up segments is 7. Since these are independent, the total number of such paths starting with right is 21 *7 = 147.

Similarly, Case 2: Paths starting with an up move.

Number of segments: 5 (up, right, up, right, up)

So, three up segments and two right segments.

Each up segment must sum to 8, and each right segment must sum to 8.

The number of compositions for up segments is C(7,2)=21, and for right segments is C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of such paths is 21 *7 = 147.

Thus, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, so is the answer 294? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait a second, but in each case, the starting direction is different. But wait, in Case 1, starting with right, you have three right segments and two up segments, each with positive lengths. So, the number of compositions for right is 21, up is 7, so 21*7=147. Similarly, starting with up, the same logic applies, so 21*7=147, and adding them gives 294.

Hmm, but wait, is there a possibility that starting with right or up could lead to overlapping counts? Or perhaps not, since they are distinct starting points.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps we can model this as starting with either direction and then, for each direction, compute the number of compositions accordingly.

Alternatively, another approach: The number of such paths is equal to 2 * (number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts). Because starting with right, you have three right segments and two up segments, each composition being independent.

Wait, but in this case, each composition for the right segments is independent of the up segments. So, yeah, it's 21 *7 *2 (for starting right or up), so 294.

But wait, another thought: in the problem statement, the direction changes exactly four times. So, for a path that starts with right, it's right, up, right, up, right – that's four direction changes. Similarly, starting with up, it's up, right, up, right, up – four direction changes.

So, each of these cases gives four direction changes, and the number of such paths is 294.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think about another way. Maybe the number of direction changes is four, which is the same as having five segments, but the starting direction could affect how the segments are arranged.

Wait, but perhaps the two cases (starting with right or up) are symmetric, so the number of paths in each case is the same, so we can compute one and multiply by two.

Yes, as I did before, 147 each, so 294 total.

But let me think if I can model this problem in a different way to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps using stars and bars. The number of ways to make k compositions for a number n is C(n-1, k-1). So, for right segments, if starting with right and having three right segments, it's C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, for two up segments, it's C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths starting with right is 21*7=147, and similarly for starting with up, also 147. So, 147*2=294.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions, but that might complicate things more.

Wait, another approach: the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is equal to 2 * C(8-1, (number of right segments -1)) * C(8-1, (number of up segments -1)).

But in this case, starting with right, number of right segments is 3, and up segments is 2. So, C(7,2) * C(7,1)=21*7=147, and same for starting with up.

So, 147*2=294.

Hmm, seems consistent.

Wait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing something.

Suppose, for example, that the starting direction is right. So, the path would have segments R, U, R, U, R. Each R segment has length >=1, sum to 8; each U segment has length >=1, sum to 8.

So, the number of ways to split 8 into 3 R segments is C(7,2)=21. Similarly, the number of ways to split 8 into 2 U segments is C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, the number of ways is 21*7=147. So, total is 294.

But another thought: in the problem statement, it's an 8x8 grid, so the number of right steps and up steps are both 8. So, when we split into 3 R segments and 2 U segments, the R segments sum to 8, and U segments sum to 8.

Wait, so for example, R1 + R2 + R3 =8, where R1, R2, R3 >=1. Similarly, U1 + U2 =8, U1, U2 >=1.

So, the number of solutions is C(7,2) for R's and C(7,1) for U's. So, 21*7=147 for starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U, it's U1 + U2 + U3=8, R1 + R2=8. So, C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

Thus, 147+147=294.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me verify with a smaller grid to see if the logic holds.

Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. So, the path needs 1 right and 1 up step. How many paths change direction exactly once? Hmm, since the path must go right then up or up then right, which are two paths. But according to the formula, starting with R: 1 R segment, since 1 direction change would mean 2 segments. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, if we want exactly one direction change, the path has two segments. So, starting with R: one R segment and one U segment. The number of such paths is C(0,0)*C(0,0)=1*1=1. Similarly, starting with U: same, 1*1=1. So total is 2, which is correct.

So, applying the same logic, for 1x1 grid, number of paths is 2, which matches.

Another test case: 2x2 grid. How many paths change direction exactly once?

Wait, a 2x2 grid requires 2 R and 2 U steps.

Paths that change direction once: either RRUU or UURR, but wait, but those are the only two? Wait, no, actually, no. Because changing direction once would mean moving all R's first, then all U's, or all U's first, then all R's. So, the number of such paths is 2.

But according to our formula, starting with R: number of right segments =2, but wait, wait, no. Wait, if we have one direction change, that's two segments. So, in the 2x2 grid, starting with R: two segments, right then up. So, the number of ways is the number of compositions of 2 into 1 R segment (since starting with R, you have one R segment and one U segment). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, it's the number of compositions for R and U. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, for a 2x2 grid, to have exactly one direction change, the path must go all R's first, then all U's, or all U's first, then all R's. So, only two paths: RRUU and UURR. So, the number is 2.

But according to our formula, starting with R: number of R segments is 1, and number of U segments is 1. So, number of compositions for R: C(1,0)=1 (since 2 into 1 segment is 1 way). Similarly, U: C(1,0)=1. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R, and same starting with U, so total 2. Which matches.

Wait, but wait, in our problem, for the 8x8 grid, we have four direction changes, which correspond to five segments. So, for the 2x2 grid, if we were to compute the number of paths with exactly three direction changes, that would correspond to four segments, which is more than the total steps available. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the maximum number of direction changes is three: R, U, R, U. But that would require five segments, but the steps are only four. Wait, no, R, U, R, U would be four segments, but each segment must be at least one step, so for a 2x2 grid, you can't have four segments because 2 R and 2 U steps can't be split into four segments each of length at least one.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of direction changes in a 2x2 grid is one, as in RRUU or UURR. Because any more direction changes would require more segments than the number of steps available. Hmm, perhaps I got confused earlier.

But in any case, the formula seems to hold for the 1x1 grid, so perhaps it's correct for the 8x8 grid as well.

Thus, returning to the original problem, the number of such paths is 294.

Wait, but another thought: suppose the path starts with right, then up, then right, then up, then right. So, it's R, U, R, U, R. Each R segment must be at least 1, and U segments must be at least 1.

The number of ways to have the R segments sum to 8 is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, the number of ways to have U segments sum to 8 with 2 parts is C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147 for starting with R. Similarly, 147 for starting with U, so total 294.

So, I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we consider paths from the lower left to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid. These paths consist of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up) and must change direction exactly four times. A direction change occurs each time the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa.

### Key Observations:
1. **Direction Changes and Segments**: A path with exactly four direction changes consists of five segments. These segments alternate between right (R) and up (U) moves.
2. **Starting Direction**: The path can start with either a right (R) or an up (U) move. These two cases are symmetric and will be calculated separately.
3. **Partitioning Steps**: Each segment must consist of at least one step. For example:
   - If the path starts with R, it will have three R segments and two U segments. The lengths of these segments must sum to 8 for both R and U directions.
   - Similarly, if the path starts with U, it will have three U segments and two R segments.

### Calculation:
1. **Starting with R**:
   - **R Segments**: The number of ways to partition 8 right steps into 3 segments is given by the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
   - **U Segments**: The number of ways to partition 8 up steps into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
   - **Total for Starting with R**: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Starting with U**:
   - **U Segments**: The number of ways to partition 8 up steps into 3 segments is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
   - **R Segments**: The number of ways to partition 8 right steps into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
   - **Total for Starting with U**: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

3. **Total Paths**: Adding the two cases together gives \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
