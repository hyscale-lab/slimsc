Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))  
and  
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

First, I should understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a value, and then take the absolute value again. That probably means their graphs are going to have some V-shapes or maybe multiple V-shapes because of the double absolute values.

Let me think about f(x) first. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So if I break this down, the innermost part is |x|. Let me consider different cases for x:

1. If x ≥ 0, then |x| = x. So f(x) = |x - 1/2|.
   - Now, |x - 1/2| can be broken down further:
     a. If x ≥ 1/2, then |x - 1/2| = x - 1/2.
     b. If x < 1/2, then |x - 1/2| = 1/2 - x.
2. If x < 0, then |x| = -x. So f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = | - (x + 1/2)| = |x + 1/2|.
   - Again, this can be broken down:
     a. If x ≥ -1/2, |x + 1/2| = x + 1/2.
     b. If x < -1/2, |x + 1/2| = -(x + 1/2) = -x - 1/2.

So putting it all together, f(x) is a piecewise function:

- For x ≥ 1/2: f(x) = x - 1/2 (a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0))
- For -1/2 ≤ x < 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - x (a line with slope -1 starting at (1/2, 0) and going down to (-1/2, 1))
- For x < -1/2: f(x) = -x - 1/2 (a line with slope -1 starting at (-1/2, 1))

Wait, actually, let me plot these points:

At x = 1/2, f(x)=0.  
At x = -1/2, f(x)=1.  
At x=0, f(x)=1/2.  
So the graph of f(x) is V-shaped with the vertex at (1/2, 0) and another point at (-1/2, 1), and it's symmetric about the y-axis.

Similarly for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Let's break it down:

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

Again, considering x ≥0 and x <0.

1. For x ≥0:
   g(x) = |x - 1/4|
   - If x ≥1/4, g(x)=x -1/4
   - If x <1/4, g(x)=1/4 -x

2. For x <0:
   g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x +1/4|
   - If x ≥-1/4, g(x)=x +1/4
   - If x < -1/4, g(x)= -x -1/4

So the graph of g(x) is also piecewise linear.

Key points:
At x=1/4, g(x)=0  
At x=-1/4, g(x)=0  
At x=0, g(x)=1/4  
So the graph is V-shaped with vertices at (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), and the center is at (0,1/4). It has two Vs.

Wait, actually, the function is symmetric about the y-axis, so both sides are mirror images.

So f(x) has a V shape that goes up to x=-1/2 and down to x=1/2, while g(x) has two Vs centered at x=0, with vertices at x=1/4 and x=-1/4.

Now, the functions y and x in the problem are both composed with f and g. Let's try to analyze each function step by step.

First, the function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me break this down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and has a period of 1 because the argument is 2πx. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1, meaning it completes one full cycle as x increases by 1.

2. Then, compute f of that: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me think about the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

   Therefore, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, we get f(sin(2πx)) between 0 and 1/2.

   Wait, let's see:

   When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.

   When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1/2.

   So regardless, f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1
