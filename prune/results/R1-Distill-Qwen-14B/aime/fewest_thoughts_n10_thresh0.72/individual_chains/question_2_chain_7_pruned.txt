Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. There are three points given: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis, a bit higher than 0.866, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then there's this family of segments F, which are PQ segments of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with length 1. All these segments are in the first quadrant, which makes sense because both P and Q are on the positive axes.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is on the x-axis, B is on the y-axis, and the distance between them should be 1. Let me check that.

Distance between A and B: A is at (1/2, 0), B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance squared is (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, yes, AB is a segment of length 1, so AB is part of the family F.

So, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's the only point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F. So, all other points on AB except C are on at least one other segment from F besides AB. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

The answer should be p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.

Alright, so let's think about the family F. Each segment PQ is of length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, for a general P at (p,0) and Q at (0,q), we have sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, for each such segment, p and q satisfy this equation.

So, the segments are all the lines connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, each such segment is like a line in the first quadrant from the x-axis to the y-axis, and the endpoints are related by p^2 + q^2 =1.

Now, we can parameterize these segments. Let's say for a parameter t, P is (t,0) and Q is (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)), since p = t, q = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, t ranges from 0 to 1, because both P and Q are in the first quadrant. So, for each t in (0,1), we have a segment PQ.

So, the equation of the line PQ can be found. The line passing through (t, 0) and (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)) has slope m = [sqrt(1 - t^2) - 0]/[0 - t] = -sqrt(1 - t^2)/t.

So, the equation of the line is y = m(x - t), because it passes through (t,0). So, substituting m, we get y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)(x - t).

Simplifying, y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, the equation is y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2).

Alternatively, we can write this as x/(t) + y/(sqrt(1 - t^2)) = 1. Because each segment PQ is an intercept form of a line, where the x-intercept is t and the y-intercept is sqrt(1 - t^2). So, the equation is x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) = 1.

So, each PQ is described by that equation for some t in (0,1).

Now, the point C is on AB, so let's find the parametric equation of AB first.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)s

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)s

where s ranges from 0 to 1. When s=0, we have A, and when s=1, we have B.

Alternatively, we can write the line AB in slope-intercept form. The slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point on AB is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), with x from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, let me check that. When x=1/2, y=0, which is correct for point A. When x=0, y= sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So, yeah, that's correct.

So, point C is on AB, so it can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), for some x between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find such a point C that it does not lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other t ≠ corresponding t_AB, the point C should not lie on the line x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) = 1.

But, since AB is itself a segment in F, with t = 1/2, because point A is (1/2, 0), so t=1/2. Then, sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. So, the segment AB corresponds to t=1/2.

So, for other t's, the segments are different. So, the point C is on AB, and for all other t ≠ 1/2, the point C is not on the segment PQ(t). So, we need to find C on AB such that it is not on any PQ(t) for t ≠1/2.

Wait, but the problem states that C is the unique point on AB not belonging to any other segment from F except AB. So, C is on AB, and
