Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. And I need to find the greatest such N. Then, when I divide that N by 1000, Q is the quotient (which would be the thousands digit, right?), and R is the remainder (the last three digits). Then add Q and R together.

Alright, so let's break this down. Let me denote N as a four-digit number: let's say N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero since it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that if any one digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing B to 1 gives another number divisible by 7, same with C and D. So, all four possibilities where a single digit is changed to 1 must result in a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. So, we need the maximum N possible with this property.

Since we're looking for the greatest N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take a long time manually. Maybe we can find some constraints or patterns.

Let me think about what it means for a number to be divisible by 7. A number is divisible by 7 if, when you divide it by 7, the remainder is zero. But checking divisibility by 7 isn't straightforward like for 3 or 9. So, perhaps we can think about each of the four modified numbers (with one digit changed to 1) and analyze their properties modulo 7.

So, for each digit position, when we replace it with 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, mathematically, for each position i (i = 1,2,3,4), the number N_i (where digit i is replaced by 1) is congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me represent N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D. Then, each modified N_i would be:

- If we change A to 1: N1 = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D. So N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. And N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

- If we change B to 1: N2 = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D. So N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7.

- Similarly, changing C to 1: N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B +10 + D. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

- Changing D to 1: N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7. Thus, we can write four congruence equations:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps we can find expressions for each of these mod 7 and then set up equations.

First, let me compute the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 7*142=994. 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is obviously 1.

So, substituting these into the four equations.

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 → 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 → 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7 → 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod7

So, now we have four equations:

Equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7

Equation 2: 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7

Equation 3:6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, so we have four equations with variables A,B,C,D (each from 0-9, except A≠0). Our goal is to find the largest possible N=ABCD, so we should try to maximize A, then B, C, D.

Perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

Let me see if we can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7 → Equation1: D ≡1 -2B -3C mod7.

From equation 2:6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7.

But D from equation1 is 1 -2B -3C mod7. So substitute into equation2:

6A +3C + (1 -2B -3C) ≡5 mod7

Simplify: 6A +3C +1 -2B -3C ≡5 mod7 → 6A -2B +1 ≡5 mod7.

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, equation3:6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Again, D is 1 -2B -3C mod7, so:

6A +2B +1 -2B -3C ≡4 mod7 → 6A +1 -3C ≡4 mod7 → 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

So now, let's write the three equations we have after substitution:

From equation2 substitution:6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Equation2a:6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

From equation3 substitution:6A -3C ≡3 mod7 → Equation3a:6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

From equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 → Equation4.

So, now we have three equations:

Equation2a:6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Equation3a:6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Let me write this system:

1. 6A -2B =4 +7k (for some integer k)
2. 6A -3C =3 +7m (for some integer m)
3.6A +2B +3C =6 +7n (for some integer n)

But since A,B,C are digits (0-9, A >=1), we can think modulo7.

Alternatively, let's try to express variables in terms of A.

From Equation2a:6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let's solve for B.

6A -2B =4 mod7 → Let's multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod7 to solve for B.

The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides: (6A)*4 - 2B*4 ≡4*4 mod7 → 24A -8B ≡16 mod7.

Simplify:

24 mod7 is 3 (7*3=21; 24-21=3).

-8 mod7 is (-8 +14)=6.

16 mod7 is 2.

So, 3A +6B ≡2 mod7.

Wait, that seems more complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps express B from equation2a.

Equation2a:6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → 6A -4 ≡2B mod7.

Since 6A -4 ≡2B mod7, let's write 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Then, B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7, since inverse of 2 is 4.

So, B ≡ (6A -4)*4 mod7.

Compute (6A -4)*4: 24A -16.

24 mod7 is 3, 16 mod7 is 2.

So, 3A -2 ≡ B mod7.

So, B ≡3A -2 mod7.

But B is a digit between 0 and9, so B = (3A -2) mod7 +7*t, where t is integer such that B remains in 0-9.

Similarly, from Equation3a:6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Let me solve for C.

6A -3C ≡3 mod7 → Let's factor 3: 3*(2A -C) ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and7 are coprime, we can do that):

2A - C ≡1 mod7.

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7 → C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So, C = (2A -1) mod7 +7*s, where s is integer such that C is 0-9.

Similarly, from Equation4:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

But from equation2a and equation3a, we already expressed B and C in terms of A, so let's substitute.

We know that B ≡3A -2 mod7, and C≡2A -1 mod7.

So, substitute B and C into Equation4:

6A +2*(3A -2) +3*(2A -1) ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

6A +6A -4 +6A -3 ≡6 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6A +6A +6A) + (-4 -3) ≡6 mod7.

18A -7 ≡6 mod7.

18 mod7 is 4, since 7*2=14, 18-14=4.

-7 mod7 is 0.

So, 4A ≡6 mod7.

So, 4A ≡6 mod7.

We can solve for A.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, A ≡6*2 mod7 → A≡12 mod7 → A≡5 mod7.

Since A is a digit from1 to9, the possible values of A satisfying A≡5 mod7 are A=5 and A=12, but 12 is not a digit. So, A=5.

Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, but 5+7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So, A can only be 5 in this case.

So, A=5.

Now that we have A=5, let's find B and C.

From earlier, B ≡3A -2 mod7 → B≡3*5 -2 mod7 → B≡15-2=13 mod7 →
