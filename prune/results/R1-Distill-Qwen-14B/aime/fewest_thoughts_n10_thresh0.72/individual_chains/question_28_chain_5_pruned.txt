Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it (which is equidistant to all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant to all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I think the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I'll need to calculate both the volume and the surface area of ABCD.

But wait, how do I calculate the volume of a tetrahedron when I only know the edge lengths? I know that for a regular tetrahedron (where all edges are equal), there's a straightforward formula, but here the edges are not all equal. The given edge lengths are AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. So, opposite edges are equal.

Hmm, perhaps this tetrahedron is isohedral? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons might have some properties that make calculating volume easier.

Wait, maybe I can think of this tetrahedron as two congruent triangles connected in some way. Let me see: if I look at edges AB and CD both being √41, and AC and BD both being √80, and BC and AD both being √89, it seems like opposite edges are equal. So, if I pair the edges, each pair has the same length.

I recall that for such a tetrahedron, which is called a "disphenoid," the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (1/6) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )

Wait, no, maybe that's for a different kind of tetrahedron. Alternatively, I think the formula for the volume when opposite edges are equal can be derived using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Oh yeah, that sounds right.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

CM = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
       | 1  0   a²   b²   c² |
       | 1  a²  0    d²   e² |
       | 1  b²  d²   0    f² |
