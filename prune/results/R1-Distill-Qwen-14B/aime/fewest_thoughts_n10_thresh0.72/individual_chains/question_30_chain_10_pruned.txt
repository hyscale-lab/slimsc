Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, this looks like a problem involving roots of unity and maybe some properties of cyclotomic polynomials. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I recall that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1 and ω^k ≠ 1 for any 0 < k < 13. So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come into play later.

Now, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it's 13 terms multiplied together. Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this expression somehow. Let me consider each term as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, the quadratic is x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor that?

The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). So, that's equal to [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

But wait, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x¹³ - 1, because the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0 are exactly ω^k for k=0 to 12. But in this case, x is (1 + i) and (1 - i). So, substituting x = (1 + i), we get ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, for x = (1 - i), it's (1 - i)^13 - 1.

So, the overall product is [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. Now, I need to compute this.

First, compute (1 + i)^13. Remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i*13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 =
