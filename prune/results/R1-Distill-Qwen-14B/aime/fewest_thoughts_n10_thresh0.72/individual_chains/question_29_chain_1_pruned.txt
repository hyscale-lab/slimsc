Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, and points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given some side lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I'll try to visualize the problem. We have two rectangles. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So they lie on a straight line. Let me imagine that this line is the base for both rectangles or something like that. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Hmm, so these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. That must mean that ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given the sides: BC=16, which is the side of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is equal to AD, right? So AD should be 16 as well. Then, AB=107, so AB is the other side of the rectangle ABCD, which would make CD also 107. Similarly, FG=17, which is a side of rectangle EFGH, so FG is 17. EF is 184, which is the other side of EFGH, so GH is also 184.

Wait, but let me get the rectangle sides correct. In rectangle ABCD, BC is one side, so BC is 16. AB is the other side, so AB is 107. So ABCD has sides 107 and 16. Similarly, EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184, so the sides of EFGH are 17 and 184.

Now, trying to figure out how these rectangles are arranged. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps the rectangles are placed such that their sides are along this line. Maybe D and C are on one rectangle, and E and F are on the other rectangle, lying on this straight line.

Let me think about the cyclic quadrilateral ADHG. Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, ADHG must be a cyclic quadrilateral. So, in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Alternatively, the power of a point theorem might come into play here.

Let me label the points more clearly. ABCD is a rectangle, so let's define it as follows:

- A is top-left,
- B is top-right,
- C is bottom-right,
- D is bottom-left.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me assume E is top-left, F is top-right, G is bottom-right, H is bottom-left.

Wait, but the problem says that E, D, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are from
