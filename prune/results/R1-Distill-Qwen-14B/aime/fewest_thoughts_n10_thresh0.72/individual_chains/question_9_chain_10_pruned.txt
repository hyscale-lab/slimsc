Alright, so I've got this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step. I remember some logarithm rules, but I might need to write them down to keep track.

First, let's write down the equations given. 

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a^k) equals k * log_b(a), so applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Let me write that down:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So:

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I notice that both equations involve log_x(y) and log_y(x). I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to make things easier. Let's say log_y(x) = k. Then, log_x(y) = 1/k.

So, substituting into Equation 1: x * (1/k) = 10. So, x = 10k.

And substituting into Equation 2: 4y * k = 10. So, 4yk = 10. Simplifying, y = 10/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

Now, I have expressions for both x and y in terms of k: x = 10k and y = 5/(2k).

But wait, I also know that log_y(x) = k. Let's write that out using the variables we have.

log_y(x) = k, which in terms of logarithms, means that y^k = x. Substituting the expressions for x and y:

(5/(2k))^k = 10k.

Hmm, okay. So now we have an equation in terms of k: (5/(2k))^k = 10k.

This looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/k might help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe taking logarithms on both sides?

Let's take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln[(5/(2k))^k] = ln(10k).

Using the logarithm power rule, the left side becomes k * ln(5/(2k)).

So, k * ln(5/(2k)) = ln(10k).

Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately. Let me see. Maybe I can express this as:

k * [ln(5) - ln(2k)] = ln(10) + ln(k).

Expanding the left side:

k * ln(5) - k * ln(2k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Wait, let's distribute the k inside the ln(2k): that's ln(2) + ln(k). So,

k * ln(5) - k*(ln(2) + ln(k)) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Simplify the left side:

k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k) = ln(10) + ln(k).

Let me collect like terms:

k(ln(5) - ln(2)) - k ln(k) - ln(k) - ln(10) = 0.

Hmm,
