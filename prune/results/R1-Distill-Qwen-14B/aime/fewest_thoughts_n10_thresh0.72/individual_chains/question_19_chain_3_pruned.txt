Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I, with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13 and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB times AC. Hmm, that's the product of two sides of the triangle. 

Alright, let me jot down what I know. First, the circumradius R is 13, so that's given. The inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So IA ⊥ OI. 

I remember that in a triangle, the inradius and the circumradius relate to various other elements like the area, semiperimeter, and side lengths. Maybe I can recall some formulas. The formula for the inradius is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius: A = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the side lengths. 

Wait, but I have to find AB times AC, which would be side c times side b if I label the triangle with sides opposite to angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So maybe I can find bc. 

Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI must relate to some properties or equations involving the inradius, circumradius, and perhaps the sides. I'm not exactly sure how, but maybe I can find a relation using coordinates or vectors. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the inradius and circumradius with the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I think there's a formula for the distance OI: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check: yes, I remember that OI² = R² - 2Rr. So plugging in the given values: OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). 

So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in the triangle formed by points I, A, and O, triangle IAO is a right triangle at A. Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem, IA² + AO² = IO². 

Wait, no
