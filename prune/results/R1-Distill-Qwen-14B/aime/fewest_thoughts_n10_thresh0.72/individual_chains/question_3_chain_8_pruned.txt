Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before diving into calculations. Let me read it again:

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Four numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are two of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.

Alright, so the problem is about conditional probability. We need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize. That is, P(Grand Prize | Prize).

First, let me break down the given information.

- Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from 1 to 10.
- Four numbers are randomly selected from S.
- She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen four.
- She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen four.

So, the prize can be won in two cases:
1. Exactly two of her numbers are in the randomly chosen four.
2. Exactly three of her numbers are in the randomly chosen four.
3. All four of her numbers are in the randomly chosen four.

Wait, the problem says "at least two", so that includes exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. So, these are the scenarios where she wins a prize. But the grand prize is only when all four match.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is equal to the probability of having exactly four matching numbers divided by the probability of having at least two matching numbers.

So, mathematically, P = (Number of favorable outcomes for grand prize) / (Number of favorable outcomes for prize).

But more accurately, since we're dealing with probabilities, it's:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize)

Where:
- P(Grand Prize) is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen.
- P(Prize) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, since all lotteries are equally likely, we can think in terms of combinations.

Let me structure this step by step.

First, let's compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4), which is 210.

Jen picks 4 specific numbers. Let's denote her chosen numbers as J, which is a set of size 4.

The random selection is another set R of size 4.

We need to compute:

1. The number of possible sets R where R intersects J in exactly 4 elements (i.e., R = J). This is the grand prize case.

2. The number of possible sets R where R intersects J in at least 2 elements (i.e., 2, 3, or 4 elements). This is the prize case.

Once we have these two quantities, we can compute the conditional probability as (number of grand prize cases) divided by (number of prize cases).

Let me compute each part.

First, the number of possible R that result in the grand prize: This is exactly 1, since R must be exactly equal to J.

So, the number of grand prize outcomes is 1.

Next, the number of prize cases. This is the number of R such that |R ∩ J| ≥ 2. That is, R shares 2, 3, or 4 numbers with J.

We can compute this by summing the number of ways R can share exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers with J.

Let me compute each of these.

1. Exactly 4 numbers: As above, only 1 way.

2. Exactly 3 numbers: We need to choose 3 numbers from J and 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and J has 4, so the rest is 6). The number of such R is C(4,3) * C(6,1).

Similarly, for exactly 2 numbers: C(4,2) * C(6,2).

For exactly 1 number: C(4,1)*C(6,3), but we don't need this since we're considering at least 2.

So, the total number of prize cases is:

C(4,4) * C(6,0) + C(4,3) * C(6,1) + C(4,2) * C(6,2) + C(4,1)*C(6,3) + C(4,0)*C(6,4)

But since we are only considering cases where |R ∩ J| ≥ 2, we can exclude the last two terms (exactly 1 and exactly 0). So, the prize cases are:

C(4,4)*C(6,0) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,2)*C(6,2)

Let me compute each term.

C(4,4) is 1, and C(6,0) is 1, so first term is 1*1=1.

C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6, so second term is 4*6=24.

C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15, so third term is 6*15=90.

So, total prize cases: 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Wait, let me verify that.

1 + 24 is 25, 25 + 90 is 115. Yes.

But wait, the total number of possible R is 210. So, the number of prize cases is 115, as computed.

But
