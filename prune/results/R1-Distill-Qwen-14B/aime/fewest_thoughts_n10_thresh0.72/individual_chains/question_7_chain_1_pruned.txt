Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation that turns all blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, each vertex has 2 choices, making the total number of possible colorings 2^8 = 256. That’s straightforward.

Now, the main part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's a rotation which maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. Let me rephrase that: we need a rotation such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, in other words, after rotation, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the original red vertices.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of group theory or symmetries. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, so 8 possible rotations in total.

For each coloring, we need to check if there exists a rotation (other than the identity, perhaps?) such that when we apply that rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were red in the original coloring.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the orbits. Each vertex can be mapped to any other vertex via some rotation. But since the octagon is regular, all vertices are in a single orbit under rotation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a given coloring, what does it mean that there's a rotation mapping blue vertices to red positions? Let's denote the original coloring as C. After some rotation R, the blue vertices in C become the red vertices in C. So, the set of blue vertices in C is mapped, via R, to the set of red vertices in
