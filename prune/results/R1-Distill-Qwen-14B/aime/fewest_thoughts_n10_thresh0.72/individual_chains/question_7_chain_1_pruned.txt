Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the octagon has eight vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many of these colorings allow for a rotation that maps all blue vertices to where red vertices were. So, if I imagine the octagon, it can be rotated in steps of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45). Each rotation corresponds to shifting the vertices by a certain number of positions. For example, a rotation of 45 degrees would move each vertex to the next position, effectively shifting the entire octagon.

Let me think about what it means for a rotation to map blue vertices to where red ones were. Suppose after coloring, the blue vertices are exactly in the positions that were originally red before any rotation. Wait, noâ€”actually, the problem is about being able to rotate the octagon so that the blue vertices end up where the red ones were. So, it's not about the original positions being red, but rather, after rotation, each blue vertex is in a position that was red in the original coloring.

Wait, maybe another way to look at it: the set of blue vertices should be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices align with red positions, that means the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

But wait, no. The octagon is fixed, but we can rotate it. So, the colors are fixed on the octagon's vertices. When we rotate the octagon, the colors move with the vertices. So, if after rotation, every blue vertex is where a red vertex was, that implies that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of permutations. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, the coloring after rotation must be such that the blue vertices (in the rotated octagon) are exactly the red vertices in the original. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices should be a cyclic shift of the set of red
