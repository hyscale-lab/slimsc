Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance, independently. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon which maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, this means that after rotation, every blue vertex must land on a red vertex, and every red vertex must land on a blue or red vertex? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because we are just ensuring that the blue ones end up where reds were. So, perhaps the rotated octagon's blue vertices must align with the original reds.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it this way: suppose we have a coloring C. We want to see if there's a rotation R such that when we apply R to C, all the blue vertices in C become red in R(C). So, R(C) must have all the blues from C now over the original red positions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that after rotation, all the blue vertices in the new position were originally red. So, the rotated octagon's blue vertices must coincide with the original red vertices.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a permutation. Each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. So, the problem is asking for colorings C such that there exists a rotation permutation π where π applied to C results in all the blue vertices in C being mapped to vertices that were originally red.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way: that after rotating, the blue vertices are now on the positions where the original coloring had red. So, if C is the original coloring, and π is a rotation, then π(C) has all blue vertices in positions where C had red. So, π(C)_i = blue implies C_{π^{-1}(i)} = red.

Alternatively, maybe it's that the set of blue vertices in C is equal to the set of red vertices in π(C). Hmm, not sure. I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that the rotated coloring has all the blue vertices now at positions where the original had red. So, if in the original, vertex 1 was red, and after rotation, the blue vertex is now at vertex 1, then that's a success.

So, maybe the rotation π must satisfy that all blue vertices in C are mapped via π to red vertices in C. So, for all i, if C_i is blue, then C_{π(i)} must be red. Wait, no, that's not exactly it.

Wait, the problem states: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after the rotation, each blue vertex is now on a position that was originally red. So, the set of blue vertices in the rotated octagon must be a subset of the original red vertices. So, if the original coloring has red vertices R and blue vertices B, then after rotation by π, the blue vertices π(B) must be a subset of R.

But actually, because it's a rotation, it's a permutation, so π is a bijection. So, π(B) must be a subset of R, but since π is a permutation, π(B) has the same size as B. So, π(B) must equal R, because R and B are complements (since each vertex is either red or blue). Because if π(B) is a subset of R, and they are the same size, then π(B) = R. So, π maps B to R and R to B. Hmm, but that would mean that the number of blue and red vertices must be equal. Because π(B) = R, so |B| = |R|. So, only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices can satisfy this condition, because otherwise, you can't have a permutation mapping B to R when |B| ≠ |R|.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, if the number of blue and red vertices is not equal, then it's impossible to have such a permutation. Because a permutation must preserve the size of the sets. So, the only colorings that can satisfy this condition are those with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. So, the first step is to realize that only colorings with 4 blue and 4 red can possibly satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the total number of colorings to consider is C(8,4) = 70. Because each coloring with exactly 4 blue and 4 red is a candidate, and colorings with other numbers of blues are impossible.

So, the probability would be (number of valid colorings with 4 blue and 4 red) / 256. But actually, since the problem is about all colorings, the ones with less than 4 or more than 4 blue vertices can't satisfy the condition, so the probability is (number of valid colorings with 4 blue and 4 red) / 256.

Wait, but 70/256 is the number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red. But within those 70, how many satisfy that there's a rotation mapping blue to red?

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of 4-colorings (with 4 blue and 4 red) such that there exists a rotation that maps blue to red.

But wait, can we think of this in terms of group theory or Burnside's lemma? Maybe using the concept of group actions.

The octagon's rotation group has 8 elements: rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, corresponding to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ...,7 positions.

We can model the problem as finding the number of colorings where the coloring is fixed (up to rotation) in such a way that the blue set is mapped to the red set under some rotation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For a given coloring with 4 blue and 4 red, does there exist a rotation π such that π(B) = R, where B is the set of blue vertices and R is the set of red vertices.

Since R is the complement of B, so π(B) = R implies that π(B) is the complement of B. So, π(B) = B^c.

Which would mean that π is an involution on the set B, but more accurately, it's a permutation such that π(B) = B^c. So, for each element b in B, π(b) is in B^c, and for each element r in R, π^{-1}(r) is in B.

But since π is a rotation, it must be a cyclic permutation, so the only possible π's are the rotations by k positions, where k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

So, for each coloring, we need to check if any of these rotations maps B to R.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the complement: the rotation must send each blue vertex to a red vertex and each red vertex to a blue vertex. So, π swaps the colors. So, π is a color-inverting permutation.

Wait, that's interesting. So, if a rotation π has the property that π(B) = R, then π is a permutation such that applying it to the coloring swaps all the colors. So, if the coloring is symmetric under such a rotation, then it satisfies the condition.

But wait, not exactly symmetric. Because the rotation itself doesn't have to leave the coloring invariant, but rather map the blue set to the red set. Which is similar to being symmetric under that rotation, but perhaps with a color inversion.

So, perhaps the colorings we are looking for are those that are symmetric under a rotation by some k positions, but with the colors inverted. So, for a rotation π, if π(B) = R, then π is a rotation that inverts the colors.

But I might be overcomplicating it. Let's think in terms of necklace colorings. The problem is similar to counting binary necklaces with certain symmetries.

Wait, let me try a different approach. For each rotation π, count the number of colorings fixed by π such that π(B) = R. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, since we need π(B) = R, which is the same as saying that π is a permutation such that π(B) = B^c. So, for a given π, how many colorings B are there such that π(B) = B^c.

But perhaps it's better to fix a rotation π and count the number of colorings B where π(B) = B^c. Since the octagon has 8 rotations, we can use Burnside's lemma or similar counting techniques.

Wait, but Burnside's lemma counts the number of colorings fixed by each group element, but here we have a different condition.

Wait, maybe an orbit-stabilizer theorem approach would help. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider that for a given rotation π, the condition π(B) = B^c is that B is a fixed point under the permutation π composed with the color inversion. Because if you rotate by π and then invert colors, you get the original coloring.

Wait, that might be a useful way to think about it. So, if we define an operation that rotates by π and then inverts the colors, then applying this operation twice would bring us back to the original coloring. So, such a coloring would have a period of 2 under this operation.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible rotations. The octagon can be rotated by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 positions. For each possible rotation π (excluding the identity, since the identity would require that B = R, which is only possible if B is empty or the entire set, but since we're considering 4 blue and 4 red, the identity rotation would require that B = R, which is only possible if B is exactly half the set, which is 4, so for the identity, the condition would be satisfied only if B is equal to R, which is only possible if B is exactly half the set, which is our case. Wait, no, for the identity rotation, π(B) = B. So, for the identity, to have π(B) = R, which would require that B = R, which is only possible if B is equal to R, meaning that all vertices are both red and blue, which is impossible. So, the identity rotation cannot satisfy π(B) = R unless B is empty or the entire set, but since we have 4 blues and 4 reds, identity can't be a solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think for each rotation π, how many colorings B satisfy π(B) = R.

So, for a given π, how many B such that π(B) = R. Since R is the complement of B, this would mean that π(B) = B^c. So, applying π to B gives the complement of B.

So, for a given π, how many subsets B of size 4 satisfy π(B) = B^c.

This is a system of equations. Each element i in B must satisfy π(i) not in B, and each element j not in B must satisfy π^{-1}(j) in B.

So, in other words, for each i, if i is in B, then π(i) is not in B, and if i is not in B, then π^{-1}(i) is in B.

This is equivalent to B being a subset such that π(B) = B^c.

So, for a given permutation π, the number of such subsets B is either 0 or 1, depending on whether such a subset exists.

Wait, is that true? Let me see. Suppose π is a permutation with certain cycle structure. Then, for each cycle in π, the subset B must either contain exactly one element from each cycle, but under the condition that π(B) = B^c.

Wait, let me think of cycles. For a permutation π, the orbits under π are cycles. For each cycle, the subset B must intersect each cycle in a certain way.

If π has a cycle of length k, then for the condition π(B) = B^c, the subset B must satisfy that in each cycle, the elements are alternately in B and not in B. But since the cycles are of various lengths, this might impose constraints.

Wait, perhaps for each cycle, the number of elements of B in the cycle must be equal to half the length of the cycle, rounded up or down. But since each cycle is a closed loop, to have π(B) = B^c, the size of B in each cycle must be such that when you apply π, you get the complement.

Wait, for a cycle of length k, if B contains m elements of the cycle, then π(B) would contain m elements (shifting each by one). But since π(B) must equal B^c, which would require that m = k - m, so m = k/2. Therefore, for each cycle, the number of elements in B must be exactly half the length of the cycle.

But since the length k must be even for m to be integer. So, if any cycle in π has odd length, then there are no such subsets B.

Therefore, for a permutation π, the number of subsets B with π(B) = B^c is 0 unless all cycles of π have even length, in which case it's 1, because you can choose exactly half the elements from each cycle.

Wait, for example, if π is a single 8-cycle, then each cycle has length 8, which is even. So, for this π, you can choose exactly 4 elements from the cycle such that π(B) = B^c. But how many such subsets B are there?

Wait, in an 8-cycle, to choose B such that π(B) = B^c, you need to select every other element in the cycle. So, in an 8-cycle, there are exactly two such subsets: one where you pick elements 0,2,4,6 and the other where you pick 1,3,5,7. Wait, no, actually, in an 8-cycle, there are two possible subsets that satisfy π(B) = B^c: the even positions and the odd positions.

Wait, let's see: if the cycle is (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7), then B could be {0,2,4,6}, and then applying π (rotation by 1) would give {1,3,5,7}, which is the complement of B. Similarly, B could be {1,3,5,7}, and applying π would give {2,4,6,0}, which is the complement. So, for the 8-cycle, there are exactly two subsets B that satisfy π(B) = B^c.

Similarly, if π is the identity permutation, which has 8 cycles of length 1, then for each cycle (each single vertex), the condition π(B) = B^c would require that each vertex is in B and not in B at the same time, which is impossible. So, no solutions for π being the identity.

If π is a rotation by 2 positions, then the permutation consists of cycles. Let's see: rotation by 2 in an octagon would decompose into cycles of length gcd(8,2)=2. So, there are 4 cycles, each of length 2: (0 2)(1 3)(4 6)(5 7). For each cycle of length 2, we need to choose exactly 1 element from each cycle to be in B.

But since each cycle is length 2, we can choose 1 element from each cycle, which gives us 2^4 = 16 possible subsets B. But wait, the condition is that π(B) = B^c. Let's see: for a cycle (a b), choosing a in B implies that π(a) = b must not be in B, which is satisfied. Similarly, if a is not in B, then π^{-1}(b) = a must be in B. So, for each cycle, you must choose exactly one element. So, the number of such subsets B is 2^4 = 16, since each cycle contributes a factor of 2.

But wait, in this case, π(B) would be the complement of B, because for each cycle, if you pick a, then π(a)=b is not picked, and vice versa. So, the total number of such subsets is 16. However, our problem requires that |B|=4. But in this case, each subset B constructed in this way would have exactly 4 elements (since there are 4 cycles, each contributing 1 element). So, the number of subsets B is 16, each with size 4, satisfying π(B)=B^c.

Wait, but in this case, π is rotation by 2, which is equivalent to rotation by 2 positions. So, for this π, there are 16 subsets B where π(B)=B^c, each with size 4.

Wait, but that seems a lot. So, for each rotation, we need to compute the number of subsets B with |B|=4 such that π(B)=B^c.

So, let's generalize. For a given rotation π, which is a cyclic shift by k positions, we can decompose π into cycles. The number of cycles is gcd(8,k). Each cycle has length 8/gcd(8,k). For a subset B to satisfy π(B)=B^c, each cycle must have exactly half of its elements in B. So, the length of each cycle must be even, otherwise, it's impossible.

So, for a given k, if 8/gcd(8,k) is even, then each cycle has even length, and we can have subsets B where exactly half the elements in each cycle are chosen. Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, for example:

- k=0: identity. Each cycle is length 1. Since 1 is odd, no solutions.

- k=1: rotation by 1. The cycle decomposition is a single 8-cycle. 8 is even, so each cycle can contribute 4 elements. The number of such subsets is 2, as discussed earlier.

- k=2: rotation by 2. The cycles are 4 cycles of length 2. Each cycle contributes 1 element. So, the number of subsets is 2^4=16.

- k=3: rotation by 3. The cycle decomposition is a single 8-cycle (since gcd(8,3)=1). So, similar to k=1, the number of subsets is 2.

- k=4: rotation by 4. The cycles are 2 cycles of length 4 (since gcd(8,4)=4, so 8/4=2 cycles, each of length 4). Each cycle contributes 2 elements. The number of subsets is (number of ways to choose 2 elements from each cycle such that they form a π-invariant subset with π(B)=B^c).

Wait, for each 4-cycle, how many subsets B satisfy π(B) = B^c. Let's take a 4-cycle (0 1 2 3). To satisfy π(B) = B^c, we need that if 0 is in B, then 1 is not, 2 is in B, 3 is not, etc. So, for a 4-cycle, the only possible subsets B are those where it alternates between in and out. So, two possible subsets per 4-cycle: {0,2} and {1,3}.

So, for each 4-cycle, 2 choices. Since there are two 4-cycles (for k=4), the total number of subsets is 2*2=4.

So, for k=4, the number of subsets is 4.

Similarly, for k=5: rotation by 5. Since gcd(8,5)=1, it's a single 8-cycle, so number of subsets B is 2.

k=6: rotation by 6. This is equivalent to rotation by -2, which is similar to rotation by 2. So, the cycle decomposition is 4 cycles of length 2. So, number of subsets is 16.

k=7: rotation by 7, which is equivalent to rotation by -1. So, a single 8-cycle, number of subsets is 2.

So, summarizing:

- For k=0: 0 subsets.

- k=1: 2 subsets.

- k=2: 16 subsets.

- k=3: 2 subsets.

- k=4: 4 subsets.

- k=5: 2 subsets.

- k=6: 16 subsets.

- k=7: 2 subsets.

Now, for each rotation, the number of subsets B with |B|=4 and π(B) = B^c is as above. But wait, in our problem, we need colorings where there exists at least one rotation π such that π(B) = B^c.

So, the total number of such colorings is the union over all rotations of the subsets B that are fixed by that rotation. However, we must account for overlaps, i.e., colorings that are fixed by multiple rotations.

This is where inclusion-exclusion comes into play. But inclusion-exclusion can be complicated because the number of terms grows quickly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Burnside's lemma, which counts the number of orbits under the group action. But Burnside's lemma counts the number of colorings fixed by each group element, but in our case, the condition is slightly different.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, in our problem, a coloring is valid if there exists at least one rotation π such that π(B) = B^c. So, the number of valid colorings is equal to the number of colorings that are fixed by at least one non-identity rotation, but with a twist because the fixed condition is π(B) = B^c, not π(B) = B.

So, perhaps it's better to model this as the union over all π of the sets F(π), where F(π) is the set of colorings fixed by π, i.e., colorings where π(B) = B^c.

So, the total number of valid colorings is |∪_{π ≠ e} F(π)|.

But to compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion:

|∪ F(π)| = Σ|F(π)| - Σ|F(π) ∩ F(σ)| + Σ|F(π) ∩ F(σ) ∩ F(τ)| - ... 

Where the sums are over all distinct rotations π, σ, τ, etc.

But this seems complicated because the group is non-abelian, and intersections of F(π) and F(σ) depend on the relation between π and σ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of colorings where there exists a rotation π such that π(B) = B^c, by counting for each rotation π, the number of colorings fixed by π, then subtracting overlaps.

But perhaps let me first compute the total number of such colorings by considering all possible π.

Wait, but each coloring can be fixed by multiple πs, so we need to be careful not to overcount.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation π (with π ≠ e), under the condition π(B)=B^c.

Wait, but perhaps using Möbius inversion or something else.

Alternatively, note that a coloring that is fixed by multiple rotations will have symmetries under those rotations. So, perhaps the total number is equal to the sum over each rotation π of |F(π)|, divided by the size of the group... Hmm, no, that's Burnside's lemma, but that counts the number of orbits, which is not exactly our case.

Wait, another approach: for each possible rotation π, the number of colorings where π(B) = B^c is |F(π)|. So, the total number of colorings that are fixed by at least one rotation π (with π ≠ e) is the union of all F(π) for π ≠ e.

But computing the size of this union requires inclusion-exclusion, which can be complex.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total number of colorings where such a rotation exists, by considering that the coloring must be symmetric in some way under a rotation (but not necessarily all).

Wait, perhaps we can model this problem as the number of colorings with at least one rotational symmetry of order 2, but with color inversion.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the possible rotational symmetries:

- Rotations by 1,3,5,7 positions: these have order 8. So, if a coloring is fixed by a rotation of 1 position, then it must be monochromatic, which is impossible since we have 4 red and 4 blue. So, actually, no colorings with 4 red and 4 blue are fixed by a rotation of 1 position.

Wait, but earlier when considering k=1, we found that there are 2 colorings fixed by rotation k=1 under the condition π(B) = B^c. But those colorings are not fixed by π, but rather satisfy π(B) = B^c.

So, perhaps the fixed colorings under π are different.

Wait, perhaps I got confused earlier. Let's clarify.

When we say a coloring is fixed by a rotation π, we mean π(C) = C. But in our problem, we are looking for colorings where π(C) = C^c (the complement). So, it's a different condition.

So, for each rotation π, the number of colorings where π(C) = C^c is |F(π)|.

Which, as we calculated earlier, for each π, |F(π)| is:

- For π being rotation by 1,3,5,7: 2 colorings each.

- For π being rotation by 2,6: 16 colorings each.

- For π being rotation by 4: 4 colorings.

- For π being identity: 0 colorings (since |B|=4≠0 or 8).

Wait, so the total number of colorings across all π is:

For identity: 0.

For π=rot1, rot3, rot5, rot7: 2 each, so 4 rotations × 2 = 8.

For π=rot2, rot6: 16 each, so 2 rotations × 16 =32.

For π=rot4: 4.

So, total across all π is 8 +32 +4 =44.

But each coloring can be counted multiple times if it satisfies π(B) = B^c for multiple πs.

So, to find the total number of unique colorings where at least one π satisfies π(B) = B^c, we can't just add them up because of overlaps.

So, let's think of it as an inclusion-exclusion problem.

First, the union over all π≠e of F(π) is the set we need.

The size is:

Σ|F(π)| - Σ|F(π) ∩ F(σ)| + Σ|F(π) ∩ F(σ) ∩ F(τ)| - ... 

So, we need to compute the sizes of intersections of F(π) and F(σ), etc.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find the number of colorings fixed by multiple rotations.

First, let's compute |F(π)| for each π:

- For π=rot1: |F(π)|=2.

- For π=rot2: |F(π)|=16.

- For π=rot3: |F(π)|=2.

- For π=rot4: |F(π)|=4.

- For π=rot5: |F(π)|=2.

- For π=rot6: |F(π)|=16.

- For π=rot7: |F(π)|=2.

Now, the first term in inclusion-exclusion is Σ|F(π)| = 2+16+2+4+2+16+2= 44.

Now, the second term is Σ|F(π) ∩ F(σ)| for all π < σ.

We need to compute the number of colorings that are in both F(π) and F(σ), i.e., colorings where both π(B)=B^c and σ(B)=B^c.

This depends on the relationship between π and σ.

So, let's consider pairs of rotations (π, σ) and compute |F(π) ∩ F(σ)|.

First, note that if π and σ generate a larger group, the intersection F(π) ∩ F(σ) would correspond to colorings fixed by the group generated by π and σ.

But this is getting complicated, so perhaps we can find the number of colorings that are fixed by both π and σ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that a coloring that is fixed by both π and σ must be fixed by the subgroup generated by π and σ.

So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings fixed by the subgroup generated by π and σ.

But this requires analyzing the structure of the subgroup generated by each pair (π, σ).

This could take a while, but perhaps let's try a few cases.

Case 1: π and σ are rotations by 1 and 2 positions.

The subgroup generated by rot1 and rot2 is the entire rotation group, since rot1 and rot2 generate all rotations. So, the only coloring fixed by all rotations would be the ones fixed under all rotations, which are the colorings where all vertices are the same color, but since we have 4 red and 4 blue, there are no such colorings. So, |F(rot1) ∩ F(rot2)|=0.

Case 2: π=rot1, σ=rot3.

What is the subgroup generated by rot1 and rot3? Since 1 and 3 are coprime with 8, their combination can generate all rotations. So again, the only fixed colorings are monochromatic, which we don't have, so |F(rot1) ∩ F(rot3)|=0.

Case 3: π=rot2, σ=rot4.

What's the subgroup generated by rot2 and rot4?

Well, rot2 generates rotations by 0,2,4,6 positions. rot4 is rotation by 4, which is the same as rotation by -4 (since 4=8-4). So, the subgroup generated by rot2 and rot4 is the same as the subgroup generated by rot2, which is {0,2,4,6}. So, the colorings fixed by both rot2 and rot4 are the same as the colorings fixed by rot2. But wait, no: F(rot2) is the set of colorings where rot2(B)=B^c, and F(rot4) is the set where rot4(B)=B^c. The intersection would be colorings where both rot2(B)=B^c and rot4(B)=B^c.

So, we need to find colorings B where both conditions hold.

What's the relationship between rot2 and rot4? Well, applying rot2 twice gives rot4. So, if a coloring is fixed under rot4, then it must satisfy rot4(B)=B^c. Similarly, applying rot2 twice gives rot4, so if we have rot2(B)=B^c, then rot4(B)=rot2(rot2(B))=rot2(B^c)= (rot2(B))^c= (B^c)^c = B. Wait, so if a coloring is in F(rot2), then applying rot2 twice gives rot4(B)=B. But we also have that in F(rot4), rot4(B)=B^c. So, combining these, we have B = B^c, which implies that B is equal to its complement. Which is only possible if B is empty or the entire set, which is impossible since |B|=4. Therefore, |F(rot2) ∩ F(rot4)|=0.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-examine.

If a coloring is in F(rot2), then rot2(B) = B^c.

Similarly, if it's in F(rot4), then rot4(B)=B^c.

But since rot4 = rot2^2, so applying rot2 twice gives rot4.

So, starting from B, rot2(B)=B^c.

Then, rot2(rot2(B))=rot2(B^c)=(rot2(B))^c=(B^c)^c=B.

So, rot4(B)=B.

But if the coloring is in F(rot4), then rot4(B)=B^c.

So, combining these two, we have B = B^c, which implies that B is equal to its complement, which is only possible if B is empty or the entire set, but since |B|=4, which is neither, this is impossible. Therefore, the intersection F(rot2) ∩ F(rot4) is empty.

So, |F(rot2) ∩ F(rot4)|=0.

Similarly, perhaps other intersections are empty.

Wait, let's think of another case: π=rot2 and σ=rot6.

But rot6 is equivalent to rot2^{-1}, since 6 = 8-2. So, perhaps similar to before.

If a coloring is in F(rot2) and F(rot6), then it must satisfy both rot2(B)=B^c and rot6(B)=B^c.

But since rot6 is the inverse of rot2, which is the same as rot2^7. So, applying rot2^7(B)=B^c.

But this is similar to the previous case.

Wait, let me apply the same logic.

If rot2(B)=B^c, then applying rot2 again gives rot4(B)=B.

But if also rot6(B)=B^c, which is equivalent to rot2^{-1}(B)=B^c.

But since rot2^{-1} is the same as rot7, which is rotation by 1 position in the opposite direction.

So, if we have both rot2(B)=B^c and rot7(B)=B^c, then what?

Well, applying rot2(B)=B^c, then rot7(rot2(B))=rot7(B^c).

But I think this is getting too tangled. Perhaps it's better to assume that most intersections are empty.

Wait, let's consider another case: π=rot2 and σ=rot4.

Wait, we did that, and found that the intersection is empty.

Another case: π=rot2 and σ=rot3.

What is the subgroup generated by rot2 and rot3? Since 2 and 3 are coprime with 8, their combination can generate the entire rotation group. So, the intersection F(rot2) ∩ F(rot3) would be colorings fixed by all rotations, which again is only possible if all vertices are the same color, which is impossible for |B|=4. So, |F(rot2) ∩ F(rot3)|=0.

Similarly, for other pairs, if the subgroup generated by π and σ is the entire group, then the intersection is empty.

So, perhaps the only non-empty intersections are when π and σ are rotations by 2 and 6 (which are inverses), but even then, as we saw, the intersection is empty.

Wait, perhaps the only non-empty intersection is when π and σ are the same rotation, but since we're considering pairs, we have to subtract all pairwise intersections, which may be zero.

Hmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternative approach: The number of colorings where there exists a rotation π such that π(B)=B^c is equal to the number of colorings that are fixed by some π (with the condition π(B)=B^c). Since each such coloring can be fixed by at most one non-identity rotation, except for colorings with more symmetry.

Wait, but actually, a coloring could be fixed by multiple rotations. For example, a coloring that's fixed by rotation by 2 positions might also be fixed by rotation by 4 positions if it has additional symmetry.

But earlier, we saw that if a coloring is fixed by both rotation by 2 and rotation by 4, then it must satisfy B=B^c, which is impossible. So, perhaps no colorings are fixed by multiple non-identity rotations.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Let me think of a specific example.

Suppose B is the set {0,2,4,6}. Then, applying rotation by 2 positions (rot2) gives {2,4,6,0}, which is the same as B, so B is fixed by rot2. But also, applying rotation by 4 positions (rot4) gives {4,6,0,2}, which is also B. So, B is fixed by both rot2 and rot4.

Wait, but in our problem, we have π(B)=B^c, not π(B)=B. So, for such a coloring, if π=rot2, then π(B)=B^c would require that {2,4,6,0}=B^c. But since B is {0,2,4,6}, B^c is {1,3,5,7}, which is not equal to {2,4,6,0}, unless B is arranged differently.

Wait, no. Let's take B = {0,2,4,6}. Then, applying rot2, which shifts each element by 2 positions, gives {2,4,6,0}, which is the same as B. So, π(B)=B, not B^c. So, this coloring is fixed by rot2, not satisfying π(B)=B^c.

But if we have B={0,1,2,3}, then applying rot4 would give {4,5,6,7}, which is B^c if B is {0,1,2,3}. So, in this case, rot4(B)=B^c. So, this coloring is in F(rot4).

But is this coloring also in F(rot8)? Well, rotation by 8 is the identity, which isn't allowed. So, other than that, does this coloring satisfy any other π(B)=B^c?

What about rotation by 2 positions: applying rot2 to B={0,1,2,3} gives {2,3,4,5}, which is not equal to B^c={4,5,6,7}. So, no. Similarly, for other rotations.

So, in this case, the coloring is only fixed by rot4.

Wait, so perhaps each coloring is fixed by at most one non-identity rotation. If that's the case, then the inclusion-exclusion principle would simplify, because the intersections F(π) ∩ F(σ) would be empty for π≠σ.

Is that true? Let's check.

Suppose there exists a coloring B that is fixed by two different rotations π and σ (other than the identity). Then, B must satisfy π(B)=B^c and σ(B)=B^c.

Which would imply that π(B)=σ(B). So, (πσ^{-1})(B)=B.

So, the coloring is fixed by πσ^{-1}.

But if π and σ are different, then πσ^{-1} is a non-identity rotation. So, unless B is fixed by some non-identity rotation, which would require that B is symmetric under that rotation.

But earlier, we saw that for a rotation π, the only colorings fixed by π are those where π(B)=B^c, which may not necessarily imply that B is fixed by any other rotation.

Alternatively, let's consider a specific example.

Suppose B is fixed by both rot2 and rot4. Then, applying rot2 gives B^c, and applying rot4 also gives B^c.

But as we saw earlier, applying rot2 twice gives rot4, so applying rot2 twice would give B again. So, if rot2(B)=B^c, then rot4(B)=rot2(rot2(B))=rot2(B^c)= (rot2(B))^c= (B^c)^c= B. So, if B is fixed by rot4, then rot4(B)=B^c, which would require that B = B^c, which is impossible unless B is empty or the entire set.

Therefore, the only colorings fixed by both rot2 and rot4 are those where B is empty or full, which are not in our case since we have 4 blues and 4 reds.

Therefore, it's impossible for a coloring with |B|=4 to be fixed by two different rotations π and σ, unless the two rotations are inverses? Wait, no. As in the previous example, it's impossible because it would require B to be equal to its complement, which is impossible.

Therefore, for our problem, each coloring is fixed by at most one rotation π≠e. Therefore, the intersection of F(π) and F(σ) is empty for π≠σ. So, in inclusion-exclusion, all the second, third, etc., terms are zero. Therefore, the total number of colorings is simply the sum of |F(π)| for each π≠e, without any overlaps.

So, the total number is 44, as computed earlier.

But wait, let's double-check this conclusion. If each coloring is fixed by at most one non-identity rotation, then when we sum |F(π)| for all π≠e, we are counting each coloring exactly once. Therefore, the total number is indeed 44.

But wait, earlier when we considered F(rot2), we had 16 colorings. But when we considered F(rot4), we had 4 colorings. Are any of these 4 colorings also in F(rot2)?

If a coloring is in both F(rot2) and F(rot4), then it must satisfy both rot2(B)=B^c and rot4(B)=B^c. But as we saw, this would require B= B^c, which is impossible. So, F(rot2) ∩ F(rot4)= empty set.

Similarly, for other pairs, the intersection is empty.

So, our conclusion that the total number of colorings is 44 is correct.

Therefore, the number of colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices that satisfy the condition is 44.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, 44 is the number of colorings across all rotations. But each coloring is counted once for each rotation that fixes it. But if each coloring is fixed by exactly one rotation, then the total number is indeed 44, but divided by the number of rotations that fix it. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, each coloring is fixed by exactly one rotation, so when we sum |F(π)| over all π≠e, each coloring is counted once for each π that fixes it. But if each coloring is fixed by exactly one π, then the total sum is equal to the number of valid colorings. So, 44 is the total number.

Wait, that can't be, because for k=2, we had 16 colorings, and for k=4, 4 colorings, and others adding up to 20. 16+4=20, plus the 2s adding up to 8, total 28? Wait, no, earlier I had:

For π=rot1,3,5,7: 2 each, 4 rotations ×2=8.

For π=rot2,6: 16 each, 2 rotations ×16=32.

For π=rot4:4.

Total:8+32+4=44.

Yes, 44.

But wait, the total number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red is C(8,4)=70. So, 44 of these 70 colorings satisfy that there exists a rotation π with π(B)=B^c.

Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 44.

So, the probability is 44 / 256.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 11/64.

So, the probability is 11/64.

Thus, m=11, n=64, and m +n=75.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, 44/256 simplifies to 11/64, yes.

But wait, earlier I concluded that the number of colorings is 44, but is that correct?

Wait, another way to think about it: for each rotation π, the number of colorings fixed by π is |F(π)|. But if each coloring is fixed by exactly one rotation, then the total number of colorings is indeed the sum of |F(π)| over all π≠e.

But in our case, the sum is 44, which is less than 70, which seems correct because not all colorings are symmetric.

Wait, but 44 seems a bit high. Let me see: for the identity, we have 70 colorings. For each non-identity rotation, we have certain colorings fixed. But if each coloring is counted once, then the total is 70. But our count via group rotations says 44, which is less than 70. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, no, the colorings in F(π) are colorings where π(B)=B^c. So, it's not the same as colorings fixed by π. So, perhaps the count is accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating |F(π)|. Let me check for π=rot2.

For rotation by 2 positions, which decomposes into 4 cycles of length 2: (0 2)(1 3)(4 6)(5 7). For each cycle, we choose exactly one element to be in B. So, for each cycle, 2 choices, and 4 cycles, so 2^4=16 subsets. Each such subset has exactly 4 elements, so |B|=4. So, that's correct.

Similarly, for π=rot4, which decomposes into 2 cycles of length 4: (0 2 4 6)(1 3 5 7). For each 4-cycle, we can choose 2 elements such that applying rot4 swaps them with their complement. For a 4-cycle, the subsets that satisfy rot4(B)=B^c are those where B contains exactly two elements, each opposite each other.

Wait, actually, for a 4-cycle, the subsets B such that rot4(B)=B^c must satisfy that if element i is in B, then element i+2 is not in B. So, for each 4-cycle, there are two possible subsets: choosing elements 0 and 2, or 1 and 3. Wait, no, in a 4-cycle, to have rot4(B)=B^c, the subset must be such that applying rot4 to each element in B gives an element not in B.

So, for a 4-cycle (0 2 4 6), if we choose 0 and 2 in B, then rot4(0)=4, which is not in B, and rot4(2)=6, which is not in B. Similarly, if we choose 1 and 3 in another 4-cycle, same thing.

Wait, no, for a single 4-cycle, the number of subsets B where rot4(B)=B^c is 2: choosing 0 and 2, or 1 and 3.

Wait, but the 4-cycle has four elements, so choosing two elements such that they are not adjacent under rotation. So, in a 4-cycle, the possible subsets are {0,2} and {1,3}. So, two choices per 4-cycle.

Since there are two 4-cycles (for rotation by 4), the total number of subsets is 2*2=4, which matches our earlier calculation.

So, for π=rot4, |F(π)|=4, which is correct.

Similarly, for π=rot1, which is a single 8-cycle, the number of subsets B where rot1(B)=B^c is 2: the even and odd positions.

So, that's correct.

So, my calculations for |F(π)| are correct.

Therefore, the total number of colorings is indeed 44.

But wait, 44 is the total number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red that satisfy the condition. So, the probability is 44/256=11/64.

But wait, let me think again. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8=256. The number of colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red is C(8,4)=70. So, the probability is 44/256=11/64≈0.171875.

But 11/64 is the probability among all colorings. But wait, the colorings with 4 blue and 4 red are 70, so another way to compute the probability is (44/70) among these colorings. But no, the problem asks for the probability among all colorings (including those with any number of blue and red vertices).

Wait, no, actually, no. The problem says: "the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices."

So, the colorings with less than 4 or more than 4 blue vertices cannot satisfy the condition, as discussed earlier. Because you can't have a permutation mapping B to R unless |B|=|R|.

So, the total number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 44, and the total number of possible colorings is 256. So, the probability is 44/256=11/64.

Therefore, the answer is m + n =11 +64=75.


The problem involves a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where the original red vertices were, expressed as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$, and then determine $m + n$.

### Key Steps:

1. **Total Colorings**: There are $2^8 = 256$ possible colorings of the octagon.

2. **Equal Blue and Red Vertices**: For a rotation to map all blue vertices to red positions, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal. Thus, we consider colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices, of which there are $\binom{8}{4} = 70$.

3. **Valid Colorings**: We need to count colorings where there exists a rotation $\pi$ such that $\pi(B) = R$, where $B$ is the set of blue vertices and $R$ is the set of red vertices. This requires analyzing the rotational symmetries of the octagon.

4. **Rotational Symmetries**: The octagon has rotational symmetries corresponding to rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which are 8 in total. For each rotation, we calculate the number of colorings that satisfy $\pi(B) = B^c$ (the complement of $B$).

5. **Counting Fixed Colorings**:
   - **Identity Rotation (0°)**: No valid colorings since it would require $B = B^c$, which is impossible for $|B| = 4$.
   - **Rotations by 1, 3, 5, 7 positions**: Each contributes 2 valid colorings.
   - **Rotations by 2, 6 positions**: Each contributes 16 valid colorings.
   - **Rotation by 4 positions**: Contributes 4 valid colorings.

6. **Total Valid Colorings**: Summing contributions from all rotations gives $44$ valid colorings.

7. **Probability**: The probability is $\frac{44}{256} = \frac{11}{64}$.

8. **Final Result**: $m = 11$, $n = 64$, so $m + n = 75$.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{75}
