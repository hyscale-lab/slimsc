Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

We have three points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere up the y-axis. Hmm, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's somewhere between (0,1) and (0,0.5), closer to (0,1).

Then, we're given a family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment PQ, P is somewhere on the x-axis, say at (p, 0), and Q is on the y-axis at (0, q), and the distance between P and Q is 1.

Wait, but since it's a unit length segment, the distance between P and Q must be 1. So, the distance formula between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, for each PQ in F, p and q satisfy that equation.

So, F consists of all such segments where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ is of unit length. So, each such segment is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1, and p, q > 0 because we're in the first quadrant.

Next, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, point C is on AB, but it's not A or B. And for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on that segment. So, AB is in F as well, right? Because AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if that's of unit length.

Compute the distance between A and B: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ). That's sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F.

So, since AB is in F, point C is on AB, and it's distinct from A and B. But for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is the only point on AB that is also on another PQ from F? Or, no, it's the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ from F except AB itself.

Wait, the wording is: "that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB." So, C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F (so other than AB), C is not on PQ.

So, C is a point on AB that is not covered by any other segment in F except AB itself. So, C is unique in that sense.

We need to find OCÂ², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. And then express it as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, and find p + q.

So, steps to solve:

1. Find parametric equations for AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), AB is a line segment connecting these two points. So, the line AB can be parameterized.

2. For any point C on AB, find the equation of the segment PQ in F that passes through C, if any. But since C is unique such that no other PQ in F passes through it, except AB itself, so it's the point where the only PQ in F that contains C is AB.

So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Maybe we need to find the envelope of the family F and see where AB is tangent to it. Then, C would be the point of tangency.

Hmm, envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. But in our case, the family F is segments, which are straight lines. So, perhaps the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F at one point.

Wait, but each PQ is a straight line segment, which is a straight line. So, the envelope might be a curve
