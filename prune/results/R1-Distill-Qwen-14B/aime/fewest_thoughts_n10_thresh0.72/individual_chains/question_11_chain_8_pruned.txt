Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem is: Find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). I need to find the maximum real part of this expression.

Hmm, okay. So \( z \) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 centered at the origin in the complex plane. The expression involves both \( z \) and its reciprocal \( 1/z \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( |1/z| = 1/4 \), so \( 1/z \) lies on a circle of radius 1/4.

First, maybe I should express \( z \) in a convenient form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, I can write \( z = 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). Either way, expressing \( z \) using polar form might make things easier because it directly relates to the magnitude and angle.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression:

First term: \( (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i) e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, multiply \( (75 + 117i) \) by 4:

\( 75 \times 4 = 300 \), \( 117 \times 4 = 468 \). So that term becomes \( 300 + 468i \).

So the expression is now:

\( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, let me express \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) in terms of cosine and sine:

\( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \),
\( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, substituting these back into the expression, we have:

First term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i - 468\sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
= \( 24\cos\theta + (36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta)i + 36\sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Now, adding the two terms together:

Real parts:
From first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
From second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Total real part: \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts:
From first term: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)
From second term: \( 36\cos\theta - 24\sin\theta \)
Total imaginary part: \( (300\sin\theta - 24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, the imaginary parts don't matter for this problem. So, the real part is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

So, our goal is to maximize \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Wait, that looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as a single sine or cosine function with some amplitude and phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is the amplitude, which is \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

Hmm, but here we have \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Let me write it as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), but in this case, \( A = 324 \), \( B = -432 \). The maximum value would be \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

So, let's compute that.

First, compute \( A^2 \): 324 squared. Hmm, 324 is 18^2, so (18^2)^2 = 18^4? Wait, no, that's not right. 324^2 is (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, +576 is 104976.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 324 * 324: I think it's better to compute 324 * 300 = 97200, 324 * 24 = 7776, so total 97200 + 7776 = 104,976. Yep, that seems correct.

Then, \( B^2 \): (-432)^2 = 432^2. Let's compute that. 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, \( A^2 + B^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \). So the square root of 291,600 is sqrt(291600). Let me see: 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So 540^2 = (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291600) is 540.

So the maximum value of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Because the general form is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta -
