Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting; so those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Alright, let me visualize this. I imagine two rectangles placed in such a way that one side of each rectangle is along the same line, which is where D, E, C, F lie. So, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is one side, BC is another. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so EF and FG are sides.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Wait, but AB is 107, BC is 16. So, ABCD must be a rectangle with length 107 and height 16. Similarly, EFGH has length 184 and height 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think that the points D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent corners of rectangle EFGH. So, the line DC is a side of ABCD, and EF is a side of EFGH.

Wait, but if D and E are on the same line as C and F, maybe the rectangles are placed such that one side of each rectangle is on the same line. Hmm.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. That must mean that the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, or that the power of a point holds, or maybe we can use some circle theorems here.

Hmm. Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. ABCD is a rectangle, so points are A, B, C, D in order. EFGH is another rectangle, so points E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that suggests that the line might be DC, which is a side of ABCD, and EF, which is a side of EFGH.

Wait, but in the problem statement, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D and C are two points on ABCD, and E and F are two points on EFGH. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. So, maybe the line is like D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F or some order. Not sure yet.

I think perhaps the line is arranged as D-E-C-F, meaning that E is between D and C, and F is
