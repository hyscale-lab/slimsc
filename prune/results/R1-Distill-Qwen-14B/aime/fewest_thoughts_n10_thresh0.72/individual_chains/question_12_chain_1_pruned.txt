Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, the sum is 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the sum is 99. The example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

Which works because 0 + 991 = 991, which is not 999, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again. The example says that 8 + 991 equals 999. Hmm, how? Oh, wait, maybe the top row is a two-digit number and the bottom row is a three-digit number? Or perhaps each row is read as a number.

Wait, the grid is 2x3, so each row has 3 cells. So when reading left to right, each row forms a three-digit number. So the first row is a three-digit number, and the second row is another three-digit number. Their sum is 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column has two digits, forming a two-digit number. So there are three columns, each contributing a two-digit number, and their sum is 99.

So the grid looks like this:

a b c
d e f

Each letter is a digit. Then, the two numbers formed by reading left to right are abc and def, and their sum is 999. The three numbers formed by reading top to bottom are ad, be, cf, and their sum is 99.

So, the equations are:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Wait, no, let me clarify. When reading top to bottom for each column, each column is a two-digit number. So the first column is ad, which is 10a + d. The second column is be, which is 10b + e. The third column is cf, which is 10c + f
