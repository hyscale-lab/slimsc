Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and the incenter I is perpendicular to the circumcenter O. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. That seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make this easier.

Let's set up a coordinate system where O is at the origin (0,0). Since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices A, B, and C will lie on the circumference of the circle with radius 13. So, their coordinates will satisfy the equation x² + y² = 13² = 169.

Now, the incenter I has coordinates (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector from I to A must be perpendicular to the vector from O to I. Let me denote point A as (a, b). Then vector IA is (a - x, b - y), and vector OI is (x, y). The dot product of these two vectors should be zero because they're perpendicular.

So, the dot product is (a - x)x + (b - y)y = 0. Expanding this, we get ax - x² + by - y² = 0. But since A is on the circumcircle, a² + b² = 169. Hmm, maybe I can express ax + by in terms of other variables.

Wait, another thought: since I is the incenter, I can relate its coordinates to the sides of the triangle. In coordinate geometry, the inradius is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula for the inradius is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

Given that r = 6, and R = 13. Maybe I can find some relationship between R, r, and the sides of the triangle. I remember there's a formula that connects R, r, and the distance between O and I. The formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry says that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

Plugging in the values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). That's the distance between O and I.

Wait, but in my coordinate system, O is at (0,0), so the distance from O to I is just sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(13). So, x² + y² = 13. Interesting, so the inradius center is at a point where x² + y² = 13.

But I also know that the inradius is 6. How does that tie in? The inradius is the distance from I to each side of the triangle. Also, the area of the triangle can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. The area can also be expressed using the formula (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides.

Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Wait, no, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, and c is AB. So, AB is c, AC is b, and BC is a.

Wait, the problem asks for AB * AC, which would be c * b.

So, I need to find b * c.

Let me see what other formulas I can use. The area is r*s = 6s, and it's also equal to (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(52), since R =13.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c = 312 s.

Hmm, but I don't know s yet. Maybe I can find s in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates of I and A. Since I is (x, y) and O is (0,0), the distance between them is sqrt(13). So, x² + y² =13.

Also, since IA is perpendicular to OI, as we had earlier, (a - x)x + (b - y)y =0.

Which simplifies to ax + by = x² + y².

But x² + y² =13, so ax + by =13.

Wait, also, since point A is (a, b), it lies on the circumcircle, so a² + b² = 169.

So, we have two equations:

1. a² + b² = 169
2. a x + b y =13

Hmm, but I have more variables than equations here. Maybe I can find expressions for x and y in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, in coordinate geometry, the incenter coordinates can be expressed in terms of the sides. The formula is:

I = ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a + b + c), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y)/(a + b + c) )

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since I is at (x, y), and O is at (0,0), the vector OI is (x, y), and IA is (a - x, b - y). Their dot product is zero:

(a - x)x + (b - y)y =0 → ax + by = x² + y² =13.

So, ax + by =13.

But also, since A lies on the circumcircle, a² + b² =169.

Hmm, so we have two equations:

ax + by =13

a² + b² =169

Is there a way to relate x and y to the sides?

Wait, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. The distance from point I to side BC is 6, and similarly for the other sides.

But in coordinate terms, the formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c =0 is |ax0 + by0 +c| / sqrt(a² + b²). However, without knowing the equations of the sides, this might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities. Let's denote the angles at A, B, C as α, β, γ respectively. Then, the coordinates of A can be expressed in terms of angles.

Wait, if I consider the circumradius as 13, then the coordinates of A can be written as (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ), where θ is the angle corresponding to point A in the circumcircle.

But then, I is at (x, y), and from earlier, x² + y² =13. So, I is inside the circumcircle, at a distance sqrt(13) from O.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector methods or coordinate geometry with some substitutions.

Wait, another idea: since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumcenter, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles or sides based on this orthogonality condition.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in any triangle, the distance between inradius and circumradius is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). We already did that earlier and found OI = sqrt(13). Let me recall if there are other relationships involving R, r, and sides.

I also remember that in a triangle, the product AB * AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, using the formula for the area:

Area = (1/2)*AB*AC*sin(angle at A).

But I don't know the angle at A yet. Hmm.

Wait, let's denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.

The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

The area is r*s =6s, and also (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c = 312 s.

Hmm, but I need to find b*c. Maybe I can express a in terms of b and c, or find another equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the coordinates of I in terms of the sides. Let's think about that.

In coordinate geometry, the inradius is at ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / (a + b + c), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y ) / (a + b + c) ). But without knowing all the coordinates, this might not help directly.

Wait, but I can consider that point I is inside the triangle, and since O is the circumcenter, which is also inside (assuming the triangle is acute). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe use trigonometric identities involving the inradius and circumradius.

I remember that in any triangle,

r = 4R sin(A/2) sin(B/2) sin(C/2)

Also, another formula: r = (a + b - c)/2 * tan(C/2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the formula that relates R, r, and the distance OI.

We have OI² = R² - 2Rr

Wait, no, Euler's formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, OI² =13*(13 -12)=13, which is consistent with our earlier calculation.

So, OI = sqrt(13). So, in our coordinate system, I is at (x, y) with x² + y² =13.

And IA is perpendicular to OI, so (a - x)x + (b - y)y =0 → ax + by = x² + y² =13.

So, from point A (a, b), we have a² + b² =169 and ax + by =13.

Hmm, maybe we can think of this as the projection of vector OA onto vector OI equals 13.

Wait, OA is the vector from O to A, which has magnitude 13. The projection of OA onto OI is (OA · OI)/|OI| = (ax + by)/sqrt(13). But we know ax + by =13, so the projection is 13/sqrt(13) = sqrt(13).

Which is equal to |OI|, since OI is sqrt(13). So, the projection is equal to the length of OI.

Hmm, that seems interesting. So, the projection of OA onto OI is equal to OI itself. That would mean that OA makes an angle θ with OI such that cosθ = (OI)/|OA| = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13).

So, the angle between OA and OI is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).

Wait, maybe I can use this angle to find some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a and b in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's express point A in terms of angles. Let me consider that point A is at (13 cos θ, 13 sin θ). Then, since I is at (x, y), and ax + by =13.

So, substituting a =13 cos θ, b =13 sin θ, we have:

13 cos θ * x + 13 sin θ * y =13 → cos θ * x + sin θ * y =1.

Also, x² + y² =13.

This seems like a system of equations:

cos θ * x + sin θ * y =1

x² + y² =13

Hmm, maybe I can square the first equation:

(cos θ x + sin θ y)^2 =1 → cos²θ x² + 2 cosθ sinθ xy + sin²θ y² =1

But x² + y² =13, so let's rewrite the equation:

cos²θ (x²) + sin²θ (y²) + 2 cosθ sinθ xy =1

But since x² + y² =13, perhaps express this as:

cos²θ (x² + y²) - sin²θ (y²) + 2 cosθ sinθ xy =1 + 12 sin²θ

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me use the fact that x² + y² =13. Let me express the first equation as:

x cos θ + y sin θ =1

Let me denote this as equation (1).

Let me also denote equation (2) as x² + y² =13.

I can use equation (1) to express, say, x in terms of y or vice versa, and substitute into equation (2).

From equation (1):

x = (1 - y sin θ)/cos θ

Plugging into equation (2):

[(1 - y sin θ)/cos θ]^2 + y^2 =13

Expanding:

(1 - 2 y sin θ + y² sin²θ)/cos²θ + y² =13

Multiply through by cos²θ:

1 - 2 y sin θ + y² sin²θ + y² cos²θ =13 cos²θ

Simplify the y² terms:

y² (sin²θ + cos²θ) = y²

So, equation becomes:

1 - 2 y sin θ + y² =13 cos²θ

But sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so 13 cos²θ =13(1 - sin²θ) =13 -13 sin²θ.

So, substituting:

1 - 2 y sin θ + y² =13 -13 sin²θ

Bring all terms to left:

y² - 2 y sin θ +1 -13 +13 sin²θ =0 → y² -2 y sin θ -12 +13 sin²θ=0

Hmm, this is a quadratic in y. Let me write it as:

y² - 2 sinθ y + (13 sin²θ -12) =0

I can solve for y using quadratic formula:

y = [2 sinθ ± sqrt(4 sin²θ -4*(1)*(13 sin²θ -12))]/2

Simplify discriminant:

sqrt(4 sin²θ -4*(13 sin²θ -12)) = sqrt(4 sin²θ -52 sin²θ +48) = sqrt(-48 sin²θ +48)

Factor out 48:

sqrt(48(1 - sin²θ)) = sqrt(48 cos²θ) = sqrt(48)|cosθ| = 4*sqrt(3)|cosθ|

So, y = [2 sinθ ± 4 sqrt(3) cosθ ] /2 = sinθ ± 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

So, y = sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ or y = sinθ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

Hmm, that's interesting. Since I is the inradius, its coordinates must be inside the triangle, so y must be positive if the triangle is above the x-axis. So, perhaps we take the positive solution.

Wait, but without knowing θ, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this as:

y = sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

Let me write this as y = 2 sqrt(3) cosθ + sinθ

Hmm, that resembles a sinusoidal function. Maybe we can write it as R cos(θ - φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Compute R: sqrt( (2 sqrt(3))^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(12 +1)=sqrt(13)

So, y = sqrt(13) cos(θ - φ), where tan φ = (1)/(2 sqrt(3)) → φ = arctan(1/(2 sqrt(3))) = 30 degrees, since tan(30)=1/sqrt(3), but 1/(2 sqrt(3)) is half that. Wait, no, 1/(2 sqrt(3)) is approximately 0.288, which is tan(16.1 degrees). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can square both sides of the equation for y.

Wait, let me think differently. Since y = sinθ ± 2 sqrt(3) cosθ, and from equation (1), x = (1 - y sinθ)/cosθ.

So, let's plug y into this expression.

Case 1: y = sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

Then,

x = [1 - (sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ) sinθ ] / cosθ
= [1 - sin²θ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ ] / cosθ
= [cos²θ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ ] / cosθ
= cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ

Similarly, for case 2: y = sinθ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

x = [1 - (sinθ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ) sinθ ] / cosθ
= [1 - sin²θ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ ] / cosθ
= [cos²θ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ ] / cosθ
= cosθ + 2 sqrt(3) sinθ

So, we have two possibilities:

1. x = cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ, y = sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

2. x = cosθ + 2 sqrt(3) sinθ, y = sinθ - 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

Hmm, perhaps I can compute x² + y² for each case and see if it equals 13.

Let's compute for case 1:

x = cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ

y = sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ

x² + y² = (cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ)^2 + (sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ)^2

Expanding:

= cos²θ -4 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ + 12 sin²θ + sin²θ +4 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ +12 cos²θ

Simplify:

cos²θ +12 cos²θ =13 cos²θ

-4 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ +4 sqrt(3) cosθ sinθ = 0

12 sin²θ + sin²θ=13 sin²θ

So, x² + y²=13 cos²θ +13 sin²θ=13(cos²θ + sin²θ)=13*1=13.

Which matches equation (2). Similarly, case 2 would give the same result.

So, both cases are valid.

But how does this help me? I need to relate this to the triangle's sides.

Wait, point I is the incenter, so it's located at (x, y). The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.

But perhaps I can find the distance from I to side BC, which is 6. Since I is at (x,y), and BC is opposite to A.

But without knowing the equation of BC, it's hard to compute the distance.

Wait, another approach: in triangle ABC, the coordinates of the incenter are given by ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x )/(a + b + c), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y )/(a + b + c) )

But in our coordinate system, O is at (0,0), and A is at (13 cosθ,13 sinθ). But I don't know where B and C are. So, maybe this is not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in triangle ABC, the distance from I to O is sqrt(13), which we already have.

Wait, maybe I can use trigonometric identities involving the sides. Let's recall that in a triangle,

a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A

Similarly, b =26 sin B, c =26 sin C.

So, sides are proportional to the sines of opposite angles. Also, since the triangle has semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and area is r*s =6s.

We also have the formula for area in terms of R: area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c = 312 s.

But a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, a*b*c =26^3 sin A sin B sin C.

So, 26^3 sin A sin B sin C =312 s → sin A sin B sin C = (312 s)/(26^3) = (312 s)/(17576)= (312/17576) s ≈ 0.01775 s.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can find expressions for the angles. Since OI is sqrt(13) and IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relationship between angle A and the position of I.

Wait, earlier, we found that the projection of OA onto OI is equal to OI. So, the projection length is sqrt(13), which is equal to |OI|.

The projection of OA onto OI is |OA| cosφ, where φ is the angle between OA and OI.

So, |OA| cosφ = |OI| → 13 cosφ = sqrt(13) → cosφ = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13).

So, the angle between OA and OI is arccos(1/sqrt(13)).

Hmm, but how does that relate to the triangle's angles?

Wait, maybe using vector analysis.

Vector OA is (13 cosθ,13 sinθ). Vector OI is (x,y).

Their dot product is 13x cosθ +13 y sinθ = |OA||OI| cosφ =13*sqrt(13)*cosφ.

But from earlier, we have ax + by =13, where a=13 cosθ, b=13 sinθ.

So, (13 cosθ)x + (13 sinθ)y =13 → cosθ x + sinθ y =1.

But from the dot product, 13x cosθ +13 y sinθ =13*(cosθ x + sinθ y)=13*1=13.

Which equals |OA||OI| cosφ =13*sqrt(13)*cosφ.

So, 13=13*sqrt(13)*cosφ → cosφ=1/sqrt(13), which is consistent with what we had.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, another idea: in triangle ABC, the distance from the inradius to the circumradius is sqrt(13), and we have IA perpendicular to OI.

Perhaps there's a formula that relates the product of two sides with these elements.

Wait, maybe using the formula for the length of IA.

The formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite the vertex.

So, IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

Given that IA is the distance from I to A, which in our coordinate system is sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (b - y)^2 ).

But we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI, which we used earlier.

Wait, but we don't know the length of IA, though. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find IA using the formula sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So, IA = sqrt(6² + (s - a)^2).

But without knowing s and a, this might not help directly.

Wait, but from the coordinate system, IA is sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (b - y)^2 ). But from earlier, we have (a -x)x + (b - y)y =0.

Also, since point A is (a, b), and I is (x,y), the vector IA is (a -x, b - y), which is perpendicular to OI=(x,y).

So, the length of IA can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA, since IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OA² = OI² + IA².

So, OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13), so IA² = OA² - OI² =169 -13=156 → IA= sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39).

So, IA=2 sqrt(39).

But from the formula, IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So,

sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2 )=2 sqrt(39)

Squaring both sides:

r² + (s - a)^2 =4*39=156

Given r=6, so:

36 + (s -a)^2 =156 → (s -a)^2=120 → s -a= sqrt(120)=2 sqrt(30) or s -a= -2 sqrt(30). But since s is semiperimeter and a is a side, s > a, so s -a is positive. So, s -a=2 sqrt(30).

So, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).

Hmm, that's an equation involving the semiperimeter and side a.

But we also have other relations. The area is r*s=6s and also (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c=312 s.

We have s= a + 2 sqrt(30).

So, a*b*c=312 (a + 2 sqrt(30)).

Hmm, but I don't know expressions for b and c yet.

Alternatively, maybe express b and c in terms of angles.

We have b=26 sin B and c=26 sin C.

Also, in triangle ABC, angles sum to π radians: A + B + C = π.

So, maybe I can express B and C in terms of A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: using the formula that relates the distance between incenter and circumradius.

We have OI² = R² - 2 R r cos A, but wait, no, that's not a standard formula. Let me check.

Wait, actually, the formula I recall is OI² = R² - 2 R r, which is Euler's formula. So, that's correct. But in our case, OI²=13=13*(13 -12)=13*1=13, which is correct.

But perhaps there's another formula involving the angle at A.

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle ABC.

Wait, let's recall that in any triangle, the distance between the inradius and circumradius can also be expressed in terms of angles.

Wait, another formula: OI² = R² - 2 R r.

Which we have already used.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector analysis. Since OI is perpendicular to IA, which we've already used.

Wait, maybe I can relate the sides to the coordinates.

Wait, earlier, we expressed point I as (x, y) = (cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ, sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ ) or the other case.

But without knowing θ, it's difficult. However, perhaps I can express the sides in terms of θ.

Wait, since A is at (13 cosθ,13 sinθ), and I is at (x,y), which is (cosθ - 2 sqrt(3) sinθ, sinθ + 2 sqrt(3) cosθ), for case 1.

So, the inradius is at (x,y). Then, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.

Hmm, perhaps I can find the equation of side BC and then compute the distance from I to BC, which should be 6.

But to find the equation of BC, I need to know coordinates of B and C, which I don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in barycentric coordinates, the incenter has coordinates proportional to the sides.

Wait, but I don't know the sides yet.

Hmm, maybe I can express the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter, and also in terms of sides.

We have area =6s and also area = (a*b*c)/(4*13)= (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 → a*b*c=312 s.

But I have s =a +2 sqrt(30).

So, a*b*c =312 (a +2 sqrt(30)).

But I don't know b and c yet.

Wait, another idea: using the formula that relates the product of two sides with the area and the sine of the included angle.

So, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But area is also 6s, so 6s = (1/2) b c sin A → b c sin A =12 s.

But from earlier, a =26 sin A, so sin A = a/(26).

So, substituting: b c (a /26 )=12 s → (a b c ) /26 =12 s → a b c = 312 s.

Which is consistent with what we had earlier.

Hmm, not new information.

Wait, maybe I can find another equation involving a, b, c.

We know that in any triangle, the semiperimeter s = (a +b +c)/2.

We have s =a +2 sqrt(30).

So, (a +b +c)/2 = a +2 sqrt(30) → a +b +c =2a +4 sqrt(30) → b +c =a +4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, that's an equation involving b and c.

We also have a*b*c=312 s=312 (a +2 sqrt(30)).

But I still need more equations.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines.

In triangle ABC, cos A = (b² +c² -a²)/(2bc).

But I don't know cos A yet.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, in our coordinate system, IA is perpendicular to OI, so (a -x)x + (b -y)y=0.

But earlier, we found that this gives ax + by =13.

But a=13 cosθ, b=13 sinθ, so:

13 cosθ x +13 sinθ y=13 → cosθ x + sinθ y=1.

But x and y are coordinates of I, which is the inradius. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can express x and y in terms of the sides.

In barycentric coordinates, the incenter has coordinates proportional to the lengths of the sides. So, in barycentric coordinates, I is (a : b : c).

But in cartesian coordinates, this would translate to:

x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x )/(a + b + c )

Similarly for y.

But without knowing the coordinates of B and C, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can express this in terms of vectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the inradius is located at a specific position relative to the circumradius.

Wait, another idea: let's use the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter with the sides.

The formula is OI² = R² - 2 R r - (a² + b² +c²)/2 + (ab + bc + ca)/2.

Wait, not sure. Let me check.

Wait, no, perhaps another formula: OI² = R² - 2 R r.

Which is what we used earlier, giving OI²=13.

Hmm, perhaps I can find a relationship involving a² + b² +c².

Wait, another formula: a² + b² +c² = 2(s² - r² -4 R r )

Wait, no, not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that in any triangle,

a² + b² +c² = 2 (b c cos A + a c cos B + a b cos C )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that in any triangle,

a = 2 R sin A

Similarly,

b = 2 R sin B,

c =2 R sin C.

So, a =26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

Then, s = (a +b +c)/2 =13 (sin A + sin B + sin C )

So, s =13 (sin A + sin B + sin C )

Also, from earlier, s =a +2 sqrt(30) =26 sin A +2 sqrt(30).

So,

13 (sin A + sin B + sin C )=26 sin A +2 sqrt(30 )

Divide both sides by13:

sin A + sin B + sin C = 2 sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13

→ sin B + sin C = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in any triangle,

sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 )

But since A + B + C=π, then B + C= π - A.

So, sin B + sin C= 2 sin( (π - A)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 )

= 2 sin( π/2 - A/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 )

= 2 cos(A/2) cos( (B - C)/2 )

So, from earlier,

2 cos(A/2) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Hmm, but I don't know about (B - C)/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to other expressions.

Wait, another idea: since I have expressions for sides in terms of angles, maybe I can also express s in terms of angles.

s= (a +b +c)/2=13 (sin A + sin B + sin C )

Also, from earlier, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=26 sin A +2 sqrt(30 )

So,

13 (sin A + sin B + sin C ) =26 sin A +2 sqrt(30 )

Divide both sides by13:

sin A + sin B + sin C =2 sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13

→ sin B + sin C = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13

Hmm, not making progress.

Wait, perhaps using the area in terms of sine:

Area= (1/2) b c sin A=6s.

We have b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So, (1/2)(26 sin B)(26 sin C) sin A=6s.

Simplify:

(1/2)(676 sin B sin C sin A )=6s →338 sin A sin B sin C =6s.

But s=13 (sin A + sin B + sin C )=13 [ sin A + sin B + sin C ]

So,

338 sin A sin B sin C =6 *13 [ sin A + sin B + sin C ]=78 [ sin A + sin B + sin C ]

So,

sin A sin B sin C = (78 /338 ) [ sin A + sin B + sin C ] ≈0.229 [ sin A + sin B + sin C ]

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the fact that in a triangle,

sin A + sin B + sin C = (a +b +c)/(2 R)= (2 s )/(2 R )=s/R.

Given R=13, s/R= s/13.

So, sin A + sin B + sin C =s/13.

But from earlier, s= a +2 sqrt(30)=26 sin A +2 sqrt(30)

So,

sin A + sin B + sin C= (26 sin A +2 sqrt(30))/13= 2 sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Which is consistent with what we had before.

Hmm, but again, not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can consider that in triangle ABC, the length of IA is 2 sqrt(39), as we found earlier.

So, IA=2 sqrt(39).

But IA can also be expressed as sqrt(r² + (s -a)^2 )=sqrt(36 + (s -a)^2 )=sqrt(36 +120 )=sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39 ), which checks out.

So, that doesn't give new info.

Wait, but perhaps using the formula for the distance from I to A:

IA² = r² + (s -a)^2.

But I also know that in triangle ABC, the length of IA is related to the sides and angles.

Wait, another formula: IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)).

So, IA= r / sin(A/2).

Given IA=2 sqrt(39), and r=6,

So,

2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2 ) → sin(A/2)=6/(2 sqrt(39 ))=3/sqrt(39 )=sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, let me compute that.

So,

sin(A/2)=3/sqrt(39 )= (3 sqrt(39 )) /39= sqrt(39)/13.

Because 3/sqrt(39)= (3 sqrt(39))/39= sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.

From here, I can find cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (39/169))=sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.

Now, from trigonometric identities,

sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2 )=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13 )=2 sqrt(39*130)/169.

Compute 39*130=5070.

So, sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*507)=sqrt(10*3*169)=sqrt(10*3*13²)=13 sqrt(30).

So, sqrt(5070)=13 sqrt(30).

Thus,

sin A=2*(13 sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169= (2 sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, angle A has sine 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, from here, a=2 R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13 )=4 sqrt(30).

So, side a=4 sqrt(30).

Wait, that's a breakthrough.

So, a=4 sqrt(30).

Earlier, we had s= a +2 sqrt(30 )=4 sqrt(30 ) +2 sqrt(30 )=6 sqrt(30 ).

So, semiperimeter s=6 sqrt(30 ).

Thus, from s=(a +b +c)/2, we have a +b +c=12 sqrt(30 ).

But a=4 sqrt(30 ), so b +c=8 sqrt(30 ).

Also, from earlier, a*b*c=312 s=312 *6 sqrt(30 )=1872 sqrt(30 ).

But a=4 sqrt(30 ), so b*c= (1872 sqrt(30 )) / (4 sqrt(30 ))=1872/4=468.

So, b*c=468.

But the problem asks for AB * AC, which are sides c and b respectively.

Wait, in standard notation, AB is opposite to C, which is denoted as c, and AC is opposite to B, denoted as b.

So, AB * AC= c * b=468.

So, the answer is 468.

Wait, let me double-check.

We found that a=4 sqrt(30 ), so BC=4 sqrt(30 ).

We had s=6 sqrt(30 ), so semiperimeter is 6 sqrt(30 ).

Then, a +b +c=12 sqrt(30 ), so b +c=8 sqrt(30 ).

We also had a*b*c=312 s=312*6 sqrt(30 )=1872 sqrt(30 ).

Since a=4 sqrt(30 ), then b*c=1872 sqrt(30 )/(4 sqrt(30 ))=1872/4=468.

Yes, that's correct.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Using Euler's formula, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find \( IA = \sqrt{OA^2 - OI^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - (\sqrt{13})^2} = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39} \).

The length of \( IA \) can also be expressed as \( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \), where \( s \) is the semiperimeter and \( a \) is the side opposite vertex \( A \). Setting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \), we solve:
\[
\sqrt{6^2 + (s - a)^2} = 2\sqrt{39} \implies 36 + (s - a)^2 = 156 \implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \implies s - a = 2\sqrt{30}.
\]
Thus, \( s = a + 2\sqrt{30} \).

The semiperimeter \( s \) is also given by \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). Therefore:
\[
a + b + c = 2s = 2(a + 2\sqrt{30}) \implies a + b + c = 2a + 4\sqrt{30} \implies b + c = a + 4\sqrt{30}.
\]

Using the area formulas \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s \) and \( \text{Area} = \frac{abc}{4R} = \frac{abc}{52} \), we equate:
\[
6s = \frac{abc}{52} \implies abc = 312s.
\]
Substituting \( s = a + 2\sqrt{30} \), we get:
\[
abc = 312(a + 2\sqrt{30}).
\]
Since \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) (derived from \( \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \) and \( a = 2R\sin A \)), we find:
\[
b + c = 8\sqrt{30}.
\]
Finally, substituting \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) into \( abc = 312s \), we solve for \( bc \):
\[
4\sqrt{30} \cdot bc = 312 \cdot 6\sqrt{30} \implies bc = \frac{312 \cdot 6\sqrt{30}}{4\sqrt{30}} = 468.
\]
Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{468}
\]
