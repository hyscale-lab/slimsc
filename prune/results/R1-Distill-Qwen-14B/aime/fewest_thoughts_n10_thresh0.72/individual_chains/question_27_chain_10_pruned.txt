Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere and their tangency. Hmm, let me try to digest it step by step.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the same plane, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So I imagine a donut shape where the circle being revolved has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis is 6. 

Then, we have a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest either inside or outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Alright, so I think I need to visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's also touching along another circle. The radii of these circles will depend on the positions and sizes of the torus and the sphere.

Let me recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius is 6. So R = 6 and r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a radius of 11, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the torus just touches the sphere internally. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must be such that the sphere just touches the torus externally.

Wait, but actually, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface is outside the torus, so the maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is exactly 11. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the minimum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is 11.

So perhaps I can model the torus as a surface in 3D space with its center at some point relative to the sphere's center.

Let me consider the centers. Let's assume the sphere's center is at the origin (0,0,0), and the torus is centered along the x-axis, so the center of the torus is at (d, 0, 0) for some distance d.

Wait, but actually, the torus is a surface, so it doesn't have a single center point. Instead, the major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. Hmm, perhaps I should model the torus in a coordinate system.

The standard parametric equation for a torus is:

(x, y, z) = ((R + r cos θ) cos φ, (R + r cos θ) sin φ, r sin θ)

where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus. Here, R is the major radius (6), and r is the minor radius (3).

So, the center of the torus, in a way, is at (0,0,0), but the generating circle is at (R + r cos θ, 0, 0). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the torus can be thought of as all points at a distance r from the center of a circle of radius R in the same plane. So, the center of that circle is at (R, 0, 0), and
