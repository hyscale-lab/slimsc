Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. The problem shows three examples, but I can't see them, so I'll have to visualize or maybe draw a regular dodecagon to get an idea.

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can often form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. The key here is that the sides of the rectangle must lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle is either an edge of the dodecagon or a diagonal.

Let me think about how rectangles can be formed. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and certain diagonals are parallel. So, for each rectangle, I need to find two pairs of parallel lines that form the sides of the rectangle.

In a regular polygon, the number of sides is equal to the number of sides, but the number of diagonals is more. For a dodecagon, the number of diagonals can be calculated, but perhaps that's not directly necessary here.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. Since it's regular, all vertices lie on a circle. So, each vertex can be represented as a point on the circumference, equally spaced.

In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So for a dodecagon, it's 360/12 = 30 degrees. So each vertex is 30 degrees apart.

Now, in a regular polygon, the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that connects two vertices with two in between, and so on.

But for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal and parallel. So, the sides of the rectangle must be chords of the circle that are of equal length and separated by a certain number of steps.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the steps between vertices. For a dodecagon,
