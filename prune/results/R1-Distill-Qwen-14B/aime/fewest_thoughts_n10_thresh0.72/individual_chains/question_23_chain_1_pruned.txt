Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all possible rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for a hyperbola, the standard form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, so here a² is 20 and b² is 24. That means a is sqrt(20) and b is sqrt(24). The hyperbola is centered at the origin, and it's symmetric about both axes.

Now, the rhombus is ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at the origin. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Let me confirm that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal unless it's a square, so in this case, they should intersect at the origin and be perpendicular.

So, let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).

But wait, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.

Another thought: since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

But maybe a better approach is to parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

Let me consider parametric equations for the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, parametric equations are x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where θ is a parameter. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but maybe the trigonometric parametrization is easier here.

But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can take points such that A and C are reflections over the origin, and similarly, B and D are reflections.

So, if A is (x1, y1), then C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, B is (x2, y2), D is (-x2, -y2).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance AB should equal BC, CD, DA.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider vectors or slopes. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular.

So, the slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1. Similarly, the slope of BD is (y2 - (-y2))/(x2 - (-x2)) = (2y2)/(2x2) = y2/x2.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.

But both points A and B are on the hyperbola, so they must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

So, (x1)^2 /20 - (y1)^2 /24 =1 and (x2)^2 /20 - (y2)^2 /24 =1.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, let's compute the length of AB, BC, etc.

But maybe it's easier to express the condition that AB = BC.

Wait, point A is (x1, y1), B is (x2, y2), C is (-x1, -y1), D is (-x2, -y2).

Then, vector AB is (x2 - x1, y2 - y1), and vector BC is (-x1 - x2, -y1 - y2). The lengths AB and BC should be equal.

So, the squared length AB
