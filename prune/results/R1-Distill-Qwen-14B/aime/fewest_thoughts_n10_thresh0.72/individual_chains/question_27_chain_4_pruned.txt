Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a torus T, which is like a donut shape. It's created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, and this axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. 

The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to understand what the torus looks like. A torus is a surface of revolution, right? So imagine taking a circle and spinning it around an external axis. In this case, the circle has radius 3, and the distance from the center of this circle to the axis is 6. So the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6, and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle. We need to find the radii of these two circles and then find their difference.

Wait, how exactly does the torus rest on the inside or outside of the sphere? I think when it's inside, the torus is entirely within the sphere, touching it at some circle. Conversely, when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

So, perhaps the key here is to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. For both internal and external tangency, these points lie on a circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, which we need to find.

I remember that the torus can be represented in 3D coordinates with the equation: 

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r² 

where R is the major radius (6) and r is the minor radius (3). But I'm not entirely sure, maybe it's better to visualize this.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the centers. The sphere is centered somewhere, but I'm not sure where. Wait, perhaps it's centered at the same point as the torus. But wait, the torus is generated by revolving around an axis, so maybe the center of the sphere is at the center of the torus's generating circle.

Wait, the torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. So the distance from the axis to the center is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. So the torus's major radius is 6, minor radius is 3.

So, the sphere of radius 11 is going to have its center at the same point as the center of the torus's generating circle. So the sphere's center is at the same point as the center of the generating circle, which is at a distance of 6 from the axis.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the sphere's center. Let me think. If the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, so the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the torus would be 11.

But the generating circle's center is 6 units from the axis, and the generating circle has radius 3. So, the furthest point on the torus from the center would be along the line going through the center of the sphere
