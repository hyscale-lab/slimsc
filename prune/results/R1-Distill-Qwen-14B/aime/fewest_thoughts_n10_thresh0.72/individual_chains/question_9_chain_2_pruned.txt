Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay, let me write that down to make it clearer.

So, the equations are:
1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use the change of base formula or some logarithm properties to simplify these equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I think I can simplify the exponent inside the logarithm. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), the equation becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Wait, so that simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, and since log_x(y) is the exponent to which I have to raise x to get y, maybe that can be expressed as y = x^{log_x(y)}. But wait, that's just restating it. Alternatively, I think there's a property that log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x), where ln is the natural logarithm. So, maybe I can write this as x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Using the same change of base idea, log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y). So substituting that in, I get 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

Now, let me write down these two equations more clearly:

1. x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10
2. 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10

Hmm, but I notice that (ln y)/(ln x) is in the first equation, and (ln x)/(ln y) is just the reciprocal of that. Let me denote (ln y)/(ln x) as, say, k. Then, the first equation becomes x * k = 10, so k = 10/x. 

And the second equation becomes 4y * (1/k) = 10. Since k is 10/x, substituting that in gives 4y * (x/10) = 10. Let me write that out:

4y * (x/10) = 10.

Simplify that, 4y x / 10 = 10. Multiply both sides by 10:

4xy = 100.

Divide both sides by 4:

xy = 25.

Wait, so is that the answer? xy equals 25? Let me check if this makes sense.

But let
