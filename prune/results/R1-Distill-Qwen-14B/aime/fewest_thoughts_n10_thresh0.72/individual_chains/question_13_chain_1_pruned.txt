Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time, the total time she takes includes some time t spent in the coffee shop. We need to find the total time she takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

First, let me parse the problem again. When she walks at speed s km/h, her total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes. So, the coffee shop time t is the same in both cases because she stops once at the coffee shop regardless of her walking speed.

So, perhaps I can set up two equations based on the time she spends walking plus the time t. The difference in total time is due to the difference in walking speed affecting the time taken to cover the 9 km.

Wait, but the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours when walking at speed s, including t minutes. So, the actual walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes, right? Similarly, when she walks faster at s+2, it takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, again including t minutes. So, the walking time here would be 2.4 hours minus t minutes.

But wait, t is in minutes. I should convert all units to be consistent. Let's decide to work in hours or minutes. Let me convert everything to hours because the speeds are in km per hour.

So, 4 hours is 4 hours, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

But t is given in minutes. So, perhaps I should convert t to hours as well.

Let me denote t as t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

So, for the first case:

Walking speed = s km/h

Total time = 4 hours = 4 hours (which includes walking time plus t minutes coffee break)

So, walking time = 4 hours - t/60 hours.

Similarly, distance = speed × time, so 9 km = s × (4 - t/60).

Similarly, for the
