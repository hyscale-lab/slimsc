Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember that in such games, it's often useful to look for a pattern or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the player whose turn it is. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position (n) is a losing position for Alice. So my goal is to find all n where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position.

Let me define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). Let's start calculating for small n:

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So this is W.
n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with n=1. But since Bob is the next player, he can take the last token and win. So if n=2, Alice can't force a win? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think again.

n=1: Alice takes 1, wins. So W for Alice, meaning Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, so Bob can't win.

n=2: Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, or take 4 which is impossible. So she takes 1, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So if n=2, Alice is forced to let Bob win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means Bob can win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. From n=2, we saw that's a losing position for the next player (which would be Bob). So if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with n=
