Okay, so I have this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits (0-9) in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. The example given is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

In this example, the two numbers left to right are 008 and 991, which add up to 999. The three numbers top to bottom are 09, 09, and 81, which add up to 99. 

Hmm, okay. So I need to find how many such arrangements are possible. Let's try to break this down.

First, let's label the cells in the grid for clarity. Let me imagine the grid as:

a b c  
d e f

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

When read left to right, the two numbers are the top row (abc) and the bottom row (def). So, ABC is a 3-digit number, DEF is another 3-digit number. Their sum is 999.

When read top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number. So, first column is ad, second column is be, third column is cf. Their sum is 99.

So, let's write the equations based on this.

First, ABC + DEF = 999.

Second, (ad) + (be) + (cf) = 99.

But wait, ad, be, cf are 2-digit numbers. So, for example, ad is 10a + d, right? Similarly, be is 10b + e, and cf is 10c + f.

So the second equation is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Which simplifies to 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Okay, that's one equation.

The first equation is ABC + DEF = 999. Let's express ABC and DEF in terms of their digits.

ABC is 100a + 10b + c.

DEF is 100d + 10e + f.

So, ABC + DEF = 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Let me write that equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can express the first equation in terms of the second equation.

Let me note that equation 1 can be rewritten as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, because 100a + 100d is 100(a + d), 10b + 10e is 10(b + e), and c + f is (c + f). So equation 1 is 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Equation 2 is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. Then equation 2 becomes 10S + T = 99.

So, T = 99 - 10S.

Now, let's look back at equation 1:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Notice that a + d, b + e, c + f can be related to S and T.

Wait, a + d is part of (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = S + T. But that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express a + d, etc.,
