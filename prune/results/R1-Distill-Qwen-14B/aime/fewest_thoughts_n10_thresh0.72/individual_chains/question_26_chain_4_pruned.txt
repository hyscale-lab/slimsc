Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given that AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, that means DB and DC are equal. So, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = DC.

Also, since D is outside the circle, AD is a secant that intersects the circle again at P. So, maybe I can use the power of point D with respect to circle ω. The power of D should be equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent) and also equal to DP * DA. Wait, let me write that down.

Power of D: DB² = DP * DA

But I don't know DB or DP or DA directly. Maybe I can express DA in terms of AP and DP. Since P is on AD and ω, AD = AP + PD. Hmm, but I don't know PD either.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the length of BD first. If I can compute BD, then I can write the power equation. So, how do I find BD?

Wait, maybe using properties of triangle ABC. Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, I can find some angles or lengths related to it. Maybe using the cosine law?

Given sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. That should be enough to find all the necessary angles or other needed lengths.

Let me try to compute the circumradius of triangle ABC because the circle ω is the circumcircle. The formula for the circumradius R is given by:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)

Where a,
