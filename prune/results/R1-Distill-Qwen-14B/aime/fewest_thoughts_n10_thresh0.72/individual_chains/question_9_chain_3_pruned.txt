Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe if I convert them into exponential form, it will make things clearer. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Let me rewrite that. If log base a of b is c, then a^c = b. So here, a is x, b is y^x, and c is 10. That means x^10 = y^x. Got that down: x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same conversion, that would be y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay, so I have two equations with x and y. Both x and y are greater than 1, which might be important later. I need to solve for x and y and then find their product.

Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other. Maybe I can use substitution. Let's take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. I can solve for y here. Taking both sides to the power of 1/x, I get y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^(10/x). So y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. That's helpful because now I can substitute this expression for y into the second equation.

So the second equation is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y from the first equation, we get:

(y)^10 = x^{4y}
(x^(10/x))^10 = x^{4y}

Simplify the left side: x^(10/x * 10) = x^{4y}
Which is x^(100/x) = x^{4y}

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, their exponents must be equal. So:

100/x = 4y

Now, I can solve for y in terms of x here. Let's do that.

100/x = 4y
Divide both sides by 4:
25/x = y

So y = 25/x. Okay, so now I have two expressions for y:

1. y = x^(10/x)
2. y = 25/x

So I can set them equal to each other: x^(10/x) = 25/x

Hmm, that's an equation with just x. Let me write that:

x^(10/x) = 25/x

I need to solve for x here. This looks a bit complicated because x is in both the base and the exponent. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides might help. Let's try that.

Take natural logarithm (ln) on both sides:

ln(x^(10/x)) = ln(25/x)

Using the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b ln a, so:

(10/x) * ln x = ln(25) - ln x

So now I have:

(10/x) * ln x = ln(25) - ln x

Let me get all the terms involving ln x on one side. Let's add ln x to both sides:

(10/x) * ln x + ln x = ln(25)

Factor out ln x:

ln x * (10/x + 1) = ln(25)

Hmm. So ln x multiplied by (10/x +1) equals ln(25). Let me write that as:

ln x * ( (10 + x)/x ) = ln 25

So that's ln x * (10 + x) = x * ln 25

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to think of some substitution or possible integer values for x and y.

Wait, the problem says that x and y are real numbers greater than 1, so perhaps they are integers? Let me test some integer values.

Looking at y = 25/x, if x and y are integers, then x must be a divisor of 25. The divisors of 25 greater than 1 are 5 and 25.

Let me test x=5. Then y=25/5=5. Let's check if that satisfies the first equation.

First equation: x^10 = y^x

5^10 = 5^5? 5^10 is 9765625, and 5^5 is 3125. Not equal. So x=5, y=5 doesn't work.

Next, x=25. Then y=25/25=1. But y must be greater than 1, so this is invalid.

Hmm, so maybe x and y aren't integers. Alternatively, perhaps x is a square number or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that x is 25 and y is 5, but wait, no, that would make y=1, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me denote t = x. Then y = 25/t.

From the first equation, x^10 = y^x. So substituting y=25/t:

t^10 = (25/t)^t

Which can be written as t^10 = (25^t)/(t^t)

Multiply both sides by t^t:

t^{10 + t} = 25^t

Take both sides to the power of 1/t:

t^{(10 + t)/t} = 25

Simplify exponent: (10 + t)/t = 1 + 10/t.

So t^{1 + 10/t} = 25.

So t * t^{10/t} =25.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write that as:

t * (t^{1/t})^10 =25

Wait, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, we can take the natural logarithm again.

Let me denote u = t^{1/t}, which is a known function. But perhaps I can write t^{10/t} as (t^{1/t})^10.

So the equation becomes:

t * (t^{1/t})^10 =25

But perhaps this isn't helpful. Let me take logarithms again.

So, starting from t^{1 + 10/t} =25.

Take ln of both sides:

(1 + 10/t) ln t = ln 25

So, (1 + 10/t) ln t = ln 25.

Multiply through:

ln t + (10 ln t)/t = ln 25.

Hmm, this seems similar to
