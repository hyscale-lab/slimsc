Okay, so I've got this problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I'll read the problem again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. The problem talks about her walking at different speeds and how the time taken changes. It gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, taking 4 hours including t minutes in the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks at s+2 km/h, which takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Then, they're asking me to find the number of minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, so I need to find the time taken when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h. To do that, I think I need to first find the values of s and t. Because without knowing her actual walking speed and the time she spends in the coffee shop, I can't calculate the total time for the different speeds.

Let me break it down. The walk is 9 kilometers long. When she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes in the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes.

So, in both cases, the time she spends walking plus t equals the total time. Therefore, I can set up equations for both scenarios and solve for s and t.

Let's denote the walking time (excluding coffee shop) as T. So, for the first scenario:

Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes
So, T = total time - t
Which means, T = 240 - t

But the walking time can also be calculated by distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km, so:

Walking time T = 9 / s hours

Wait, but the problem gives the total time in hours and minutes. I think it's better to convert everything into hours or into minutes to avoid confusion. Let me decide to use hours for all calculations.

So, 4 hours is 4.0 hours, and 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

Similarly, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking time (in hours) + t/60 hours = 4.0 hours

But walking time is distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.0

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Walking speed = s+2 km/h
Total time = 2.4 hours

So, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, plus t/60 hours equals 2.4 hours.

Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4.0

2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4.0 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

So, 9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s+2
