Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time each takes, including t minutes. From that, I should be able to find out what s and t are, right?

So, let's parse the first scenario. She walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. Wait, but 4 hours is 240 minutes. So the total time is 240 minutes, which includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into minutes to make it easier. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes. So, 144 minutes total, again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

So, in both cases, the total time is the time she spends walking plus t minutes. Therefore, we can write two equations based on this information.

Let me denote the time she spends walking as T1 and T2 for the two scenarios, respectively. So, for the first scenario:

T1 + t = 240 minutes.

And for the second scenario:

T2 + t = 144 minutes.

But, how do I find T1 and T2? Well, I know the distance she walks is 9 km. So, the time she spends walking can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed.

But, wait, the speed is in km per hour, and the time is in minutes. I need to make sure the units are consistent. So, perhaps I should convert the time into hours when calculating, then convert back to minutes if needed.

Let me try that. For the first scenario, speed is s km/h, distance is 9 km. So, the time she spends walking is 9 / s hours. To convert that into minutes, I can multiply by 60, so it becomes (9 / s) * 60 minutes.

Similarly, the walking time in the second scenario is 9 / (s + 2) hours, which is (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 minutes.

So, plugging these into the total time equations:

First scenario:
(9 / s) * 60 + t = 240.

Second scenario:
(9 / (s + 2)) * 60 + t = 144.

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

1) (540 / s) + t = 240.

2) (540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144.

I can call these Equation (1) and Equation (2), respectively. Now, I need to solve these two equations to find s and t. Let me try subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate t.

So, Equation (1) - Equation (2):

(540 / s + t) - (540 / (s + 2) + t) = 240 - 144.

Simplify the left side: 540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96.

So, 540 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 96.

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s+2). It's equal to (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So, 540 * (2 / [s(s + 2)]) = 96.

So, 1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96.

Now, solve for s.

1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96.

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1080 = 96 s (s + 2).

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s + 2).

Let me compute 1080 divided by 96. Hmm, 96 times 11 is 1056. 1080 - 1056 is 24. So, 11 + 24/96 = 11.25. So, 1080/96 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25.

So, s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in s. Let me write it as:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

To solve for s, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, so a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).

Compute the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49.

That's nice, the discriminant is a perfect square, 49, so sqrt(49) = 7.

So, s = [-2 ± 7] / (2 * 1).

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5.

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5.

But speed can't be negative, so s must be 2.5 km/h.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's plug s back into one of the equations, say Equation (1):

540 / s +
