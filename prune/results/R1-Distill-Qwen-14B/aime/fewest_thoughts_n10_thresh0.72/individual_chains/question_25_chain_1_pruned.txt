Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, I need to find how many people own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let's see, I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from my classes. Maybe I can apply that here.

Alright, let me try to parse the problem again. There are 900 residents total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's four different items. But wait, no—wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. Oh, so actually, 100% own the candy hearts. That's interesting because it means the candy hearts are universal in this context. So, when considering the ownership of other items, the candy hearts are always included. Hmm, that could simplify things a bit.

The problem also mentions that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. So, I need to find the number who own all four. Let me note down the given data:

- Total residents, n = 900
- Diamond ring owners, D = 195
- Golf clubs owners, G = 367
- Garden spade owners, S = 562
- Candy hearts owners, C = 900 (since everyone owns this)
- Exactly two items owners, exactly two = 437
- Exactly three items owners, exactly three = 234
- Exactly four items owners, exactly four = ? (This is what we need to find)

Wait, I think I should recall the formula for the union of multiple sets. The inclusion-exclusion principle is used to calculate the total number of elements in the union of multiple sets. The formula for four sets is:

n(D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C) = n(D) + n(G) + n(S) + n(C) - n(D∩G) - n(D∩S) - n(D∩C) - n(G∩S) - n(G∩C) - n(S∩C) + n(D∩G∩
