Okay, so I've got this problem here about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has radius 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. That defines the major radius of the torus, I think. And the minor radius is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when outside, along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. The torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, so it has a major radius R and minor radius r. Here, R is 6 and r is 3. The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. So, the sphere and torus touch at exactly that circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch along another circle.

I think the key is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in each case. Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetrical, the centers should lie along the same axis.

Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O. When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle (let's call it C) is at some distance from O. Similarly, when it's outside, the distance would be different.

Wait, I think when the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center O must be equal to the radius of the sphere minus some dimension of the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest point on the torus should equal the sphere's radius plus some dimension.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance between the centers. Let me sketch a diagram mentally. The torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3. The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is placed inside the sphere, tangent to it, the sphere's center and the torus's center (C) are separated by some distance D_i. The closest point on the torus to the sphere's center would be along the line connecting O and C, right? That point would be at a distance of D_i - R - r from O? Wait, not exactly. Wait, the center C is at distance D_i from O. The torus is generated by a circle of radius r around C, which is then revolved around the axis. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, no. The torus itself is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. So, the torus's major radius is 6, minor radius 3.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center O is offset from the torus's center C by some distance. The sphere has radius 11, so the distance between O and C must satisfy that the closest point on the torus to O is equal to 11, and the farthest point is also 11, because the torus is tangent along a circle.

Wait, no. Actually, the torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle, which means that at all points along that circle, the distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is equal to the sphere's radius. So, for points on the torus, their distance from O must be 11.

So, let me consider a point P on the torus. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis. Let me model this mathematically.

In cylindrical coordinates, the torus can be represented as (R + r cos θ, φ, z), but perhaps it's better to use a different approach.

Alternatively, the equation of a torus can be written in 3D coordinates as:

√(x² + y²) = R ± r cos θ

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of parametric equations. The parametric equations for a torus are:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus.

But maybe it's easier to use the equation in terms of distance from the center. The equation of a torus centered at the origin is:

√(x² + y²) = R ± r cos θ

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, for a torus in 3D, the equation can be written as:

(√(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2

Yes, that seems familiar. So, any point (x, y, z) on the torus satisfies that equation. So, if the sphere is centered at (0, 0, a) along the z-axis, for instance, then the points
