Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, in this game, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. I think I should model this as a series of positions, labeling each n as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player about to move.

Let me start by considering small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, so if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. But wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let me think. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Or Alice can take 4, but she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice is forced to take 1, and Bob wins. So n=2 is an L position for Alice, which means it's a W position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, in game terms, the player whose turn it is can win. So for n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take the last one and win. So for n=2, if it's Alice's turn, she can't force a win because Bob can take the remaining token. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So for n=2, if it's Alice's turn, she can't win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob. Wait, no—wait, no, the problem is asking for n where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's play. So for n=2, since Alice can't win, Bob can win. So n=2 is a position where Bob can win.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

If n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice's options are take 1 or 4. She can't take 4, so she takes 1. Now n=1. It's Bob's turn, and he can take the last token and win. So for n=2, if Alice takes 1, Bob can win. Wait, but Alice is trying to win, so she would make a move that allows her to win.
