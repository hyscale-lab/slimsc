Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, these are in the first quadrant. Then, there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with length 1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is part of F, right? Because AB connects A on the x-axis and B on the y-axis, and the length of AB should be 1.

Wait, let me check that. The points are A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, point C is on AB but not equal to A or B, and it doesn't lie on any other segment in F except AB. So, our task is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

The answer should be in the form p/q, with p and q coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the setup. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, a bit more than halfway up to (0,1). The segment AB is in F because it's of length 1.

The family F consists of all such segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, for any P on the x-axis, say at (p, 0), Q must be at (0, q) such that sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, for each p in [0,1], there's a unique segment PQ in F.

So, the family F is all these segments from (p,0) to (0, q) where p² + q² = 1.

Now, point C is on AB, not A or B, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, except AB, C doesn't lie on them.

We need to find point C such that it's the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ from F.

Wait, but the problem says it's the unique point on AB that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB, and for all other segments in F, C is not on them.

But AB is already in F, so that's why it's allowed.

So, to find such a point C, perhaps we need to find a point on AB that is an intersection point of only AB with F, and doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, maybe C is the point where all other PQ segments in F would pass below or above, but only AB touches it.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for any PQ ≠ AB, C does not lie on PQ.

So, to find such a C, perhaps it's the point where the envelope of all these segments PQ just touches AB.

Wait, that might be a method. The envelope of the family of curves (in this case, lines) is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

In this case, the family F consists of straight lines PQ, each of length 1, connecting the x-axis to y-axis. So, the envelope of these lines is a curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point.

If I can find the envelope, then the point C would be where the envelope intersects AB. Because for that point, it would lie on AB and on the envelope, meaning it's the point where the envelope just touches AB, and thus, C is only on AB and no other PQ.

So, maybe I should find the envelope of the family F.

To find the envelope, I can parameterize each PQ in F. Let me parameterize each segment PQ by the point P on the x-axis.

Let P be (p, 0), then Q is (0, q), with p² + q² = 1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the equation of the line PQ can be found.

The line PQ connects (p, 0) and (0, q). The slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p.

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, equation of PQ is y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²).

We can write this as y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²).

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we take F(x, y, p) = 0, then solve for the partial derivatives with respect to p, and so on.

Wait, but since each line is given by y = m x + c, where m = -sqrt(1 - p²)/p, and c = sqrt(1 - p²).

Alternatively, we can write the equation as:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let me rearrange this:

y = sqrt(1 - p²) (1 - x/p)

But perhaps more useful is to write it as:

y = (-sqrt(1 - p²)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p²)

Let me write this as:

y = sqrt(1 - p²) - (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x

So, F(x, y, p) = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

But to apply the envelope condition, we can use the fact that the envelope satisfies F(x, y, p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

So, compute dF/dp.

First, let's compute F:

F = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = 0 + [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) )*(-2p) ) / p ) x - ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) )*(-2p) ) ] 

Wait, let me compute this carefully.

Let me differentiate each term:

d/dp [ sqrt(1 - p²)/p * x ] = x * d/dp [ sqrt(1 - p²)/p ]

Let me compute d/dp [ sqrt(1 - p²)/p ].

Let me denote f(p) = sqrt(1 - p²)/p.

Then f'(p) = [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ) * (-2p) ) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) * 1 ] / p²

Wait, using the quotient rule: d/dp [ numerator / denominator ] = (num’ * denom - num * denom’ ) / denom²

So, numerator is sqrt(1 - p²), denominator is p.

So, numerator’ = (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²))) * (-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p²)

Denominator’ = 1

So, f’(p) = [ (-p / sqrt(1 - p²)) * p - sqrt(1 - p²) * 1 ] / p²

Simplify numerator:

= [ (-p² / sqrt(1 - p²)) - sqrt(1 - p²) ] 

= [ (-p² - (1 - p²) ) / sqrt(1 - p²) ]

= [ (-p² -1 + p² ) / sqrt(1 - p²) ]

= (-1)/sqrt(1 - p²)

So, f’(p) = (-1)/sqrt(1 - p²) / p²

So, derivative of the second term is x * f’(p) = x * (-1)/(p² sqrt(1 - p²))

Now, the derivative of the third term in F is d/dp [ - sqrt(1 - p²) ] = (1/(2 sqrt(1 - p²))) * (-2p) = -p / sqrt(1 - p²)

So, putting it all together, dF/dp is:

x * (-1)/(p² sqrt(1 - p²)) - (-p / sqrt(1 - p²)) 

= -x / ( p² sqrt(1 - p²) ) + p / sqrt(1 - p² )

Set dF/dp = 0:

- x / (p² sqrt(1 - p²)) + p / sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - p²):

- x / p² + p = 0

So,

- x / p² + p = 0 → p = x / p² → p³ = x → x = p³

So, from dF/dp = 0, we get x = p³.

Now, we can substitute x = p³ into F = 0.

Recall F = y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Substitute x = p³:

y + (sqrt(1 - p²)/p) * p³ - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Simplify:

y + p² sqrt(1 - p²) - sqrt(1 - p²) = 0

Factor sqrt(1 - p²):

y + sqrt(1 - p²)(p² - 1) = 0

But p² - 1 = -(1 - p²), so:

y - sqrt(1 - p²)(1 - p²) = 0 → y = sqrt(1 - p²)(1 - p²)

But sqrt(1 - p²) is (1 - p²)^(1/2), so (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, now, we have x = p³ and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

We can write this parametrically as:

x = p³

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2)

We can try to eliminate p to find the envelope.

Let me express p in terms of x: since x = p³, then p = x^(1/3)

Then, y = (1 - (x^(1/3))² )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2)

So, y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2)

So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2)

Alternatively, we can raise both sides to 2/3:

y^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)

Which is the equation:

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

Yes, that's the standard equation for an astroid.

So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the astroid is the envelope of all these segments PQ in F.

Therefore, the astroid touches each PQ segment at exactly one point.

So, the astroid is the curve that is tangent to each PQ at some point.

So, the point C is the point where the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 intersects the segment AB.

We need to find such a point C on AB.

So, AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of AB.

First, let's find the parametric equation of AB.

Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1.

At t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0). At t=1, we are at B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

So, the parametric equations can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, for t in [0,1], (x(t), y(t)) = (1/2 (1 - t), sqrt(3)/2 t)

We can write this as:

x = 1/2 (1 - t)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, to find the point of intersection between AB and the astroid, we can substitute x and y from AB into the astroid equation.

So, substitute x = 1/2 (1 - t) and y = sqrt(3)/2 t into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So:

[ (1/2 (1 - t) ) ]^(2/3) + [ (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Let me compute each term.

First term: [ (1/2 (1 - t)) ]^(2/3) = (1/2)^(2/3) * (1 - t)^(2/3)

Similarly, second term: [ (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ]^(2/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3) * t^(2/3)

So, let me compute (1/2)^(2/3) and (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3):

(1/2)^(2/3) = (2^(-1))^(2/3) = 2^(-2/3) =
