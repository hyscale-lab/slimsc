Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm, alright. So Alice picks a set A, and based on that, Bob creates a list of sets B. Each B is a finite, non-empty set of positive integers, and importantly, the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me try to break this down.

First, let's understand what defines the set B. Each B is a finite, non-empty set of positive integers. The maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element m in A, how many sets B have m as their maximum?

If m is the maximum element of B, then B can be any non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., m} that includes m. Because the maximum is m, all elements in B are less than or equal to m, and since it's non-empty and m is included, the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}.

So for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, which is 2^(m-1). Because for each element less than m, it can either be included or not in the set B.

Wait a second, but we have to remember that B is a non-empty set. But since m is always included, and the subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1} can include any combination, including the empty set. So when we include m, the empty subset just gives {m} which is non-empty. So the number of sets B with maximum m is indeed 2^(m-1).

So, if A is a set with elements m1, m2, ..., mn, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each m in A of 2^(m-1). Because each m contributes 2^(m-1) sets, and since A is a set, there's no overlap in these contributions.

So the problem states that the total number of such B is 2024. So mathematically, we can write:

Sum_{m ∈ A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements of A, which is Sum_{m ∈ A} m.

So, we need to find a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A equals 2024. Then, compute the sum of the m's.

Wait, but how do we find such a set A? Maybe A is a set where each element is chosen in such a way that the sum adds up to 2024. Let's think about how binary numbers work here.

2024 is a specific number. Let me compute its binary representation to see if that helps.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0
1012 /2 =506, rem 0
506/2=253, rem 0
253/2=126 rem 1
126/2=63 rem 0
63/2=31 rem1
31/2=15 rem1
15/2=7 rem1
7/2=3 rem1
3/2=1 rem1
1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let's count the bits: 11 bits.

Let me verify that:

1024 (2^10) is 1 followed by ten zeros. 2024 is 2024-1024=1000. So 1024 + 1000.

1000 is 512 + 488. 512 is 2^9, 488-256=232. 256 is 2^8, 232-128=104. 128 is 2^7, 104-64=40. 64 is 2^6, 40-32=8. 32 is 2^5, 8 is 2^3.

So 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, that's 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 +8 = let's compute:

1024 +512=1536; 1536+256=1792; 1792+128=1920; 1920+64=1984; 1984+32=2016; 2016+8=2024. Yep, that's correct.

So 2024 in binary is 11111101000. Let's check:

From right to left, starting at 0:

Positions with 1s: positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10 = 8 +32+64+128+256+512+1024=2024. Correct.

So, 2024 = 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10.

But in our problem, Sum_{m ∈ A} 2^{m-1} =2024.

So, 2^{m-1} per m. So, if we have each term 2^{m-1} as a power of 2, then each such term must be a distinct power of two, because if A has distinct elements, then the exponents m-1 are distinct, so each 2^{m-1} is unique and the sum is the sum of distinct powers of 2.

Wait, that suggests that the binary representation of 2024 is the key here. Because each 2^{m-1} corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

So, the binary digits of 2024 are 1s at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10 (as we saw).

Which implies that m-1 must be each of these positions.

So m-1 =3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Thus, m=4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, but let me make sure.

If m is the maximum element, then for each term 2^{m-1}, the exponents are m-1. So, if the binary representation of 2024 is a sum of 2^k terms, then the exponents k correspond to m-1 for each m in A.

So, if 2024 = 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^10, then the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. So m-1 is each of these, so m is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, no, wait: m-1=3 → m=4; m-1=5 → m=6; m-1=6→m=7; m-1=7→m=8; m-1=8→m=9; m-1=9→m=10; m-1=10→m=11.

So A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So, the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Therefore, the sum of elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that: 4+6=10; 10+7=17; 17+8=25; 25+9=34; 34+10=44; 44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, but hold on a moment. Let me make sure that this is the correct approach.

Alternative approach: think about the binary representation of 2024, which is 11111101000.

Each set B corresponds to a subset with maximum in A. Each m in A contributes 2^{m-1} sets.

So the total is 2024, which is the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A.

Since 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, each m-1 must be a unique exponent in the binary representation. So m-1 must be 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, as we found.

So m's are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Thus, the sum is indeed 4+6+7+8+9+10+11 = 55.

Wait, but why are the m's 4,6,7,8,9,10,11 and not 4,5,6,7,8,9,10? Because in the binary, 2024 is 11111101000, which skips the 4th bit? Wait, no, let me recount.

Wait, let me think again about the binary representation.

Wait, in binary, 2024 is 11111101000.

Let me count the bits from right (position 0) to left:

Positions: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:        1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Wait, that's actually:

Position 10:1

9:1

8:1

7:1

6:1

5:1

4:0

3:1

2:0

1:0

0:0

So the bits set are positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Wait, that's 7 bits set. So exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, so m-1 is 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So m is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Therefore, the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11. Let me add that again:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So, sum is 55.

Is there any possibility that A could have other elements, not just these? For example, could A have elements whose 2^{m-1} sum to 2024 in a different way?

Wait, but since 2024 is equal to the sum of distinct powers of two, the only way to write it as a sum of 2^{m-1} terms is if each m-1 corresponds to a unique bit in the binary representation. Therefore, A must consist of exactly those m's where m-1 are the exponents in the binary decomposition of 2024.

Thus, A is uniquely determined as {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, so the sum is 55.

Wait, to make sure, let me check with a small example.

Suppose Alice chooses A={1}. Then, the sets B must have maximum element 1, so the only set is {1}. So the number of B is 1.

According to the formula, Sum_{m∈A} 2^{m-1} = 2^{0}=1, which matches.

Another example: A={2}. Then, the sets B can be {2}, {1,2}. So 2 sets.

Sum is 2^{1}=2, which matches.

Another example: A={1,3}.

Then, sets with max 1: {1}.

Sets with max 3: {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}.

Total sets:1 +4=5.

According to the formula: 2^{0} + 2^{2} =1 +4=5, which matches.

So the formula works.

Hence, in our problem, since 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^8 +2^9 +2^10, then the set A must have m's such that m-1=3,5,6,7,8,9,10, which means m=4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Thus, the sum is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Bob's list contains 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( m \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( m \) is \( 2^{m-1} \). Therefore, the total number of such sets \( B \) is given by:

\[
\sum_{m \in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024
\]

The number 2024 in binary is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of 2:

\[
2024 = 2^3 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 + 2^9 + 2^{10}
\]

This implies that the exponents \( m-1 \) are 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Therefore, the elements \( m \) in \( A \) are:

\[
m = 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Thus, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
