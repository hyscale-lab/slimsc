Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. 

The problem says that for an integer b (which is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_{13}, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

So, the task is to find the smallest integer b (b ≥ 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means, for this particular base b, there are at least 11 numbers n that satisfy the two conditions mentioned.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to express n in base b with two digits. In base b, a two-digit number is written as 'd1 d0', where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, mathematically, n can be written as:

n = d1 * b + d0

Here, d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so each of them must satisfy 0 ≤ d0, d1 ≤ b-1. Also, since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero; otherwise, it would be a single-digit number. So, d1 must be at least 1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits d1 + d0 equals the square root of n. So:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n = d1 * b + d0, substituting that into the equation gives:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can rearrange the terms:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in d1, where d0 is a variable that can take values from 0 to b-1 (since it's a digit). For each possible d0, I can solve this quadratic equation to find possible d1 values. But since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, I need to see if the solutions are integers within this range.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about this differently. Since d1 and d0 are digits, they are each less than b. So, d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.

The square of the sum of the digits is equal to the number itself. So, (d1 + d0)^2 = n = d1*b + d0.

Let me denote s = d1 + d0. Then, we have:

s^2 = d1*b + d0

But since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Substituting that into the equation:

s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

Simplify:

s^2 = d1*b + s - d1

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, the result of this division must be within 1 and b-1.

So, for a given base b, we can iterate over possible s and see if d1 is an integer in the required range, then check if d0 = s - d1 is a valid digit (i.e., between 0 and b-1). 

But how do I find the number of b-eautiful numbers for each base b? Let's think about the possible values of s.

s is the sum of d1 and d0, which are digits in base b. Since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, the minimum value of s is 1. The maximum value is when both digits are (b-1), so s can be up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

But not all s in this range will work. We need to find for each b, the number of s such that:

1. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer in [1, b-1]
2. d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1]

So, for each base b, we can calculate the number of valid s values that satisfy these conditions.

Our goal is to find the smallest b where the number of valid s is more than 10.

Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should try to find an expression or a way to count the number of valid s for each b.

Let me try to express this:

For each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s such that:

- (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1)
- d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b - 1
- d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1

So, s must satisfy:

s ≥ 1

s ≤ 2b - 2

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) must be integer, so (s^2 -
