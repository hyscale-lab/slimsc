Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving symmetric expressions, sometimes it's helpful to consider symmetric functions or maybe even factorization techniques. The first condition is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second condition is a bit more complicated. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Wait a second, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it or at least rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Looking at the terms, each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are different variables. Let me see if I can factor this:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that seems a bit cleaner. Now, considering that a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Wait, that simplifies each term. Let me compute each part:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³.

So adding them together:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so now the equation is:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 100 to make the numbers smaller:

3(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/100 = 60,000.

Wait, no, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate a² + b² + c² to (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc). Since I know that a + b + c = 300, I can compute a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + ac + bc.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and Q = a² + b² + c², and P = ab + ac + bc.

Then, Q = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Substituting Q into the equation:

300(90,000 - 2P) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute 300 * 90,000 first. That's 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

Then, 300 * (-2P) = -600P.

So the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me subtract 27,000,000 from both sides and rearrange:

-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000
-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000.

Multiplying both sides by -1:

600P + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 2
