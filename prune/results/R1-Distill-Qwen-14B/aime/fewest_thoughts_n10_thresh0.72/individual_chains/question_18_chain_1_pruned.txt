Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which has 12 sides. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a lot of sides like a dodecagon, there are a lot of symmetries and diagonals. Since the problem allows sides or diagonals, the rectangles can be formed by connecting these lines. 

I think the key is to figure out how to choose four points out of the 12 vertices such that they form a rectangle. But wait, not all sets of four points will form a rectangle; they have to satisfy certain conditions. 

In a regular polygon, a rectangle is formed when the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But in this case, since it's a dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip.

I remember that in a regular n-gon, the number of rectangles can be determined by considering the pairs of parallel sides. For a regular polygon, if n is even, which 12 is, there are multiple sets of parallel sides. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, each side has a parallel side, and each diagonal has parallel diagonals as well.

So, perhaps the approach is to find how many pairs of parallel lines there are and then compute the number of rectangles based on choosing two pairs which are perpendicular to each other.

Wait,
