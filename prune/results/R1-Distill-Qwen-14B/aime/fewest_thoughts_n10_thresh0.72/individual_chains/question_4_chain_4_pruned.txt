Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two players, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. So, for each n, I need to determine if Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does.

I remember this kind of problem is usually solved using the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. Let's denote the positions (number of tokens) as either winning (W) or losing (L) for the player whose turn it is.

Base cases:
- If n=0, the game is over, so the previous player has won. So, if a player is faced with n=0, they lose because they can't make a move. Wait, actually, the player who takes the last token wins, so n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose n=0: the stack is empty. So, the player whose turn it is cannot make a move and thus loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Now, for n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, n=2: take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Wait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, what if n=2: current player takes 1, leaving 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So, current player can't force a win? No, wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, for n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent (they can take the last token). Or the current player could take 4, but n=2 is less than 4, so they can't. So, for n=2, the current player has only one move: take 1, leading to n=1 which is a W for the opponent. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, that can't be right because if n=2, the current player takes 1, leaving 1, and the opponent can take that 1 and win. So yes, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So, n=2 is L.

Wait, let me make a table for small n to see the pattern.

Let me try to list n from 0 to, say, 10, and mark each as W or L.

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
W/L
