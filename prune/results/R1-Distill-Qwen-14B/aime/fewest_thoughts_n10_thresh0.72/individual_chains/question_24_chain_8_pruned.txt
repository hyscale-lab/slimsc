Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem is about a list of positive integers with some specific properties. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me list out the properties again to make sure I don't miss anything:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number, and no other number has the same frequency as 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

Okay, let's break this down.

First, since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear at least twice. Also, no other number can appear the same number of times as 9. So if 9 appears, say, three times, then every other number can appear at most two times.

Next, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers we pick, their total should be 30.

The median is a positive integer not in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer and it's not in the list. So, let's think about what that implies.

Wait, the median is a positive integer, so if the list has an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, and that integer must not be present in the list. If the list has an odd number of elements, then the middle number is the median, but it can't be in the list, which would be impossible because the median is one of the elements. So that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it were odd, the median would be an element of the list, which contradicts the third condition.

So, the list has an even number of elements. Letâ€™s denote the number of elements as 2k, where k is a positive integer. Then, the median would be the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. This average must be an integer not present in the list.

Now, let's think about how the mode and median interact.

Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, the minimal number of times 9 can appear is two. Let's explore that.

But wait, if 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. Because if another number appears twice, then 9 would not be the unique mode. So, if 9 appears twice, all other numbers appear once or less. But since all numbers are positive integers, they can't appear zero times. So, perhaps other numbers appear once.

But let's see if 9 can appear more times.

Suppose 9 appears three times. Then, other numbers can appear at most two times. So, let's explore both possibilities.

Let me consider possible lengths for the list. Let's note that the sum is 30, so the number of elements can't be too large
