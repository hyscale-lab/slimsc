Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), I know that \( z \) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So, \( z \) can be expressed in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, I can write \( z = 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \). Maybe that will be helpful later on.

But before I jump into parametrizing \( z \), let me look at the expression I need to maximize the real part of. Let's denote the expression as \( E \):
\[ E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

I want to find the maximum real part of \( E \). To do this, I might need to express \( E \) in terms of \( z \) and then find its real part. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate \( E \) to make it easier to handle.

Wait, since \( |z| = 4 \), \( \frac{1}{z} \) can be written as \( \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \). Because for any complex number \( z \), \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \). So, since \( |z| = 4 \), \( |z|^2 = 16 \), hence \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

Let me apply that substitution to \( E \):
\[ E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{16} \cdot \overline{z} \]
Simplify \( \frac{96 + 144i}{16} \):
96 divided by 16 is 6, and 144 divided by 16 is 9. So this becomes \( 6 + 9i \).

So, \( E = (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, let's write \( z \) as \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers, but given \( |z| = 4 \), we have \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \).

But maybe instead of writing \( z = a + bi \), it's better to express \( z \) in terms of \( \theta \). So, \( z = 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \), and \( \overline{z} = 4(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Substituting these into \( E \):
\[ E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (6 + 9i) \cdot 4(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \]

Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):
Factor out the 4:
4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ)

Similarly, the second term is 4*(6 + 9i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Wait, maybe instead of expanding them separately, I can compute each product.

Let me compute the first term:
Let me denote \( (75 + 117i) \) as \( A \), so \( A = 75 + 117i \).

So, \( A \cdot z = A \cdot 4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Similarly, the second term is \( (6 + 9i) \cdot \overline{z} = (6 + 9i) \cdot 4(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Let me compute each product:

Compute \( A \cdot z = (75 + 117i)(4\cos\theta + 4i\sin\theta) \)
= 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 4*[75 cosθ + 75 i sinθ + 117i cosθ + 117i^2 sinθ]
= 4*[75 cosθ + (75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)i - 117 sinθ]
Because \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term is -117 sinθ.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ)
Imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) i

Similarly, compute \( (6 + 9i) \cdot \overline{z} = (6 + 9i)(4 cosθ - 4i sinθ) \)
= 4*(6 + 9i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 4*[6 cosθ - 6i sinθ + 9i cosθ - 9i^2 sinθ]
= 4*[6 cosθ + ( -6 sinθ + 9 cosθ )i + 9 sinθ]
Again, since \( i^2 = -1 \), the last term is +9 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real part: 4*(6 cosθ + 9 sinθ)
Imaginary part: 4*(-6 sinθ + 9 cosθ) i

Now, adding both terms together for \( E \):
Real part of E:
4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 4*(6 cosθ + 9 sinθ)
= 4*[75 cosθ - 117 sinθ + 6 cosθ + 9 sinθ]
= 4*[(75 + 6)cosθ + (-117 + 9) sinθ]
= 4*(81 cosθ - 108 sinθ)

Imaginary part of E:
4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) i + 4*(-6 sinθ + 9 cosθ) i
Factor out 4i:
4i*[75 sinθ + 117 cosθ -6 sinθ + 9 cosθ]
= 4i*[(75 -6) sinθ + (117 +9) cosθ]
= 4i*(69 sinθ + 126 cosθ)

So, the entire expression \( E \) is:
\[ E = 4(81 cosθ - 108 sinθ) + 4i(69 sinθ + 126 cosθ) \]

But since we're only interested in the real part of \( E \), we can focus on the first part:
Real part: \( 4(81 cosθ - 108 sinθ) \)

So, our goal is to maximize this real part with respect to θ.

Let me denote \( R(θ) = 4(81 cosθ - 108 sinθ) \)

We can write \( R
