Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared, not just p. So, p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I need the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p might be relevant here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, it's about solving n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

But wait, first, I think I should find the smallest prime p where such an n exists. Let's start by testing small primes.

Starting with p=2. Let's see:

If p=2, then p²=4. Let's compute n⁴ +1 modulo 4.

n can be 1: 1⁴ +1 = 2 → 2 mod 4, which is not 0. n=2: 16 +1=17 → 1 mod 4. n=3: 81 +1=82 → 2 mod 4. So, for p=2, no n satisfies n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. p²=9.

n=1: 1+1=2 mod9 → nope. n=2: 16+1=17 → 8 mod9. n=3: 81+1=82 → 1 mod9. n=4: 256+1=257 → 257 mod9: 257 /9=28*9=252, 257-252=5 → 5 mod9. Hmm, not 0. n=5: 625 +1=626 → 626-69*9=626-621=5 mod9. Still no. n=6: 1296+1=1297 → 1297 mod9: 1+2+9+7=19 → 1 mod9. Hmm, no luck. Wait, maybe I should check higher n? Or perhaps p=3 isn't suitable.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to see whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. For primes p, -1 is a quartic residue if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 8, I think. Wait, let me recall. I know that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if p ≡ 1 mod 4. For higher powers, it's more restrictive.

I remember that for the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, p must be 2 or p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because 8 is the order of the multiplicative group modulo p, so the exponent 4 must divide p-1.

Wait, more accurately, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution only if -1 is in the subgroup generated by x⁴. Since the order of -1 is 2, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies that the order of x is 8, so 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So the primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p is solvable are p=2 and p≡1 mod8.

So, the smallest primes to check are 2, then 17 (since 17 is 1 mod8), 97, etc. Wait, no, 17 is 1 mod8, but 17 is larger than 2. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2 that is 1 mod8. Wait, is 17 the next? Let me list primes:

Primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,...

Looking for p ≡1 mod8: 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc.

Wait, but 17 is the first after 2. So when p=2, we saw that there's no n with n⁴ +1 divisible by 4. So the next candidate is p=17.

But is 17 the minimal p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n? Or maybe a smaller prime like 5, 13, etc., even though they aren't 1 mod8? Because maybe for some primes not congruent to 1 mod8, n⁴ +1 can still be divisible by p² for some n.

Wait, earlier, for p=3, it didn't work. Let me try p=5.

For p=5, p²=25. Let's test n from 1 to, say, 10.

n=1: 1+1=2 mod25 → nope.
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod25 → nope.
n=3: 81+1=82 → 82-3*25=82-75=7 mod25.
n=4: 256 +1=257 → 257-10*25=257-250=7 mod25.
n=5: 625 +1=626 → 626 mod25 is 626 -25*25=626-625=1 mod25.
n=6: 1296 +1=1297 → 1297 mod25: 1297-51*25=1297-1275=22 mod25.
n=7: 2401 +1=2402 → 2402 -96*25=2402-2400=2 mod25.
n=8: 4096 +1=4097 → 4097 mod25: 4097 -163*25=4097-4075=22 mod25.
n=9: 6561 +1=6562 → 6562 mod25: 6562 -262*25=6562-6550=12 mod25.
n=10:10000 +1=10001 → 10001 mod25: 10000 is 0 mod25, so 10001 is 1 mod25.

Hmm, none of these n's up to 10 give 0 mod25. Maybe I need to try higher n? Or perhaps p=5 isn't the prime we're looking for.

Wait, perhaps p=13? Let's see p=13. p²=169.

Testing n=1: 1+1=2 mod169 → nope.
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod169.
n=3: 81 +1=82 mod169.
n=4: 256 +1=257 → 257 -1*169=88 mod169.
n=5: 625+1=626 → 626 -3*169=626-507=119 mod169.
n=6: 1296 +1=1297 → 1297 -7*169=1297-1183=114 mod169.
n=7: 2401 +1=2402 → 2402 -14*169=2402-2366=36 mod169.
n=8: 4096 +1=4097 → 4097 -24*169=4097-4056=41 mod169.
n=9: 6561 +1=6562 → 6562 -39*169=6562-6591= -29 mod169 → 140 mod169.
n=10: 10000 +1=10001 → 10001 mod169.

Wait, calculating 10001 divided by 169: 169*59=169*(60-1)=10140-169=100, so 169*59=10000 -169=9831. Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 169*59:

169*50=8450, 169*9=1521, so 8450+1521=9971.

10001 -9971=30. So 10001 ≡30 mod169.

So n=10: 30 mod169. Not zero.

Hmm, maybe p=13 isn't suitable either. Maybe p=17 is the first prime where p² divides n⁴ +1.

Wait, but before that, perhaps p=5 doesn't work, but maybe p=17 is the first. So let's try p=17.

p=17, p²=289. Let's try to find n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

I think using Euler's theorem might help. The multiplicative group mod 289 is cyclic of order 17² -1 = 288.

So, the multiplicative order is 288. So, to solve x⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

We can note that x⁸ ≡1 mod289.

So, the order of x must divide 8 and 288. So the order of x is 8, which would imply that 8 divides 288, which it does.

So, to find x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

Alternatively, perhaps we can lift a solution from mod17 to mod289 using Hensel's lemma.

First, find a solution mod17.

So, find x such that x⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

Compute x⁴ mod17 for x=1 to 8 (since 17 is prime, and residues repeat every 17).

x=1:1 → 1 mod17
x=2:16 → 16 mod17
x=3:81 → 81-4*17=81-68=13 mod17
x=4:256 → 256 mod17: 17*15=255, so 256≡1 mod17
x=5:625 → 625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13 → 13 mod17
x=6:1296 → 1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4 → 4 mod17
x=7:2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4 →4 mod17
x=8:4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17.

Wait, x=8: 8⁴=4096, which is 4096 mod17. Since 4096=17*241 -1, so 4096 ≡-1 mod17. So, x=8 is a solution to x⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

So, mod17, x=8 is a solution. Now, can we lift this to mod17²=289?

Using Hensel's lemma. Since f(x)=x⁴ +1. We have f(8) mod17=0. Now, compute f'(x)=4x³.

At x=8 mod17, f'(8)=4*(8)^3 mod17.

Compute 8³=512 mod17. 17*30=510, so 512≡2 mod17. So f'(8)=4*2=8 mod17. Since 8 is not 0 mod17, Hensel's lemma applies, meaning there's a unique lift of x=8 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, let's write x=8 +17k, and find k such that x⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Compute x=8 +17k. Compute x⁴ mod289.

But maybe expanding x⁴ would be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289.

But 17²=289, so terms with (17
