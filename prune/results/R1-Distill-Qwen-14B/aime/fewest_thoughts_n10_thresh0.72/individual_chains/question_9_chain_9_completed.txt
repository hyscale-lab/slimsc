Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have certain properties that might help here. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can rewrite these using logarithm properties to make them easier to handle. Let's start with the first equation.

For the first equation, log_x(y^x). I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that property here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So,

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, and log_x(y) is the same as (ln y)/(ln x), right? Because log_b(a) = ln a / ln b. So substituting that in, we get:

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Hmm, maybe I can let’s say, let’s define a variable to simplify this. Let me set t = ln x and s = ln y. Then, since x and y are both greater than 1, t and s will be positive real numbers.

So, substituting, ln x = t, ln y = s. Then, log_x(y) = s/t.

So the first equation becomes:

x * (s/t) = 10.

But wait, x is e^t, since x = e^{t}. So substituting that in,

e^t * (s/t) = 10.

Hmm, that might be a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Wait, maybe I can express both equations in terms of log_x(y). Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of a single variable. Let's see if I can find a relationship between x and y from the first equation.

From the first equation: x * log_x(y) =10. Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then, that equation becomes:

x * k =10.

But log_x(y) =k implies that y = x^k. So, y = x^k.

So substituting into the second equation, which is log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Let me write this second equation using the same substitution.

log_y(x^{4y}) =10.

Again, using the logarithm power rule: log_b(a^c) = c log_b(a). So,

4y * log_y(x) =10.

But log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_y(x) = 1/(log_x(y)) = 1/k.

So, substituting that in,

4y * (1/k) =10.

So, (4y)/k =10.

But from the first equation, x*k=10, which means k =10/x.

So, substituting k=10/x into the second equation:

(4y)/(10/x) =10.

Simplify that: (4y) * (x/10) =10.

Which is (4xy)/10 =10.

Simplify further: (2xy)/5 =10.

Multiply both sides by 5: 2xy=50.

Divide both sides by 2: xy=25.

Wait, so is it that straightforward? Because that seems to give us the product xy=25 directly.

Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Let k = log_x(y). Then y =x^k.

2. First equation: x * k =10.

3. Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10. Using logarithm power rule, it's 4y * log_y(x)=10.

4. Since log_y(x) =1/k, substitute: 4y*(1/k)=10.

5. From first equation, k=10/x. Substitute into the second equation: 4y*(x/10)=10.

6. Simplify: (4xy)/10 =10 → 2xy/5=10 → 2xy=50 → xy=25.

Looks solid. So, yeah, the product xy is 25.

But just to make sure, let me try solving for x and y explicitly and see if they satisfy both equations.

From step 1: y= x^k.

From step 2: x*k=10 → k=10/x.

So, y= x^{10/x}.

Now, let's see, if I can find x such that y =x^{10/x}, and check the second equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a value for x that satisfies the equation.

Hmm, but perhaps more straightforward: since we have xy=25, and y= x^{10/x}, then substituting y into xy=25 gives:

x*(x^{10/x})=25.

Which is x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, taking natural log on both sides: (1 +10/x) ln x = ln 25.

Not sure if that helps, but maybe I can see if x=5, since 25 is 5 squared.

Let me try x=5.

Then, y=5^{10/5}=5^2=25.

So, x=5, y=25. Let's check the first equation: log_5(25^5).

Wait, 25^5 is (5^2)^5=5^{10}, so log base 5 of 5^{10} is 10. That's correct.

Second equation: log_{25}(5^{4*25})=log_{25}(5^{100}).

But 25 is 5^2, so log_{5^2}(5^{100})= (100)/(2)=50. Wait, but that's supposed to be 10? Wait, that's not right. Hmm, did I make a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, if x=5, y=25, then the second equation is log_{25}(5^{4*25})= log_{25}(5^{100}).

But 5^{100} is (25)^{50}, because 25 is 5^2, so (25)^{50}=(5^2)^50=5^{100}.

So, log_{25}(25^{50})=50, but the problem states that this should be 10. So that's a problem.

Hmm, so x=5 and y=25 don't satisfy the second equation. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, so let's backtrack. Did I do the substitution correctly?

Wait, when I substituted, I got xy=25, but when I plug in x=5, y=25, I get the second equation equal to 50, not 10. So that can't be right. So perhaps my earlier conclusion that xy=25 is wrong.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check my steps again.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Which becomes x * log_x(y)=10.

Let me define k= log_x(y), so y=x^k.

So, equation 1: x*k=10 → k=10/x.

Equation 2: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Rewrite as 4y * log_y(x) =10.

But log_y(x) is 1/k, so equation 2 becomes 4y*(1/k)=10.

Substituting k=10/x: 4y*(x/10)=10 → (4xy)/10=10 → (2xy)/5=10 → 2xy=50 → xy=25.

But when I plug x=5, y=25, I get the second equation equal to 50, not 10. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming both equations are satisfied by x=5 and y=25. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the second equation. Let me re-examine it.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Which is 4y * log_y(x) =10.

Hmm, but log_y(x) is 1/k, as I had before.

So, 4y*(1/k)=10.

But since k=10/x, 4y*(x/10)=10.

Which is (4xy)/10=10 → (2xy)/5=10 → 2xy=50 → xy=25.

So, according to this, if xy=25, then x=5, y=5 would be a possibility because 5*5=25. Let me check that.

Wait, if x=5, y=5, then first equation: log_5(5^5)= log_5(3125)=5, but we need it to be 10. So that's not correct.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another pair where xy=25, not necessarily x=5 and y=5.

Wait, maybe x=25 and y=1. But no, y has to be greater than 1.

Wait, perhaps I should express y in terms of x and then substitute into the second equation.

Given that y = x^{10/x}, and xy=25, so x*(x^{10/x})=25.

So, x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Take natural log: (1 +10/x) ln x = ln25.

Let me denote t = x. So,

(1 + 10/t) * ln t = ln25.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and might not have a closed-form solution. Maybe I can try to find a value of t that satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a substitution where t = something.

Wait, let me assume that x= y^{k}, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another approach: let me consider that since xy=25, then y=25/x.

So, substituting into y = x^{10/x}, we get 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Hmm, so 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Multiply both sides by x: 25 =x^{10/x +1}.

Hmm, but I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(25) = (10/x +1) ln x.

Hmm, maybe I can let u = ln x. Then, since x>1, u>0.

So, ln(25) = (10/x +1) * u.

But x = e^u, so 10/x =10 e^{-u}.

Substituting, we have:

ln25 = (10 e^{-u} +1) u.

Hmm, this is a non-linear equation in u and likely difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can try plugging numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better substitution. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the exponents. Let me set 10/x = n, so that x=10/n.

Then, substituting into equation:

ln25 = (n +1)* ln x = (n +1)* ln(10/n).

Hmm, that might not be helpful either.

Wait, perhaps trying specific values would help.

Let me try x= sqrt(25) =5. Then, y=25/5=5.

Wait, earlier this didn't work because the second equation gave 50, which was wrong.

Wait, but let me recheck that.

If x=5, y=5, then first equation: log_5(5^5)=5, but it's supposed to be 10. So that's wrong.

Hmm, maybe I need to try x= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, when I substituted y =x^{10/x}, into xy=25, I got x^{1 + 10/x}=25.

So, perhaps taking logarithm base 5 of both sides, since 25 is 5^2.

So, log_5(x^{1 +10/x})= log_5(25)=2.

Which gives: (1 +10/x) log_5(x) =2.

Hmm, so (1 +10/x) log_5(x) =2.

Let me set u= log_5(x). Then x=5^u.

So, substituting:

(1 +10/(5^u)) * u =2.

Hmm, so this equation is u*(1 +10/(5^u))=2.

Let me try u=1: 1*(1 +10/5^1)=1*(1+2)=3 → 3 ≠2.

u=2: 2*(1 +10/25)=2*(1 +0.4)=2*1.4=2.8 → Not 2.

u=0.5: 0.5*(1 +10/sqrt(5)).

Wait, sqrt(5) is about 2.236. So 10/sqrt(5)≈4.472.

So 1 +4.472≈5.472. Then, 0.5*5.472≈2.736, which is more than 2.

Hmm, maybe u is around 0.8.

Let me try u=0.8.

Then, 5^u=5^{0.8} ≈ approximately 5^(0.8) is e^{0.8 ln5} ≈ e^{0.8*1.609}=e^{1.287}≈3.615.

So, 10/(5^{0.8})≈10/3.615≈2.766.

So, 1+2.766≈3.766.

Multiply by u=0.8: 0.8 *3.766≈3.013, which is more than 2.

Hmm, maybe u=0.6.

5^{0.6}=e^{0.6 ln5}=e^{0.6*1.609}=e^{0.9654}≈2.628.

10/2.628≈3.804.

1+3.804≈4.804.

Multiply by u=0.6: 0.6*4.804≈2.882, which is still more than 2.

Hmm, maybe u=0.5.

As before, gives 2.736, which is more than 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because when u is decreasing, 5^u is getting smaller, so 10/(5^u) is getting bigger, making (1 +10/(5^u)) bigger, but u is smaller. So maybe the product could decrease.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try u=0.4.

5^0.4≈e^{0.4*1.609}=e^{0.6436}= approximately 1.903.

10/1.903≈5.255.

1 +5.255≈6.255.

Multiply by u=0.4: 0.4*6.255≈2.502. Hmm, getting closer. Still higher than 2.

Wait, perhaps u=0.3.

5^0.3≈e^{0.3*1.609}=e^{0.4827}=≈1.620.

10/1.620≈6.173.

1+6.173≈7.173.

Multiply by u=0.3: 0.3 *7.173≈2.151. Closer to 2, but still higher.

Hmm, maybe u=0.25.

5^0.25= sqrt(sqrt(5))≈1.495.

10/1.495≈6.690.

1+6.690≈7.690.

Multiply by 0.25: 0.25*7.690≈1.922. Now, that's less than 2.

So, between u=0.25 and u=0.3, the function goes from 1.922 to 2.151.

We're looking for when it equals 2.

Let me try u=0.27.

5^0.27= e^{0.27*1.609}= e^{0.4344}=≈1.544.

10/1.544≈6.476.

1+6.476≈7.476.

Multiply by 0.27: 0.27*7.476≈2.018. Very close to 2.

Hmm, so u≈0.27 gives us approximately 2.018, which is just above 2.

So, maybe u is approximately 0.267.

Wait, let me try u=0.267.

5^0.267= e^{0.267*1.609}= e^{0.429}=≈1.535.

10/1.535≈6.515.

1+6.515≈7.515.

Multiply by u=0.267: 0.267*7.515≈2.007. Close to 2.

So, u≈0.267.

So, x=5^u=5^{0.267}≈1.535.

Then, y=25/x≈25/1.535≈16.286.

Let me check the original equations with x≈1.535 and y≈16.286.

First equation: log_x(y^x)= log_x( (16.286)^1.535 ).

Hmm, let's compute y^x first.

16.286^1.535.

Well, 16^1.5= sqrt(16^3)=sqrt(4096)=64. So, 16.286^1.535 is a bit more than 64.

But let me compute log_x(y^x)=log_x(16.286^1.535)=1.535 * log_x(16.286).

Since x≈1.535, log_x(16.286)=ln(16.286)/ln(1.535).

Compute ln(16.286)=2.788, ln(1.535)=0.431.

So, 2.788/0.431≈6.467.

Multiply by 1.535: 1.535*6.467≈9.96, which is approximately 10. So that works.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})= log_{16.286}( (1.535)^{4*16.286} )

Compute 4y=4*16.286≈65.144.

So, x^{4y}=1.535^{65.144}.

But taking log base y of that: log_{16.286}(1.535^{65.144})=65.144 * log_{16.286}(1.535).

Now, log_{16.286}(1.535)=ln(1.535)/ln(16.286)=0.431/2.788≈0.1546.

Multiply by 65.144: 65.144*0.1546≈10.08, which is close to 10. So, this seems to check out.

So, even though x and y are not integers, they satisfy the equations, and their product is 25.

Wait, but when I assumed x=5 and y=5, it didn't work, but when I let x≈1.535 and y≈16.286, it works. So, perhaps the earlier assumption that x=5 and y=5 was incorrect because I didn't think through the substitution correctly.

So, the product xy is 25, as per the earlier algebraic solution, despite the individual values not being integers. So, the answer is 25.


Given the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

We start by applying logarithm properties. For the first equation, using the power rule:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10
\]

Let \(k = \log_x(y)\), then \(y = x^k\). Substituting into the first equation:

\[
x \cdot k = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{10}{x}
\]

For the second equation, again using the power rule:

\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = \frac{1}{k}\), substitute into the second equation:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10
\]

Substituting \(k = \frac{10}{x}\) into this equation:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{x}{10} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{4xy}{10} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2xy}{5} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2xy = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
