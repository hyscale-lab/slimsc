Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Let me break it down. 

First, let's understand what it means for Jen to win a prize. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, that includes the cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers match the chosen numbers. The grand prize is when exactly four match, which is a subset of winning a prize.

So, event B (winning a prize) includes all cases where she has 2, 3, or 4 matches. Event A (winning grand prize) is just the case where she has 4 matches. So, A ∩ B is just A, because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely won a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize.

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). So, I need to calculate both P(A) and P(B).

Let me recall that the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So, the total possible combinations are 210.

First, let's compute P(A). P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she's choosing 4 specific numbers, there's only one favorable outcome: the four numbers she picked. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two are among Jen's four. Alternatively, this can be calculated by subtracting the number of ways to have fewer than two matches from the total.

But sometimes it's easier to compute the complementary probability. So, P(B) = 1 - P(less than two matches). P(less than two matches) is P(exactly 0 matches) + P(exactly 1 match).

So, let's calculate P(exactly k matches) for k = 0,1,2,3,4.

But since we need P(B), which is at least two, it's easier to compute 1 - [P(0) + P(1)].

So, first, let's compute P(0): the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). So, the number of ways is 15. Therefore, P(0) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(1): the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen. To compute this, we choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let me compute that.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. So, P(1) = 80 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)] = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 15 (for 0 matches) plus 80 (for 1 match) is 95. So, yes, 210 - 95 is 115. So, 115/210 is P(B).

Wait, but 115 and 210 can both be divided by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(B) simplifies to 23/42.

Similarly, P(A) is 1/210. So, putting it all together, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: that's 1/5. So, it becomes (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is the same as (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). 42 divided by 210 is 1/5, so it's (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115. So, the probability is 1/115.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my steps.

First, total number of possible combinations is C(10,4) = 210. Correct.

P(A) is 1/210. Correct.

For P(B), which is at least two matches, so 1 - [P(0) + P(1)].

P(0): C(6,4) = 15. So, 15/210.

P(1): C(
