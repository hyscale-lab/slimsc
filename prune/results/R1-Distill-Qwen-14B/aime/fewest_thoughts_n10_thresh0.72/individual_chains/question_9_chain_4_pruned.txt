Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The conditions are that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also 10. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe that can help me here. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. Alternatively, I can use any common base, like base 10 or base 2, but natural log might be easier because I can work with exponents more smoothly.

So, let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I need to translate these into equations using exponents. Let's take the first one: log_x(y^x) =10. By the definition of logarithms, this means that x raised to the 10th power equals y^x. So, equation (1) becomes:

x^{10} = y^x

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10. Using the same logic, this means that y^{10} = x^{4y}. So, equation (2) becomes:

y^{10} = x^{4y}

Okay, now I have the two equations:

1. x^{10} = y^x
2. y^{10} = x^{4y}

Hmm, these are two equations with two variables, x and y. I need to solve for both x and y, or maybe find a relationship between them that allows me to find xy.

Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's start with the first equation: x^{10} = y^x.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides might help. Let's do that:

ln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y

So, equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, take the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}

Take natural logs of both sides:

ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y})

Which simplifies to:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

So, equation (2a): 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now, I have two equations:

1a. 10 ln x = x ln y
2a. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for ln y from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From equation (1a):

ln y = (10 ln x)/x

Now plug this into equation (2a):

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Wait, let's write that out:

10 * ( (10 ln x)/x ) = 4y ln x

Simplify the left side:

(100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Hmm, assuming that ln x is not zero, which it isn't because x >1, so ln x >0. So, we can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

So, equation (3): 100 / x = 4y

Which can be rewritten as:

y = (100)/(4x) = 25 / x

So, y is 25 divided by x.

Now, knowing that y =25/x, I can substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x. Let's choose equation (1a): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Since y=25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So, let's substitute into equation (1a):

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x )

Expanding the right side:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x

Bring all terms to the left side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 =0

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x
