Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

So, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE.

Let me sketch this out mentally. Let's label the rectangles. Since ABCD is a rectangle, let me think of it with A at the top-left, B at top-right, C at bottom-right, and D at bottom-left. Similarly, EFGH would be another rectangle; since E, F, G, H are the corners. But wait, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F must lie somewhere along the line that passes through D and C.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, points D and C are adjacent. So, the line DC is one of the sides. But E and F are also on this line? Or is it another line? Hmm, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is between D and C, and F is on the same line beyond C? Or perhaps E is beyond D and F beyond C? Not sure yet.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, maybe the rectangle EFGH is positioned such that H and G are somewhere relative to A and D.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to better visualize. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, which would be the height, and AB=107, which would be the width.

So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is 107 units long. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107,16), and point A would be at (0,16). Wait, no. Wait, AB is 107, which is the length from A to B, so AB is the top side. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), B is at (107,16), and A is at (0,16). Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So, the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So, E and F must lie on this line.

But which sides of EFGH are which? Let's think. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal
