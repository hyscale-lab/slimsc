Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the plane of the circle but 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle is 3.

Now, the torus T is inside a sphere S with radius 11. There are two scenarios: when T rests on the inside of S, they're internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When T rests on the outside, they're externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I should probably recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Next, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The torus can be placed inside or outside of this sphere, tangent along a circle in each case. I need to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

Let me think about the internal tangent first. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent along a circle, that means the sphere and torus touch at exactly that circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch along another circle.

I think it might help to consider the centers of these two surfaces. The sphere S has its center at some point, but since we're dealing with the torus inside and outside, I need to figure out the positions where the centers align.

Wait, actually, in the case of internal tangency, the centers of the sphere and the torus will be aligned along the same axis, right? Because the torus is symmetric around its axis. So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the center of the sphere is offset from the center of the torus's generating circle.

Wait, no, actually, the torus's generating circle is at a distance R = 6 from the axis. So, the torus isn't just a flat disk; it's a surface of revolution. Hmm, maybe I should model the torus mathematically.

The equation for a torus in 3D coordinates can be given if we set the axis of revolution along, say, the z-axis. Then, the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.

In this case, R = 6 and r = 3, so the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Let me assume that this circle lies in some plane, maybe equatorial for simplicity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be in a plane that cuts through the axis of the torus.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the sphere and torus in terms of their centers. The sphere is centered at the origin, let's say. The torus is centered along the z-axis because its equation is symmetric around the z
