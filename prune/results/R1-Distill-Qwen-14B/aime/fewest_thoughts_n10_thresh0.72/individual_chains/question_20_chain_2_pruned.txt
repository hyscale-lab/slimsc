Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. So, each chip is just either white or black, and I can't tell them apart except by color. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. That's straightforward.

The next condition is that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column must have the same color. Hmm, so for any given row, if there are any chips, they must all be the same color—either all white or all black. Similarly, every column must have all its chips of the same color. Wait, does that mean each row and each column must be all white or all black, but possibly different from each other?

But then, there's another condition: any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, the placement must be such that it's maximal—meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column uniformity.

Let me think about what that implies. Suppose I have a grid where some rows are filled with white, some with black, same for columns. But the placement must be such that adding another chip isn't possible without making a row or column have mixed colors.

Wait, but if I have a row that's not completely filled, then I could potentially add a chip, but I have to make sure that adding that chip doesn't create a mixed color. So, for a row that isn't all white or all black, I can't add a chip because that would mix the colors. Similarly, for a column that's not all white or all black, I can't add a chip.

So, does that mean that every row must be either all white, all black, or completely empty? Or could some rows have a mix, but then you couldn't add any more chips?

Wait, no. Because if a row has, say, one white and one black chip, then adding another chip to that row would require it to be either white or black, which would make the row have two different colors if it was already mixed. But the condition is that all chips in the same row must have the
