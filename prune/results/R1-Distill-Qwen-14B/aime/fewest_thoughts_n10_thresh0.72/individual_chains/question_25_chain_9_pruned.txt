Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have 900 residents in Aimeville, and each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and everyone owns at least the candy hearts. 

We are given the numbers for each of these items:
- Diamond rings: 195
- Golf clubs: 367
- Garden spades: 562

And we also know that:
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.

We need to find how many own all four: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves set theory and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the intersections of two sets, adding back the intersections of three sets, and so on.

But wait, here we have four sets: diamond ring (let's call it D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But since everyone owns at least C, the candy hearts, the total number is 900. So, maybe we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union is the sum of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But wait, in our case, since everyone owns at least C, the union of D, G, S, and C is actually the entire 900 residents. So, the union is 900.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets.

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since C is owned by everyone, the sets D, G, S are subsets of C. So, the union D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C is just C, which is 900. So, the total union is 900.

But C is 900 because everyone owns it. So, plugging in the values:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |D∩G∩S∩C|

Wait, but |C| is 900, so |D| is 195, |G| is 367, |S| is 562, and |C| is 900.

So, let
