Okay, so I need to solve this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember something about sets and using inclusion-exclusion principles. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are a given for everyone. Then, some own diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. Also, 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

Wait, so all four things would mean owning the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But wait, the candy hearts are already given to everyone. So, in a way, the candy hearts are like a universal set here. So, all residents own at least the candy hearts. So, the problem is about the other three items.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me write down the given data:

- Total residents (n) = 900.
- Number owning a diamond ring (A) = 195.
- Number owning golf clubs (B) = 367.
- Number owning garden spade (C) = 562.
- All own candy hearts (D). So, D=900.
- Number owning exactly two of A, B, C, D = 437.
- Number owning exactly three of A, B, C, D = 234.
- Number owning all four (A∩B∩C∩D) = ?

Wait, but since everyone owns D, the ownership of D is 100%. So, if I think about it, the other items (A, B, C) are subsets of D. So, maybe I can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since D is universal, it's a bit simpler.

Wait, let me think differently. Since everyone has D, the problem is about how many people have A, B, C, and D. So, the four things include D, which is a given. So, the problem reduces to finding how many have A, B, C, and D, given the counts for exactly two and exactly three of the non-D items.

Wait, no. Because the 'exactly two' and 'exactly three' counts include all four items, right? Because the problem says "exactly two of these things," where "these things" refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Oh wait, no, the initial statement says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, all 900 have D. So, when it says "437 own exactly two of these things," does that include D?

Wait, that's a crucial point. Let's read the problem again:

"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition
