Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, interesting.

Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. We're looking for primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Then, once I find the smallest such p, I need to find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

First, I should probably check smaller primes first to see if any of them satisfy the condition. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me go through them one by one.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4 (since p²=4). Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3,... 

n=1: 1⁴=1, so 1+1=2. 2 mod 4 is 2, not 0. So p=2 doesn't work?

Wait, but n=2: 2⁴=16, 16+1=17. 17 mod 4 is 1, which is not 0. n=3: 3⁴=81, 81+1=82. 82 mod 4 is 2. Hmm, seems like n⁴ mod 4 is either 0 or 1. Wait, 1⁴=1, 2⁴=0, 3⁴=1. So n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 would be 1 or 2 mod 4. So it's never 0 mod 4. So p=2 doesn't work. So p must be an odd prime.

Next prime is p=3. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1 mod9, 1+1=2 no.

n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8 no.

n=3: 0 mod9, 0+1=1 no.

n=4: 4⁴=256, 256 mod9: 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4, 4+1=5 no.

n=5: 5 mod9, 5⁴=625. 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4, so 4. 4+1=5 no.

n=6: 6⁴ is 1296, which is 0 mod9. 0+1=1 no.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8 no.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: Let's add the digits: 4+0+9+6=19, then 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 1 mod9. 1+1=2 no.

So none of n=1 to 8 gives n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime, p=5. Check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24 (since mod25 cycles every 25). But that's a lot, maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, note that for primes p, the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic if p is odd. Wait, maybe I can use some number theory here.

If p is an odd prime, and p² divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡1 mod p². So the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², so the order doesn
