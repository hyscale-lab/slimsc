Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, alright, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive nth roots of unity. So, Φ₁₃(x) should be of degree φ(13) = 12, so it's x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Right.

But how does that help me with the product? The product is over terms of the form (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. Let me write that down:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this expression. Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}

Alternatively, perhaps factor it or write it in terms of ω^k. Maybe I can factor it as a quadratic in ω^k?

Let me try that. Let me denote θ = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2θ + θ².

So, 2 - 2θ + θ². Hmm, can that be factored? Let's see:

θ² - 2θ + 2. Let me check the discriminant: discriminant D = 4 - 8 = -4. So, θ² - 2θ + 2 = (θ - (1 + i))(θ - (1 - i)). Ah, okay, so it factors into linear terms over complex numbers.

So, each term in the product is (θ - (1 + i))(θ - (1 - i)), where θ = ω^k. Therefore, the entire product P can be written as:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, that's the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, P = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]

Now, I remember that the product over k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n - 1, because the roots of x^n - 1 are exactly the nth roots of unity. Wait, but in our case, the product is over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a), where a is some constant. Let's see.

If I let x = a, then the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} - 1, since the roots are ω^k for k=0 to 12. But wait, that's when the product is (x - ω^k). But in our case, it's (ω^k - a) = -(
