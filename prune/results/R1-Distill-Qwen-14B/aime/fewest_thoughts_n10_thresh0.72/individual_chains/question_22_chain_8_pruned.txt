Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and all sides equal. So, it's kind of like a regular hexagon but stretched or something because the opposite sides are parallel but maybe not all angles equal.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are 120 degrees, but here it's just equilateral, meaning all sides are equal, but angles might be different. But the fact that opposite sides are parallel suggests some symmetry.

I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be thought of as vectors that are equal and opposite. So, maybe AB is parallel and equal to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA? Not sure if that's exactly correct, but something like that.

But the problem says the triangle formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So, maybe these extensions meet at certain points forming a larger triangle.

I think I need to model the hexagon in some coordinate system. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Maybe place point A at the origin, and then proceed step by step.

Wait, but maybe it's better to approach this problem using vectors or coordinate geometry. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, the hexagon is a centrally symmetric if it's a regular hexagon, but since it's only equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's a more general case.

Wait, another thought: such a hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating a triangle. For example, if you take a triangle and translate it in some direction, you might form a hexagon. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of similar triangles.

The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, 300. Let's call this triangle T. So, triangle T is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inscribed within it in some way.

Wait, maybe the hexagon is similar to this triangle but scaled down. Or perhaps the hexagon is formed by cutting off the corners of triangle T.

Let me think about how the hexagon relates to triangle T. If I extend AB, CD, EF, their extensions meet at the vertices of triangle T. So, the hexagon is inside triangle T, and the sides of the hexagon are parts of the sides of T, but shifted inward.

Wait, but in the hexagon, AB, CD, EF are sides that are extended to form triangle T. So, the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. But all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, which is the side length we need to find.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Hmm, perhaps the triangle T can be divided into smaller similar triangles, each corresponding to a part of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles and parallel lines. Since the sides of the hexagon are parallel to each other, the triangle T is divided into smaller similar triangles by the hexagon.

Let me try to think about the proportions. Suppose that when we extend AB, CD, EF, they meet at points forming triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. So, triangle T is similar to the triangles formed by the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, but how does the scaling work here? Maybe each side of the hexagon is a fraction of the corresponding side in triangle T.

Alternatively, perhaps using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) to find the scaling factors.

Wait, let me try to model this.

Imagine triangle T with sides 200, 240, 30
