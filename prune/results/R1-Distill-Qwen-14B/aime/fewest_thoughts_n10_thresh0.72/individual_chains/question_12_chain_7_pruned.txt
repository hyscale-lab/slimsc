Okay, so I've got this problem about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits (0-9) in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Also, when I read it top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me visualize the grid. It's two rows and three columns. So the first row has three digits, and the second row has three digits. When I read left to right, the first row forms a 3-digit number, let's call it ABC, and the second row forms another 3-digit number, DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

Similarly, when I read top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number. So the first column is A and D, which makes AD, the second column is B and E, making BE, and the third column is C and F, making CF. Then the sum AD + BE + CF should be 99.

So, I need to find the number of ways to fill the grid with digits A, B, C, D, E, F such that:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Let me break this down. First, let's handle the ABC + DEF = 999 condition. Since ABC and DEF are both 3-digit numbers, their sum is 999. That suggests that ABC and DEF are complementary in a way. Specifically, DEF = 999 - ABC.

But since both are 3-digit numbers, ABC can range from 000 to 999, but in reality, ABC is at least 000 and DEF is at least 000, so their sum being 999 implies that each digit-wise addition (hundreds, tens, units) must add up to 9.

Wait, that's a key point. Let's think about each digit place:

- Hundreds place: A + D = 9
- Tens place: B + E = 9
- Units place: C + F = 9

Because when you add ABC and DEF, each digit place adds up to 9 (since 999 is 9 in each place). So, A + D = 9, B + E = 9, and C + F = 9.

That's a crucial observation. So each pair (A,D), (B,E), (C,F) must add up to 9.

Now, moving on to the second condition: AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, AD, BE, CF are two-digit numbers. So AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F.

So, AD + BE + CF = (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F). 

But from the first condition, D = 9 - A, E = 9 - B, F = 9 - C.

So substituting these into the equation:

10(A + B + C) + ( (9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) ) = 99

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

(9 - A) + (9 - B) + (9 - C) = 27 - (A + B + C)

So the equation becomes:

10(A + B + C) + (27 - (A + B + C)) = 99

Let me denote S = A + B + C. Then the equation is:

10S + (27 - S) = 99

Simplify:

10S + 27 - S = 9S + 27 = 99

Subtract 27 from both sides:

9S = 72

Divide both sides by 9:

S = 8

So S = A + B + C = 8.

Therefore, the sum of the first row digits is 8.

But let's remember that each pair A + D, B + E, C + F = 9. So D = 9 - A, E = 9 - B, F = 9 - C.

So now, our conditions are:

1. A + D = 9
2. B + E = 9
3. C + F = 9
4. A + B + C = 8

We need to find the number of possible (A,B,C,D,E,F) tuples where each of A, B, C, D
