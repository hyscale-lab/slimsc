Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

Alright, so to break this down, if a number n is represented as "d1 d0" in base b, then n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits, d1 + d0, must be equal to sqrt(n). So, mathematically, we can write this as:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (because it's the leading digit), and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

Let me square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let's rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. This seems a bit complicated, maybe I can find a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, since n = d1*b + d0, and the sum of digits s = d1 + d0, then s = sqrt(n). Therefore, s^2 = n. So, substituting:

s^2 = d1*b + d0

But s = d1 + d0, so:

s^2 = d1*b + d0 = d1*b + (s - d1)

Because d0 = s - d1.

So, substituting, we have:

s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s

Let me write that equation again:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1, we can express this as a condition on s and b.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b (since the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b in decimal) and less than b^2 (since the largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1). Thus, s = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s < sqrt(b^2) = b. So, s is an integer between ceiling of sqrt(b) and floor(b - 1). Wait, but s is equal to d1 + d0, which are digits, so s must also be a positive integer.

Wait, let me think again. Since n = s^2, and n is between b and b^2 - 1, then s must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ b - 1, but s must be an integer because it's the sum of digits, which are integers.

Therefore, for each base b, the possible values of s are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

But let's clarify: s must be an integer because d1 and d0 are integers. So s is an integer, and s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b.

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of integers s such that:

1. s is an integer, 1 ≤ s ≤ b - 1
2. s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, so s^2 >= b and s^2 < b^2
3. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1
4. d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible s and check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and if d1 and d0 satisfy the digit constraints.

But since we need to find the smallest b where the number of such s is more than ten, we can approach this by checking each base starting from b=2 upwards, and count how many s's satisfy the conditions for each b, until we find the first b where the count exceeds ten.

But this seems computationally intensive if done manually, so perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.

Let me try to express d1 in terms of s and b:

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must divide (s^2 - s).

So, (b - 1) | s(s - 1)

Which means that (b - 1) divides the product s(s - 1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide s or s-1, or more precisely, the factors of (b -1) must be distributed between s and s-1.

Alternatively, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). So, for each b, we can find all s such that s(s -1) is a multiple of (b-1). Then, for each such s, we can compute d1 and check if d1 is in [1, b-1] and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1].

Let me think about how s and b relate.

Given that s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so s^2 < b^2. Since s >= sqrt(b), but s must be less than b.

Wait, but s can be as high as b-1, since d1 can be up to b-1 and d0 can be up to b-1, so s = d1 + d0 can be up to 2(b-1). But wait, since n = s^2 must be less than b^2, s can be up to b-1.

Wait, let's clarify: n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = d1*b + d0 < b^2, so s^2 = n < b^2, so s < b. But s must also be at least sqrt(b), because n >= b, so s^2 >= b => s >= ceil(sqrt(b)).

Therefore, s is in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1]

Now, for each b, the possible s are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1.

For each s in that range, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Then check if d1 is in [1, b-1] and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1].

If all these conditions hold, then s is valid, and n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, for each b, the number of s's that satisfy these conditions is the number of b-eautiful numbers.

Our goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of s's is more than ten.

This seems manageable for small values of b, but since we need to go up until we find a b with more than ten s's, perhaps we can find a way to express this count as a function of b.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize it in terms of s and find for which b's the conditions are satisfied.

Wait, let's rearrange the equation for d1:

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So, (b -1) divides s(s -1). Let me denote k = b -1, so k divides s(s -1). Therefore, k must be a divisor of s(s -1). Since s and s -1 are coprime, k must divide s or k must divide s -1.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because k can have factors that divide s and others that divide s -1. But since s and s-1 are coprime, their gcd is 1, so the prime factors of k must be entirely in s or in s-1.

Wait, no, I think that if k divides s(s -1), and s and s-1 are coprime, then k must be equal to d1*(b-1), but perhaps the factors of k must be distributed between s and s-1.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each s, the possible k = b -1 must be a divisor of s(s -1). So, for a given s, the possible k's (and hence b's) are the divisors of s(s -1). Then, for a given s, the possible b's are equal to (divisors of s(s-1)) + 1.

But we're looking for b's such that for many s's, k = b -1 divides s(s -1). So, to have many s's for a given b, we need b -1 to have many divisors, each of which can divide some s(s -1) for s in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

Alternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to s_max, where s_max is b -1.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it for each b, compute how many s's satisfy the conditions.

So, let's try to formalize it.

Given b, compute k = b -1.

We need to find the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that k divides s(s -1). For each such s, compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/k.

We must also ensure that d1 is between 1 and b -1, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b -1.

So, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], check if k divides s(s -1). If yes, compute d1 and d0 and check if they are valid digits.

So, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of k = b -1 that are in the range [something], but perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

Alternatively, since s(s -1) must be divisible by k, which is b -1, then for each s, if k divides s(s -1), then s(s -1) = m*k for some integer m. Then, d1 = m.

Wait, but d1 = (s^2 - s)/k = m, so m must be an integer, and m = d1 must be in [1, b -1].

Hmm.

Wait, let's think about this.

Given that s and s -1 are coprime, then k = b -1 must be a product of factors from s and s -1. So, for k to divide s(s -1), the prime factors of k must be a subset of the union of the prime factors of s and s -1.

But since s and s -1 are coprime, the prime factors are entirely in s or in s -1. Therefore, k must be a product of factors from s and s -1, but since they're coprime, k can be written as k = d * e, where d divides s and e divides s -1, and d and e are coprime.

But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, for each s, the possible k's are the divisors of s(s -1). So, for a given s, the possible k's are the divisors of s(s -1). Then, b = k + 1.

So, for each s, we can find all possible b's that would make s a valid s for that b.

But since we're looking for a fixed b where many s's are valid, perhaps it's better to iterate over b and count the number of s's.

But this might take a while. Let me think of an alternative approach.

Let me consider that for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s -1) that are less than s and satisfy b >= 2.

Wait, because k = b -1 must be a divisor of s(s -1), so k must be a divisor of s(s -1), and since b >= 2, k >=1.

Moreover, since s is at least ceil(sqrt(b)), but since s <= b -1, we have s <= k.

Wait, because s <= b -1 = k.

So, for each s, the possible k's are the divisors of s(s -1) that are >= s (because k must be >= s, since s <= k). Wait, no, because k can be smaller than s.

Wait, no, because k = b -1, and s can be up to k. So, k can be any divisor of s(s -1), but since s and s -1 are coprime, the divisors of s(s -1) are products of the divisors of s and s -1.

Wait, maybe another way: For a given s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s -1) that are >= s, because k must be >= s (since s <= k). Because s <= k, since s <= b -1 = k.

Wait, no, because s can be up to k. So, k can be any divisor of s(s -1), as long as k >= s.

Wait, no, for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], and b = k + 1, so k = b -1 >=1.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about for a fixed b, how many s's satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to b -1, and for which s = (d1 + d0) satisfies the digit constraints.

Wait, perhaps another angle. Let's consider that the equation is:

s^2 = d1*b + d0, where d0 = s - d1.

So, s^2 = d1*b + s - d1

Rearranged:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)

But d1 must be an integer between 1 and b -1, and d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b -1.

So, for each b, the number of s's is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 is in [1, b -1], and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b -1].

So, for a given b, we can compute k = b -1, and then for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to k, check if k divides (s^2 - s), then compute d1 and d0, and count the number of valid (s, d1, d0).

Let me try to compute this for several small values of b to see if I can find a pattern.

Starting with b=2:

b=2, k=1.

Possible s: ceil(sqrt(2))=2, but s must be <=k=1. So no s exists. So 0 numbers.

So, 1 number.

Wait, maybe I need to go higher. Let's try b=20.

k=19.

s from 5 (sqrt(20)=4.472, ceil=5) to 19.

We need to find s where 19 divides s(s-1).

So, 19 divides s(s-1). Since 19 is prime, it must divide either s or s-1.

So, s ≡0 mod 19 or s≡1 mod 19.

But s is between 5 and 19.

s=19: s=19, which is 0 mod19. So s=19.

s=1: Not in the range.

So only s=19 is valid.

Compute d1=(19^2 -19)/19=(361-19)/19=342/19=18.

d0=19-18=1. Valid.

So, only s=19. 1 number.

Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps b=21.

k=20.

s from 5 (sqrt(21)=4.583, ceil=5) to 20.

We need 20 divides s(s-1).

20 factors into 4*5. So, s(s-1) must be divisible by 4 and 5.

Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, and one of them must be divisible by 4, and one divisible by 5.

So, possible cases:

Case 1: s divisible by 5, and s or s-1 divisible by 4.

Case 2: s-1 divisible by 5, and s or s-1 divisible by 4.

So, let's find s in 5 to 20:

s divisible by 5: s=5,10,15,20.

For each, check if s or s-1 divisible by 4.

s=5: s-1=4, which is divisible by 4. So yes.

s=10: s=10, which is divisible by 2, but not 4. s-1=9, not divisible by 4. So no.

s=15: s=15 not divisible by 4. s-1=14, not divisible by 4. No.

s=20: s=20, which is divisible by 4. So yes.

Now, s-1 divisible by 5: s-1=5,10,15.

So s=6,11,16.

Check if s or s-1 divisible by 4.

s=6: s=6 not divisible by 4, s-1=5 not divisible by 4. No.

s=11: s=11 not divisible by 4, s-1=10 not divisible by 4. No.

s=16: s=16, which is divisible by 4. Yes.

So, the valid s's are s=5,20,16.

Wait, let me check:

s=5:

d1=(25 -5)/20=20/20=1.

d0=5-1=4. Valid.

s=16:

d1=(256 -16)/20=240/20=12.

d0=16-12=4. Valid.

s=20:

d1=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19.

d0=20-19=1. Valid.

So, s=5,16,20 are valid. So 3 numbers.

Still 3.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider a base where b-1 has many small factors, allowing for more s's.

Wait, perhaps if b-1 is a highly composite number, like 24.

Let me try b=25, k=24.

s from 5 (sqrt(25)=5) to 24.

We need 24 divides s(s-1). Since 24=8*3=2^3*3.

So s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3.

Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, but to be divisible by 8, either s or s-1 must be divisible by 8, and the other must be even.

Also, one of s or s-1 must be divisible by 3.

So, let's find s in 5 to 24 where s(s-1) is divisible by 24.

This happens when:

Either s divisible by 8 or s-1 divisible by 8, and among s and s-1, one is divisible by 3.

So, let's list s where s or s-1 is divisible by 8, and s or s-1 divisible by 3.

Possible s:

s divisible by 8: 8,16,24.

Check if s or s-1 divisible by 3.

s=8: s=8 not divisible by 3. s-1=7 not divisible by 3. So no.

s=16: s=16 not divisible by 3. s-1=15, which is divisible by 3. Yes.

s=24: s=24 divisible by 3. Yes.

s-1=23 not divisible by 3. So s=24 is okay.

s-1 divisible by 8: s=9,17, 25 (but 25>24, so s=9,17).

Check if s or s-1 divisible by 3.

s=9: s=9 divisible by 3. Yes.

s=17: s=17 not divisible by 3. s-1=16 not divisible by 3. So no.

So, the valid s's are s=16,24,9.

Wait, let's check:

s=9:

d1=(81 -9)/24=72/24=3.

d0=9-3=6. Valid.

s=16:

d1=(256 -16)/24=240/24=10.

d0=16-10=6. Valid.

s=24:

d1=(576 -24)/24=552/24=23.

d0=24-23=1. Valid.

So, s=9,16,24: 3 numbers.

Not enough.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, for s=8: 8 and 7.

s=8: 8 not divisible by 3, 7 not divisible by 3. So no.

s=16: 16 not divisible by 3, 15 is. So yes.

s=24: 24 is divisible by 3. So yes.

s=9: 9 is divisible by 3. So yes.

s=17: 17 not, 16 not. No.

So, s=9,16,24 are valid. So 3 numbers.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of k in a certain range.

Alternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors d of k such that d <= k and d >= (k +1 - something). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for a given k, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors d of k such that d <= k and d satisfies certain conditions.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for each divisor d of k, s can be expressed as d + m*k, but within the range of s.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that since k divides s(s-1), and s and s-1 are coprime, then k must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.

So, for each divisor pair (d, e) of k, where d*e = k and gcd(d,e)=1, we can set s ≡0 mod d and s≡1 mod e.

Then, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo d*e=k.

So, for each such co-prime divisor pair (d,e) of k, there is a unique s modulo k that satisfies s ≡0 mod d and s≡1 mod e.

Then, since s must be in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), k], each such s corresponds to a solution.

Therefore, the number of such s's is equal to the number of co-prime divisor pairs (d,e) of k.

Each such pair gives one s in the range [1, k], but we need to check if s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), k].

But b = k +1, so sqrt(b) = sqrt(k +1). So, s must be >= ceil(sqrt(k +1)).

Thus, the number of s's is equal to the number of co-prime divisor pairs (d,e) of k where the corresponding s is >= ceil(sqrt(k +1)).

But this seems a bit abstract. Let me think about how to compute this.

The number of co-prime divisor pairs (d,e) with d*e =k is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of k}.

Because each prime factor can go to d or e, but since d and e must be coprime, each prime factor must entirely go to d or e.

Therefore, the number of co-prime pairs (d,e) with d*e =k is 2^{ω(k)}, where ω(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k.

But each such pair gives a unique solution s modulo k.

However, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(k +1)), k].

So, for each co-prime pair (d,e), we get a unique s in [1, k], but only some of them will be in the desired range.

Thus, the number of s's is roughly equal to the number of co-prime pairs (d,e) where the solution s is >= ceil(sqrt(k +1)).

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe another way: for each co-prime pair (d,e), compute s, and check if s >= ceil(sqrt(k +1)).

But perhaps a better way is to note that for each co-prime pair (d,e) of k, there's exactly one s in [1, k] that satisfies s ≡0 mod d and s≡1 mod e.

So, the number of such s's is equal to the number of such pairs where the resulting s is within our desired range.

But this requires actually computing s for each pair, which might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps for k with many distinct prime factors, we can get more s's.

For example, if k is a product of many small primes, like 2*3*5=30, then the number of co-prime pairs would be 2^3=8.

Each pair would give a unique s modulo 30, so potentially 8 s's in [1,30]. But we need s >= ceil(sqrt(31))=6.

So, perhaps for k=30, we can have up to 8 s's, but some might be less than 6.

Wait, let's test this with k=30, b=31.

Compute s's where 30 divides s(s -1).

s must be between 6 and 30.

For each co-prime pair (d,e) where d*e=30 and gcd(d,e)=1.

The possible pairs are:

(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1).

Each pair (d,e) corresponds to solving s ≡0 mod d and s≡1 mod e.

Let's compute s for each pair:

1. (d=1,e=30): s ≡0 mod1 (always true), s≡1 mod30. So s=1,31,...

But s must be <=30. So s=1. But s must be >=6. So invalid.

2. (d=2,e=15): s ≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod15.

Find s ≡0 mod2 and s≡1 mod15.

Let me solve for s:

s =15m +1.

We need 15m +1 ≡0 mod2 → 15m ≡-1 mod2 → m ≡1 mod2.

So m=2k+1.

Thus, s=15*(2k+1)+1=30k +16.

Within s <=30, k=0: s=16.

So s=16.

16 >=6, valid.

3. (d=3,e=10): s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod10.

Solve s=10m +1.

10m +1 ≡0 mod3 → 10m ≡-1 mod3 → 1m ≡2 mod3 → m≡2 mod3.

So m=3k +2.

s=10*(3k+2)+1=30k +21.

Within s <=30: k=0→s=21.

21>=6, valid.

4. (d=5,e=6): s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod6.

Solve s=6m +1.

6m +1≡0 mod5 → 6m≡-1 mod5 → m≡4 mod5.

So m=5k +4.

s=6*(5k +4)+1=30k +25.

Within s <=30: k=0→s=25.

25>=6, valid.

5. (d=6,e=5): s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod5.

Solve s=5m +1.

5m +1≡0 mod6 →5m≡-1 mod6 → 5m≡5 mod6 → m≡1 mod6.

So m=6k +1.

s=5*(6k +1)+1=30k +6.

Within s <=30: k=0→s=6, k=1→s=36>30.

So s=6.

6>=6, valid.

6. (d=10,e=3): s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod3.

Solve s=10m.

10m ≡1 mod3 → m≡1 mod3.

So m=3k +1.

s=10*(3k +1)=30k +10.

Within s <=30: k=0→s=10, k=1→s=40>30.

s=10.

10>=6, valid.

7. (d=15,e=2): s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod2.

s=15m.

15m ≡1 mod2 → m≡1 mod2.

m=2k +1.

s=15*(2k +1)=30k +15.

Within s <=30: k=0→s=15, k=1→s=45>30.

s=15.

15>=6, valid.

8. (d=30,e=1): s≡0 mod30, s≡1 mod1.

s≡0 mod30 and s≡1 mod1 (always true).

s=30m.

Within s <=30: s=30.

30>=6, valid.

So, the valid s's are 16,21,25,6,10,15,30.

Wait, that's 7 s's. But let me check each:

From above:

1. (2,15): s=16.

2. (3,10): s=21.

3. (5,6): s=25.

4. (6,5): s=6.

5. (10,3): s=10.

6. (15,2): s=15.

7. (30,1): s=30.

So, 7 s's. Plus s=6, which is the lower bound.

So total of 7 s's.

But let's verify each s:

s=6:

d1=(36 -6)/30=30/30=1.

d0=6-1=5. Valid.

s=10:

d1=(100 -10)/30=90/30=3.

d0=10-3=7. Valid.

s=15:

d1=(225 -15)/30=210/30=7.

d0=15-7=8. Valid.

s=16:

d1=(256 -16)/30=240/30=8.

d0=16-8=8. Valid.

s=21:

d1=(441 -21)/30=420/30=14.

d0=21-14=7. Valid.

s=25:

d1=(625 -25)/30=600/30=20.

d0=25-20=5. Valid.

s=30:

d1=(900 -30)/30=870/30=29.

d0=30-29=1. Valid.

So, 7 s's for b=31.

That's more than the previous counts.

Wait, but the question asks for more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, 7 is not enough.

So, perhaps if we go higher.

Let me try k=60, which has more factors.

Wait, but let's compute step by step.

Wait, for k=30, we have 7 s's. Let's try k=24.

Wait, earlier when k=24, we found 3 s's. Maybe that's not better.

Alternatively, let's try k=60, b=61.

k=60 has prime factors 2^2,3,5. So ω(k)=3, number of co-prime pairs is 2^3=8.

But wait, actually, for k=60, the number of co-prime pairs (d,e) where d*e=60 and gcd(d,e)=1.

The co-prime pairs would be:

(1,60), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (60,1).

So, 8 pairs.

Each pair will give a unique s modulo 60.

We need to find s in [ceil(sqrt(61))=8, 60].

Compute each s:

1. (d=1,e=60): s≡0 mod1, s≡1 mod60 → s=1. Not >=8.

2. (d=3,e=20): s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod20.

Find s=20m +1 ≡0 mod3 → 20m ≡-1 mod3 → 2m ≡2 mod3 → m≡1 mod3.

So m=3k+1.

s=20*(3k+1)+1=60k+21.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=21.

21>=8, valid.

3. (d=4,e=15): s≡0 mod4, s≡1 mod15.

s=15m +1.

15m +1 ≡0 mod4 → 15m ≡-1 mod4 → 3m ≡3 mod4 → m≡1 mod4.

m=4k +1.

s=15*(4k +1)+1=60k +16.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=16.

16>=8, valid.

4. (d=5,e=12): s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod12.

s=12m +1.

12m +1 ≡0 mod5 → 12m ≡-1 mod5 → 2m ≡4 mod5 → m≡2 mod5.

m=5k +2.

s=12*(5k +2)+1=60k +25.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=25.

25>=8, valid.

5. (d=12,e=5): s≡0 mod12, s≡1 mod5.

s=5m +1.

5m +1 ≡0 mod12 →5m ≡-1 mod12 →5m ≡11 mod12.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod12, which is 5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod12.

So m ≡11*5=55≡7 mod12.

Thus, m=12k +7.

s=5*(12k +7) +1=60k +36.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=36.

36>=8, valid.

6. (d=15,e=4): s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod4.

s=4m +1.

4m +1 ≡0 mod15 →4m ≡-1 mod15 →4m ≡14 mod15.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod15, which is 4, since 4*4=16≡1 mod15.

Thus, m ≡14*4=56≡11 mod15.

m=15k +11.

s=4*(15k +11)+1=60k +45.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=45.

45>=8, valid.

7. (d=20,e=3): s≡0 mod20, s≡1 mod3.

s=3m +1.

3m +1 ≡0 mod20 →3m ≡-1 mod20 →3m ≡19 mod20.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod20, which is 7, since 3*7=21≡1 mod20.

Thus, m ≡19*7=133≡13 mod20.

m=20k +13.

s=3*(20k +13)+1=60k +40.

Within s <=60: k=0→s=40.

40>=8, valid.

8. (d=60,e=1): s≡0 mod60, s≡1 mod1.

s=60m.

Within s <=60: s=60.

60>=8, valid.

So, the valid s's are 21,16,25,36,45,40,60.

That's 7 s's.

Wait, same as k=30. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need a k with more distinct prime factors. Let's try k=2*3*5*7=210, but that's probably too high, but let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps k=12.

Wait, let's try k=24 again.

Wait, earlier with k=24, we had 3 s's. So, perhaps higher k's with more factors may not necessarily have more s's because the s's may fall below the sqrt(b) threshold.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write k = b-1 as a product of two coprime numbers d and e, which is 2^{number of prime factors of k}.

But earlier, for k=30, which has 3 prime factors, we had 8 co-prime pairs, but only 7 s's in the range.

Wait, perhaps the number of s's is roughly equal to the number of co-prime pairs, minus those that give s below the sqrt(b) threshold.

In that case, for k=30, we have 7 s's. For higher k's, we might get more.

Wait, let me try k=60, b=61.

As above, we have 7 s's. So, same as k=30.

Wait, perhaps the number of s's is limited by the number of co-prime pairs, but when k increases, the required s increases as well.

Wait, perhaps I should try k=120, which has more factors.

Wait, k=120, b=121.

Compute s's in [11,120].

k=120=2^3*3*5.

Number of co-prime pairs (d,e) with d*e=120 and gcd(d,e)=1.

These pairs are:

(1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15), (15,8), (24,5), (40,3), (120,1).

So, 8 pairs.

For each pair, compute s.

1. (1,120): s=1. <11, invalid.

2. (3,40): s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod40.

s=40m +1.

40m +1 ≡0 mod3 →40m ≡-1 mod3 →m ≡1 mod3.

So m=3k +1.

s=40*(3k +1)+1=120k +41.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=41.

41>=11, valid.

3. (5,24): s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod24.

s=24m +1.

24m +1 ≡0 mod5 →24m ≡-1 mod5 →4m ≡4 mod5 →m≡1 mod5.

m=5k +1.

s=24*(5k +1)+1=120k +25.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=25.

25>=11, valid.

4. (8,15): s≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod15.

s=15m +1.

15m +1 ≡0 mod8 →15m ≡-1 mod8 →7m ≡7 mod8 →m≡1 mod8.

m=8k +1.

s=15*(8k +1)+1=120k +16.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=16.

16>=11, valid.

5. (15,8): s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod8.

s=8m +1.

8m +1 ≡0 mod15 →8m ≡-1 mod15 →8m ≡14 mod15.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 8 mod15, which is 2, since 8*2=16≡1 mod15.

Thus, m≡14*2=28≡13 mod15.

m=15k +13.

s=8*(15k +13)+1=120k +105.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=105.

105>=11, valid.

6. (24,5): s≡0 mod24, s≡1 mod5.

s=5m +1.

5m +1 ≡0 mod24 →5m ≡-1 mod24 →5m ≡23 mod24.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod24, which is 5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod24.

Thus, m≡23*5=115≡115-4*24=115-96=19 mod24.

m=24k +19.

s=5*(24k +19)+1=120k +96.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=96.

96>=11, valid.

7. (40,3): s≡0 mod40, s≡1 mod3.

s=3m +1.

3m +1 ≡0 mod40 →3m ≡-1 mod40 →3m ≡39 mod40.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod40, which is 27, since 3*27=81≡1 mod40.

Thus, m≡39*27 mod40.

39*27=1053. 1053 mod40: 1053 -26*40=1053-1040=13.

Thus, m≡13 mod40.

m=40k +13.

s=3*(40k +13)+1=120k +40.

Within s <=120: k=0→s=40.

40>=11, valid.

8. (120,1): s=120.

120>=11, valid.

So, the valid s's are 41,25,16,105,96,40,120.

That's 7 s's.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe the number of s's increases when k is a factorial, but that's getting too big.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of k as a multiple of many small numbers, so that more s's fall into the required range.

Wait, but so far, even with k=60 and k=120, we only get 7 s's. The question asks for more than ten, so maybe I need a k with more co-prime pairs.

Wait, let's try k=210, which has prime factors 2,3,5,7. So, number of co-prime pairs is 2^4=16.

But this might take a while, but let's try.

k=210, b=211.

s from 15 (sqrt(211)=14.526, ceil=15) to 210.

Number of co-prime pairs (d,e) where d*e=210, gcd(d,e)=1.

The pairs are:

(1,210), (2,105), (3,70), (5,42), (6,35), (7,30), (10,21), (14,15), and their reverses.

Wait, actually, the co-prime pairs would be all pairs where d and e are coprime and d*e=210.

Since 210=2*3*5*7.

The co-prime pairs are:

(1,210), (2,105), (3,70), (5,42), (6,35), (7,30), (10,21), (14,15), and their reverses, totaling 16 pairs.

But let's list them:

(1,210), (210,1)

(2,105), (105,2)

(3,70), (70,3)

(5,42), (42,5)

(6,35), (35,6)

(7,30), (30,7)

(10,21), (21,10)

(14,15), (15,14)

So, 16 pairs.

For each pair, compute s.

1. (1,210): s=1. <15, invalid.

2. (210,1): s=210. >=15, valid.

2. (2,105): s≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod105.

s=105m +1.

105m +1 ≡0 mod2 →105m ≡-1 mod2 →m≡1 mod2.

m=2k +1.

s=105*(2k +1)+1=210k +106.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=106.

106>=15, valid.

3. (105,2): s≡0 mod105, s≡1 mod2.

s=2m +1.

2m +1 ≡0 mod105 →2m ≡-1 mod105 →m≡(104) mod105.

m=105k +104.

s=2*(105k +104)+1=210k +209.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=209.

209>=15, valid.

4. (3,70): s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod70.

s=70m +1.

70m +1 ≡0 mod3 →70m ≡-1 mod3 →1m ≡2 mod3 →m≡2 mod3.

m=3k +2.

s=70*(3k +2)+1=210k +141.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=141.

141>=15, valid.

5. (70,3): s≡0 mod70, s≡1 mod3.

s=3m +1.

3m +1 ≡0 mod70 →3m ≡-1 mod70 →3m ≡69 mod70.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod70, which is 47, since 3*47=141≡1 mod70.

Thus, m≡69*47 mod70.

Compute 69*47:

70*47=3290, 69*47=3290 -47=3243.

3243 mod70: 3243 /70=46*70=3220, 3243-3220=23.

Thus, m≡23 mod70.

m=70k +23.

s=3*(70k +23)+1=210k +70.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=70.

70>=15, valid.

6. (5,42): s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod42.

s=42m +1.

42m +1 ≡0 mod5 →42m ≡-1 mod5 →2m ≡4 mod5 →m≡2 mod5.

m=5k +2.

s=42*(5k +2)+1=210k +85.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=85.

85>=15, valid.

7. (42,5): s≡0 mod42, s≡1 mod5.

s=5m +1.

5m +1 ≡0 mod42 →5m ≡-1 mod42 →5m ≡41 mod42.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod42, which is 17, since 5*17=85≡1 mod42.

Thus, m≡41*17 mod42.

41*17=697.

697 mod42: 42*16=672, 697-672=25.

Thus, m≡25 mod42.

m=42k +25.

s=5*(42k +25)+1=210k +126.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=126.

126>=15, valid.

8. (6,35): s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod35.

s=35m +1.

35m +1 ≡0 mod6 →35m ≡-1 mod6 →35 mod6=5, so 5m ≡5 mod6 →m≡1 mod6.

m=6k +1.

s=35*(6k +1)+1=210k +36.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=36.

36>=15, valid.

9. (35,6): s≡0 mod35, s≡1 mod6.

s=6m +1.

6m +1 ≡0 mod35 →6m ≡-1 mod35 →6m ≡34 mod35.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 6 mod35, which is 6, since 6*6=36≡1 mod35.

Thus, m≡34*6=204≡204-5*35=204-175=29 mod35.

m=35k +29.

s=6*(35k +29)+1=210k +175.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=175.

175>=15, valid.

10. (7,30): s≡0 mod7, s≡1 mod30.

s=30m +1.

30m +1 ≡0 mod7 →30m ≡-1 mod7 →30 mod7=2 →2m ≡6 mod7 →m≡3 mod7.

m=7k +3.

s=30*(7k +3)+1=210k +91.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=91.

91>=15, valid.

11. (30,7): s≡0 mod30, s≡1 mod7.

s=7m +1.

7m +1 ≡0 mod30 →7m ≡-1 mod30 →7m ≡29 mod30.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 7 mod30, which is 13, since 7*13=91≡1 mod30.

Thus, m≡29*13=377≡377-12*30=377-360=17 mod30.

m=30k +17.

s=7*(30k +17)+1=210k +120.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=120.

120>=15, valid.

12. (10,21): s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod21.

s=21m +1.

21m +1 ≡0 mod10 →21m ≡-1 mod10 →1m ≡9 mod10 →m≡9 mod10.

m=10k +9.

s=21*(10k +9)+1=210k +190.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=190.

190>=15, valid.

13. (21,10): s≡0 mod21, s≡1 mod10.

s=10m +1.

10m +1 ≡0 mod21 →10m ≡-1 mod21 →10m ≡20 mod21.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 10 mod21, which is 19, since 10*19=190≡190-9*21=190-189=1 mod21.

Thus, m≡20*19=380≡380-18*21=380-378=2 mod21.

m=21k +2.

s=10*(21k +2)+1=210k +21.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=21.

21>=15, valid.

14. (14,15): s≡0 mod14, s≡1 mod15.

s=15m +1.

15m +1 ≡0 mod14 →15m ≡-1 mod14 →15 mod14=1 →m ≡-1 mod14 →m≡13 mod14.

m=14k +13.

s=15*(14k +13)+1=210k +196.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=196.

196>=15, valid.

15. (15,14): s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod14.

s=14m +1.

14m +1 ≡0 mod15 →14m ≡-1 mod15 →14m ≡14 mod15 →m≡1 mod15.

m=15k +1.

s=14*(15k +1)+1=210k +15.

Within s <=210: k=0→s=15.

15>=15, valid.

16. (210,1): s=210.

210>=15, valid.

Wait, let's count the valid s's:

From pairs:

2. s=106

3. s=209

4. s=141

5. s=70

6. s=85

7. s=126

8. s=36

9. s=175

10. s=91

11. s=120

12. s=190

13. s=21

14. s=196

15. s=15

16. s=210

Wait, did I miss some? Let's recount:

1. (1,210): invalid

2. (210,1): 210

3. (2,105):106

4. (105,2):209

5. (3,70):141

6. (70,3):70

7. (5,42):85

8. (42,5):126

9. (6,35):36

10. (35,6):175

11. (7,30):91

12. (30,7):120

13. (10,21):190

14. (21,10):21

15. (14,15):196

16. (15,14):15

17. (210,1):210

Wait, that's 16 pairs, but some may result in the same s.

Wait, s=210 is from (210,1).

s=209 from (105,2).

s=196 from (14,15).

s=190 from (10,21).

s=175 from (35,6).

s=152? Wait, no, let me list all:

From above, the s's are:

210, 106,209,141,70,85,126,36,175,91,120,190,21,196,15.

Wait, that's 15 s's.

Wait, let me list them numerically:

15,21,36,70,85,91,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,209,210.

That's 15 s's.

So, for b=211, k=210, we have 15 b-eautiful numbers.

That's more than ten. So, is 211 the least such b?

Wait, but earlier for k=60, we had 7 s's. For k=210, we have 15 s's.

But perhaps there's a smaller k where the number of s's exceeds ten.

Wait, let's try k=60 again.

Wait, earlier for k=60, we had 7 s's. Let me see if I can find a k between 60 and 210 that gives more than ten s's.

Alternatively, perhaps k=120 gives more.

Wait, earlier for k=120, we had 7 s's. So, perhaps k=210 is the first k that gives more than ten s's.

But let's see if there's a smaller k.

Wait, let's try k=30*2=60, but we saw 7 s's.

What about k=420? No, that's even larger.

Wait, perhaps k=360.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of s's increases with the number of co-prime pairs, which is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}.

So, for k=2*3*5*7=210, we have 4 prime factors, so 2^4=16 co-prime pairs, but due to the range, we get 15 s's.

Wait, but maybe for k=2*3*5*7*11=2310, we'd get even more, but that's way larger.

But the question is to find the smallest b, so the smallest k, such that the number of s's is more than ten.

So, perhaps the earliest k where the number of co-prime pairs is sufficient to give more than ten s's in the required range is k=210, leading to b=211.

But wait, let's check if there's a smaller k with more co-prime pairs.

Wait, let's try k=60.

Wait, k=60 has prime factors 2^2,3,5. So, ω(k)=3, so 2^3=8 co-prime pairs.

Earlier, for k=60, we had 7 s's. So, to get more than ten s's, we might need a k with more prime factors.

Wait, let's try k=120, which has prime factors 2^3,3,5. Same as k=60, so same number of co-prime pairs: 8.

But we had 7 s's.

Wait, perhaps k=180.

k=180=2^2*3^2*5. So, ω(k)=3, same as 60 and 120.

So, number of co-prime pairs=8.

But perhaps more s's fall into the required range.

Let me compute for k=180, b=181.

s must be >=14 (sqrt(181)=13.45, ceil=14) to 180.

Compute s's for each co-prime pair:

The co-prime pairs (d,e) where d*e=180 and gcd(d,e)=1.

These are:

(1,180), (4,45), (5,36), (9,20), (20,9), (36,5), (45,4), (180,1).

So, 8 pairs.

Compute each s:

1. (1,180): s=1. <14, invalid.

2. (180,1): s=180. >=14, valid.

3. (4,45): s≡0 mod4, s≡1 mod45.

s=45m +1.

45m +1 ≡0 mod4 →45m ≡-1 mod4 →1m ≡3 mod4 →m≡3 mod4.

m=4k +3.

s=45*(4k +3)+1=180k +136.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=136.

136>=14, valid.

4. (45,4): s≡0 mod45, s≡1 mod4.

s=4m +1.

4m +1 ≡0 mod45 →4m ≡-1 mod45 →4m ≡44 mod45.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod45, which is 34, since 4*34=136≡136-3*45=136-135=1 mod45.

Thus, m≡44*34 mod45.

44*34=1496.

1496 mod45: 45*33=1485, 1496-1485=11.

Thus, m≡11 mod45.

m=45k +11.

s=4*(45k +11)+1=180k +45.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=45.

45>=14, valid.

5. (5,36): s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod36.

s=36m +1.

36m +1 ≡0 mod5 →36m ≡-1 mod5 →1m ≡4 mod5 →m≡4 mod5.

m=5k +4.

s=36*(5k +4)+1=180k +145.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=145.

145>=14, valid.

6. (36,5): s≡0 mod36, s≡1 mod5.

s=5m +1.

5m +1 ≡0 mod36 →5m ≡-1 mod36 →5m ≡35 mod36.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 5 mod36, which is 29, since 5*29=145≡145-4*36=145-144=1 mod36.

Thus, m≡35*29 mod36.

35*29=1015.

1015 mod36: 36*28=1008, 1015-1008=7.

Thus, m≡7 mod36.

m=36k +7.

s=5*(36k +7)+1=180k +36.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=36.

36>=14, valid.

7. (9,20): s≡0 mod9, s≡1 mod20.

s=20m +1.

20m +1 ≡0 mod9 →20m ≡-1 mod9 →2m ≡8 mod9 →m≡4 mod9.

m=9k +4.

s=20*(9k +4)+1=180k +81.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=81.

81>=14, valid.

8. (20,9): s≡0 mod20, s≡1 mod9.

s=9m +1.

9m +1 ≡0 mod20 →9m ≡-1 mod20 →9m ≡19 mod20.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 9 mod20, which is 9, since 9*9=81≡1 mod20.

Thus, m≡19*9=171≡171-8*20=171-160=11 mod20.

m=20k +11.

s=9*(20k +11)+1=180k +100.

Within s <=180: k=0→s=100.

100>=14, valid.

So, the valid s's are 180,136,45,145,36,81,100.

That's 7 s's.

Same as before.

So, it seems that k=210 is the first k where the number of s's exceeds ten.

Thus, the least b is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**: A number \( n \) in base \( b \) is represented as \( d_1 d_0 \), where \( n = d_1 \cdot b + d_0 \). The sum of the digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation**: Let \( s = d_1 + d_0 \). Then \( s^2 = d_1 \cdot b + d_0 \). Rearranging gives \( s^2 - s = d_1 \cdot (b - 1) \), leading to \( d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1} \).

3. **Conditions for Validity**: \( d_1 \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), and \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).

4. **Finding \( b \)**: For each \( b \), we check all possible \( s \) values in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \) to see if they satisfy the conditions. The goal is to find the smallest \( b \) where more than ten such \( s \) exist.

5. **Analysis**: Through detailed analysis and computation, it was determined that for \( b = 211 \), the number of valid \( s \) values exceeds ten. This is because \( b - 1 = 210 \) has numerous factors, leading to multiple valid solutions.

### Conclusion:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \( \boxed{211} \).
