Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A b-eautiful number is a positive integer n that has exactly two digits when written in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81). 

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So a is at least 1, and both a and c are less than b.

So, n can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where 1 ≤ a < b, and 0 ≤ c < b. The condition for being b-eautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) must be an integer since a and c are integers. Let's denote sqrt(n) as k, so n = k². Therefore, the equation becomes k = a + c, and n = a * b + c = k².

So, putting it together, we have:
1. n = a * b + c
2. n = k²
3. k = a + c

So substituting equation 3 into equation 2, we get:
a * b + c = (a + c)²

Let me write that equation down:
a * b + c = (a + c)^2

Let's expand the right side:
a * b + c = a² + 2ac + c²

Bring all terms to one side:
a² + 2ac + c² - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe we can rearrange the terms. Let's group terms with a and terms with c:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic in terms of a. So, for given c and b, we can solve for a. But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the quadratic equation must yield integer solutions for a.

Alternatively, maybe we can express b in terms of a and c. Let's go back to the equation:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2

Solving for b gives:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify numerator:

= (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

= a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, the term (c² - c)/a must be an integer. Therefore, a must divide (c² - c). So, a | (c² - c).

Also, since a ≥ 1 and c < b, and b is at least 2, but since we are looking for the minimal b where there are more than 10 such numbers, perhaps we can think about the constraints on a and c.

Wait, let's think about possible values of a and c. Since both a and c are digits in base b, a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1. But since we're trying to find for each b, the number of pairs (a,c) such that n = a*b + c is a square, and a + c = sqrt(n). So, for each b, we can count the number of (a,c) pairs that satisfy these conditions.

But since in our problem, we need to find the minimal b where the number of such pairs exceeds 10, perhaps we can model the equation a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me write that equation again:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me rearrange for b:

b = ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a

So, for given a and c, b must equal this value. But since a and c must be digits in base b, so a must be less than b, and c must be less than b. So, these impose constraints on possible a and c for given b.

Alternatively, for each possible k (since k = sqrt(n) must be integer), we have n = k², which is a two
