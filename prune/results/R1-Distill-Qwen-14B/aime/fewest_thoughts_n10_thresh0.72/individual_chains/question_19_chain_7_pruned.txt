Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB times AC in triangle ABC. Let me try to break down the given information and figure out how to approach this.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's recall some properties about triangle centers and maybe some formulas that connect the inradius, circumradius, and the sides of the triangle.

I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

And the inradius r is given by:

r = Δ/s

where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a+b+c)/2.

But wait, in this problem, they mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a crucial piece of information that I might need to use. I'm not exactly sure how that connects yet, but maybe I can find a relationship between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides using some coordinate geometry or vector methods.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter to the other parameters. Let me think. There is a formula that relates OI (the distance between the circumcenter and incenter) to R, r, and other terms.

Right! The formula is:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. I think so. So OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r).

Given that OI is the distance between the two centers, and in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is the segment from the inradius to vertex A, and it's perpendicular to OI.

Hmm, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vector methods or trigonometric identities. But maybe starting with coordinate geometry is a good idea.

Let me set up the coordinate system such that the circumcenter O is at the origin (0,0). That might simplify things because then the coordinates of the circumradius points will lie on the circle of radius 13.

So, if O is at (0,0), then points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of this circle with radius 13.

Now, the incenter I has coordinates (x, y). The vector from O to I is (x, y), and the vector from I to A is (A_x - x, A_y - y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.

So, (A_x - x)*x + (A_y - y)*y = 0.

But without knowing the exact coordinates of A and I, this might not be straightforward. Maybe I can find some relation using the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, maybe another approach. The length of IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides.

I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by the formula:
