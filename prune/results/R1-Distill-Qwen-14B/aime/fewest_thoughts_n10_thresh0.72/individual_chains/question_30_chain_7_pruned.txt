Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω is a root of the equation x^13 = 1, which means ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Maybe that can be useful later.

Looking at the product, each term is of the form 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. I wonder if I can simplify this expression somehow or find a pattern when considering all k from 0 to 12.

Let me consider each term in the product:

For each k, the term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, the term is a quadratic in z. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots.

Wait, 2 - 2z + z^2 can be rewritten as z^2 - 2z + 2. Let me check if this factors. The discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Hmm, okay.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this quadratic as (z - a)(z - b) where a and b are roots. Let me find the roots.

The roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0 can be found using the quadratic formula:

z = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). That means each term in the product can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

I can separate this into two products:

Product = [Product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [Product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Hmm, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all roots ω^k of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ_n(x). But wait, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for ω, which is degree 12. So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (x -
