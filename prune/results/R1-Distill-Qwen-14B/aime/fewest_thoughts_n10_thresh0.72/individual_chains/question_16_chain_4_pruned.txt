Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I then have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me break this down.

First, I should consider small primes and check whether n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p² for some n. The primes to check are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., in order.

Starting with p=2:
We need to see if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2²=4.

Let's compute n⁴ + 1 mod 4 for various n:
n=1: 1 + 1 = 2; 2 mod 4 is 2, not 0. So not divisible.
n=2: 16 + 1 = 17; 17 mod 4 is 1, not 0.
n=3: 81 + 1 =82; 82 mod4 is 2, not 0.
n=4: 256 +1=257; 257 mod4 is 1.
Wait, it alternates between 2 and 1 mod4. So, n⁴ mod4: n even: 0 mod4, so n⁴ +1=1 mod4. n odd: 1 mod4, so n⁴ +1=2 mod4. So, n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod4. Hence, 2² doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is 3. Check if 9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8:
n=1: 1 mod9. 1+1=2 mod9. Not 0.
n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7+1=8 mod9. Not 0.
n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0+1=1 mod9. Not 0.
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 256: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5. Not 0.
n=5: 625 mod9. 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5. Not 0.
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod9=0. 0+1=1. Not 0.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: sum the digits: 2+4+0+1=7, which is 7 mod9. 7+1=8. Not 0.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19; 1+9=10; 1+0=1. So 1 mod9. 1+1=2. Not 0.

So none of the n from 1 to 8 give n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9. Since 9 is 3², perhaps 3 is out?

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check n=4 again. 4⁴=256. 256/9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5, not 0. Correct.

So, 3 is also a prime where n⁴ +1 is never divisible by 9. So p=3 is not the prime we're looking for.

Next prime is 5. Let's check if 25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

Wait, that's a lot, but perhaps I can find a pattern or use some properties.

Alternatively, I can check whether -1 is a quartic residue mod5. That is, does x⁴ ≡ -1 mod5 have a solution?

Compute x⁴ mod5:

x=1: 1 mod5
x=2: 16 mod5=1
x=3: 81 mod5=1
x=4: 256 mod5=1

Wait, so all x not divisible by 5 have x⁴ ≡1 mod5. So x⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5. So n⁴ +1 is always 2 mod5, which is not 0. So no solution mod5, so certainly no solution mod25. So p=5 is out.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if for mod25, maybe there's a solution? But if n is not a multiple of 5, then n⁴ ≡1 mod5, so n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5, which is not 0, so n⁴ +1 cannot be divisible by5, let alone 25. So 5 is out.

Next prime:7.

Check whether 49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

First, check modulo7.

Compute x⁴ mod7:

x=1:1
x=2:16 mod7=2
x=3:81 mod7=4 (since 7*11=77, 81-77=4)
x=4:256 mod7. 256 /7=36*7=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod7.
x=5:625 mod7. Let's compute 625: 7*89=623, 625-623=2. So 2 mod7.
x=6:1296 mod7. Let's compute 1296/7=185*7=1295, so 1296 mod7=1.

So, the quartic residues mod7 are: 1,2,4.

So, when is x⁴ ≡-1 mod7? Since -1 mod7 is 6. So none of the quartic residues are 6 mod7. Therefore, there is no solution to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod7. Hence, n⁴ +1 can't be divisible by7, let alone 49. So p=7 is out.

Next prime:11.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should check 13 or 17? Wait, no, primes in order.

Wait, next prime after 7 is 11.

But let's check 11.

Check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 121 (11²).

First, check mod11.

Compute x⁴ mod11.

x:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

1⁴=1 mod11.

2⁴=16 mod11=5.

3⁴=81 mod11=4 (since 11*7=77, 81-77
