Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for each column. Also, once I place some chips, any additional chip I try to place should violate one of these two conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the constraints. Each row must have all chips of the same color, right? So, for any given row, it can be all white, all black, or maybe even empty. Same for each column. Wait, but if a row is empty, then technically, the column constraints would still apply. But since we can place some chips, I think the idea is to have a configuration where adding any more is impossible without violating the row or column color uniformity.

So, the problem is asking for the number of such valid configurations. Let me think about how to model this.

Each row and each column must be monochromatic. So, perhaps each row is either white, black, or empty? Wait, no, because each cell can have at most one chip, but the entire row or column must be the same color if any chip is placed there. So, if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color, and similarly for columns.

Wait, but if a row has some chips, say white, then all chips in that row must be white. But then, looking at the columns, the same applies. So, if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. But the problem is the interaction between rows and columns.

I'm thinking that perhaps each row is assigned a color (white or black) or is empty, and each column is assigned a color or is empty, but with the constraint that if a row is assigned a color, then all columns intersecting that row must also be assigned the same color if they have any chips.

Wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should model this as a matrix where each cell can be white, black, or empty. But the constraints are that each row is either all white, all black, or all empty. Similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or all empty.

And, importantly, the configuration should be maximal; that is, you can't
