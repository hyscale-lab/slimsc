Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We're told that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Alice picks some set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob is creating a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is an element of A. The total number of such sets B is 2024, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Alright, so I need to figure out what A must be such that the number of finite nonempty sets B where max(B) is in A is 2024. Then, once I know A, I can sum its elements.

Let me think about how Bob is constructing these sets B. Each set B is finite and nonempty, and the maximum element of B must be in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum. How many such sets are there for each a?

If a is the maximum of B, then all other elements of B must be less than a. So, for a given a, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each element of B must be less than a.

Wait, no. Not exactly. Because B is a set, the elements have to be distinct. So, for each a in A, the number of possible B sets where max(B) = a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. Because each such subset can be combined with {a} to form a set B where a is the maximum. So, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, since each element from 1 to a-1 can be either included or excluded. But wait, that counts all subsets, including the empty set. However, B must be non-empty. So, the number of non-empty subsets is 2^{a-1} - 1, because we subtract the empty set.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, no. Let me clarify. For each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each such subset, when combined with {a}, forms a set B with maximum a. But wait, the subsets can be empty. Because if the subset is empty, then B is just {a}, which is a valid non-empty set. So, actually, for each a, the number of sets B with maximum a is equal to 2^{a-1}, because each element from 1 to a-1 can be either included or not, and even if none are included, {a} is allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that B is a finite nonempty set. So, if a is in A, then {a} is a valid set B, which is counted in Bob's list. So,
