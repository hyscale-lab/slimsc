Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should recall that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, rectangles in a polygon. For a rectangle to be formed, it needs four sides, each pair of opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But since the dodecagon is regular, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles between them.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the sides are between adjacent vertices, and diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, up to 5 vertices because beyond that, they start repeating on the other side.

So, the diagonals can be of different lengths. For example, in a dodecagon, the diagonals that skip 1 vertex are the shortest diagonals, then skipping 2, 3, etc., up to skipping 5 vertices, which gives the longest diagonal. So, the maximum number of different diagonal lengths is 5.

But how does this help me find the rectangles?

Well, in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. But in a dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form lines that are at angles which are multiples of 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30. So, the sides are every 30 degrees.

Wait, for a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular, so the angle between the sides should be 90 degrees. Hmm, but in a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides are 30 degrees apart. So, 90 degrees would correspond to three steps of 30 degrees each. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are lines that are separated by 3 steps (i.e., 90 degrees) in the polygon.

Wait, that might
