Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1, where n is the order. Since ω is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1, it must satisfy ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct.

So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity except ω^0 = 1? Wait, no, k goes from 0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 as well. But wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) which is (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So the first term is 1, and the rest are for k=1 to 12.

So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Therefore, I can focus on computing the product from k=1 to 12.

Let me denote P as the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I need to compute P and then find P mod 1000.

Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can factor the expression or relate it to some polynomial whose roots are these terms.

Wait, let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe I can factor this or find a polynomial that has roots at ω^k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this term as a polynomial evaluated at ω^k. Let me think.

Let me set x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, for each x, which is a primitive 13th root of unity (since k is from 1 to 12, so x ≠ 1), we have the term 2 - 2x + x^2.

So the product P is the product over x ≠ 1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2). That's the same as the product over all x^k where x is a 13th root of unity except x=1 of (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Wait, that seems useful because the product over all roots of a polynomial except x=1 can sometimes be related to evaluating the polynomial at certain points or using cyclotomic polynomials.

Wait, let's think about polynomials. The product over all (x - a) where a are the roots of some polynomial is the polynomial itself. But in this case, I have a product of (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at each root x = ω^k, except k=0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product P is the product Q(ω^k) for k=1 to 12.

So, P = product_{k=1}^{12} Q(ω^k) = product_{x ≠ 1} Q(x), where x are the 13th roots of unity.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that for a polynomial f(x), the product over all roots x of unity of f(x) is equal to something. Hmm, perhaps I can use properties of cyclotomic polynomials.

The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. For n=13, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, but that's because 13 is prime.

Wait, but I'm dealing with all 13th roots of unity, not just the primitive ones. So, including 1. So, the minimal polynomial for all 13th roots of unity is x^13 - 1 = 0. So, x^13 -1 factors as (x - 1)Φ_13(x).

But in any case, perhaps I can consider the product over all x^13 =1, x ≠1 of Q(x). So, product_{x^13=1, x≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Wait, how can I compute that? Maybe I can use the fact that product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = x^13 - a^13, but that's when a is a constant.

But in this case, I'm evaluating a quadratic at each root x. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = x^13 - a^13. So, if I have product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = x^13 - a^13. But in our case, we have product_{x^13=1, x≠1} Q(x), which is product_{x^13=1, x≠1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Wait, another approach: Let me denote f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then, the product P is product_{x^13=1, x≠1} f(x). So, that would be equal to product_{x^13=1} f(x) divided by f(1). Because the product over x^13=1 is the product over x=1 and x≠1, so dividing by f(1) gives the product over x≠1.

So, product_{x^13=1, x≠1} f(x) = [product_{x^13=1} f(x)] / f(1).

So, if I can compute product_{x^13=1} f(x), then divide by f(1), and that would give me P.

Now, product_{x^13=1} f(x) is equal to product_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

But wait, how can I compute that? Maybe I can consider that for any polynomial f(x), product_{x^n=1} f(x) can be expressed using the resultant or something.

Wait, another idea: Maybe use the fact that product_{x^n=1} (x - a) = x^n - a^n. But here, it's not (x - a), it's (x^2 - 2x + 2). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write f(x) as (x^2 - 2x + 2) and consider the product of f(x) over all x where x^13=1.

So, product_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = product_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2).

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can think of this as evaluating the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1.

Wait, another approach: Since x^13 = 1, I can write x^k = x^{k mod 13}. So, perhaps I can express f(x) in terms of x^13.

Wait, maybe I can write f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Since x^13=1, x^2 is x^{-11}, and so on. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of f(x) as a quadratic and find its roots. Let's compute the roots of f(x)=0.

The roots of x^2 - 2x + 2=0 are given by x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. So, f(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, product_{x^13=1} f(x) = product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i)) * product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 - i)).

Each of these products is the product of (x - a) over all x^13=1, which is equal to (x^13 - a^13) evaluated at x=1? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, for any a, product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = (x^13 - a^13) evaluated at x=1? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, the product over x of (x - a) where x runs over all 13th roots of unity is equal to (x^13 - a^13)/(x - a), but that's if x is a variable. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, no, more accurately, if you have a polynomial f(x) and you take the product of f(x) over all roots of another polynomial g(x) = 0, that might relate to the resultant, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I can notice that for any a, product_{x^13=1} (x - a) is equal to a^13 - 1? No, wait, that's not right because if x^13 = 1, then product (x - a) would be something else.

Wait, hold on. Let me think about it. Let's consider that the product over x^13=1 of (x - a) is equal to the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x - a, but perhaps that's too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = (a^{13} -1)/(a -1) when a ≠1? Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, let's test for a simple case. Let me take n=2. Then, the product over x^2=1 of (x - a) is (1 - a)(-1 - a) = (a^2 -1). Hmm, that's interesting. So for n=2, product_{x^2=1} (x - a) = a^2 -1.

Similarly, for n=3, product_{x^3=1} (x - a) = (1 - a)(ω - a)(ω^2 - a). But since 1 + ω + ω^2 = 0, maybe it can be expressed as (a^3 -1). Wait, let's compute it.

Wait, (x - a) evaluated at x=1, x=ω, x=ω^2 is (1 - a)(ω - a)(ω^2 - a). Let me compute this:

(1 - a)(ω - a)(ω^2 - a) = (1 - a)[(ω - a)(ω^2 - a)] = (1 - a)[ω*ω^2 -a(ω + ω^2) + a^2] = (1 - a)[1 - a(-1) + a^2] because ω + ω^2 = -1.

So, = (1 - a)[1 + a + a^2] = (1 - a)(1 + a + a^2) = 1 - a^3.

Ah! So for n=3, product_{x^3=1} (x - a) = 1 - a^3. Similarly, for n=2, product_{x^2=1} (x -a) = 1 - a^2.

So perhaps in general, product_{x^n=1} (x - a) = 1 - a^n.

Wait, that seems to fit. So, for n=13, product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = 1 - a^{13}.

So, that formula must be correct then.

Therefore, product_{x^13=1} (x - a) = 1 - a^{13}.

So, going back to our problem, product_{x^13=1} f(x) = product_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) = product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to [product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 + i)))] * [product_{x^13=1} (x - (1 - i)))].

Using the formula, each product is 1 - (1 + i)^13 and 1 - (1 - i)^13, respectively.

So, product_{x^13=1} f(x) = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].

Therefore, product_{x^13=1, x ≠1} f(x) = [product_{x^13=1} f(x)] / f(1).

Since f(1) = 1^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.

So, P = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13] / 1 = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let me compute (1 + i)^13.

Note that 1 + i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13π/4}.

Compute each modulus and argument.

Let's compute (sqrt(2))^13.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the angles: 13π/4. Let's reduce 13π/4 modulo 2π.

13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 + 3π. Since 3π is equivalent to π in terms of direction (since 3π = π + 2π). So, 13π/4 is the same as π/4 in terms of the angle, but in which direction?

Wait, 13π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8, so subtract 2π once: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, 5π/4 is in the third quadrant.

Similarly, 13π/4 - 2π * 2 = 13π/4 - 16π/4 = -3π/4. So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{i*(-3π/4)} = cos(-3π/4) + i sin(-3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - i sin(3π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to just compute it as 5π/4.

Wait, 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. So, 3π is π more than 2π, so it's equivalent to π + π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Let's compute this:

Multiply 64*sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2):

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64*sqrt(2) multiplied by (-i sqrt(2)/2) is:

64*sqrt(2)*(-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-i)*(2)/2 = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Compute this:

64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = same as before, -64.

64*sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*i*(2)/2 = 64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i.

So, now we have:

[1 - (1 + i)^13] = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.

[1 - (1 - i)^13] = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.

So, the product P is (65 +64i)(65 -64i).

Compute this product:

(65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096 * (-1)) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

So, P = 8321.

But wait, I thought P was the product from k=1 to 12, which is equal to 8321. But the original product was from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0, which is 1. So the total product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.

But the question is to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 mod 1000.

Compute 8321 / 1000: 8*1000=8000, 8321 -8000=321.

So, remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I might have made a miscalculation.

First, product_{x^13=1} f(x) = [1 - (1+i)^13][1 - (1-i)^13] = (65 +64i)(65 -64i)=65^2 +64^2=4225 +4096=8321.

Then, product_{x≠1} f(x) = 8321 / f(1) = 8321 /1=8321.

So, the product from k=0 to 12 is 8321, since k=0 contributes 1.

Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, yes, because 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321.

So, the remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer is 321.

But wait, let me just verify the computation of (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 again, because that's a crucial step.

(1 + i) has modulus sqrt(2) and angle π/4. So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*(13π/4)}.

As above, (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Angle 13π/4: subtract 2π*1 = 8π/4, so 13π/4 - 2π = 5π/4, which is in the third quadrant.

So, e^{i*5π/4} is (-sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2), so multiplying by 64*sqrt(2):

Real part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2)/2 = -64.

Imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Correct.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13: same modulus, angle -π/4.

(1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*13π/4}.

Again, 13π/4 is 5π/4 when reduced, so e^{-i*5π/4} is cos(5π/4) + i sin(-5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

Multiply by 64*sqrt(2):

Real part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) = 64.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Correct.

Then, [1 - (1 + i)^13] = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i.

[1 - (1 - i)^13] = 1 - (-64 +64i) = 65 -64i.

Multiplying these gives 65^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Correct.

So, product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321. So, the answer is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recap:

- Each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

- Let x = ω^k, so each term is x^2 - 2x +2.

- The product over x ≠1 is the product from k=1 to 12.

- So, product_{x^13=1, x≠1} (x^2 - 2x +2) = [product_{x^13=1} (x^2 - 2x +2)] / f(1).

- f(1) =1, so product is [product_{x^13=1} (x^2 -2x +2)].

- Which is [product_{x^13=1} (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i))].

- Which is [1 - (1 +i)^13][1 - (1 -i)^13].

- Compute (1 +i)^13 = -64 -64i, (1 - i)^13= -64 +64i.

- Then, 1 - (-64 -64i)=65 +64i, 1 - (-64 +64i)=65 -64i.

- Multiply them: (65)^2 + (64)^2 =4225 +4096=8321.

- So, total product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 321.


The problem involves finding the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity.

1. **Simplify the Product**:  
   Each term in the product can be written as \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\). Let \(x = \omega^k\), so each term becomes \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). The product is over all 13th roots of unity except \(x = 1\), so we need to compute \(\prod_{x^{13}=1, x \neq 1} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\).

2. **Factor the Quadratic**:  
   The quadratic \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) factors as \((x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\), where \(1 \pm i\) are the roots.

3. **Product Over All Roots**:  
   The product over all 13th roots of unity (including \(x = 1\)) is \(\prod_{x^{13}=1} (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))\). Using the formula \(\prod_{x^n=1} (x - a) = 1 - a^n\), this becomes:
   \[
   [1 - (1 + i)^{13}] \cdot [1 - (1 - i)^{13}].
   \]

4. **Compute Powers**:  
   Compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). Each has a modulus of \(\sqrt{2}\) and angles \(\pi/4\) and \(-\pi/4\), respectively. After computation:
   \[
   (1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i.
   \]

5. **Evaluate Products**:  
   Substitute back:
   \[
   [1 - (-64 - 64i)] = 65 + 64i, \quad [1 - (-64 + 64i)] = 65 - 64i.
   \]
   Multiply these:
   \[
   (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
   \]

6. **Final Result**:  
   The product is 8321. The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:
   \[
   8321 \mod 1000 = 321.
   \]

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
