Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. Depending on the type of triangle, these can be located in different positions. For example, in an acute triangle, they're inside, but in an obtuse triangle, the circumcenter is outside.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and circumcenter O. That seems like a specific condition, so maybe it can help relate some lengths or angles in the triangle.

I think I should draw a diagram to visualize. Let me sketch triangle ABC, mark O and I somewhere. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, I can imagine a right angle at point I between IA and OI. Hmm, not sure yet, but maybe using coordinates could help. Sometimes, placing the triangle in a coordinate system can simplify things.

Let me consider placing point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. If I do that, then the line IA is just the line from I (0,0) to A (some point). The line OI will be from I (0,0) to O (another point). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.

So, if I denote O as (h, k), then the vector OI is (h, k), and the vector IA is (x, y), where A is (x, y). The dot product is hx + ky = 0. So, hx + ky = 0.

But wait, since I is the incenter, and O is the circumcenter, their positions are related to the triangle's sides and angles. Maybe there's a formula that relates the distance between O and I to other quantities.

I remember that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula: OI^2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that.

Yes, I think that's correct. So, substituting the given values, R is 13 and r is 6. So, OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, that's interesting. So, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). But also, in our coordinate system, O is at (h, k), so the distance from I (0,0) to O is sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = sqrt(13). So, h^2 + k^2 =13.

Also, from earlier, the dot product of OI and IA is zero. So, vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is (x, y). So, hx + ky =0.

But A is a vertex of the triangle. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Then, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter. The formula is r = Area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

We know r is 6, so Area = 6s. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius R as (a*b*c)/(4R). So, Area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

Therefore, 6s = (a*b*c)/52. So, a*b*c = 6s *52 = 312 s.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet. Maybe I should think about coordinates more.

Since I is at (0,0), let me consider the coordinates of A, B, C. Let me denote A as (x, y), B as (p, q), and C as (u, v). But that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), then the line IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the line from O (h,k) to I. So, their dot product is zero, which gives hx + ky = 0.

But A is a vertex of the triangle, so maybe I can express A in terms of the triangle's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric relations. Let me think about the angles.

In triangle ABC, the distance from I to A is... Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps using vector methods.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates with I at the origin and O at (0, d) along the y-axis, such that OI is along the y-axis. Wait, but then IA would have to be perpendicular to OI, which is along the y-axis, so IA would be along the x-axis.

But if OI is along the y-axis, then O is at (0, sqrt(13)), since OI is sqrt(13). Then, point A would be somewhere on the x-axis because IA is perpendicular to OI. So, point A is (a, 0) for some a. But I is at (0,0), so IA is just the vector (a, 0), which is along the x-axis. OI is along the y-axis, so their dot product is zero, which satisfies the condition.

Hmm, that might be a good coordinate system to use. Let me try that.

So, I is at (0,0), O is at (0, sqrt(13)). Point A is at (a, 0). Then, the triangle ABC has vertex A at (a,0), with I at (0,0), and O at (0, sqrt(13)).

Wait, but in this setup, point A is on the x-axis, and I is the incenter at (0,0). So, the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to each side. Therefore, the y-coordinate of each side is 6 units away from I. But wait, in this coordinate system, the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6. Hmm, but point A is at (a, 0), so the side BC must be tangent to the incircle at some point, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius r is related to the angles. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A.

Yes, I think that formula is correct: IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2).

So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2). Similarly for others.

But I also know that OI^2 = R(R - 2r), which we have as 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but in the coordinate system I set up earlier, with O at (0, sqrt(13)) and I at (0,0), then the distance between O and I is sqrt(13), which matches. So that's consistent.

Now, I can think about the position of A in this coordinate system. Since IA is along the x-axis, point A is (a, 0). The inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to BC. So, the length from I to BC is 6. But how does that relate to the coordinates of B and C?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. Since I is at (0,0), and BC is a line, the distance from (0,0) to BC is 6. So, if BC is the line ax + by + c =0, then |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) =6.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should think in terms of the coordinates of B and C.

Wait, another property: In any triangle, the distance from the incenter to the circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Which we used earlier, so that's consistent.

Also, the formula for distance between O and I is sqrt(R^2 - 2Rr). Wait, no, hold on: OI^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. Wait, no, OI^2 = R^
