Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is asking: if Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the t minutes at the coffee shop?

Alright, so the key here is that the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. But the coffee shop time t is the same in both scenarios. So, the difference in total time must be due to the difference in walking time at the two different speeds.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find the relationship between her walking speed and the time it takes, and then find the value of s and t so that I can compute the time when her speed is s + 1/2.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to find t explicitly if I can find the relationship between the times. Let me think.

The distance she walks is constant: 9 kilometers. So, the time she spends walking can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed.

But the total time includes t minutes at the coffee shop. So, for the first scenario where her speed is s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Wait, no, 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. But wait, she stops at the coffee shop for t minutes, so the actual walking time is 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes: 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes total. Again, the walking time is 144 - t minutes.

But I can also express the walking time in terms of her speed. Because walking time = distance / speed. So, walking time when speed is s is 9 / s hours, and when speed is s + 2, it's 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Wait, but the t is in minutes, so I might need to convert the walking time from hours to minutes when working with t, which is in minutes.

Let me write equations for both scenarios.

First scenario:
Walking time + coffee time = total time.
Walking time = 9 / s hours. To convert that to minutes, multiply by 60: (9 / s) * 60 minutes.
Coffee time is t minutes.
Total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
So, equation 1: (9 / s) * 60
