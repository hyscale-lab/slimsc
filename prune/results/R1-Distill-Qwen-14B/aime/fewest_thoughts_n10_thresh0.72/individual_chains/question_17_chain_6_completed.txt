Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, the problem says that the set B consists of all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, every box in B has these two properties. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, meaning I need the sphere that can enclose any box from B with the minimum possible radius. The radius squared will then be expressed as p/q, which are coprime, and I have to find p + q.

I remember that for a rectangular box with dimensions x, y, z, the surface area S and volume V are given by:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
V = xyz = 23

And the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere has to fit around the box, the diagonal of the box is the diameter of the sphere. So, the radius would be half of that diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4 given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, actually, the sphere needs to contain each box, so I need the maximum possible value of the space diagonal among all boxes in B. Because the sphere has to contain all such boxes, the radius must be at least as large as the maximum possible space diagonal divided by 2. So, actually, I need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²), given the constraints on surface area and volume. Then, the radius will be half of that maximum, and then r squared is (max(x² + y² + z²))/4.

So, let me rephrase the problem: given x, y, z > 0 with 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23, find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Hmm, so I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given those two constraints.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach.

Let me recall that for positive real numbers, certain inequalities relate sums, products, and sums of squares. For example, Cauchy-Schwarz or AM ≥ GM.

But perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume.

Wait, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so xy + yz + zx = 27.

I also know that for any real numbers, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, that gives x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of x + y + z, given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, okay. Now, I have to find the maximum of x + y + z with those constraints.

I remember that for symmetric functions, sometimes we can assume variables are equal or use inequalities like AM ≥ GM.

Wait, but if x, y, z are equal, then we can have a symmetric case. Let's see what happens if x = y = z.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 2(3x²) = 6x² =54, so x²=9, so x=3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the case where all three variables are equal is not applicable here because the volume is lower than that.

So, the variables can't all be equal. So, maybe we can assume two variables are equal and the third is different. Maybe that can help.

Let me assume that x = y, and z is different. Then, let's see.

So, if x = y, then:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 2(x² + 2xz) = 54.

So, x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x^2 z = 23.

So, from the volume equation, z = 23/(x²).

Substituting into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/(x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to left:

x³ -27x +46 = 0

We can try to find roots of this cubic equation.

Let's see, maybe x=2 is a root:

2³ -27*2 +46 = 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x-2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2).

Set up synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

Bring down 1.

Multiply 2*1=2, add to next coefficient: 0+2=2

Multiply 2*2=4, add to next coefficient: -27+4 =-23

Multiply 2*(-23)=-46, add to last coefficient:46 + (-46)=0.

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23).

Now, set x² +2x -23=0. Using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ±2*sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x = -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible solutions are x=2, x= -1 +2√6.

So, when x=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, when x=2, z=5.75, so the box dimensions are 2,2,5.75.

When x= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898, then z=23/(x²). Let's compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6. So, x² = ( -1 +2√6 )² = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23, since 23*23=529.

So, z= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, the dimensions are x=y= -1 +2√6≈3.898, z≈(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

Wait, that's interesting. So, in this case, when x=y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

So, in both cases, when x=2, z=5.75, and when x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Now, what's the sum x + y + z in each case?

Case 1: x=2, y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

Sum = 2 + 2 +5.75=9.75.

Case 2: x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Sum≈3.898*2 +1.513≈7.796 +1.513≈9.309.

Wait, so in case 1, the sum is 9.75, in case 2, it's approximately 9.309, which is less.

So, the maximum sum is 9.75 in case 1.

But wait, is that the maximum? Or could there be other cases where the sum is larger?

We assumed x=y, but perhaps if all variables are different, the sum could be larger.

Alternatively, maybe when two variables are equal, the sum is maximized as 9.75.

Wait, to confirm, let's see: if I set x=2, y=2, z=5.75, then x+y+z=9.75.

Is this the maximum possible?

Alternatively, perhaps setting one variable very small, another very large, and the third moderate.

But I need to verify.

Wait, another approach is to use Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the optimization problem.

We need to maximize f(x,y,z)=x + y + z,

subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx=27,

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, we set up:

∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h.

Compute gradients.

∇f = (1,1,1)

∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)

∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, the equations are:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz,

1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz,

1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy.

Hmm, so we have:

1 = λ(y + z) + μ yz, (1)

1 = λ(x + z) + μ xz, (2)

1 = λ(x + y) + μ xy. (3)

We can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

0 = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ (xz - yz)

Simplify:

0 = λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y)

Factor out (x - y):

0 = (x - y)(λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

0 = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ (xy - yz)

Simplify:

0 = λ(x - z) + μ y(x - z)

Factor out (x - z):

0 = (x - z)(λ + μ y)

So now, we have:

Either x = y, or λ + μ z = 0,

And either x = z, or λ + μ y = 0.

So, possibilities:

Case 1: x = y = z.

But as we saw earlier, if x=y=z, then volume would be 27, but we need 23, so this case is not possible.

Case 2: Suppose x = y ≠ z.

Then, from the first analysis, this leads to x=2, z=23/4, sum=9.75.

Alternatively, let's see if another case is possible.

Suppose x ≠ y and x ≠ z, but from above, we have:

From the first subtraction, (x - y)(λ + μ z) =0,

From the second subtraction, (x - z)(λ + μ y) =0.

If x ≠ y and x ≠ z, then we must have:

λ + μ z = 0,

and λ + μ y = 0.

Which implies that μ z = -λ,

and μ y = -λ.

Thus, μ z = μ y => z = y, since μ ≠0 (otherwise λ=0 from μ z= -λ, but then from equation (1), 1=0 + 0, which is impossible).

So, if x ≠ y and x ≠ z, then we must have y = z.

So, now, Case 3: y = z ≠ x.

So, in this case, y = z, and x is different.

Then, let's write down the constraints.

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx)=54.

Since y = z, this becomes 2(xy + y² + x y)=54.

Which simplifies to 2(2xy + y²)=54,

So, 4xy + 2y² =54,

Divide both sides by 2: 2xy + y²=27.

Volume: xyz = x y² =23.

So, x=23/(y²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2*(23/(y²))*y + y²=27

Simplify:

(46/y) + y²=27

Multiply both sides by y:

46 + y³=27y

Bring all terms to left:

y³ -27y +46=0

Wait, this is the same equation we had before when we set x=y.

So, same equation: y³ -27y +46=0.

We found that y=2 is a root, and factoring gives (y-2)(y² +2y -23)=0.

So, solutions y=2, and y=-1 ±2√6.

Again, since y must be positive, y=-1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, when y=2, x=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75, and z=y=2.

So, dimensions are x=5.75, y=2, z=2.

Thus, the sum x + y + z =5.75 +2 +2=9.75, same as before.

When y= -1 +2√6≈3.898, x=23/(y²)≈23/(25 -4√6)≈1.513, and z=y≈3.898.

So, sum x + y + z≈1.513 +3.898 +3.898≈9.309, which is less than 9.75.

So, in both cases, whether we set x=y or y=z, the maximum sum x + y + z is 9.75 when two variables are 2 and the third is 5.75.

So, that suggests that the maximum x + y + z is 39/4, since 9.75=39/4.

Wait, 9.75=39/4=9 3/4.

So, (x + y + z)^2= (39/4)^2=1521/16.

And since x² + y² + z²= (x + y + z)^2 -2(xy + yz + zx)= (1521/16) -54.

Wait, 54 is equal to 864/16, so 1521/16 -864/16= (1521-864)/16=657/16.

So, x² + y² + z²=657/16.

Therefore, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (657/16)/4=657/(64).

Wait, that would make r²=657/64.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, x² + y² + z²= (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz +zx)= (39/4)^2 - 2*27.

Compute (39/4)^2: 39^2=1521, so 1521/16.

2*27=54=864/16.

So, 1521/16 -864/16=657/16.

Then, r squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

So, 657 and 64: let's check if they are coprime.

64 factors: 2^6.

657 divided by 3: 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3. 657/3=219. 219/3=73. So, 657=3^2 *73.

73 is a prime number. 64 and 657 share no common factors besides 1. So, 657/64 is reduced.

Thus, p=657, q=64. So, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but hold on. I assumed that the maximum x + y + z is 39/4=9.75, which occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 23/4=5.75.

But is this the only case where the maximum occurs?

Wait, in the Lagrange multipliers case, when we considered y=z, we also had the same maximum sum when x=5.75.

So, both cases give the same sum, so perhaps this is indeed the maximum.

But let me think, is there a way to have a larger sum?

Suppose we set one variable very large, another medium, and the third small. But with the constraints on surface area and volume.

Suppose, for example, x is large, y is moderate, z is small. Would that allow x + y + z to be larger?

But we have the product xyz=23, which is fixed. So, if x increases, either y or z must decrease, because the product is fixed.

But how does that affect the sum?

It's not immediately clear. Maybe testing with some numbers.

Suppose x approaches infinity, then y or z must approach zero to keep xyz=23.

But in that case, the sum x + y + z would approach infinity, but wait, the surface area is fixed at 54. So, if x is very large, then the terms involving x in the surface area would dominate.

Wait, surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx)=54.

If x is very large, then xy and xz would have to be significant to make the sum 27.

But if x is large, and y and z are small, but xyz=23, so if x is large, then y and z would have to be roughly proportional to 23/x, which is small.

So, for example, let's say x=100.

Then, y*z=23/100=0.23.

To compute the surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx)=2(100y + 0.23 +100 z)=54.

So, 100y +100 z +0.46≈54.

But 100(y + z)≈54-0.46≈53.54.

Thus, y + z≈0.5354.

So, y and z are each around 0.26.

But then, x + y + z≈100 +0.26 +0.26≈100.52, which is way larger than 9.75.

Wait, that can't be right because if x is 100, then y and z would have to be approximately 0.26 each, but then surface area would be dominated by the terms with x, which would be about 100*0.26*2=52, and 2*(52 + 0.23)≈104.46, but our surface area is only 54.

Wait, that suggests that if x is 100, the surface area would be way larger than 54, which is not allowed.

So, perhaps x can't be too large because the surface area is fixed.

Hmmm, so perhaps there's a limit on how large x can be.

Wait, so let's see, with the constraints that 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23.

If x is very large, then y and z must be small enough so that yz=23/x.

But the surface area terms: 2(xy + yz + zx)=54.

But if x is large, then xy and xz would be large, unless y and z are very small.

But let's try to find the maximum possible x.

Assume y and z are as small as possible, so y= z= t.

Then, x*t^2=23 => t= sqrt(23/x).

Surface area: 2(x*t + t^2 +x t)=2*(2x t + t^2)=54.

So, 2*(2x t + t^2)=54 => 4x t + 2t^2=54.

But t= sqrt(23/x).

So, substituting:

4x * sqrt(23/x) + 2*(23/x) =54.

Simplify:

4*sqrt(23 x) + (46)/x =54.

Let me denote s = sqrt(x). Then, x= s².

Then, equation becomes:

4*sqrt(23) * s + 46/(s²) =54.

Multiply both sides by s²:

4*sqrt(23) * s^3 +46 =54 s².

Bring all terms to left:

4*sqrt(23) s^3 -54 s² +46=0.

This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to try to see if x can't get too large.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum sum x + y + z is indeed 39/4=9.75, as found earlier, because when trying to increase x beyond that, the surface area constraint is violated.

Wait, but in the earlier case, when x=5.75 and y=z=2, the surface area is 2*(5.75*2 + 2*2 +5.75*2)=2*(11.5 +4 +11.5)=2*(27)=54, which satisfies the constraint.

So, perhaps that is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, let's think about the function x + y + z with the constraints.

Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, the maximum is likely achieved when two variables are equal and the third is different.

Which is exactly the case we considered earlier.

So, in that case, the maximum sum is 9.75=39/4, so x² + y² + z²=657/16, so r²=657/64.

So, p=657, q=64, which are coprime, so p + q=657+64=721.

Therefore, the answer is 721.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that for a rectangular box with dimensions \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), the surface area \(S\) and volume \(V\) are given by:

\[
S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad V = xyz = 23.
\]

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the space diagonal of the box, which is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}/2\). Therefore, \(r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4}\).

To find \(r^2\), we need to maximize \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) given the constraints. Using the identity \((x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\), we rewrite \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) as:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.
\]

Thus, maximizing \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) is equivalent to maximizing \(x + y + z\). We use the method of Lagrange multipliers and assume symmetry by setting two variables equal. Let \(x = y\), then the constraints become:

\[
2(x^2 + 2xz) = 54 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 + 2xz = 27,
\]
\[
x^2 z = 23 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z = \frac{23}{x^2}.
\]

Substituting \(z\) into the surface area equation:

\[
x^2 + 2x \left(\frac{23}{x^2}\right) = 27 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0.
\]

Solving this cubic equation, we find \(x = 2\) is a root. Factoring, we get:

\[
(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 23) = 0.
\]

The positive root of \(x^2 + 2x - 23 = 0\) is \(x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6}\). Calculating the corresponding \(z\), we find the dimensions of the box. The maximum sum \(x + y + z\) occurs when \(x = y = 2\) and \(z = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75\), giving:

\[
x + y + z = 2 + 2 + 5.75 = 9.75 = \frac{39}{4}.
\]

Thus,

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \left(\frac{39}{4}\right)^2 - 54 = \frac{1521}{16} - \frac{864}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
\]

Finally, \(r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64}\). Since 657 and 64 are coprime, \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\), so \(p + q = 721\).

\[
\boxed{721}
\]
