Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen 4. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize (which includes winning the grand prize and other cases where she wins but not the grand prize).

So, P(A|B) is the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. That would be the probability of both A and B happening (but since A is a subset of B, it's just P(A)) divided by P(B).

So, I need to calculate P(A) and P(B). Let's define:

- The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Let me calculate that first.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total possible combinations are 210.

Now, for event A (winning the grand prize), Jen must have all four numbers chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is just 1 (the specific set she chose). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, for the grand prize, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 because it's the exact combination she chose out of all possible combinations. So, yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, event B is winning a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, we need to compute P(B), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen.

Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the probability of the complement: the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen (i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen), and then subtract that from 1.

Let me try that approach.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210 as before.

The number of ways that zero of her numbers are chosen: That means all four numbers are chosen from the other 6 numbers (since she picked 4, so 10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of ways is C(6,4). Let's compute that.

C(6,4) = 15.

Now, the number of ways that exactly one of her numbers is chosen: We choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the number of ways where she gets fewer than two numbers (i.e., zero or one) is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she gets at least two numbers is the total combinations minus the ones with fewer than two: 210 - 95 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, yes, 115/210.

Alternatively, if I compute it directly, the number of ways she can have exactly two, three, or four numbers chosen.

But I think my calculation above is correct because the complement is easier.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that fraction: Divide numerator and denominator by 5. 115 ÷ 5 = 23, 210 ÷ 5 = 42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Now, P(A) is 1/210. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, P(A) is the probability that all four numbers are chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total number of possible outcomes is 210, so yes, P(A) is 1/210.

But wait, when calculating the conditional probability P(A|B), it's P(A) / P(B). So, (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (1 * 42) / (210 * 23) = 42 / (210 *23). Simplify.

42 and 210 have a common factor: 42 divides into 210 five times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5. So, 42/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) is 1/115.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, no, another way: the conditional probability is the probability that all four are chosen given that at least two are chosen.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, and the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

Wait, but actually, in terms of counting, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, and the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

So, in the conditional probability, it's (number of favorable for A) / (number of favorable for B). So, 1 / 115.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the conditional probability, the "universe" is restricted to the cases where she wins a prize (i.e., B occurs). So, the size of the reduced sample space is 115.

In that restricted sample space, how many cases result in her winning the grand prize? Only 1 case: the case where all four numbers are chosen.

So, P(A|B) = 1 / 115. So, m=1, n=115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with any number.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because in the conditional probability, when we compute P(A|B), it's P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, A is a subset of B because if you win the grand prize, you certainly have at least two numbers chosen. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) ) = 1/115. Yep, same as before.

So, the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the probability seemed low. Let me think about it again. So, 115 is the number of ways she can have at least two numbers chosen, and only 1 of those ways is the grand prize. So, yes, 1/115 is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the numbers again. If she has 4 numbers, the chance that all four are chosen is 1/210, which is correct. The chance that at least two are chosen is 115/210, which is 23/42. So, the conditional probability is (1/210) divided by (115/210) = 1/115. So, yes.

So, the final answer is 1 + 115 = 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( A \) is the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) is the event of winning a prize (which includes winning the grand prize).

1. **Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:**
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (\( P(A) \)):**
   There is only 1 favorable outcome (the exact set Jen chose).
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

3. **Probability of winning a prize (\( P(B) \)):**
   We calculate the complement: the probability of having fewer than two numbers chosen (zero or one).
   - **Zero numbers chosen:** 
     \[
     \binom{6}{4} = 15
     \]
   - **One number chosen:** 
     \[
     \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   - **Total ways with fewer than two numbers chosen:** 
     \[
     15 + 80 = 95
     \]
   - **Ways with at least two numbers chosen:** 
     \[
     210 - 95 = 115
     \]
   - **Probability of winning a prize:** 
     \[
     P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
     \]

4. **Conditional probability \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction and find \( m + n \):**
   The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{116}\).
