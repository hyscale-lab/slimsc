Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation seems a bit more complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to group terms.

Let me group terms with similar variables. For example, a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be factored as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b can be factored as c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, I remember that a + b + c = 300, so I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation.

So, substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Let's write it out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me think about another approach. Maybe express a³ in terms of a² and a, since a + b + c = 300.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some symmetric properties or known identities. I know that for three variables, there are identities that relate sums of powers to each other. For example, I recall that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Hmm, wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Actually, the expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) + 3(c + a)(b + c). Hmm, no, maybe that's not accurate. Wait, perhaps I should compute (a + b + c)^3 correctly.

Let me compute (
