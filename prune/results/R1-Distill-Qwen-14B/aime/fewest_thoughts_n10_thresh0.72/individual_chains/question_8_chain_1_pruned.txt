Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, let me write down what I know. The problem involves two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both of these equations. 

Let me think about the second equation. It looks symmetric in a, b, and c, so maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let me see:

The second equation can be rewritten as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, expanding each term:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

I remember that:

a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q.

And for a³ + b³ + c³, the formula is S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

So plugging these into the equation:

300(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000.

We know S = 300, so let's substitute that in:

300(300² - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300²: 300 * 300 = 90,000.

So, 300² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.

Multiply by 300: 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, compute 300³: 300 * 300 * 300 = 27,000,000.

Then, 3*300*Q = 900Q.

So, the expression inside the second parenthesis is 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Putting it all together:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute the subtraction:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.

So, 0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, now I have the equation:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

Which is:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, the product abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have another relation between Q and P.

I remember that for three variables, we can relate these symmetric sums. Let me see if I can find another equation involving Q and P.

Wait, maybe I can express Q in terms of a, b, c. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation a + b + c = 300, and think about the possible values of a, b, c.

Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, each of them can range from 0 up to 300.

But perhaps it's better to think about cases where two variables are zero, or when one variable is dominant, etc.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation P = 100Q - 2e6. Since P is abc, and Q is ab + bc + ca, perhaps there's a way to express this in terms of the variables.

Let me see: If I let a, b, c be nonnegative integers, then perhaps I can write things in terms of two variables, since a + b + c = 300.

Let me set c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute into Q and P:

Q = ab + bc + ca = ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b).

Similarly, P = abc = a b (300 - a - b).

Let me compute Q:

Q = ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab.

Wait, let me do that step by step.

Q = ab + bc + ca.

Substitute c = 300 - a - b:

= ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b).

Expand each term:

= ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab.

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: ab.

Second term: b*(300 - a - b) = 300b - ab - b².

Third term: a*(300 - a - b) = 300a - a² - ab.

So, combine all these:

ab + (300b - ab - b²) + (300a - a² - ab).

Now, combine like terms:

ab
