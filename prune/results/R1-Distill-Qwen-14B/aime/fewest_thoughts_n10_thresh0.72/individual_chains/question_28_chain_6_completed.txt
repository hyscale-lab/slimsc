Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with the following edge lengths:
- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. This distance is to be expressed in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, we need to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, the point I is equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) which touches all four faces.

So, the problem is essentially asking for the inradius of this particular tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I know that the formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, my plan is to compute the volume V and the total surface area S, then compute r = 3V / S.

But first, I need to figure out the areas of each face and the volume of the tetrahedron.

Wait, but how do I find the volume when I only know the edge lengths? I think I can use something called the Cayley-Menger determinant, which allows you to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant formula for the volume V of a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

But wait, the order of the points matters here. The determinant is constructed based on the coordinates. Since I don't have coordinates, I need to assign variables correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points to make the computation easier. Let me try that approach.

Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0), point B at (x, 0, 0), point C at (p, q, 0), and point D at (r, s, t). Then, I can write equations based on the given edge lengths.

But this might get complicated with too many variables. Maybe there's a symmetry here I can exploit?

Looking at the edge lengths:
- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

This seems symmetric in a way. Maybe the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that opposite edges are equal. So, AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That kind of symmetry might allow for some simplification.

Alternatively, maybe the tetrahedron is a "disphemoid" or a "rhombohedron," but I'm not certain. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths when opposite edges are equal. Maybe there's a formula for that scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors and setting up coordinate systems.

Wait, let me try the coordinate approach. Let's assign coordinates in a way that might exploit the symmetry.

Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0).

Since AB = sqrt(41), let's place point B at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). So AB is along the x-axis.

Now, points C and D need to be placed such that AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89), BC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), and CD = sqrt(41).

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check:

From the problem: AB = CD = sqrt(41)

AC = BD = sqrt(80)

BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, AB is opposite to CD, which both are sqrt41.

Similarly, AC opposite BD are sqrt80, and BC opposite AD are sqrt89.

So, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that AB and CD are opposite edges of equal length, etc.

So, to model this, perhaps I can place points A, B, C, D in such a way that the opposite edges are equal.

Alternatively, maybe I can place points such that the midpoints of AB and CD coincide, and similarly for other opposite edges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a coordinate system where the centroid is at the origin, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, another approach: since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps this tetrahedron is such that it can be embedded in a coordinate system where it has certain symmetries.

Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can place point A at (0,0,0), point B at (x, 0, 0), point C at (0, y, 0), point D at (0, 0, z). But in that case, the opposite edges would be AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC.

Wait, in this case, if I set A at (0,0,0), B at (x,0,0), C at (0,y,0), D at (0,0,z), then:

- AB has length x.

- AC has length y.

- AD has length z.

- BC: distance between (x,0,0) and (0,y,0) is sqrt(x² + y²).

- BD: distance between (x,0,0) and (0,0,z) is sqrt(x² + z²).

- CD: distance between (0,y,0) and (0,0,z) is sqrt(y² + z²).

So, according to the problem,

AB = CD => x = sqrt(y² + z²)

Similarly, AC = BD => y = sqrt(x² + z²)

And BC = AD => sqrt(x² + y²) = z

Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, let's write the equations:

From AB = CD:

x = sqrt(y² + z²) --> equation 1

From AC = BD:

y = sqrt(x² + z²) --> equation 2

From BC = AD:

sqrt(x² + y²) = z --> equation 3

So, now we have three equations:

1: x² = y² + z²

2: y² = x² + z²

3: x² + y² = z²

Wait, substituting equation 1 into equation 2:

From equation 1, x² = y² + z².

From equation 2, y² = x² + z².

Substitute x² from equation 1 into equation 2:

y² = (y² + z²) + z² = y² + 2 z²

Subtract y² from both sides: 0 = 2 z² => z = 0

But z=0 would mean point D is at (0,0,0), which is the same as point A, which is impossible in a tetrahedron. So, this suggests that such a coordinate system is not possible, which means my initial assumption about the coordinates is incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps the tetrahedron can't be embedded with right angles in this way. So, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors and set up equations based on the dot product.

Let me denote vectors AB, AC, AD as vectors from point A.

Let me denote vectors:

Let’s denote vectors:

Let’s set point A at the origin, so its coordinates are (0,0,0).

Let’s let vector AB = b, AC = c, AD = d.

Then, the edge lengths are:

|b| = AB = sqrt(41)

|c| = AC = sqrt(80)

|d| = AD = sqrt(89)

Also, the other edges are:

CD: The distance between points C and D. Since C is at vector c and D is at vector d, the vector CD is d - c. So, |d - c| = sqrt(41).

Similarly, BD: The distance between points B and D. Vector BD is d - b. So, |d - b| = sqrt(80).

And BC: The distance between points B and C. Vector BC is c - b. So, |c - b| = sqrt(89).

So, we have the following equations:

1. |b|² = 41 --> b·b = 41

2. |c|² = 80 --> c·c = 80

3. |d|² = 89 --> d·d = 89

4. |d - c|² = 41 --> (d - c)·(d - c) = 41 --> d·d - 2 d·c + c·c = 41

5. |d - b|² = 80 --> (d - b)·(d - b) = 80 --> d·d - 2 d·b + b·b = 80

6. |c - b|² = 89 --> (c - b)·(c - b) = 89 --> c·c - 2 c·b + b·b = 89

So, let's write down these equations:

From equation 4: d·d - 2 d·c + c·c = 41

We know d·d =89, c·c=80. So, 89 -2 d·c +80 =41 --> 169 - 2 d·c =41 --> 2 d·c =128 --> d·c=64.

Similarly, equation 5: d·d - 2 d·b + b·b =80

We have d·d=89, b·b=41. So, 89 -2 d·b +41=80 --> 130 -2 d·b=80 --> 2 d·b=50 --> d·b=25.

Equation 6: c·c -2 c·b + b·b =89

c·c=80, b·b=41. So, 80 - 2 c·b +41=89 --> 121 -2 c·b=89 --> 2 c·b=32 --> c·b=16.

So now, we have:

d·c=64

d·b=25

c·b=16

So, now, our vectors b, c, d have these dot products.

Now, we can express the volume of the tetrahedron in terms of the scalar triple product.

The volume V is (1/6) | b · (c × d) |.

So, to compute V, we need to find the scalar triple product b · (c × d).

But to compute this, perhaps we can find the squares of these vectors and use some identities.

Alternatively, maybe we can find |c × d| and the angle between b and c × d.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the square of the scalar triple product.

Wait, let me recall that:

| b · (c × d) |² = |b|² |c|² |d|² + 2 (b·c)(c·d)(d·b) - |b|² (c·d)^2 - |c|² (d·b)^2 - |d|² (b·c)^2

Wait, is that correct? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should look for another identity.

Alternatively, I can use the Gram determinant, which gives the squared volume in terms of the dot products.

The Gram determinant for three vectors b, c, d is:

det( [ [b·b, b·c, b·d],
       [c·b, c·c, c·d],
       [d·b, d·c, d·d] ] )

So, the determinant is:

| b·b   b·c   b·d |
| c·b   c·c   c·d |
| d·b   d·c   d·d |

Which is:

| 41    16     25 |
| 16    80     64 |
|25     64     89 |

So, compute this determinant.

Let me compute it step by step.

The determinant is:

41*(80*89 - 64*64) - 16*(16*89 - 64*25) + 25*(16*64 - 80*25)

Let me compute each term.

First term: 41*(80*89 - 64*64)

Compute 80*89: 80*(90-1) = 7200 -80=7120

Compute 64*64: 4096

So, 7120 -4096=3024

So, first term: 41*3024 = let's compute 40*3024=120,960; 1*3024=3,024. Total 123,984.

Second term: -16*(16*89 -64*25)

Compute 16*89=1,424

Compute 64*25=1,600

So, 1,424 -1,600= -176

Multiply by -16: -16*(-176)=2,816

Third term: 25*(16*64 -80*25)

Compute 16*64=1,024

Compute 80*25=2,000

So, 1,024 -2,000= -976

Multiply by 25: 25*(-976)= -24,400

Now, sum all three terms:

First term: 123,984

Second term: +2,816 --> 123,984 +2,816=126,800

Third term: -24,400 --> 126,800 -24,400=102,400

So, the determinant is 102,400.

Therefore, the squared volume is (1/36)*102,400? Wait, no. Wait, the Gram determinant gives the square of the volume scaled by something.

Wait, no. The volume is (1/6)*sqrt(det), because the Gram determinant is |b · (c × d)|², so V = (1/6) * sqrt(det). So, det is |b · (c × d)|², so sqrt(det) is |b · (c × d)|.

So, V = (1/6) * sqrt(102,400).

Compute sqrt(102,400): 1024 * 100 = 102,400. sqrt(1024)=32, sqrt(100)=10, so sqrt(102,400)=32*10=320.

So, V= (1/6)*320= 320/6=160/3.

So, the volume V is 160/3.

Wait, let me just verify that step again. The Gram determinant is |b · (c × d)|², so the volume is (1/6)*sqrt(det). So, sqrt(102400) is 320, so (320)/6 = 160/3. Yes, that's correct.

So, V = 160/3.

Great, so volume is found.

Now, we need the total surface area S. S is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.

So, we have four faces: ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Let me compute the area of each face.

First, face ABC: triangle with sides AB, BC, AC.

Wait, sides are AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).

So, using Heron's formula, area = sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Compute semi-perimeter s: (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80))/2.

But this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way since we have vectors.

Alternatively, since we have vectors b and c, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)|b × c|.

Similarly, the area of triangle ABD is (1/2)|b × d|.

The area of triangle ACD is (1/2)|c × d|.

The area of triangle BCD is (1/2)| (d - c) × (d - b) |.

But perhaps I can compute |b × c|, |b × d|, |c × d|, and |(d - c) × (d - b)|.

Alternatively, since we have the Gram determinant, maybe we can find the areas.

Wait, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)|b × c|. The magnitude of the cross product is |b||c|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between b and c.

We can compute sin(theta) using the dot product: sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - (cos(theta))²). We have b·c=16, and |b|=sqrt(41), |c|=sqrt(80).

So, cos(theta)= (b·c)/( |b||c| )=16/(sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)).

Compute sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)=sqrt(3280). Hmm, but let's compute sin(theta):

sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - (256)/(41*80)).

Compute denominator: 41*80=3280.

256/3280 = 32/410 = 16/205.

So, 1 - 16/205 = (205 -16)/205=189/205.

So, sin(theta)=sqrt(189/205)=sqrt(189)/sqrt(205).

But 189=9*21=9*3*7, and 205=5*41.

So, sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21), sqrt(205)=sqrt(205). So, sin(theta)= 3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205).

Thus, |b × c|= |b||c| sin(theta) = sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)*(3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).

Simplify this:

sqrt(41)*sqrt(80)=sqrt(41*80)=sqrt(3280).

So, |b × c| = sqrt(3280) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)).

But sqrt(3280) = sqrt(16*205)=4 sqrt(205).

So, |b × c|=4 sqrt(205) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(205)) )=4 *3 sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21).

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

Similarly, let's compute |b × d|.

We know b·d=25, |b|=sqrt(41), |d|=sqrt(89).

So, cos(theta')=25/(sqrt(41)*sqrt(89)).

Compute sin(theta')=sqrt(1 - (625)/(41*89)).

Compute denominator: 41*89=3649.

So, 625/3649.

So, 1 - 625/3649=(3649 -625)/3649=3024/3649.

Hmm, 3024= 16*189=16*9*21=16*9*3*7.

3649: let's see if 3649 is a square. 60^2=3600, 61^2=3721. So no, it's not a square. So sqrt(3024/3649)=sqrt(3024)/sqrt(3649).

But 3024= 16*189=16*9*21, so sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21).

sqrt(3649)=sqrt(41*89)=sqrt(3649). Not sure if it simplifies.

Wait, 41*89= (40+1)(90-1)=40*90 -40*1 +1*90 -1*1=3600 -40 +90 -1=3600+50-41=3600+9=3609? Wait, no, 40*90=3600, 40*1=40, 1*90=90, 1*1=1.

Wait, 41*89 = (40 +1)(90 -1)=40*90 -40*1 +1*90 -1*1 = 3600 -40 +90 -1= 3600 +50 -41= 3600 +9=3609? Hmm, but 41*89 is 3649. Wait, 41*90=3690, so 41*89=3690-41=3649. Yes, correct.

So, sqrt(3649)=sqrt(41*89). So, sqrt(3024/3649)=12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41*89).

So, |b × d|=|b||d| sin(theta')= sqrt(41)*sqrt(89)*(12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41*89)).

Simplify: sqrt(41)*sqrt(89)=sqrt(41*89), so they cancel with the denominator.

So, |b × d|=12 sqrt(21).

Thus, the area of triangle ABD is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

Hmm, interesting, same as ABC.

Now, let's compute |c × d|.

We know c·d=64, |c|=sqrt(80), |d|=sqrt(89).

So, cos(phi)=64/(sqrt(80)*sqrt(89)).

Compute sin(phi)=sqrt(1 - (64^2)/(80*89)).

Compute denominator:80*89=7120.

64^2=4096.

So, 4096/7120= 4096 ÷ 16=256, 7120 ÷16=445. So 256/445.

So, 1 - 256/445=(445-256)/445=189/445.

So, sin(phi)=sqrt(189/445)=sqrt(189)/sqrt(445).

189=9*21=9*3*7, 445=5*89.

So, sqrt(189)=3 sqrt(21), sqrt(445)=sqrt(445).

Thus, |c × d|=|c||d| sin(phi)=sqrt(80)*sqrt(89)*(3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(445)).

Simplify sqrt(80)*sqrt(89)=sqrt(80*89)=sqrt(7120).

sqrt(7120)=sqrt(16*445)=4 sqrt(445).

So, |c × d|=4 sqrt(445) * (3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(445)) )=4*3 sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21).

Hence, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

Wow, so all three faces ABC, ABD, ACD have area 6 sqrt(21).

Now, the last face is BCD. Let's compute its area.

We can compute the area of triangle BCD using Heron's formula.

First, find the lengths of BD, CD, BC.

Given BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89).

So, sides are a= sqrt(80), b= sqrt(41), c= sqrt(89).

Semi-perimeter s= (sqrt(80)+sqrt(41)+sqrt(89))/2.

But Heron's formula would involve sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)] which looks messy.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors again. Since BCD is a triangle with points B, C, D.

We can compute vectors CB and CD, then take half the magnitude of their cross product.

Wait, point B is at vector b, point C at vector c, point D at vector d.

So, vector CB = b - c, vector CD = d - c.

So, area = (1/2)| (b - c) × (d - c) |.

But I can also compute this cross product.

Alternatively, note that (b - c) × (d - c) = b × d - b × c - c × d + c × c.

But c × c = 0, so it's b × d - b × c - c × d.

So, |(b - c) × (d - c)| = |b × d - b × c - c × d|.

But since cross product magnitudes are involved, it's tricky because of directions.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for the area in terms of the edges.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the area using Heron's formula.

Given sides a= sqrt(80), b= sqrt(41), c= sqrt(89), let's compute the semi-perimeter:

s = (sqrt(80) + sqrt(41) + sqrt(89))/2.

Then, area^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c).

But this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to compute the area using another approach.

Wait, since we know the areas of the other three faces, and the total surface area is the sum of all four, but I don't know the area of BCD yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the area of BCD is also 6 sqrt(21). Because all the other faces are equal. But wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the four faces are congruent or something, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but all three faces ABC, ABD, ACD have the same area, and the fourth face BCD, perhaps it's the same.

Wait, let's compute |(b - c) × (d - c)|.

We have vectors:

b - c: vector from C to B.

d - c: vector from C to D.

We can compute (b - c) × (d - c).

Expanding this cross product:

= b × d - b × c - c × d + c × c

= b × d - b × c - c × d

Because c × c = 0.

So, the cross product is (b × d) - (b × c) - (c × d).

We already know |b × c|=12 sqrt(21), |b × d|=12 sqrt(21), |c × d|=12 sqrt(21).

But cross products are vectors, so their magnitudes are known, but directions are not. So, the cross product (b × d) - (b × c) - (c × d) is a vector whose magnitude we can compute, but it's non-trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the square of the magnitude.

Let me denote vector X = (b × d) - (b × c) - (c × d).

Then, |X|² = |b × d|² + |b × c|² + |c × d|² - 2 (b × d)·(b × c) - 2 (b × d)·(c × d) + 2 (b × c)·(c × d).

This seems complicated, but maybe using properties of cross products.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find |(b - c) × (d - c)| another way.

Wait, another approach: the area of triangle BCD can be found by the formula (1/2)*|BC × BD sin(theta)|, where theta is the angle between BC and BD.

But I don't know theta.

Alternatively, use the cosine law to find one angle, then compute sin(theta) and hence the area.

In triangle BCD, sides are BC= sqrt(89), BD= sqrt(80), CD= sqrt(41).

So, using the cosine law:

cos(theta) = (BC² + BD² - CD²)/(2*BC*BD)

Compute BC²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

So,

cos(theta)= (89 +80 -41)/(2*sqrt(89)*sqrt(80))= (128)/(2*sqrt(89*80))=64/sqrt(7120).

Simplify sqrt(7120)=sqrt(16*445)=4 sqrt(445).

So, cos(theta)=64/(4 sqrt(445))=16/sqrt(445).

Thus, sin(theta)=sqrt(1 - (256)/(445))=sqrt(189/445)=sqrt(189)/sqrt(445)=3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(445).

Therefore, area of triangle BCD is (1/2)*sqrt(89)*sqrt(80)*sin(theta)= (1/2)*sqrt(89*80)*(3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(445)).

Compute sqrt(89*80)=sqrt(7120)=4 sqrt(445).

So, area= (1/2)*4 sqrt(445)*(3 sqrt(21)/sqrt(445))= (1/2)*4*3 sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).

So, the area is 6 sqrt(21) as well.

Wow, so all four faces have the same area of 6 sqrt(21).

Therefore, the total surface area S is 4 *6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).

So, S =24 sqrt(21).

Earlier, we found V=160/3.

So, r=3V/S=3*(160/3)/(24 sqrt(21))= (160)/(24 sqrt(21))= (20)/(3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

r=20 sqrt(21)/(3*21)=20 sqrt(21)/(63).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 20 and 63 are coprime, so m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but 63 can be simplified with 21? Wait, no, 63 is 7*9, 21 is 3*7. So, 20 and 63 share a GCD of 1, so the fraction is reduced.

n=21, which is square-free (21=3*7, neither square factors), so that's okay.

So, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Therefore, m +n +p=20+21+63=104.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if 20 and 63 are coprime. 20 is 2^2 *5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, so yes, they are coprime.

And n=21 is square-free, since 21 factors into primes 3 and 7, neither squared.

So, the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, which is the inradius \(r\).

First, we calculate the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron using the Cayley-Menger determinant. The determinant for the volume is computed as follows:

\[
\text{det} = \begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 64 & 25 \\
1 & 80 & 64 & 0 & 64 \\
1 & 89 & 25 & 64 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

After computing the determinant, we find it to be 102400. The volume \(V\) is then given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \sqrt{102400} = \frac{1}{6} \times 320 = \frac{160}{3}
\]

Next, we compute the total surface area \(S\). Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with area \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four faces, the total surface area is:

\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is calculated using the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\):

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\). The values \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\) give us \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
\]
