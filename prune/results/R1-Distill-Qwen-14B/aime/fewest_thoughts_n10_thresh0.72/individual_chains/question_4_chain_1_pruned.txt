Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this case, the game is impartial, meaning both players have the same moves available to them. So, the concept of P-positions (previous player winning positions) and N-positions (next player winning positions) applies. Wait, no, actually, in standard terminology, P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win, meaning the next player cannot. So, for impartial games, positions are either P or N. If all moves lead to an N-position, then the current position is a P-position. If there's at least one move leading to a P-position, then it's an N-position.

Wait, let me get that straight. If I'm at a P-position, then whatever move I make, the opponent can force a win. So P-positions are losing for the player about to move. N-positions are the opposite; the player can force a win.

So, the initial position is n tokens. Alice goes first. So, if n is a P-position, then Bob can win; if n is an N-position, Alice can win.

So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a P-position in this game.

The key is to model the game and find the pattern of P-positions and N-positions.

Let me try to model this for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's start with n=0. If there are zero tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a P-position, because the previous player has just taken the last token.

Wait, no: if n=0, it's the end of the game. So the player who is
