Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A number n is called b-eautiful if when it's written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Cool, that makes sense.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me think about how a two-digit number in base b works. In base b, a two-digit number would be represented as 'd1 d0', where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the unit's place. So, mathematically, the value of this number is d1*b + d0. Both d1 and d0 are digits in base b, which means they have to satisfy 0 ≤ d1, d0 < b. But since it's a two-digit number, the first digit d1 can't be zero. So, d1 is at least 1 and up to b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.

Now, the condition for being b-eautiful is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So, substituting, we get that d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Let's denote s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Then, squaring both sides, we have s² = d1*b + d0.

But we also know that s = d1 + d0, so substituting that in, we get s² = d1*b + (s - d1). Let's simplify this equation:

s² = d1*b + s - d1
s² - s = d1*(b - 1)
So, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, that's interesting. So, for given s and b, d1 is equal to (s² - s)/(b - 1). But d1 must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. So, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d1 must be at least 1 and less than b, we have:

1 ≤ (s² - s)/(b - 1) < b

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible values of s and see if (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and whether the resulting d1 is between 1 and b-1. Then, from d1, we can find d0 = s - d1, and check if d0 is between 0 and b-1.

But what is the possible range for s? Let's see. Since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, the maximum possible value for s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. The minimum s is 1 + 0 = 1, but since d0 can be zero, but d1 is at least 1. But s has to be a positive integer because it's the sum of two digits.

Moreover, n = d1*b + d0 must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (since s is an integer). Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that s = sqrt(n), so n must be a perfect square.

So, for each base b, we can find the number of pairs (d1, d0) such that:

1. d1 + d0 = s, where s is an integer.
2. d1*b + d0 = s².
3. d1 is between 1 and b-1, inclusive.
4. d0 is between 0 and b-1, inclusive.

Alternatively, since s² = d1*b + d0, and s = d1 + d0, maybe we can express everything in terms of s and b.

Let me rearrange the equation s² = d1*b + d0:

But since d0 = s - d1, substitute that in:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1)
s² = d1*(b - 1) + s
