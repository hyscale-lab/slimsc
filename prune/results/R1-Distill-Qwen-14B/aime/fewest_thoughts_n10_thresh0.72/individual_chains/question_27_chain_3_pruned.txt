Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but outside it.

The problem says the torus T has a radius of 3 for the circle being revolved, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, when you spin it around, the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6. I think that makes the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of S and be internally tangent, and also on the outside, externally tangent. When it's internally tangent, the point of tangency is along a circle with radius r_i, and when externally tangent, it's along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their surfaces touch along a circle. For the torus inside the sphere, the point of contact should be where both surfaces have the same normal vector, I think. Similarly for the external tangent.

Let me recall the equations for a torus. A torus can be represented parametrically, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of its geometry. The torus has two radii: R (the major radius, distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and r (the minor radius, radius of the tube itself). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere. So the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. So the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the farthest point of the torus from the sphere's center is equal to 11.

Wait, no. The torus is entirely inside the sphere, touching it at a circle. So the maximum distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus is 11.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the closest point of the torus to the sphere's center is 11, since it's externally tangent.

So for internal tangency: the maximum distance from the sphere's center to the torus is 11.

For external tangency: the minimum distance from the sphere's center to the torus is 11.

Wait, but the torus is centered at the same point as the sphere? Or not necessarily?

Wait, the problem says when T rests on the inside and outside of S. So I think the sphere S is fixed, and the torus T is placed such that it's either inside or outside, touching along a circle.

But to model this, maybe the centers of the sphere and torus are aligned along the same axis. Let's assume the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is also centered at the origin because otherwise, the symmetry might be broken.

Wait, but a torus is a surface of revolution, so it's symmetric around its axis. If the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is placed such that it's touching the sphere along a circle, then the center of the torus must lie along the axis of the torus, which is in the plane of the original circle.

Wait, maybe the torus's center is at some distance from the sphere's center? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's center. Because otherwise, how would they be
