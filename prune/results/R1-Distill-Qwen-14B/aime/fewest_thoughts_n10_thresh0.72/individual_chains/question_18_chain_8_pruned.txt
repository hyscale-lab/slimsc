Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. 

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a shape with 12 vertices, each connected to two adjacent vertices by sides. The diagonals are the lines connecting non-adjacent vertices. So, in a regular polygon, diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

I remember that in regular polygons, you can form rectangles by selecting pairs of parallel sides. Since it's a regular dodecagon, it's symmetric, so there should be a lot of symmetry in the possible rectangles.

Let me think about how rectangles can be formed here. Each rectangle is defined by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are all equal and the sides are equally spaced in terms of angles. So, maybe the key is to find how many such pairs we can get.

Wait, for a regular polygon, the sides can be grouped into parallel sets. The number of sides in each set depends on the number of vertices. For a dodecagon, since it's even, 12, each side has a parallel side opposite to it. But wait, no, actually, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, each side has a unique parallel side. So, for a dodecagon, each side has exactly one side that's parallel to it, located across the center.

But wait, that's not the only way sides can be parallel. Because in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can also be parallel to other sides or diagonals. So, the sides and diagonals can form lines that are parallel in different directions.

So, perhaps the first step is to figure out how many sets of parallel lines there are in a regular dodecagon. Each set can be used to form two sides of a rectangle. Then, I can choose two different sets to form the sides of a rectangle.

Wait, that makes sense. Because a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, each pair from a different set. So, if I can determine how many sets of parallel lines there are, and then compute the number of ways to choose two
