Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have a list of positive integers with certain properties, and we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

First, let's list out the given properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, so let's break this down step by step.

Starting with the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. That means no other number can appear the same number of times as 9.

Next, the median. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. Since it's a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, that tells me something about the length of the list. Let's think: if the median isn't in the list, the number of elements must be even? Because if it's odd, the median is the middle element which is in the list. So if the median isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because for an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So that average must be an integer, but it's not present in the list.

Wait, the median is a positive integer itself. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is an integer and not present in the list. That seems to fit. So in this case, perhaps the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, making the median 9. That would mean 9 is not in the list, but 9 is the mode. Wait, but if 9 is the mode, it has to be in the list, right? Because mode is the most frequent number, so it must appear at least once. So that's a contradiction. Because if the median is 9, which isn't in the list, but 9 is the mode, which must be in the list. So that can't be.

Wait, so maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Perhaps the median is another number. Let me reconsider.

Wait no, the median is an integer, but it doesn't appear in the list. Let's say the list has even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is an integer not in the list. So in that case, the list would be [some numbers where 9 is the mode, and 8 and 10 are the two middle numbers]. So 9 is the mode, but 9 is not present in the list. Wait, but if 9 isn't present in the list, how can it be the mode? Because the mode has to be one of the numbers in the list. So that can't be.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The list must include 9 because 9 is the mode. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. Also, the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So the median is not 9, right? Because 9 is in the list. So the median is some other integer, say M, which is not in the list.

So let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of elements in the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements.

2. Since the median is an integer not present in the list, n must be even because if it's odd, the median would be the middle element, which is in the list. So n is even.

3. Let's denote the two middle numbers as a and b. Then the median is (a + b)/2, which is an integer, so a + b must be even. Therefore, a and b are both even or both odd.

4. Also, since the median M is not in the list, M is (a + b)/2 and M is not present in the list.

5. The list is in non-decreasing order, so a ≤ b.

6. The mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

Let me think about possible n. Let's try to find the minimal possible n.

Wait, let's think about the minimal n where the mode is 9. Since 9 must appear more times than any other number, the minimal number of 9s is at least 2. Because if it was just one, it wouldn't be a unique mode. Because other numbers could also appear once. So the minimal number of 9s is 2.

But wait, no. If 9 appears twice, and all other numbers appear once or twice, but 9 must appear more than any other number. So if another number also appears twice, then 9 isn't the unique mode. So 9 must appear at least three times. Because if it's the only one appearing three times, then it's the unique mode.

So minimal number of 9s is three.

Wait, but let's think again. Suppose n is 7. Then the median is the 4th element. Let's think about n=7. The median is the 4th element. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. So the 4th element is M, which is not in the list. But wait, n=7 is odd, so the median is the 4th element, which would have to be in the list. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, n can't be odd. So n must be even.

So n must be even.

Let's consider n=8. Then the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. So (4th +5th)/2. Let's denote the 4th element as a and 5th as b. So (a + b)/2 must be an integer not in the list.

The list is in order: [x1, x2, x3, a, b, x6, x7, x8]

So, a and b are such that a ≤ b, and (a + b) is even. Also, (a + b)/2 is not in the list.

Now, since 9 is the mode, which appears more frequently than any other number. Let's think how many 9s we need.

At least three 9s. Because if we have two 9s, another number could also have two, making mode not unique. So to make 9 the unique mode, it must appear more times.

So, let's try to construct such a list.

First, let's think about the positions where 9s can be.

Since a and b are the 4th and 5th elements, and the list is in order, so a ≤ b.

Also, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Let me try to have as many 9s as possible in the list.

But let's also remember that the sum is 30.

So, the sum of all elements is 30.

Let me consider the minimal case: n=8.

Suppose we have 4 nines. Let's see if that's possible.

If four 9s, sum contributed by 9s is 4*9=36, but the total sum is 30, which is less than 36. So that's impossible.

So 4 nines is too much.

How about three 9s. Let's try with three 9s.

Sum from 9s is 27. So the remaining sum is 30-27=3, spread over the remaining five numbers.

But wait, n=8, so three 9s and five other numbers? Or wait, no, n=8, so three 9s and five other numbers, but the sum of the other five numbers is 3. Since we have positive integers, each of the remaining five numbers is at least 1. So the minimal sum is 5*1=5, but we have 3, which is less than 5. So that's impossible. So three 9s would require the remaining five numbers to sum to 3, which is impossible because each is at least 1.

So 3 nines is
