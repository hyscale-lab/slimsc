Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, N is a four-digit number. So it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is: if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, N is a four-digit number, let's represent it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Now, if I change any one digit to 1, regardless of which one, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, or B to 1, or C to 1, or D to 1, each time results in a number divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the greatest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, then add them together.

Alright, so how do we approach this?

First, let's think about the property. For any digit in N, replacing it with 1 gives a multiple of 7. So, for each digit position, the number formed by replacing that digit with 1 must be divisible by 7.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace a digit with 1, say the thousands place, we get a new number: 1BCD. Similarly, replacing the hundreds place gives A1CD, the tens place gives AB1D, and the units place gives ABC1.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1BCD is divisible by 7
2. A1CD is divisible by 7
3. AB1D is divisible by 7
4. ABC1 is divisible by 7

Since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, we'd want N to be as large as possible, so likely starting from 9999 and working our way down until we find such a number.

But that might take a long time. Maybe we can find some constraints or equations based on the four conditions.

Let me try to write each condition mathematically.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these expressions is congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Now, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of N and the digit being replaced.

Wait, N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. When we replace a digit with 1, the new number can be written as N minus the original digit times its place value plus 1 times that place value. For example, replacing the thousands digit:

1BCD = N - (A * 1000) + 1000.

Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit:

A1CD = N - (B * 100) + 100.

Replacing the tens digit:

AB1D = N - (C * 10) + 10.

Replacing the units digit:

ABC1 = N - D + 1.

So, for each case, the new number is N - k * place + 1 * place, where k is the original digit, and place is 1000, 100, 10, or 1.

So, the new number is N - (k - 1) * place.

Given that each new number is divisible by 7, that means:

N - (k - 1) * place ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which implies N ≡ (k - 1) * place mod 7.

So for each digit, we have:

1. For thousands place: N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
2. For hundreds place: N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7
3. For tens place: N ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7
4. For units place: N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod 7

So, each of these four congruences must hold.

But since N must satisfy all four, perhaps we can write N ≡ (A-1)*1000 mod7, N ≡ (B-1)*100 mod7, N ≡ (C-1)*10 mod7, and N ≡ (D-1)*1 mod7.

Wait, but N is the same number in all four cases, so all four congruences must be satisfied simultaneously. So, this is a system of congruences that N must satisfy.

Hmm, perhaps we can compute what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7 to simplify these.

Let me compute:

7 goes into 1000 how many times?

But perhaps it's easier to compute each place value modulo 7:

1000 mod7: 1000 ÷7 is 142*7=994, 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly:

100 mod7: 7*14=98, 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, place values modulo7 are:

1000:6, 100:2, 10:3, 1:1.

So, the four congruences become:

1. N ≡ (A-1)*6 mod7

2. N ≡ (B-1)*2 mod7

3. N ≡ (C-1)*3 mod7

4. N ≡ (D-1)*1 mod7

So, all four of these must hold.

So, N ≡6(A-1) mod7,

N ≡2(B-1) mod7,

N ≡3(C-1) mod7,

N ≡(D-1) mod7.

But since all four are equal to N mod7, they must all be equal to each other mod7.

So, 6(A-1) ≡ 2(B-1) ≡3(C-1) ≡ (D-1) mod7.

So, all four expressions must be congruent modulo7.

Therefore, 6(A-1) ≡2(B-1) mod7,

6(A-1) ≡3(C-1) mod7,

6(A-1) ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, perhaps I can express B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me denote x = 6(A-1) mod7.

Then, 2(B-1) ≡x mod7,

3(C-1) ≡x mod7,

(D-1) ≡x mod7.

So, from each of these, I can solve for (B-1), (C-1), (D-1) in terms of x.

But since x is 6(A-1) mod7, and A is a digit from 1 to9 (since N is a four-digit number, A can't be 0), perhaps we can find expressions for B, C, D in terms of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express each in terms of x.

Let me think about each:

From 2(B-1) ≡x mod7,

We can multiply both
