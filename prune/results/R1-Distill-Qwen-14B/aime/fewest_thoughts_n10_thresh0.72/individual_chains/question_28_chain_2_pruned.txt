Alright, so I've got this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Hmm, a tetrahedron has four triangular faces, right? The problem says that ABCD is a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so opposite edges are equal. That might mean the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.

The question is about finding a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. That point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find this inradius.

The problem mentions that this distance can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, find m + n + p.

Okay, so first, I should figure out the volume of the tetrahedron because the inradius formula involves the volume and the surface area. Wait, right, the formula for the inradius r is 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area.

So, I need to find V and A.

But before that, maybe I can find the edge lengths and see if this tetrahedron is something special. Since opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. That seems like a characteristic of a "equifacial" tetrahedron, or maybe it's called isohedral? No, isohedral means all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. Wait, maybe it's a disphenoid? A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's it. So, this is a disphenoid.

Disphenoids have some nice properties. For one, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, hold on. If all opposite edges are equal, does that mean all faces are congruent? Let me think. In a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles if and only if all edges are equal, right? But in this case, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So, each pair of opposite edges has the same length, but all three pairs are different. Therefore, the four faces are congruent in pairs but not all four congruent. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, and sqrt89? Wait, no, because each face is a triangle formed by three edges. Let's see:

Take face ABC: edges AB, BC, and AC. So, AB = sqrt41, BC = sqrt89, AC = sqrt80. Similarly, face ABD: AB, BD, AD. AB is sqrt41, BD is sqrt80, AD is sqrt89. Similarly for other faces. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face is congruent, so it's an isohedral tetrahedron? Or maybe a regular tetrahedron, but no, because the edges are not equal.

Wait, no, each face is congruent, but the tetrahedron isn't regular. So, it's a disphenoid with congruent faces, which makes it isohedral.

So, each face is congruent, so the area of each face is the same. That might simplify things because the total surface area will just be 4 times the area of one face.

So, first, let me compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt41, b = sqrt8
