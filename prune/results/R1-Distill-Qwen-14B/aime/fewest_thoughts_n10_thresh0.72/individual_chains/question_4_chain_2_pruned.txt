Okay, so I've got this problem about Alice and Bob playing a game with tokens. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The game is such that there's a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. So, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be either winning or losing for the player about to move. A losing position is one where no matter what you do, the opponent can force a win. Conversely, a winning position is one where you can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position.

So, in this case, the losing positions would be those n where the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Wait, but the question is about Bob being able to force a win regardless of Alice's moves. So, that would mean that for those n, the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, and Bob can win. So I'm looking for the number of n ≤ 2024 where Alice cannot win, meaning Bob can.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can use dynamic programming or find a pattern by calculating the losing positions.

Let me denote each position (number of tokens) as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because there are no tokens to take. But wait, actually, in this game, taking the last token wins, so if n=1, the player can take it and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

Wait, perhaps I should list the positions starting from n=0 and see which are W or L.

n=0: No tokens left. The player can't move, so it's a losing position (L).

n=1: Player can take 1 token, leaving 0 for the opponent. Since 0 is L, the current player can force a win. So n=1 is W.

n=2: Player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is W. Or take 4, but can't because 4>2
