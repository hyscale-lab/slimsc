Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The distance should be expressed in a certain form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me write down the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

I notice that the opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. That seems symmetrical. Maybe this tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are congruent, which might not be the case here. But the symmetry might still help.

The point I is the incenter, which is the point equidistant from all four faces. That distance is what we're looking for. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S.

But first, how can I find the volume? Since the edge lengths are given, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I've heard of that before; it's a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on its edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

det = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
         | 1  0  AB² AC² AD² |
         | 1 AB² 0  BC² BD² |
         | 1 AC² BC² 0  CD² |
         | 1 AD² BD² CD² 0  |

And the volume V is then:

V = sqrt( det / 288 )

But the determinant is a 5x5 determinant, which might be a bit complicated to compute. Maybe there's a smarter way because of the symmetry in the edge lengths?

Wait, the edge lengths are arranged such that opposite edges are equal. Maybe that symmetry can help simplify the determinant.

Let me assign the edges properly. Let me denote the edges as:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => BD² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix looks like:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, that seems symmetric. Maybe I can take advantage of that symmetry to compute the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another approach. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that opposite edges are aligned in a particular way.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me assume that the tetrahedron is centered at the origin, and perhaps the points are symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps I can set up the coordinates so that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide. Since AB
