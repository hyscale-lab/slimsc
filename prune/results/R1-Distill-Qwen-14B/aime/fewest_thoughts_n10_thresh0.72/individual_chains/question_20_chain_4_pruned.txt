Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Plus, any additional chip I try to place would break one of these rules. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so 25 cells in total. Each cell can either be empty or have a chip, either white or black. But wait, no: actually, each cell can have at most one chip, but the color is determined by the row and column. Because all chips in the same row must be the same color, and same for columns. So that means that each row can only have chips of a single color, and each column can only have chips of a single color.

Wait, but rows and columns are both restricted. So this implies that the grid has to have a consistent color pattern. Because if a row is all white, then any column that intersects that row must also be all white or all black. But if it's all white, the column can't have both white and black chips because that would mix colors in the column. Oh, so perhaps the entire grid must be of a single color? No, wait, that can't be right because the problem allows for both white and black chips.

Wait, maybe each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black. But then, how do these choices interact? Because if a row is white, then every column that intersects that row must also be white? Because otherwise, the column would have a white chip from the row and a black chip from another row, which is not allowed since the column must be all same color.

Wait, that makes sense. So if a row is white, then all the columns in that row must be white, meaning that the entire column must be white. Similarly, if a row is black, then all columns in that row must be black, meaning the entire column must be black.

But then, that would imply that all rows and all columns are of the same color. But that can't be, because then you can't have both white
