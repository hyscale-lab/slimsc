Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, that means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct roots except ω^0 = 1, which is excluded here.

So, the product is over k=0 to 12, but wait, ω^0 is 1, so when k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^0 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that first term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So maybe I can start the product from k=1 to 12 instead? That might make things easier.

So the product simplifies to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Now, I need to compute this product. Let me think about how to handle the terms 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten perhaps. Let me factor it or see if it's a known form. Hmm, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} is equal to ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see:

Let x = ω^k. Then, each term becomes x^2 - 2x + 2. So, the product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k.

But ω^k are the 13th roots of unity excluding 1, right? Since k=1 to 12. So
