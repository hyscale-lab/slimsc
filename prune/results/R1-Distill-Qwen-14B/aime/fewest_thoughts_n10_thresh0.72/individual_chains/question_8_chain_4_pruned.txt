Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums and products, sometimes you can factor or rearrange terms to make things clearer. Let me look at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this somehow.

Let me try to factor out common terms. Let's see, group the terms as follows: a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems to work. So, the equation becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others. Let's see:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. So now, the equation is in terms of a, b, c each multiplied by (300 minus themselves). Let's write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Maybe I should keep it as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions involving a, b, c that can be connected to a + b + c. Let me recall that:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

We know a + b + c is 300, so (300)^2 = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Therefore, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc. These are the standard symmetric sums.

I need to find a way to express the second equation in terms of S, Q, and P. Let me see:

We have the second equation as a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me factor this differently. Each term is of the form x²y where x and y are variables. So, perhaps this can be written as (a² + b² + c²)(a + b + c) - (a³ + b³ + c³).

Wait, let's
