Okay, so I've got this math problem about Aimeville's residents and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves sets and their overlaps. I think this is a problem about the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let me write down what's given:

- Total residents: 900
- Number owning a diamond ring: 195
- Number owning a set of golf clubs: 367
- Number owning a garden spade: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's 900 people owning that.

Wait, so each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts. So, the bag of candy hearts is like a universal set here. All other ownerships are subsets of this.

So, we have four items: let's denote them as follows:

- D: diamond ring
- G: golf clubs
- S: garden spade
- C: candy hearts

Wait, but everyone owns C, so the universal set is C, which has 900 elements. So, all the other sets (D, G, S) are subsets of C.

Now, the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's our universe. So, the four items are C, D, G, S, but all residents have C, so we can think in terms of how many have D, G, S, and possibly all four.

The next part says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "exactly two" and "exactly three", but we have four items here. Or wait, no, each resident owns at least C, so when they say "exactly two" or "exactly three", they're talking about exactly two or three of D, G, S, and C?

Wait, no, because C is owned by everyone. So, if someone owns exactly two things, that would include C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others. Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing. So, the total number of items they can own is four: C, D, G, S. So, when it says 437 own exactly two, that would mean they own two of the four items, including C? Or does it include C automatically?

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as: each resident owns some combination of D, G, S, and C. Since all own C, then when it's said that someone owns exactly two things, that could be C plus one other, or perhaps the two things could be any two, including C. Hmm, but the way the problem is phrased, I think "exactly two" refers to exactly two of the four items, which includes C.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it's written: "437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." So, I think "these things" refers to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the bag of candy hearts. So, each resident owns at least one thing, but in this case, everyone owns the candy hearts. So, the other three are optional.

Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four "things" are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

So, when it says someone owns exactly two of these things, that would be two of these four, including the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three would be three of the four, including the candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are always owned, so any ownership count would include C.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, that means that the candy hearts are a given; everyone has that. So, when the problem later refers to people owning exactly two or three things, those are referring to exactly two or three of the other three items, not including the candy hearts. Or perhaps including? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps I should reread the problem statement.

Problem statement: "In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts."

So, the four things are: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts, but may own some or all of the other three.

So, when the problem says "437 residents who own exactly two of these things," it's referring to exactly two of the four, including candy hearts. Similarly, 234 own exactly three of the four, including candy hearts.

But wait, that can't be, because everyone owns at least one (candy hearts), so the minimum is one thing. So, when it says "exactly two," it's two of the four, which would include the candy hearts. So, someone could have, for example, candy hearts and a diamond ring, but not the other two. Similarly, exactly three would include candy hearts plus two others.

But in that case, the problem is about four sets, and the counts include C. Let me structure this.

Let me denote:

- n(C) = 900, since everyone has C.

- n(D) = 195, n(G) = 367, n(S) = 562.

We have to find n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C), which is the number of residents who have all four. But since everyone has C, it's the same as n(D ∩ G ∩ S).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model it as four sets, with C being universal.

So, the problem is about four sets: D, G, S, C, where C includes everyone.

We are told that:

- Exactly two of these: 437 people.

- Exactly three of these: 234 people.

We need to find the number of people who have all four: exactly four.

Wait, but the problem says "exactly two of these things" and "exactly three of these things". So, in the context of four items, the possible exact counts are 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since everyone has C, the minimum is 1, so the possible exact counts are 1, 2, 3, 4.

But the problem says 437 have exactly two, 234 have exactly three, and we're to find how many have all four.

Wait, but what about those who have exactly one? Because 437 + 234 + x = total, but the total is 900. Hmm, yeah, but let me check.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention the number of people with exactly one thing, but maybe we can compute it.

Let me think: The total number of residents is 900, and each has at least one thing (C). So, the sum of people with exactly 1, exactly 2, exactly 3, exactly 4 things is 900.

We have:

Exactly 2: 437

Exactly 3: 234

Exactly 4: Let's call this x.

Exactly 1: Let's call this y.

So, y + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Which simplifies to y + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, y + x = 229. Hmm.

But perhaps we can find another equation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the counts.

Wait, but the problem is about four sets, but it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as follows.

Let me denote the four sets as D, G, S, C, with C being the universal set (since everyone owns it).

The number of people owning exactly two of the four things is 437. Since each person must have C, that means exactly two would be C plus one other. So, for example, D and C, G and C, etc.

Wait, no. Wait, when they have exactly two of the four things, it's any two, including C. So, for example, someone could have C and D, or C and G, or C and S, or exactly D and G, etc., but wait, no, because if someone has D and G, but not C, that's impossible because everyone has C. So, actually, all residents have C, so when they have exactly two things, it must be C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three things would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all four.

Wait, that can't be right because if exactly two things, and since C is always present, that would mean C plus one other. So, someone with exactly two things would have C plus one of D, G, or S.

Similarly, exactly three would have C plus two of the other three.

Wait, but that can't be because the problem says 437 own exactly two, which would mean C plus one, and 234 own exactly three, which would be C plus two. Then, the remaining would be C plus three, which is all four.

So, let me try to model this.

Number of people with exactly two things: 437. Each of these has C plus exactly one other item. So, the number of people with exactly two things would be the sum of people with C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.

Similarly, the people with exactly three things (234) would be those with C plus two others: C, D, G; C, D, S; C, G, S.

And people with exactly four things (x) would have all four.

Plus, the people with exactly one thing (y) would have only C. Because everyone has C, so the only way to have exactly one thing is to have only C.

So, now, let's think about how inclusion-exclusion works for four sets.

Wait, but since C is the universal set, maybe it's easier to model without C. Because everyone has C, so each of the other sets D, G, S is a subset of C.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the counts for D, G, S, and their overlaps, considering that all are within C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, considering D, G, S, because C is the universal set.

Wait, let me try that. Let me model D, G, S as subsets of C, with |C|=900.

So, the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets says:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But we also know that everyone has C, so the total number of people without C is zero. Wait, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S. But since everyone has C, the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S plus C. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the given numbers: 437 own exactly two of the four things, 234 own exactly three, and x own all four. The rest (y) own exactly one thing (which is only C).

So, let me model the counts for D, G, S.

Each person owns some combination of D, G, S, along with C.

Let me denote:

- a: number of people with only C (exactly one thing) → y.

- b: number with C and D only (exactly two things).

- c: number with C and G only.

- d: number with C and S only.

- e: number with C, D, G only (exactly three things).

- f: number with C, D, S only.

- g: number with C, G, S only.

- h: number with C, D, G, S (exactly four things) → x.

So, the total number of people is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

Now, the number of people owning exactly two things is b + c + d = 437.

The number owning exactly three things is e + f + g = 234.

The number owning exactly four things is h = x.

And the number owning exactly one thing is a = y.

Earlier, we had y + x = 229, because 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

So, a + h = 229.

Now, let's look at the counts for each of D, G, S.

The number of people owning D is |D| = a_D = 195.

But a_D is the number of people with D, which includes:

- b (C and D)

- e (C, D, G)

- f (C, D, S)

- h (C, D, G, S)

So, |D| = b + e + f + h = 195.

Similarly, |G| = c + e + g + h = 367.

And |S| = d + f + g + h = 562.

Now, we have the following equations:

1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.

2. b + c + d = 437.

3. e + f + g = 234.

4. a + h = 229.

5. b + e + f + h = 195.

6. c + e + g + h = 367.

7. d + f + g + h = 562.

We can try to solve these equations step by step.

First, from equation 2: b + c + d = 437.

From equation 3: e + f + g = 234.

From equation 4: a + h = 229.

From equation 1: a + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 900 → a + 437 + 234 + h = 900 → a + h = 229, which matches equation 4.

So, that's consistent.

Now, let's consider equation 5: b + e + f + h = 195.

But from equation 3, e + f + g = 234 → e + f = 234 - g.

Substituting into equation 5: b + (234 - g) + h = 195 → b - g + h = 195 - 234 → b - g + h = -39.

Hmm, that's equation 5a: b - g + h = -39.

Similarly, equation 6: c + e + g + h = 367.

We can write e + g as (from equation 3): e + g = 234 - f.

Wait, but maybe another approach. Let's try to express variables in terms of others.

We have from equation 5: b + e + f + h = 195.

From equation 3: e + f + g = 234 → e + f = 234 - g.

Substituting into equation 5: b + (234 - g) + h = 195 → b + h - g = 195 - 234 → b + h - g = -39.

Similarly, equation 6: c + e + g + h = 367.

Let me try to find another equation.

Wait, let's also consider equation 7: d + f + g + h = 562.

Hmm.

But perhaps we can find expressions for variables in terms of h.

From equation 4: a = 229 - h.

From equation 2: b + c + d = 437 → So, c + d = 437 - b.

From equation 3: e + f + g = 234 → e = 234 - f - g.

From equation 5: b + e + f + h = 195.

Substituting e from equation 3 into equation 5:

b + (234 - f - g) + f + h = 195 → b + 234 - g + h = 195 → b - g + h = 195 - 234 → b - g + h = -39.

Which is what I had earlier.

Similarly, from equation 6: c + e + g + h = 367.

Again, substituting e from equation 3: e = 234 - f - g.

So, equation 6 becomes:

c + (234 - f - g) + g + h = 367 → c + 234 - f + h = 367 → c - f + h = 367 - 234 → c - f + h = 133.

Hmm, equation 6a.

From equation 7: d + f + g + h = 562.

Hmm.

This seems getting complicated. Maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for the three sets D, G, S.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion for three sets says that:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But since everyone owns C, the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is |D ∪ G ∪ S|, which is equal to the total number of people minus those who don't own D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, the people who don't own D, G, S are exactly those who own only C, which is a = y.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a.

But from inclusion-exclusion:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So,

900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Let me compute 195 + 367 + 562:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So, 900 - a = 1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Hmm, but I don't know |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S|, or |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, but maybe I can express these intersections in terms of the variables we have from the previous model.

From the variables:

- |D ∩ G| is the number of people who have both D and G, which includes those who have C, D, G only (e), those with C, D, G, S (h), and those with D, G, but not C? Wait, no, because everyone has C. So, |D ∩ G| includes e and h.

Wait, no, earlier we defined e as those with C, D, G only, and h as those with all four. So, |D ∩ G| = e + h.

Similarly, |D ∩ S| = f + h.

|G ∩ S| = g + h.

And |D ∩ G ∩ S| = h.

So, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion equation:

900 - a = 1124 - ( (e + h) + (f + h) + (g + h) ) + h.

Simplify:

900 - a = 1124 - (e + f + g + 3h) + h.

Which becomes:

900 - a = 1124 - (e + f + g) - 2h.

From equation 3, e + f + g = 234.

So,

900 - a = 1124 - 234 - 2h.

Calculate 1124 - 234: 1124 - 200 = 924; 924 - 34 = 890.

So,

900 - a = 890 - 2h.

Rearranging,

(900 - a) - 890 = -2h → 10 - a = -2h → 2h = a - 10.

But from equation 4, a + h = 229 → a = 229 - h.

Substituting into 2h = a -10:

2h = (229 - h) - 10 → 2h = 219 - h → 3h = 219 → h = 73.

So, h, which is the number of people with all four things, is 73.

So, the answer is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the overlaps between the sets of residents owning different items. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Define the sets**:
   - \( C \): Bag of candy hearts (owned by all 900 residents).
   - \( D \): Diamond ring (195 residents).
   - \( G \): Golf clubs (367 residents).
   - \( S \): Garden spade (562 residents).

2. **Given data**:
   - Total residents: 900.
   - Residents owning exactly two items: 437.
   - Residents owning exactly three items: 234.
   - We need to find residents owning all four items (\( h \)).

3. **Variables**:
   - \( a \): Residents owning only \( C \) (exactly one item).
   - \( b, c, d \): Residents owning \( C \) plus one other item (exactly two items).
   - \( e, f, g \): Residents owning \( C \) plus two other items (exactly three items).
   - \( h \): Residents owning all four items (exactly four items).

4. **Equations**:
   - \( a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900 \) (total residents).
   - \( b + c + d = 437 \) (exactly two items).
   - \( e + f + g = 234 \) (exactly three items).
   - \( a + h = 229 \) (since \( 900 - 437 - 234 = 229 \)).

5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:
   Using the principle for sets \( D, G, S \):
   \[
   |D \cup G \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap S|
   \]
   Since everyone owns \( C \), \( |D \cup G \cup S| = 900 - a \).

6. **Substitute values**:
   \[
   900 - a = 195 + 367 + 562 - (e + h + f + h + g + h) + h
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   900 - a = 1124 - (e + f + g + 3h) + h
   \]
   Using \( e + f + g = 234 \):
   \[
   900 - a = 1124 - 234 - 2h
   \]
   \[
   900 - a = 890 - 2h
   \]
   \[
   10 - a = -2h
   \]
   Using \( a = 229 - h \):
   \[
   2h = (229 - h) - 10
   \]
   \[
   3h = 219 \implies h = 73
   \]

**Answer**: The number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
