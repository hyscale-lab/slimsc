Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the plane of the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the torus T is made by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the main circle has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis of revolution is 6. That makes sense.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem talks about two scenarios: when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere and when it rests on the outside. In each case, they are tangent along a circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i for internal tangency and r_o for external tangency, then compute the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, finally finding m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I should start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

The sphere has a fixed radius, 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they touch along another circle. I need to find these circles' radii.

Wait, but how do the torus and sphere touch? For internal tangency, the torus is inside the sphere, and they're tangent along a circle. For external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, and again, they're tangent along another circle. I guess I need to find the positions where these two surfaces touch.

Let me think about the geometry here. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sphere radius minus the torus' major radius, right? Because the torus is inside, so the center of the sphere is at some point, and the center of the generating circle of the torus is at a distance of R from the axis. Wait, maybe I should consider the centers.

Wait, actually, I think the sphere is centered at the same point as the center of the torus? Or is the sphere's center different? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but I think in both cases, the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's center. Because otherwise, the problem would have specified different centers. So, assuming both the sphere and the torus are centered at the same point.

So, for the torus, the major radius is R = 6, and the minor radius is r = 3. The sphere has radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the surfaces are tangent along a circle. So, the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on this circle of tangency must be equal to both the sphere's radius and the torus' surface at that point.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the tangency occurs such that the distance from the center to the circle is equal to the sphere's radius plus the torus' major radius or something like that. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the closest and farthest points.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. So in this case, it's (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2 = 9.

The sphere is
