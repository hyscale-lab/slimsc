Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I should probably represent the dimensions of the box. Let's say the box has length x, width y, and height z. So, the surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume (V) is xyz.

Given that SA = 54 and V = 23, so:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27.

And xyz = 23.

I think I can use these two equations to find relationships between the variables.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Thus, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, so I need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some inequalities like AM >= GM or Cauchy-Schwarz.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about symmetric functions or maybe substituting variables.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

Also, I know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize S², because x² + y² + z² is directly dependent on S².

But how do I find S? Hmm. I have S, P, and Q. Maybe I can find a relationship between them.

Wait, for a cubic equation with roots x, y, z, the equation is t³ - St² + Pt - Q = 0. So, t³ - St² + 27t - 23 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can use some inequalities here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality. I know that for positive real numbers, certain inequalities hold.

But since we're dealing with three variables, maybe I can consider using the AM-QM (Arithmetic Mean - Quadratic Mean) inequality.

Wait, but I need to relate x² + y² + z² to S. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

So, let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,

and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, I can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0,

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27,

xyz = 23.

So, I have four equations here. Let me see if I can find some symmetry or relations between x, y, z.

If we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:

2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) - [2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] = 0.

Simplify:

2(y - x) - λ(x + z - y - z) - μ(xz - yz) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

2(y - x) - λ(x - y) - μ z(x - y) = 0.

Factor out (y - x):

[2 + λ + μ z](y - x) = 0.

So, either y = x, or 2 + λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third:

2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) - [2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz)] = 0.

Simplify:

2(z - y) - λ(x + y - x - z) - μ(xy - xz) = 0.

Which becomes:

2(z - y) - λ(y - z) - μ x(y - z) = 0.

Factor out (z - y):

[2 + λ + μ x](z - y) = 0.

So, either z = y, or 2 + λ + μ x = 0.

Similarly, subtracting the first equation from the third:

2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) - [2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz)] = 0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to assume that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x = y = z. But wait, if x = y = z, then it's a cube, but in that case, the surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x²=9 → x=3, and volume x³=27. But the given volume is 23, which is less than 27, so a cube isn't the case here. So, the minimal sphere might not have x=y=z. So, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Let me suppose that x = y. Then, we can express all variables in terms of x and z.

So, let x = y.

Then, surface area: 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54 → x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x * x * z = x² z = 23 → z = 23 / x².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + (46)/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Yes! x=2 is a root. So, we can factor (x - 2).

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x -2):

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46.

Bring down 1. Multiply by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2:4. Add to -27: -23.

Multiply by 2: -46. Add to 46: 0. So, the cubic factors as (x -2)(x² +2x -23).

So, the roots are x=2, and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x=2, or x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, x could be 2 or approximately 3.898.

So, when x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75.

Calculating x² + y² + z² = 2² + 2² + (23/4)^2 = 4 +4 + (529/16) = 8 + 529/16 = (128 +529)/16 = 657/16.

So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64. Wait, wait. No, r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, (657/16)/4=657/64.

But wait, let me check when x= -1 + 2√6.

x= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898, so x ≈3.898.

Then, z=23/(x²)≈23/(15.19)≈1.514.

So, x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.514.

Compute x² + y² + z²≈(3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2≈15.19 +15.19 +2.29≈32.67.

Compare to when x=2, which gave 657/16=41.0625. So, 32.67 is less, so this is a better minimum.

So, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal and the other is different. So, maybe x=y= -1 + 2√6 and z=23/(x²).

But I need to do this properly instead of approximating.

So, let's denote x = y.

Then, the equations become:

2(x² + 2xz) =54 →x² + 2xz =27.

And x² z=23→z=23/(x²).

Substituting into the first equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) =27→x² +46/x =27.

Multiply by x: x³ +46=27x→x³ -27x +46=0.

We found that x=2 is a root, so factor as (x-2)(x²+2x -23)=0.

Thus, x=2, or x² +2x -23=0→x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4√6)/2= -1 ±2√6.

Since x>0, we take x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, the minimal x² + y² + z² in this case is when x=y= -1 +2√6 and z=23/(x²).

Let me compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6.

x²= (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6)=1 + 24 -4√6=25-4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6).

We can rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Since 529=23², so 23/529=1/23.

Thus, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, x² + y² + z²= 2x² + z².

We have x²=25 -4√6,

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

z²=(25 +4√6)^2 /23².

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + (4√6)^2 +2*25*4√6=
