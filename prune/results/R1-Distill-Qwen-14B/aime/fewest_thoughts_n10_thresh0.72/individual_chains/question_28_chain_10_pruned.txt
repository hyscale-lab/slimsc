Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find that distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, and then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. That incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that touches each face. So the distance from I to each face is the inradius, which I need to find.

To find the inradius, I recall the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron: r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So I need to compute both the volume V and the total surface area S.

But wait, how do I find the volume and surface area without knowing the specific coordinates of the vertices? Maybe I can use some properties of the tetrahedron or coordinate geometry.

Looking at the given edge lengths, I notice that opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. This seems symmetric. Maybe it's a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron that can be embedded in a coordinate system with vertices at certain points to make calculations easier.

Yes, setting coordinates might be a good approach. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the symmetries are preserved.

Let me consider placing the points in 3D space. Let's assume point A is at (x, y, z), B is at (a, b, c), C is at (d, e, f), and D is at (g, h, i). But that's too vague. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, another approach is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which can compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Since all edge lengths are provided, this might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, let me list all the edge
