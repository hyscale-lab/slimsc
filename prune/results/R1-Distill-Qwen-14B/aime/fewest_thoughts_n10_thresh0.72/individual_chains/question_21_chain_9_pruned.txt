Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is written as 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, so I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n are b-eautiful. Then, find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem.

First, understanding what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c. 

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Let me write that down:

n = a*b + c
sqrt(n) = a + c

But since sqrt(n) is an integer, let's denote k = sqrt(n). Then, n = k^2. So,

k^2 = a*b + c

But we also have that k = a + c. So, substituting that into the equation:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Because c = k - a. So,

k^2 = a*b + k - a
k^2 = a*(b - 1) + k

Let me rearrange that:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Hmm. Since a must be an integer, and a is a digit in base b, meaning 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1.

Also, c must be a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. But since c = k - a, and a is at least 1, c can be as low as k - (b - 1). Wait, but c has to be ≥ 0. So, k - a ≥ 0 → a ≤ k.

So, a is between 1 and min(b - 1, k).

But since a is also (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), that means (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k^2 - k).

Alternatively, (b - 1) divides (k^2 - k), which factors as k*(k - 1). So, (b - 1) must be a divisor of k*(k - 1). 

Additionally, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1 and a ≤ k.

So, putting this all together, for a given base b, we can look for integers k such that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1). Then, for each such k, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). Then, check whether a is an integer, and whether 1 ≤ a ≤ (b - 1), and c = k - a is between 0 and (b - 1).

Wait, but c = k - a. So, c must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. Since a ≥ 1, c ≤ k - 1. But since we're in base b, c can be up to b -1, so k - a ≤ b - 1. Since a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1), let's see if this is manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps for each base b, we can find the possible k's such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check whether a is within the required range.

But since we need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, maybe it's better to approach it by
