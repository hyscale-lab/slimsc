Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 1/3
Convert 1/3 to 4/12:
2b = -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4
So, b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

So, b = -3/8

Then, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12)
Convert to common denominator, which is 24:
-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9/24 + 2/24) = (-7/24)

So, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Let me check these values in the original logarithmic equations (1b, 2b, 3b) to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Left side: a = -7/24
Right side: b + c + 1/2 = (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2
Convert all to 24 denominator:
-3/8 = -9/24
-5/12 = -10/24
1/2 = 12/24
Sum: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24
Which matches a. Good.

Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Left side: b = -3/8
Right side: a + c + 1/3 = (-7/24) + (-5/12) + 1/3
Convert to 24 denominator:
-7/24, -5/12 = -10/24, 1/3 = 8/24
Sum: (-7 -10 +8)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8
Which matches b. Good.

Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4
Left side: c = -5/12
Right side: a + b + 1/4 = (-7/24) + (-3/8) + 1/4
Convert to 24 denominator:
-7/24, -3/8 = -9/24, 1/4 = 6/24
Sum: (-7 -9 +6)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12
Which matches c. Good.

So, the values are correct.

Now, our target is E = 4a + 3b + 2c.

Plugging in the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

So, E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine the terms:

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6): that's (-12/6) = -2

Then, add (-9/8): -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25/8)

So, E = -25/8

The problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | = 25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since their greatest common divisor is 1. So, m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because it seems a bit odd that the result is negative. But since we're taking absolute value, it's okay. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the arithmetic.

So, E = 4a +3b +2c

a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Compute each term:

4a: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667

3b:3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 ≈ -1.125

2c:2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 ≈ -0.8333

Adding them together: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me convert all to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

Wait, wait, wait. Because 28 +27 is 55, plus 20 is 75. So, negative 75/24? But 75/24 simplifies to 25/8.

Yes, so E = -75/24 = -25/8. So, absolute value is 25/8.

So, m =25, n=8, which are coprime. So m +n is 33.

Hmm, that seems correct.


The given system of logarithmic equations can be converted into a linear system in terms of logarithms. By solving this system, we find the values of the logarithms of x, y, and z. Substituting these values into the expression we need to evaluate, we compute the absolute value and express it as a reduced fraction. The sum of the numerator and denominator is the final answer.

$\boxed{33}$
