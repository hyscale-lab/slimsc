Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem in front of me, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted into exponential form, which might make it easier to handle. So, if log_x(y^x) = 10, that should mean that x raised to the power of 10 equals y^x. Let me write that down:

log_x(y^x) = 10 ⇒ x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which should mean that y raised to the power of 10 equals x^{4y}:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 ⇒ y^10 = x^{4y}.

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, both equations involve x and y with exponents. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents. Let's try that.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y.

So, equation 1 becomes:

10 ln x = x ln y.  [Equation A]

Similarly, for equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}

Taking ln again:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which gives:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So, equation 2 becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x.  [Equation B]

Now, I have two equations (A and B) involving ln x and ln y. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

From Equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y ⇒ ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

From Equation B: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now, substitute ln y from Equation A into Equation B.

So, Equation B becomes:

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side:

(100 ln x) / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, ln x is a common factor on both sides. Since x > 1, ln x is positive, so I can divide both sides by ln x without any issues. Let's do that:

100 / x = 4y.

So, 100/x = 4y ⇒ y = (100)/(4x) ⇒ y = 25/x.

Wait, so y is 25/x. Interesting. Now, I can plug this back into either Equation A or B to find x.

Let me choose Equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y.

But since y = 25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So, substituting into Equation A:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Let me write this out:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x.

Let's bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0.

Factor out ln x where possible:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln25.

So,

ln x = (x ln25) / (10 + x).

Hmm, that's an equation involving ln x. Let me think about how to solve this.

Alternatively, maybe I can express x in terms of y or something else. Wait, but I already have y =25/x. Maybe substitution is the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I can substitute y =25/x into one of the original logarithmic equations. Let me try that.

Looking back at equation 1: log_x(y^x) =10.

Since y =25/x, substitute:

log_x( (25/x)^x ) =10.

Simplify inside the log:

(25/x)^x = 25^x / x^x.

So, log_x(25^x / x^x) =10.

Using logarithm rules, log_x(a/b) = log_x a - log_x b.

Thus,

log_x (25^x) - log_x (x^x) =10.

Simplify each term:

log_x (25^x) = x log_x 25, and log_x (x^x) = x log_x x =x*1 =x.

So, the equation becomes:

x log_x 25 - x =10.

Factor out x:

x (log_x 25 -1) =10.

Hmm, log_x 25 can be rewritten using change of base formula. Remember that log_b a = ln a / ln b.

So, log_x 25 = ln25 / ln x.

Thus,

x ( (ln25 / ln x) - 1 ) =10.

Let me write that:

x ( (ln25 - ln x) / ln x ) =10.

Which is:

x ( (ln(25/x) ) / ln x ) =10.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe try to express everything in terms of t = ln x or something.

Let me set t = ln x. Then, ln25 is a constant, so ln25 = k (let me say k for simplicity).

So, equation becomes:

x ( (k - t) / t ) =10.

But x = e^t (since t = ln x), so:

e^t ( (k - t)/t ) =10.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated but maybe manageable.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the substitution for ln x. Earlier, I had:

ln x = (x ln25)/(10 + x).

So,

ln x =
