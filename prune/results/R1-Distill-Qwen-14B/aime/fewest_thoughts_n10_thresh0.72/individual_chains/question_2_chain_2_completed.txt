Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form the triangle OAB. The problem is talking about a family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, and all these segments are of length 1.

The key part is that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from family F except for AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, compute p + q.

Hmm. So, I need to find point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment from family F except AB. So, AB is a member of family F because it's of unit length, right? Let me check.

Wait, AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's calculate its length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a segment of unit length in family F.

So, point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F. So, our goal is to find point C such that if we were to take any other segment PQ in F, C doesn't lie on PQ. Only AB contains C.

So, perhaps this point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F. Because in such cases, the envelope is the set of all limit points of the family, and the tangent at C would be the envelope.

Wait, but maybe I need to think in terms of the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of all these segments PQ, then the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and C is the point where AB touches this curve, so that any other PQ from F doesn't pass through C. Hmm.

Wait, I think the envelope idea is more promising. So, let me try to model the family F.

Each segment PQ connects a point P(p, 0) on the x-axis to a point Q(0, q) on the y-axis, with PQ of length 1. So, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. By the distance formula:

sqrt[(p)^2 + (q)^2] = 1 => p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, each segment PQ is between (p,0) and (0, q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, the family F consists of all such segments where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, to find the envelope of all these segments, perhaps I can parameterize each segment and then find the envelope.

Alternatively, we can parametrize each PQ by a parameter, say t, such that p = t, then q = sqrt(1 - t^2). But since p and q are positive (because we're in the first quadrant), t ranges from 0 to 1.

Wait, but actually, each PQ is a straight line segment from (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)). So, the equation of the line PQ can be found.

Let me find the equation of PQ. Let's say P is (t, 0) and Q is (0, s), where t^2 + s^2 = 1.

So, the equation of the line PQ is x/t + y/s = 1.

Because when x = t, y=0, and when x=0, y=s.

So, the equation is x/t + y/s =1, with t^2 + s^2 =1.

So, the family F is given by the lines x/t + y/s =1, where t and s are positive numbers with t^2 + s^2 =1.

So, I can write s in terms of t: s = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, the equation of each line is x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) = 1.

Now, to find the envelope of these lines, I can use the method where for each t, we have a line, and the envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to t.

So, the envelope is a curve such that for each t, the line is tangent to the curve at some point (x(t), y(t)).

So, the envelope equations are:

1. x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) =1

2. derivative of the left-hand side with respect to t =0.

So, first, let me compute the derivative.

Let me denote f(t) = x/t + y/(sqrt(1 - t^2)).

Then, df/dt = -x/t^2 + y * (1/2)(1 - t^2)^(-3/2) * 2t.

Simplify: df/dt = -x/t^2 + y * t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)

Set this equal to zero for the envelope condition.

So, we have:

-x/t^2 + y t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2) = 0

Which can be rewritten as:

y t = x t^2 / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)

Let me rearrange this.

y = x t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)

Hmm, so now we have two equations:

x/t + y / sqrt(1 - t^2) =1

and

y = x t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)

So, let's substitute y from the second equation into the first.

So,

x/t + [x t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)] / sqrt(1 - t^2) =1

Simplify the second term:

[x t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2)] / sqrt(1 - t^2) = x t / (1 - t^2)^2

So, equation becomes:

x/t + x t / (1 - t^2)^2 =1

Factor out x:

x [1/t + t/(1 - t^2)^2 ] =1

So,

x = 1 / [1/t + t/(1 - t^2)^2 ]

Simplify denominator:

1/t + t/(1 - t^2)^2 = [ (1 - t^2)^2 + t^2 ] / [ t (1 - t^2)^2 ]

Compute numerator: (1 - t^2)^2 + t^2 = 1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 + t^2 = 1 - t^2 + t^4.

So,

x = [ t (1 - t^2)^2 ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

Similarly, from the second equation:

y = x t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2 )

Substitute x:

y = [ t (1 - t^2)^2 / (1 - t^2 + t^4 ) ] * t / (1 - t^2)^(3/2 )

Simplify:

y = [ t^2 (1 - t^2)^2 ] / [ (1 - t^2 + t^4 ) (1 - t^2)^(3/2) ) ]

= [ t^2 (1 - t^2)^(2 - 3/2) ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

= [ t^2 (1 - t^2)^(1/2) ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

So, now x and y are expressed in terms of t.

So, to get the envelope, we can write parametric equations:

x(t) = t (1 - t^2)^2 / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

y(t) = t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe we can find a relation between x and y without t.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a cartesian equation.

But before that, maybe let me see if I can find the equation of the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think.

Wait, since the envelope is formed by all these lines PQ, which are tangent to the envelope curve. So, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent, i.e., the curve is the "limit" of PQs as they change.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a circle or some conic section.

Wait, let me see if I can find the envelope equation.

Wait, so from the parametric expressions for x(t) and y(t), perhaps we can eliminate t.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can write x(t) and y(t) in terms of t and then find a relationship between x and y.

Let me denote t as a parameter and express x and y in terms of t.

Let me write:

Let me set t^2 = u. Then, t = sqrt(u), but that might complicate more.

Alternatively, maybe express y in terms of x.

Wait, from x(t):

x = t (1 - t^2)^2 / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

Let me write numerator as t (1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 ) and denominator as (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

So,

x = [ t (1 - 2 t^2 + t^4 ) ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

= [ t ( (1 - t^2 + t^4 ) - 2 t^2 ) ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

= t [ 1 - t^2 + t^4 - 2 t^2 ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

= t [ 1 - 3 t^2 + t^4 ] / (1 - t^2 + t^4 )

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, can we write x in terms of t?

Alternatively, perhaps set t = sinθ or something like that.

Wait, let me think differently. The condition is that point C is on AB, and it's the unique point on AB that's not on any other PQ from F. So, perhaps I can parametrize AB and find the point C where the tangent to the envelope at C is AB itself.

Alternatively, perhaps AB is the tangent to the envelope at C, and C is the only point where AB is tangent, so we can find that point.

Wait, AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2 ). So, the equation of AB can be found.

Let me find the equation of AB.

The line passes through (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2 ).

The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -sqrt(3 )

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3 ) x + c.

To find c, plug in point A(1/2, 0):

0 = -sqrt(3 )*(1/2 ) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB is y = -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) / 2.

Now, the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. So, point C lies on AB and on the envelope, and the tangent to the envelope at C is AB.

So, to find point C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Alternatively, since AB is in family F, the envelope must be tangent to AB at C.

Wait, but AB is a member of F, so the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent, so AB itself is a member of F, so the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent, which includes AB's tangent point.

Wait, but AB is the line segment from A to B, which is a member of F.

Wait, perhaps the envelope consists of all points where each PQ is tangent to it, so each PQ touches the envelope at exactly one point.

But AB is a member of F, so it's a line that is also in F, so the envelope might be a curve that is touched by each PQ once, but AB itself is a straight line which is also a PQ.

Wait, but perhaps the envelope is the union of all these PQs? But that can't be, because each PQ is a line segment, and the envelope is a curve.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a region? But no, envelope is a curve.

Wait, maybe the envelope is a circle. Because the set of lines PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ of unit length—maybe the envelope is a circle with radius 1/sqrt(2), but let me check.

Wait, but the envelope of lines x/t + y/s =1 with t^2 + s^2 =1, I think it's a circle.

Wait, let me see. Let's suppose the envelope is a circle. Let me assume that and see.

Suppose the envelope is a circle centered at the origin with radius r. Then, the equation would be x^2 + y^2 = r^2.

Now, each PQ is a line x/t + y/s =1, with t^2 + s^2 =1.

We can check whether this line is tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = r^2.

The condition for a line a x + b y = c to be tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to r.

So, the distance from (0,0) to x/t + y/s =1 is |0 + 0 - 1| / sqrt( (1/t)^2 + (1/s)^2 ) ) = 1 / sqrt( (1/t^2 + 1/s^2 ) )

Set this equal to r.

So,

r = 1 / sqrt( (1/t^2 + 1/s^2 ) )

But s^2 = 1 - t^2, so:

r = 1 / sqrt( 1/t^2 + 1/(1 - t^2 ) )

= 1 / sqrt( (1 - t^2 + t^2 ) / [t^2 (1 - t^2 ) ] )

= 1 / sqrt( 1 / [ t^2 (1 - t^2 ) ] )

= 1 / ( 1 / sqrt( t^2 (1 - t^2 ) ) )

= sqrt( t^2 (1 - t^2 ) )

= t sqrt(1 - t^2 )

Hmm, but for the line x/t + y/s =1 to be tangent to the circle x^2 + y^2 = r^2, the distance must be r. So, we have r = t sqrt(1 - t^2 )

But for a fixed r, this would mean that t sqrt(1 - t^2 ) = r for all t? That's impossible because t varies from 0 to 1. So, unless r=0, which doesn't make sense, this isn't possible. So, my initial assumption that the envelope is a circle is incorrect.

So, the envelope is not a circle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is an astroid.

Wait, the envelope of lines x/t + y/s =1 with t^2 + s^2 =1 is a well-known curve. Let me think.

Wait, if I set t = sinθ, then s = cosθ, since t^2 + s^2 =1.

Then, the line becomes x/sinθ + y/cosθ =1.

Which can be written as x cosθ + y sinθ = sinθ cosθ.

Wait, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation in terms of θ. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the envelope by parametrizing in terms of t and eliminating t.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can consider specific points on the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the point C by considering that it's on AB and is also on the envelope, and that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

So, let's parametrize point C on AB.

AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2 ). So, parametric equations for AB can be written as:

x = 1/2 (1 - t )

y = sqrt(3)/2 * t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, when t=0, we have (1/2, 0 ), which is point A, and when t=1, we have (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), which is point B.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (1/2 (1 - t ), sqrt(3)/2 t )

Now, since C is on the envelope, it must satisfy the envelope equation.

But I don't have the envelope equation yet. So, perhaps I can use the condition that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

Wait, the envelope is the set of points where each PQ is tangent to it. So, at point C, the line PQ is AB itself, but AB is a member of F, so the envelope is such that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

Wait, but AB is a straight line, and the envelope is another curve. So, the envelope must be a curve that is tangent to AB at point C, and all other PQs are tangent to the envelope at other points.

Hmm, perhaps the envelope is a convex curve, and AB is one of its tangent lines.

So, point C is the point of tangency between AB and the envelope.

Therefore, to find C, we need to find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

So, perhaps I can find the equation of the envelope and then find the point where AB is tangent to it.

Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, the system of equations consisting of the envelope equation and the line AB will have exactly one solution at point C, and the derivative at that point will match.

Wait, but without knowing the envelope equation, this approach is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the point C on AB such that the distance from C to the x-axis and y-axis satisfy some condition.

Wait, but C is (1/2 (1 - t ), sqrt(3)/2 t ). Let's denote C as (x, y).

So, x = (1 - t ) / 2

y = (sqrt(3 ) t ) / 2

So, t = (2 y ) / sqrt(3 )

Also, x = (1 - t ) / 2 => t = 1 - 2x

So, from both expressions for t:

1 - 2x = 2 y / sqrt(3 )

=> sqrt(3 ) (1 - 2x ) = 2 y

=> y = (sqrt(3 ) / 2 ) (1 - 2 x )

Which is consistent with the equation of AB.

So, now, since C is on the envelope, it must satisfy the envelope condition.

But I still don't know the envelope equation.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since C is on AB and is the unique point not lying on any other PQ from F, then any other PQ from F cannot pass through C.

So, for any other t (i.e., other than t corresponding to AB), the line PQ does not pass through C.

So, suppose there's another PQ with parameter t' (not the same as the t for AB), such that the line PQ passes through C.

But since C is unique, there's only one such PQ (which is AB) that passes through C.

So, for any other t', the line x/t' + y/sqrt(1 - t'^2 ) =1 does not pass through C.

So, to find C, it must satisfy that for all t' ≠ t_c (where t_c is the parameter for AB), the line PQ does not pass through C.

Hmm, but that's a bit abstract. Maybe I can find C by considering that it's the point on AB where the derivative of the distance from C to PQ is minimized or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of optimization. For each PQ in F, compute the distance from C to PQ, and ensure that the minimum distance is non-zero except for PQ=AB.

Wait, but point C is on AB, so the distance from C to AB is zero. But for other PQs, the distance from C to PQ should be positive, meaning that C doesn't lie on any other PQ.

So, perhaps the condition is that the minimal distance from C to any PQ (other than AB) is positive.

So, to ensure that, perhaps the minimal distance is achieved when PQ is tangent to the envelope at C.

Wait, but this is getting a bit too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the point C on AB such that the distance from C to any other PQ is minimized, and that minimal distance is zero only for PQ=AB.

Wait, but another approach: since C is on AB, and AB is a segment of F, then for any other point on AB, say D, which is not C, D lies on some other PQ in F.

But C is unique in that it doesn't lie on any other PQ.

So, perhaps the point C is the point on AB that is closest to the origin? Or perhaps not.

Wait, let me think. Let me compute OC^2. So, point C is (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), so the line is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, point C is (x, y) on AB, so y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find point C on AB such that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ does not pass through C.

So, suppose that for some t ≠ t_c (where t_c is the t for AB), the line PQ with parameter t passes through C.

But that would mean that C lies on PQ(t), which we don't want except for t = t_c.

So, to ensure that no other PQ passes through C, the system of equations:

x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1

and

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

should have no solution for t except t = t_c.

Wait, but t_c is the parameter for AB. Let's find t_c.

AB is the segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), so t_c is 1/2 because P is (1/2, 0), so t_c = 1/2.

Wait, let me check that. For AB, P is (1/2, 0), so t_c = 1/2, and Q is (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), so s_c = sqrt(3)/2.

And indeed, (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 )^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which satisfies p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, t_c = 1/2, and s_c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, the line AB is x/(1/2 ) + y/(sqrt(3)/2 ) =1, which simplifies to 2x + (2 y)/sqrt(3 ) =1.

Which is consistent with the equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, now, for any other t ≠ 1/2, the line x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1 should not pass through any point C on AB except when t=1/2.

But we need to find the point C on AB such that for all t ≠1/2, the line PQ(t) does not pass through C.

Wait, but how do we ensure that? Because for each t, PQ(t) is a different line.

Wait, perhaps the point C is the point on AB where the distance to the origin is minimized or maximized, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize point C on AB as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), and then plug this into the equation of PQ(t'), and find the condition that this only holds when t' =1/2.

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept that C is the point where the derivative of the distance from C to PQ(t) is minimized, but perhaps that's more calculus.

Wait, another idea: The point C is such that the set of all lines PQ(t) for t ≠1/2 do not pass through C. So, for point C on AB, the equation x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1 has no solution for t except t=1/2.

So, for point C = (x, y), the equation x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1 must not hold for any t ≠1/2.

So, if we have C = (x, y) on AB, then for any t ≠1/2, x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) ≠1.

So, we can write that for all t ≠1/2, x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) ≠1.

But, since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's substitute y into the equation:

x/t + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) ≠1.

So, for all t ≠1/2, the above expression is not equal to 1.

So, perhaps we can find x such that the equation x/t + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1 has only one solution t=1/2.

Wait, but that's a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the equation as:

x/t + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1.

Let me denote this as:

x/t + [ sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) x ] / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1.

Let me factor sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) [ (1/2 - x ) / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) ] + x/t =1.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as:

x/t + c / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1,

where c = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) x.

So, x/t + c / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1.

We can think of this as an equation in t, parameterizing the lines that pass through C.

But for our condition, this equation should have t=1/2 as the only solution.

So, the equation x/t + c / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) =1 must have exactly one solution t=1/2.

Which means that the equation has a double root at t=1/2, so that for any other t, the equation is not satisfied.

Wait, but that's a bit abstract. Alternatively, perhaps the function f(t) = x/t + c / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) -1 has a double root at t=1/2.

So, f(1/2 )=0 and f’(1/2 )=0.

So, let's compute f(t) and f’(t).

f(t) = x/t + c / sqrt(1 - t^2 ) -1.

Then,

f’(t) = -x / t^2 + c * ( t ) / (1 - t^2 )^(3/2 ).

Set f(1/2 )=0:

x/(1/2 ) + c / sqrt(1 - (1/2 )^2 ) -1 =0

Simplify:

2x + c / (sqrt(3)/2 ) -1 =0

=> 2x + (2 c ) / sqrt(3 ) -1 =0

Also, set f’(1/2 )=0:

- x / (1/2 )^2 + c * (1/2 ) / (1 - (1/2 )^2 )^(3/2 ) =0

Simplify:

- x / (1/4 ) + (c * 1/2 ) / ( (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )=0

=> -4x + (c / 2 ) / ( (3 sqrt(3) ) / 8 )=0

Simplify denominator:

(3 sqrt(3 ) ) /8.

So,

-4x + (c / 2 ) * (8 ) / (3 sqrt(3 ))=0

=> -4x + (4 c ) / (3 sqrt(3 ))=0

So, now we have two equations:

1. 2x + (2 c ) / sqrt(3 ) -1 =0

2. -4x + (4 c ) / (3 sqrt(3 ))=0

Let me write them as:

Equation 1: 2x + (2 c ) / sqrt(3 ) =1

Equation 2: -4x + (4 c )/(3 sqrt(3 )) =0

Let me solve these two equations.

Let me express equation 2 in terms of equation 1.

Equation 2: Let's multiply equation 2 by 3 sqrt(3 ) to eliminate denominators.

Equation 2: -4x * 3 sqrt(3 ) +4c =0

=> -12 sqrt(3 ) x +4c=0

=> 4c =12 sqrt(3 ) x

=> c = 3 sqrt(3 ) x

Now, from equation 1:

2x + (2 c ) / sqrt(3 )=1.

Substitute c=3 sqrt(3 ) x:

2x + (2 * 3 sqrt(3 ) x ) / sqrt(3 )=1.

Simplify:

2x + (6 sqrt(3 ) x ) / sqrt(3 )=1

=> 2x +6x=1

=>8x=1

=>x=1/8.

So, x=1/8.

Then, c=3 sqrt(3 ) x= 3 sqrt(3 ) * (1/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 ) /8.

But c is defined as sqrt(3 )/2 - sqrt(3 ) x.

Wait, c= sqrt(3 )/2 - sqrt(3 ) x = sqrt(3 )(1/2 -x )

Substitute x=1/8:

c= sqrt(3 )(1/2 -1/8 ) = sqrt(3 )(3/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 ) /8.

Which matches the earlier result. So, that's consistent.

So, now, point C has x=1/8.

Then, y= -sqrt(3 ) x + sqrt(3 ) /2.

So, y= -sqrt(3 )*(1/8 ) + sqrt(3 )/2 = sqrt(3 ) ( -1/8 +4/8 )= sqrt(3 )*(3/8 )= 3 sqrt(3 ) /8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )

Thus, OC^2= (1/8 )^2 + (3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )^2 =1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.

Wait, 27? Wait, (3 sqrt(3 ))^2 is 9*3=27, yes.

So, OC^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

Simplify: 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 )

So, OC^2= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + (9*3)/64=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

Yes, 7/16. So, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me ensure that this is correct.

So, we found that the point C on AB is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3 ) /8 ), and OC^2=7/16.

But let me check the reasoning again. We set up the equations such that the function f(t)=x/t + c/sqrt(1 - t^2 ) -1 has a double root at t=1/2, leading to x=1/8 and y=3 sqrt(3 ) /8.

Thus, this seems correct.

So, the answer is 7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.


To solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant, where \(P\) is on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) is on the \(y\)-axis. Each segment \(\overline{PQ}\) connects points \((p, 0)\) and \((0, q)\) such that \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). The equation of each segment \(\overline{PQ}\) is given by \(\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1\).

Next, we consider the line segment \(\overline{AB}\), which connects \(A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The length of \(\overline{AB}\) is 1, confirming it belongs to the family \(\mathcal{F}\). The equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

To find the unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any other segment from \(\mathcal{F}\), we determine the envelope of the family of lines \(\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1\) with \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\). The envelope is found by solving the system:
\[
\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad -\frac{x}{p^2} + \frac{y \cdot p}{(1 - p^2)^{3/2}} = 0.
\]
Substituting \(q = \sqrt{1 - p^2}\) and solving, we find the parametric equations for the envelope. 

However, since \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), we parametrize \(C\) as \(\left(\frac{1 - t}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}t}{2}\right)\) for some parameter \(t\). Substituting this into the envelope condition and solving, we find \(t = \frac{1}{4}\). Thus, \(C\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Finally, we compute \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \(p = 7\) and \(q = 16\), giving \(p + q = 23\).

\(\boxed{23}\)
