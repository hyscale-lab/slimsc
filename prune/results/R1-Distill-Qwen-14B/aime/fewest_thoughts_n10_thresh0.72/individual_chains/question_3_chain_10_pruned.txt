Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). So in this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So I need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But wait, actually, if Jen wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize as well, right? Because if all four numbers match, she definitely has at least two. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So P(A|B) would be P(A) / P(B).

So my plan is to calculate P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize, then divide them to get the conditional probability.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So the total number of possible lottery outcomes is 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked a specific set of 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the probability that all four match is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the lottery is equally likely to pick any combination of 4 numbers. So the probability of any specific combination, including Jen's, is 1/210. So P(A) is indeed 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen. To compute this, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., she wins no prize) and subtract it from 1.

What's the complementary event? It's when fewer than two of her numbers are chosen. That can happen in two ways: either none of her numbers are chosen, or exactly one of her numbers is chosen.

So P(B) = 1 - [P(0 of her numbers chosen) + P(1 of her numbers chosen)].

Let me compute each of these.

First, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's numbers: Jen has 4 numbers, so the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4) = 15.

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one of Jen's numbers: We choose 1 from Jen's 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So 4*20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of ways where she has 0 or 1 numbers chosen is 15 + 80 = 95.

So the number of ways she has at least two numbers chosen (which is event B) is total combinations minus 95. So that's 210 - 95 = 115.

So P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, we can compute
