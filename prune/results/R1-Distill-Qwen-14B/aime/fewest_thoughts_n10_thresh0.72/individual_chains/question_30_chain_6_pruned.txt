Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a root and not equal to 1. So, that means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That's a key point because it tells me about the powers of ω and how they behave.

The expression we're looking at is the product for k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote this product as P.

So, P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I need to compute this product and then find P mod 1000.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this product. It might help to factor or find some pattern or symmetry in the terms.

Looking at each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me see if it's a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me treat ω^k as a variable, say x. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Hmm, let me write that as x^2 - 2x + 2.

Is this quadratic factorable? Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = (−2)^2 −4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, it has roots, but they are complex. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but perhaps over the complex numbers. But I don't know if that's helpful here.

Wait, maybe instead of looking at each term, I can consider the product over all k. Since ω is a root of unity, maybe the product can be related to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that.

I remember that cyclotomic polynomials are factors of x^n - 1 and have roots that are primitive roots of unity. For n=13, which is prime, the cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that connects here yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^{13} - 1, since the roots are the 13th roots of unity. But in our case, each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k.

Wait, another approach: perhaps consider the product as evaluating a polynomial at specific points. Let me think. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which is 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Let me try to express this as a quadratic in ω^k. So, the term is ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. So, maybe I can write this as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2, which is a quadratic in ω^k.

So, if I have a product over k of (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2, that's the product over k of (quadratic in ω^k). Maybe I can express this as evaluating some polynomial at specific points.

Wait, let me think about polynomials. If I have a polynomial Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2, then the product over k=0 to 12 of Q(ω^k) would be the product of Q evaluated at each 13th root of unity. So, P = product_{k=0}^{12} Q(ω^k).

Is there a formula or a theorem that relates the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity? I think there's something called the product over roots of unity of a polynomial.

Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithms to turn the product into a sum, but that seems complicated for integers.

Wait, another thought: when dealing with roots of unity, the product over all (x - ω^k) is x^{13} - 1. Maybe I can relate Q(ω^k) to some other expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as the product over all k of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me factor out ω^k: ω^k (ω^k - 2) + 2. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another idea: Since ω^13 = 1, ω^{2k} is just ω^{2k mod 13}. So, as k runs from 0 to 12, 2k mod 13 cycles through all residues from 0 to 12 since 2 and 13 are coprime. So, the mapping k → 2k mod 13 is a permutation of the residues modulo 13. So, when k runs through 0 to 12, 2k mod 13 also runs
