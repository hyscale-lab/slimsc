Okay, so I've got this math problem here that says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should figure out what the smallest prime p is such that p² divides some n⁴ +1. I remember that primes dividing n⁴ +1 have to satisfy certain conditions. For example, primes of the form 8k+1 can divide numbers like n⁴ +1 because 4 divides 8k, so maybe the order of n modulo p is 8? Or something like that. Wait, maybe Fermat's little theorem will come into play here.

Let me recall that if p is a prime and p doesn't divide n, then n^{p-1} ≡ 1 mod p. So, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Squaring both sides, n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4, because then n^4 ≡1 mod p, which contradicts n^4 ≡ -1. So the order must be 8. Which implies that 8 divides p-1, because the order of an element modulo p divides p-1 by Fermat's little theorem. So p must be 1 mod 8.

So the primes p that can divide n⁴ +1 must be 1 mod 8. The primes that are 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. But wait, 2 is also a prime. Does 2 divide any n⁴ +1? Let's see: n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod 2. So n⁴ +1 is 1 or 2 mod 2. If n is even, n⁴ is even, so n⁴ +1 is odd, which is 1 mod 2. If n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod 2, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 2, which is 0. So 2 divides n⁴ +1 when n is odd. So 2 divides n⁴ +1 for odd n. But the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So can 4 divide n⁴ +1?

Let me check: Let’s compute n⁴ mod 4. If n is even, n is 0 mod 2, so n⁴ is 0 mod 4. Then n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 4. If n is odd, n is 1 mod 2, so n is 1 or 3 mod 4. Either way, n² is 1 mod 4, so n⁴ is (n²)^2, which is 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 is 2 mod
