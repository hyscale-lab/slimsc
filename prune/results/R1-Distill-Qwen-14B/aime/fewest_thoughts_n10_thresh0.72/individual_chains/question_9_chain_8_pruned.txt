Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me write down the given equations first. So, the first equation is:

log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, so both logarithms equal 10. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I should convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, we get:

x^10 = y^x

Okay, that's manageable. Now for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, converting this to exponential form gives:

y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, so now I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x
2) y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of x and y and find a relationship between them.

Let me take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. I can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to bring down the exponents. So:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}

Taking ln on both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

Now I have two equations:

1) 10 ln x = x ln y
2) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these simultaneously. Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other.

From equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me solve for ln y.

ln y = (10 ln x)/x

Then, from equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Substitute ln y from equation 1 into equation 2.

So,

10*(10 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Let me compute that:

100 ln x / x = 4y ln x

Assuming ln x is not zero (which it can't be since x > 1, so ln x > 0), I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y

Simplify:

100/(4x) = y

Which simplifies to:

25/x = y

So y = 25/x

Okay, that's a useful relationship. So now I can substitute y = 25/x into one of the earlier equations to find x.

Let's go back to equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y

But since y =25/x, let's substitute that in:

10 ln x = x ln(25/x)

Let me expand ln(25/x). Remember that ln(a/b) = ln a - ln b.

So,

ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x

Substituting back into equation 1:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Expanding the right-hand side:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x

Let me bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0

Factor out ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe rearrange the equation:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25

So,

ln x = (x ln 25)/(10 + x)

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of x. It might not be straightforward to solve algebraically, so perhaps I can make a substitution or find a clever way to manipulate this.

Wait, let me think about the original equations again. Maybe if I express both x and y in terms of each other, I can find a substitution that works.

We have y =25/x. So, maybe if I express x in terms of y, that's x=25/y.

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can take the ratio of the two equations I had earlier.

Wait, going back to equation 1 and equation 2:

Equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y

Equation 2: 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Let me write them again:

10 ln x = x ln y --> Equation A

10 ln y =4y ln x --> Equation B

If I divide Equation A by Equation B, maybe I can eliminate some variables.

So,

(10 ln x)/(10 ln y) = (x ln y)/(4y ln x)

Simplify the left side: (ln x)/(ln y) = (x ln y)/(4y ln x)

Cross-multiplying gives:

(ln x)^2 *4y = (ln y)^2 *x

Hmm, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since I know y=25/x, perhaps I can substitute that into one of the equations.

Let me try substituting y=25/x into equation 1:10 ln x =x ln y.

So,

10 ln x =x ln(25/x)

Which is the same as when I did it earlier. So perhaps I can work with that equation.

So,

10 ln x =x (ln25 - ln x)

Which gives:

10 ln x =x ln25 -x ln x

Bring x ln x to the left:

10 ln x + x ln x =x ln25

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10 +x
