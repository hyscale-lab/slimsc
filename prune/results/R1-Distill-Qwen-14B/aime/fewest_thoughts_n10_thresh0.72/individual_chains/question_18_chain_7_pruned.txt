Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle. So, all the vertices lie on a circle. That might help because the center angles between each vertex are equal. Since it's a 12-gon, each side corresponds to a central angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, each vertex is 30 degrees apart from the next.

Now, the problem is about rectangles inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

I think the key here is that for a rectangle to be formed, it must have its sides parallel to each other and meet at right angles. In the context of a regular polygon, especially one inscribed in a circle, this likely relates to diameters or chords that are perpendicular.

Wait, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, there are diameters that connect opposite vertices. These diameters are the longest diagonals and are straight lines passing through the center. So, if a rectangle's sides are these diameters, then perhaps the rectangle is formed by two diameters intersecting at the center, but that would just form a single rectangle (the one that's the same as the polygon's diameter). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles are formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, there are multiple types of diagonals based on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips two vertices, and so on.

So, let me think about how to form a rectangle. A rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides equal and parallel. In the case of a dodecagon, we can have sides of the rectangle as either sides of the polygon or diagonals. But since the dodecagon is regular, the sides and diagonals have specific
