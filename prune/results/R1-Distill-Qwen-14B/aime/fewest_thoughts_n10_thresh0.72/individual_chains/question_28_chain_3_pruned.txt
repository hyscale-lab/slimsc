Alright, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the point I inside the tetrahedron to each of the faces, which is the same for all faces. This distance is supposed to be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and I need to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all faces is called the incenter. So, point I is the incenter, and the distance is the inradius. 

I think the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is related to its volume (V) and its surface area (A). Specifically, for a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Is that right? Let me recall. Yes, I think that's correct because in 3D, the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*surface area*inradius. So, multiplying both sides by 3 gives V = (1/3)*A*r => r = 3V / A.

So, my task is to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A, and then compute r = 3V / A.

First, I need to find the volume. Since the edge lengths are given in a symmetric way, perhaps the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, isohedral means that all faces are the same, but here the edges are paired as AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, but not necessarily regular.

Wait, perhaps this tetrahedron is a kind of "equifacial" or "isohedral" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I've heard of such tetrahedrons before. In such cases, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

I think a good approach would be to assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that the edges correspond to the given lengths. If I can assign coordinates, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

So, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system where the midpoints of the edges are at the origin, or something like that. Alternatively, I can try to set points in such a way that calculations are easier.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors to represent the edges and using properties of such symmetric tetrahedrons.

Wait, another thought: For a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's called a "disphenoid." I think that's the term. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is exactly our case. So, maybe I can use properties of disphenoids.

I remember that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using a formula involving the lengths of the
