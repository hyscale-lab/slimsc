Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me start by breaking down the problem and understanding the given conditions.

First, the list is a collection of positive integers. The sum of all these integers is 30. That's straightforward enough. So, if I denote the list as [a1, a2, ..., an], then a1 + a2 + ... + an = 30.

Next, the unique mode of the list is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently. The fact that it's unique tells me that 9 appears more times than any other number in the list. So, 9 must occur at least twice, and more than any other number. But wait, could it be just once? No, because if it's the mode, it has to appear more frequently than any other number. So, if all other numbers appear once, 9 must appear at least twice. But if another number appears twice, then 9 must appear three times, and so on.

Then, the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it has an even number, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer, and it's not in the list. So, if the median was the average of two numbers, then it's possible that it's not an integer, but wait, the problem says it's a positive integer, so for even-length lists, the average must be an integer. So, in that case, the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd, such that their average is an integer. But regardless, the median isn't present in the list. So, for example, if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle one is the median, but it's not in the list. Wait, that can't be because the list is ordered, so the middle element is part of the list. So, if the median isn't in the list, that must mean that the list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two middle numbers, and that average is an integer not present in the list.

Wait,
