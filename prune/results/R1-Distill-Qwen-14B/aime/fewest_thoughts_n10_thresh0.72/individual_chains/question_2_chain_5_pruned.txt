Okay, so I just came across this geometry problem, and I want to solve it step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis, half a unit away from the origin, and point B is on the y-axis, a little over 0.866 units up. Then, we have a family of segments F, which are PQ segments of unit length. Each PQ is in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis.

So, each segment PQ is like a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. So, for each such PQ, the endpoints are (p,0) and (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between them is 1.

That distance formula would be sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So, for each PQ, the points P and Q lie on the x and y axes respectively, and their coordinates satisfy p² + q² = 1. So, the family F consists of all such unit-length segments.

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F because OA is (1/2, 0) and OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check: the length of AB would be the distance between (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute that distance.

Distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)² + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)²] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment of length 1, hence part of the family F. So, segment AB is one of these PQ segments.

Now, the point C is on AB, but it's unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB. So, we need to find this point C on AB such that no other segment PQ (from F) passes through it. Then, we need to compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

Let me visualize this. The first quadrant has the x-axis and y-axis. O is the origin. A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is a bit higher on the y-axis. AB is a line segment connecting these two points. The family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, these are like lines that form right triangles with the axes, each with legs p and q, such that p² + q² = 1.

Now, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's only on segment AB and none of the other PQ segments in F. So, we need to find the point C on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through it. That means C is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ in F except AB itself.

I think this point C would be where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps as we vary p and q with p² + q² = 1, the segments PQ form an envelope, and AB is part of this envelope, but the point C is where AB is tangent to another part of the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the family F and find equations for the lines PQ, then find the condition that a point C on AB is not on any other PQ. That might involve solving for when the lines PQ and AB intersect only at C, and we're looking for the unique C where this happens.

Let me try to parametrize the family F. Each segment PQ goes from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. So, for a parameter p, q is sqrt(1 - p²). Alternatively, we can parametrize using an angle θ, where p = cosθ and q = sinθ. So, points P would be (cosθ, 0) and Q would be (0, sinθ). The line PQ can then be written in intercept form as x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1.

So, the equation of PQ is x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1. Alternatively, rearranged, it's x sinθ + y cosθ = cosθ sinθ.

Wait, let me check that: starting from x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1, multiply both sides by cosθ sinθ to get x sinθ + y cosθ = cosθ sinθ. So, that's correct.

Now, AB is the segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of AB. The line can be parameterized as (1/2 - t/2, 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. Plugging in (1/2, 0), we get 0 = -sqrt(3)(1/2) + c, so c = sqrt(3)/2. Thus, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, point C is on AB, so its coordinates are (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). We need to find x such that this point does not lie on any other PQ from F except for AB itself.

Wait, but AB is one of the PQ segments in F. So, when θ is such that PQ is AB, then for that particular θ, the point C would lie on AB. But for all other θ, the point C should not lie on those PQ lines.

So, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. Because the envelope is the locus of points where each PQ is tangent, so the only point where AB coincides with another PQ would be at the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the envelope of the family F and find where AB intersects this envelope.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope here is a circle or another curve.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is the unit circle itself, but I'm not sure. Let me try to find the envelope.

The family of lines is given by x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1. To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve for θ such that both the equation and its derivative with respect to θ are zero.

So, let's denote F(θ) = x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) - 1 = 0.

Compute the derivative of F with respect to θ:

dF/dθ = x sinθ / cos²θ - y cosθ / sin²θ = 0.

So, x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ.

Let me rewrite that as (x sinθ) / cos²θ = (y cosθ) / sin²θ.

Cross-multiplying: x sinθ * sin²θ = y cosθ * cos²θ.

Which simplifies to x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

So, x sin³θ = y cos³θ.

Hmm, perhaps we can express x and y in terms of θ. Let me see.

From the original equation: x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1.

So, we have two equations:

1. x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) = 1
2. x sin³θ = y cos³θ

Let me solve these two equations for x and y.

From equation 2: y = (x sin³θ) / cos³θ = x tan³θ.

Substitute this into equation 1:

x/(cosθ) + (x tan³θ)/(sinθ) = 1.

Simplify tan³θ as (sin³θ)/(cos³θ):

x/(cosθ) + x (sin³θ)/(cos³θ) * 1/(sinθ) = 1.

Simplify the second term: (sin³θ)/(cos³θ) * 1/sinθ = sin²θ / cos³θ.

So, equation becomes:

x/(cosθ) + x (sin²θ / cos³θ) = 1.

Factor x:

x [1/cosθ + sin²θ / cos³θ] = 1.

Factor out 1/cos³θ:

x [ (cos²θ + sin²θ) / cos³θ ] = 1.

Since cos²
