Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than 1/2 because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The problem mentions a family of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are all possible unit segments connecting the x-axis and y-axis in the first quadrant. 

Then, it says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from this family except AB. So, C is a point on AB that isn't covered by any of these PQ segments except for AB itself. We need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, first, maybe I should visualize this. Let me sketch the coordinate system. O is at the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway between (0,0) and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), so that's a bit above (0, 0.866). AB is a line segment connecting A and B. 

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point (p,0) to (0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers such that the distance between them is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, all these PQ segments are such that p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1, and they are in the first quadrant. So, as p varies from 0 to 1, q varies from 1 to 0, and vice versa.

So, each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q²=1.

Now, the point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is a point on AB that is only covered by AB and no other PQ from F.

Therefore, we need to find such a point C on AB, compute its distance squared from O, and then express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

So, first, perhaps I should parametrize AB and find the coordinates of C.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be parametrized. Let me find its equation.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), so y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be represented as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, actually, if x goes from 1/2 to 0, the y-coordinate goes from 0 to sqrt(3)/2. So, to parametrize points on AB, x can be from 0 to 1/2, with y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. 

So, point C is (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, we need to find such a point C that is not on any other segment PQ in the family F except AB. So, for all other PQ segments, C is not on PQ.

So, for C to not lie on any PQ in F except AB, it must be that there's no other PQ in F that contains C. 

So, the strategy is probably to find the envelope of all the PQ segments, and then see where AB intersects this envelope, and that should give the point C.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the envelope of the family F of segments PQ might form a curve, and the point C lies where AB is tangent to this envelope. But since AB is part of the family F (as AB is a segment PQ with length 1, let me check: OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, so AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

Wait, so AB is one of the PQ segments in F. So, any point on AB is on AB, which is a
