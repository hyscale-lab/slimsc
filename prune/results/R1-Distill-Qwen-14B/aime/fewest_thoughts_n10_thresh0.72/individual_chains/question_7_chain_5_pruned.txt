Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue, each color having a 50% chance. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since octagon has 8 sides) such that when we rotate the octagon, all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red.

Wait, but hold on. So if we rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. For the condition to be satisfied, after rotation, every blue vertex must have been on a red vertex before rotation. Or rather, the set of blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices.

But I think it's more precise to say that for some rotation, the image of the blue vertices under that rotation must be a subset of the red vertices. So, another way to think about it is: the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the rotation of the red vertices.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think that the rotation maps blue vertices to red positions. So for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it must land on a red vertex. So, the set of blue vertices must be mapped to the set of red vertices via some rotation.

But actually, the problem says that after rotation, all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. That means that for each blue vertex in the original coloring, when we rotate the octagon by some k positions (k=0,1,...,7), the new position of that blue vertex was previously red.

So, the rotated image of the blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let’s denote the set of blue vertices as B, and the set of red vertices as R. We need that there exists a rotation such that the image of B under that rotation is a subset of R.

But since R is the complement of B, because every vertex is either red or blue, R = V \ B, where V is the set of all vertices.

So, the condition is that there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) ⊆ R = V \
