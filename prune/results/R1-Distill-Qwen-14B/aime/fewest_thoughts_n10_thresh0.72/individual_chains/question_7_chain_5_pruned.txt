Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I need to visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices, each connected in a cycle. Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability, so each color has a 1/2 chance for each vertex, and the colors are independent.

The key part is that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, if after some rotation, every blue vertex is now in a spot that was red before the rotation. Wait, not exactly sure about that. Let me rephrase: After coloring, we can perform a rotation (maybe by some number of steps) so that the new positions of the blue vertices correspond exactly to the original red vertices.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as: After coloring, there exists a rotation such that when you apply that rotation, all the blue vertices in the new arrangement were red in the original arrangement. So, the set of blue vertices, when rotated by some amount, becomes the set of red vertices.

Alternatively, maybe it's that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because the octagon is regular, so rotations can map vertices onto each other.

Wait, so the problem is equivalent to asking: The colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then rotating by that amount would map blues to reds.

But wait, in that case, the number of blue vertices has to equal the number of red vertices, right? Because rotation is a bijection. So, the number of blue and red vertices must be the same. So, for this to be possible, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, which is four each.

Wait, hold on. The octagon has eight vertices. So, if the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, that means exactly four blue and four red. Otherwise, if it's not four each, you can't rotate and have all blues mapping to reds.

So, first thought: The probability is only non-zero when exactly four vertices are blue and four are red. So, the total number of such colorings is C(8,4) = 70. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. So, the probability would be 70/256, which reduces to 35/128. But wait, that's just the probability that exactly four are blue and four are
