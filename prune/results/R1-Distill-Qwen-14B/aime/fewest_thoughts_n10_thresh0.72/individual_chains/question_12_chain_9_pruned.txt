Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum is 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0,0,8 and the bottom row is 9,9,1. Let me try to break this down.

First, let's visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a digit from 0 to 9. When read left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. When read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number, and the sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the top row is a, b, c, forming the number ABC, which is 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row is d, e, f, forming DEF, which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum ABC + DEF should be 999.

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number: AD, BE, CF. So, AD is 10a + d, BE is 10b + e, and CF is 10c + f. Their sum should be 99.

So, the two main equations I have are:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Hmm, maybe I can express these equations more clearly.

Let me denote the first equation as:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

And the second equation is:
(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Wait, let's compute the second equation. Expanding it:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which can be rewritten as:
10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99.

So, equation (2): 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, interesting. Let's look at equation (1) again:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, is that correct? Because 100a + 100d = 100(a + d), and 10b + 10e = 10(b + e), and c + f is just c + f. So equation (1) can be written as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

So, equation (1): 100X + 10Y + Z = 999, where X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f.

And equation (2): 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f. Then equation (2) becomes 10S + T = 99.

But from equation (1), I can write it as:

100X + 10Y + Z = 999.

But X, Y, Z are sums of digits. So, let's think about what X, Y, Z can be. Each of a, d are digits from 0-9, so X = a + d can range from 0+0=0 to 9+9=18. Similarly, Y = b + e can be 0-18, Z = c + f can be 0-18.

Similarly, S = a + b + c can be from 0 to 27, and T = d + e + f can be from 0 to 27, but equation (2) says that 10S + T = 99. So, 10S + T = 99. Let's see what S and T can be.

Since S and T are sums of digits, S can be from 0 to 27, T same. But 10S + T = 99.

So, let me find possible S and T. Let's rearrange: T = 99 - 10S.

Since T must be non-negative, 99 - 10S >= 0 => S <= 9.9. So S can be from 0 to 9.

But S is a sum of three digits, each 0-9, so S >=0, and S <= 27, but in this case, S <=9.

So possible S is 0 through 9.

But T = 99 -10S. Since T must be the sum of three digits, d+e+f, each digit is 0-9, so T must be <= 27. So let's see for which S, 99 -10S <=27.

So 99 -10S <= 27 → 10S >=72 → S >=7.2. Since S is integer, S >=8.

So S must be 8 or 9.

So S can be 8 or 9.

Case 1: S = 8.

Then T = 99 - 80 = 19.

Case 2: S =9.

T = 99 -90 =9.

So, two cases: S=8, T=19 and S=9, T=9.

So, now, I need to consider each case separately.

But before that, let me note that equation (1) is 100X +10Y + Z =999.

So, 100X +10Y + Z =999, where X = a + d, Y = b + e, Z = c + f.

Each of X, Y, Z is between 0 and 18.

So, 100X is the main term here. Let's write 999 as 9*100 + 99. So, 100X <=999 → X <=9.99, so X <=9.

Because X is an integer, right? Because it's a sum of two digits, so X is between 0 and 18, but equation (1) requires 100X <=999 → X <=9. So X can be from 0 to9.

Wait, but 100X must be less than or equal to 999. So X can be from 0 to 9.

But 100X must be such that the total is 999. Let's see:

100X + 10Y + Z =999.

So, let me write 999 as 900 + 99.

So, 100X + 10Y + Z =900 + 99.

Hmm, 100X must be <=900. So X must be 9, because 100*9=900.

Wait, 100X = 900, so X=9.

So, 100*9 +10Y + Z =999 → 900 +10Y + Z =999 → 10Y + Z =99.

So, equation (1a): 10Y + Z =99.

Similarly, Y and Z are sums of digits. Y = b + e, Z = c + f.

So, Y can be from 0 to18, Z can be from 0 to18.

So, 10Y + Z =99.

What are the possible Y and Z?

We can write this as Z =99 -10Y.

Since Z must be >=0 and <=18, 99 -10Y <=18 → 10Y >=81 → Y >=8.1 → Y >=9.

Similarly, Z =99-10Y >=0 → 10Y <=99 → Y <=9.9 → Y <=9.

So Y must be 9.

Thus, Y=9, Z=99 - 90=9.

So, in equation (1a), Y=9, Z=9.

So, from equation (1), we have X=9, Y=9, Z=9.

So, X = a + d =9.

Y = b + e =9.

Z = c + f =9.

So, now, in the grid, we have:

a + d =9,

b + e =9,

c + f =9,

and from equation (2) earlier, we have S = a + b + c =8 or 9,

and T = d + e + f=19 or 9.

Wait, but earlier we saw that S can be 8 or 9, and T correspondingly 19 or 9.

But now, since a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9,

so T = d + e + f = (d + e + f) = (9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c) = 27 - (a + b + c) =27 - S.

But from equation (2), T =99 -10S.

So, 27 - S =99 -
