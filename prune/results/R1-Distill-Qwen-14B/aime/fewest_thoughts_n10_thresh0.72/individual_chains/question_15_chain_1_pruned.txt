Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.

First, an 8x8 grid. So, it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns. The starting point is the lower left, which I can think of as (0,0), and the ending point is the upper right, which would be (8,8). But wait, actually, in grid terms, moving from (0,0) to (8,8) requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves.

Right, so each path is a permutation of 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have the additional constraint that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, I can't just use the standard combination formula. I need to figure out how direction changes factor into this.

What does it mean for a path to change direction? Well, in a grid path, the direction changes when you switch from moving right to moving up or vice versa. So, for example, if a path is going right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each time it switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Wait, so the number of direction changes is related to the number of times the path switches between R and U. How does that translate into the number of segments in the path? Let's think.

If the path starts with R, then the first segment is R, then switches to U for the next segment, then perhaps back to R, and so on. Each switch is a direction change. So, the number of direction changes plus one gives the number of segments. For example, if there are four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if a path has k direction changes, it's made up of k+1 segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

In this problem, the number of direction changes is exactly four
