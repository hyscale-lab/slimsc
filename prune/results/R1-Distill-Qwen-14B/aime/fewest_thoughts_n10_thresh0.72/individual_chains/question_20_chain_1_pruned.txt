Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white and 25 black chips, and each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. Also, any additional chip placed would break these rules. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. Each row and each column must have chips of a single color. So, for each row, I can choose either white or black. Similarly, for each column, I can choose either white or black. But wait, there's a catch. If I choose a color for a row, then all the chips in that row must be of that color, same for the columns. However, if a row is white, then all the columns in that row must have white chips? Or no, wait, no, the columns can independently choose their colors, but if a row is white, then in that row, the column color assignments must be white, but the column as a whole could have multiple colors otherwise? No, wait, no. Because each column must also be a single color. So, it's not possible for a column to have both white and black chips.

Wait, so if a row is all white, then every column that intersects with that row must be white? Because if a column had a white in one row, it can't have a different color in another row. Oh wait, that's not necessarily true. Let me think. If a column is colored black, then all the cells in that column must be black. So, if a row is white, then all the columns in that row must be white. Because if the row is white, every cell in that row is white, so the columns that intersect that row must have white chips. Therefore, if I color a row white, all the columns in that row must also be white. Similarly, if I color a row black, all the columns in that row must be black.

Wait, that seems too restrictive. Let me think again. Suppose I have a row colored white. Then all cells in that row are white. So, for each column that intersects this row, since the cell is white, that column must be entirely white. Because if a column had a black chip in another row, that would mean the column has both white and black, which is not allowed. So, coloring a
