Okay, so I have this problem about a triangle ABC with eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent. Two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC respectively. Also, it says that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There are eight circles, each tangent to the next, and two of them are tangent to sides AB and BC. I think this means that the circles are arranged along the sides of the triangle, maybe each tangent to two sides or something. Wait, no, if two circles are tangent to AB and BC, perhaps the arrangement is similar to a chain of circles along the sides.

I remember that when you have circles tangent to two sides of a triangle, they are called mixtilinear incircles. But in this case, the problem mentions that they are sequentially tangent. So maybe they are arranged in a line, each tangent to the next, and two of them tangent to the sides AB and BC.

Wait, maybe it's a straight line of circles inside the triangle, each tangent to its neighbors and to two sides? Or perhaps along one side? Hmm, not sure yet.

But then there's a mention of 2024 circles of radius 1 arranged similarly. So perhaps the arrangement is scaled down? Like, the 2024 circles are doing the same thing but with a smaller radius, so the inradius of ABC is somehow related to both the 34 radius circles and the 1 radius circles.

I think I need to model this. Let's consider the first part with eight circles of radius 34. Let's say two of them are tangent to AB and BC. So maybe these circles are placed near the vertex B, and each subsequent circle is tangent to the previous one and to another side or something.

Wait, perhaps it's a straight chain of circles inside the triangle. Let me think of the process of arranging circles between two sides. If you have two sides meeting at a point, like AB and BC meeting at B, then you can fit circles that are tangent to both sides. If you have a chain of circles, each tangent to the next, and also tangent to both sides, that might form a straight line.

But wait, if all circles are tangent to both AB and
