Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. So, in total, there are 16 moves, 8 of each type.

But the problem isn't just about any path; it's about paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, so that means the path alternates between moving right and up, but only four times. Wait, no, not exactly. Changing direction means switching from right to up or up to right. So, each time the path switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Wait, but how does that count? For example, if I start with a bunch of R's, then switch to U's, then switch back to R's, etc. Each switch is a direction change. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A run being a consecutive sequence of the same move.

So, if the path has k runs, then the number of direction changes is k-1. So, in this problem, the number of direction changes is four. That means the number of runs is five. So, the path alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U, and has five segments (runs) in total.

Since the path starts at the lower left, which is (0,0), and ends at (8,8), the path can start with either R or U. But in an 8x8 grid, the number of right moves and up moves is equal, both 8. So, the number of runs has to be odd because you can't have the same number of R and U runs if it's even. Wait, let me think.

If the number of runs is five, which is odd, then the starting and ending runs are the same. So, if it starts with R, it will end with R, and if it starts with U, it will end with U. But
