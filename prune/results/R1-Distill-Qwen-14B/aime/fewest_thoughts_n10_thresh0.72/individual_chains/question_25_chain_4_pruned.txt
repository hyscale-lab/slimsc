Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem involves sets and their intersections, so I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve it. 

First, let me list out the given information to make it clear. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The counts are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Additionally, I know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things: the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the candy hearts. 

Wait, candy hearts are mentioned as something everyone owns. So that's like a universal set. So the four things are: diamond ring (let's denote this as D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C), which is owned by all 900. 

But since everyone owns candy hearts, any combination involving candy hearts is essentially the same as the other three. So when we're talking about owning two, three, or all four things, it's the intersection of the other items plus the candy hearts. Hmm, but since C is universal, the presence of C doesn't affect the counts for D, G, S. So maybe I can model this without considering C separately?

Wait, maybe I should think about it more carefully. Let me denote:

- The total number of residents: n = 900
- Number owning D: |D| = 195
- Number owning G: |G| = 367
- Number owning S: |S| = 562
- Number owning exactly two of D, G, S: 437
- Number owning exactly three of D, G, S: 234
- Number owning all four (D, G, S, C): ?

But since C is owned by everyone, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S because C is already included. So maybe the question is essentially asking how many own all three: D, G, S.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "own all four of these things," which would include the candy hearts. But since everyone owns C, the number of people owning all four is equal to the number of people owning D, G, and S. So if I can find |D ∩ G ∩ S|, that would answer the question.

Okay, so let's model this with inclusion-exclusion. The key formula for three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But wait, we don't know |D ∪ G ∪ S| yet
