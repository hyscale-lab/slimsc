Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, first, let's write down what's given. The first equation is a + b + c = 300, which is a linear equation. The second condition is a quadratic expression involving all three variables. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Let me think about the second equation. It's the sum of a²b, a²c, b²a, b²c, c²a, and c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can factor this expression by grouping terms. Let me try that. So, grouping terms with similar variables:

(a²b + a²c) + (b²a + b²c) + (c²a + c²b)

Which can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Oh, that's better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

And this equals 6,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that seems more manageable now. Maybe I can express this as a function of each variable.

Let me define a function f(x) = x²(300 - x). Then the equation becomes f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

So, f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000.

Now, perhaps I can analyze the function f(x) to see what possible values a, b, c can take. Let's compute f(x) for some values.

f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1*(300 - 1) = 299
f(2) = 4*(298) = 1192
f(3) = 9*(297) = 2673
...
I can see that f(x) increases as x increases, at least up to a point.

Wait, let me find the maximum of f(x). Since f(x) is a cubic function, it will have a maximum somewhere. Let's take derivative to find the maximum.

Wait, but maybe since x is an integer, and nonnegative, perhaps I can find the x that maximizes f(x).

Alternatively, since f(x) = x²(300 - x), it's a cubic with a negative leading coefficient, so it will have a single maximum. Let's compute f'(x):

f'(x) = 2x(300 - x) + x²(-1) = 600x - 2x² - x² = 600x - 3x²

Set f'(x) = 0:

600x - 3x² = 0 => x(600 - 3x) = 0 => x=0 or x=200.

So, the function f(x) reaches maximum at x=200. Let me compute f(200):

f(200) = 200²*(300 - 200) = 40,000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, the maximum value of f(x) is 4,000,000 at x=200.

Our target is f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = 6,000,000. But each term is at most 4,000,000, so the only way to get 6,000,000 is if at least two of the variables are 200 because 4,000,000 * 2 = 8,000,000 which is more than 6,000,000. Wait, but wait, 6,000,000 is less than 8,000,000 but more than 4,000,000.

Wait, let me think again. Each f(x) can be up to 4,000,000. So, if one variable is 200, then the other two would have to add up to 6,000,000 - 4,000,000 = 2,000,000. But can two variables add up to 2,000,000?

Wait, but the variables a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and a + b + c = 300. So, if one of them is 200, the other two sum to 100. So, f(a) for the 200 would be 4,000,000, and then f(b) + f(c) would have to be 2,000,000. But wait, if a = 200, then b + c = 100, and b and c are nonnegative integers. What's the maximum f(b) + f(c) can be when b + c = 100?

Let me compute f(b) + f(c) when b + c = 100.

So, f(b) + f(c) = b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c). Since c = 100 - b, this becomes:

f(b) + f(100 - b) = b²(300 - b) + (100 - b)²(200 + b)

Wait, let's compute this for some values.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum of f(b) + f(100 - b). Let me call this expression S(b).

Compute S(b) = b²(300 - b) + (100 - b)²(200 + b)

Simplify this:

Let me expand each term:

First term: b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³

Second term: (100 - b)^2*(200 + b) = (10,000 - 200b + b²)(200 + b)

Let me expand this:

(10,000)(200 + b) = 2,000,000 + 10,000b

(-200b)(200 + b) = -40,000b - 200b²

(b²)(200 + b) = 200b² + b³

So, the second term becomes:

2,000,000 + 10,000b - 40,000b - 200b² + 200b² + b³

Simplify:

2,000,000 - 30,000b + b³

So the second term is 2,000,000 - 30,000b + b³.

So, S(b) = (300b² - b³) + (2,000,000 - 30,000b + b³) = 300b² - b³ + 2,000,000 - 30,000b + b³

Simplify:

The b³ terms cancel out. So, S(b) = 300b² - 30,000b + 2,000,000.

That's a quadratic in terms of b. Let's write it as:

S(b) = 300b² - 30,000b + 2,000,000

We can factor this to make it simpler:

Divide all terms by 100: 3b² - 300b + 20,000.

Hmm, maybe not necessary. Let's find the maximum value of S(b). Since it's a quadratic in b, and the coefficient of b² is positive, it opens upwards, meaning it has a minimum, not a maximum. Wait, that's a problem because we're looking for the maximum of S(b).

Wait, but if it's a quadratic with a positive coefficient on b², it tends to infinity as b increases. But in our case, b can only go up to 100 because a = 200, and b + c = 100. So, b can be from 0 to 100.

So, the maximum of S(b) on b ∈ [0,100] will occur at one of the endpoints. Let's compute S(0) and S(100).

S(0) = 300*(0)^2 - 30,000*(
