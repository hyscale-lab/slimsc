Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm. So, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is kind of a given. Then, some own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. 

Let me list out the numbers again to be clear. There are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. Oh, and everyone owns the candy hearts, so that's 900 right there.

Now, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I'm trying to find how many own all four. Hmm. So, this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that from set theory.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle. For four sets, the formula would be something like the sum of individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the four-way intersection. But wait, the problem gives me some numbers about exactly two and exactly three, so maybe I need to use that information.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with a Venn diagram in my mind. Each of the four categories (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, candy hearts) would be overlapping circles. But since everyone owns the candy hearts, that's a universal set here. So, in this case, candy hearts are like the universe, and the other three are subsets within it.

Wait, but the problem says each of the 900 owns a candy heart bag, so that's 900. So, all the other ownerships are subsets of that. So, the other items (diamond, golf, garden) are subsets of the candy hearts.

So, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:

- D = number who own diamond ring = 195
- G = number who own golf clubs = 367
- S = number who own garden spade = 562
- C = candy hearts = 900 (since everyone owns it)

But wait, since C is universal, maybe I don
