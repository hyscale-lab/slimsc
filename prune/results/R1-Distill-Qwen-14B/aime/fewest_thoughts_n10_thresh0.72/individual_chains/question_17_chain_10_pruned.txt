Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize the problem. We have a rectangular box, which means it has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The sphere that can contain this box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere's diameter has to reach from one corner of the box to the opposite corner, right? So the radius would be half of that space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal d of the box can be found using the formula d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be d/2, so r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r squared is (a² + b² + c²)/4. So if I can find the minimal value of a² + b² + c² given the constraints on surface area and volume, then I can find r squared.

Wait, so the problem reduces to minimizing a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. That's an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a more straightforward way.

Let me recall the formulas for surface area and volume. The surface area S of a rectangular box is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. The volume V is abc = 23.

I need to minimize a² + b² + c² given these constraints. So I have two equations:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 → ab + bc + ac = 27
2. abc = 23

And the function to minimize is f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

Hmm, so how can I approach this? Maybe express two variables in terms of the third using the constraints and then substitute into the function to minimize.

But that might get complicated with three variables. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.

So, let's set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote λ and μ as the Lagrange multipliers for the surface area and volume constraints, respectively.

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(2(ab + bc + ac) - 54) - μ(abc - 23)

Wait, actually, I think I missed a factor of 2 in the surface area constraint earlier. Let me check: the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. So in the Lagrangian, it's better to write it as:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

Yes, that's correct.

Now, to find the extrema, we take the partial derivatives of L with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

So, compute ∂L/∂a, ∂L/∂b, ∂L/∂c.

Let's compute ∂L/∂a:

∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

Similarly, ∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

And ∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

Also, we have the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27

abc = 23

So, now we have five equations:

1. 2a - λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0
2. 2b - λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
3. 2c - λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0
4. ab + bc + ac = 27
5. abc = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can find a relationship between a, b, and c from the first three equations.

Looking at the first three equations, let's denote them as Eq1, Eq2, Eq3.

Let me rearrange Eq1, Eq2, Eq3:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc   ...(1)
2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac   ...(2)
2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab   ...(3)

Now, perhaps I can subtract equations to find relationships between a, b, c.

Subtract Eq1 - Eq2:

2a - 2b = λ(b + c - a - c) + μ(bc - ac)  
Simplify:

2(a - b) = λ(b - a) + μ c (b - a)

Factor out (b - a):

2(a - b) = (λ + μ c)(b - a)

Note that (b - a) = -(a - b), so:

2(a - b) = -(λ
