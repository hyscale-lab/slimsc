Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which is a subset of winning a prize (which requires at least two correct), P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate P(A) and P(B), then divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me start by figuring out P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Since she has to pick all four numbers correctly, and the lottery also picks four numbers. The total number of possible ways the lottery can choose four numbers is the combination of 10 numbers taken 4 at a time, which is C(10,4). And since Jen has one specific set of four numbers, the probability P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): that's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, I need to calculate P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability of having at least two of her numbers chosen. So, in other words, the number of ways where she gets exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. But since she can't have more than four numbers matching (since both she and the lottery pick four), the cases are exactly two, three, or four matches.

Alternatively, it's easier to calculate 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S, none of which are in Jen's 4 numbers. Jen has 4 numbers, so there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick is C(6,4). So, P(0) = C(6,4) / C(10,4) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, P(1 match): the number of ways to choose exactly one of Jen's numbers and three from the remaining six. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, the number of favorable cases is 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(1) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

Wait, let me confirm that. So, 4 choose 1 is 4, 6 choose 3 is 20. Multiply gives 80, correct. So, 80/210 simplifies to 8/21. Okay.

So, P(0) = 15/210, P(1) = 80/210. So, the probability of at least two matches is 1 - 15/210 - 80/210.

Calculating that: 1 is 210/210, so 210/210 - 15/210 - 80/210 = (210 - 15 -80)/210 = (115)/210. Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 15 +80 =95. 210 -95 =115. Yes, so that's correct.

Alternatively, I can compute the number of favorable cases for at least two matches directly.

Number of ways for exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Because she needs to choose 2 from her 4 numbers and 2 from the 6 she didn't pick.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.

Number of ways for exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

Number of ways for exactly four matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, total number of favorable cases: 90 +24 +1=115. So, same as before, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

Okay, so that's correct. So, P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 =1/5. So, 1/5 divided by 23 is (1/5)*(1/23)=1/(115).

Wait, no. Wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, (1/210) divided by (23/42) equals (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42/210)/23= (1/5)/23=1/(5*23)=1/115.

So, yes, the probability is 1/115.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, is P(A|B) equal to P(A)/P(B)? Yes. Because A is a subset of B, so P(A ∩ B)=P(A). So, yes.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210) )
