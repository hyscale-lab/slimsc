Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the problem says that N is the greatest four-digit positive integer with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder. So, Q is essentially the thousands digit, and R is the last three digits.

First, let me restate the problem in my own words. We have a four-digit number N. For each digit in N, if we replace that digit with 1, the new number is divisible by 7. We need to find the largest such N and then compute Q + R.

Since N is a four-digit number, it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The problem asks for the greatest such N, so we should probably start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take too long. So, we need a smarter approach.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number with digits a, b, c, d. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Now, if we replace any one digit with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7.

So, the possible operations are:

1. Replace a with 1: New number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b +10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

2. Replace b with 1: New number is 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

3. Replace c with 1: New number is 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.

4. Replace d with 1: New number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Divisible by 7.

So, all four of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me note down the four conditions.

Let me denote each case:

Case 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can write each of these congruences and then try to find relations between a, b, c, d.

But since we're dealing with mod 7, perhaps it's better to compute each number modulo 7 and set each to zero.

Let me remember that 1000 mod 7 is equal to (since 1000 ÷ 7 is 142*7=994, 1000-994=6). So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7 is 100 ÷ 7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, let me rewrite each case:

Case1: (1000 + 100b +10c +d) mod7 = (6 + 2b + 3c + d) mod7 ≡0.

Case2: (1000a +100 +10c +d) mod7 = (6a + 2 +3c +d) mod7≡0.

Case3: (1000a +100b +10 +d) mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3 +d) mod7≡0.

Case4: (1000a +100b +10c +1) mod7 = (6a + 2b + 3c +1) mod7≡0.

So, now we have four congruence conditions:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four equations:

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 6a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7 →6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡ -3 mod7 →6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡ -1 mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, so now we have four equations with variables a, b, c, d. The variables a, b, c, d are digits, so they must be integers from 0 to9, except a which is from1 to9.

Now, let me try to find relations between these equations.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, let's subtract equation (2) minus equation (1):

[6a +3c +d] - [2b +3c +d] =6a -2b ≡5 -1=4 mod7.

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me write this as equation (5): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation (3) minus equation (1):

[6a +2b +d] - [2b +3c +d] =6a -3c ≡4 -1=3 mod7.

So, equation (6): 6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

And equation (4) is 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me also note equation (5):6a -2b ≡4.

From equation (5), we can solve for 6a ≡4 +2b mod7.

Similarly, equation (6):6a ≡3 +3c mod7.

So, from these two, 4 +2b ≡3 +3c mod7.

Which simplifies to 2b -3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me note that as equation (7):2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

Now, equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

But from equation (5), 6a =4 +2b mod7. So substitute into equation (4):

(4 +2b) +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

4 +4b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, 4b +3c ≡2 mod7.

Let me note this as equation (8):4b +3c ≡2 mod7.

Now, equation (7) is 2b -3c ≡6 mod7.

So, equation (7):2b -3c ≡6.

Equation (8):4b +3c ≡2.

If I add equation (7) and equation (8):

(2b -3c) + (4b +3c) =6b ≡6 +2=8 mod7→6b≡1 mod7.

So, 6b ≡1 mod7.

We can solve for b mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, 6^{-1} mod7 is 6 because 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 6: b ≡6*1≡6 mod7.

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values for b are 6 and 6+7=13, but since b is a digit, only 6 is possible.

So, b=6.

Now, let's substitute b=6 into equation (7):2*6 -3c ≡6 mod7.

12 -3c ≡6 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5. So, 5 -3c ≡6 mod7.

Which gives: -3c ≡1 mod7→3c≡-1≡6 mod7.

So, 3c≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c≡6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So, c=2 or 2+7=9. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible c=2 or 9.

So, c can be 2 or 9.

Now, let's consider each case.

Case 1: c=2.

Case 2: c=9.

Let's first take c=2.

So, b=6, c=2.

Now, from equation (5):6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We know b=6, so:

6a -12 ≡4 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, so 6a -5 ≡4 mod7 →6a≡9 mod7 →6a≡2 mod7.

So, 6a≡2 mod7. Multiply both sides by 6^{-1}≡6 mod7:

a≡2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So, a=5 or 5+7=12, but a is a digit (1-9), so a=5 or 12 is invalid.

So, a=5.

Now, from equation (6):6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

a=5, c=2.

6*5=30≡2 mod7.

3c=6→6 mod7.

So, 2 -6 ≡-4≡3 mod7? Wait, 2 -6= -4≡3 mod7 because -4+7=3.

Yes, that works.

So, a=5.

Now, let's go back to equation (1):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

b=6, c=2.

2*6=12≡5 mod7.

3*2=6≡6 mod7.

So, 5 +6 +d ≡1 mod7 →11 +d ≡1 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4, so 4 +d ≡1 mod7 →d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or 11, but d is a digit, so d=4 or 11 is invalid. So, d=4.

So, now we have a=5, b=6, c=2, d=4.

Thus, N=5624.

But wait, we need to check if this is the maximum. Because we also have another case where c=9.

So, let's check the other case where c=9.

Case 2: c=9.

So, b=6, c=9.

From equation (5):6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

b=6: 6a -12 ≡4 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5, so 6a -5 ≡4 mod7 →6a≡9 mod7→6a≡2 mod7.

Same as before, a≡5 mod7. So, a=5 or 12, but a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, equation (6):6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

a=5, c=9.

6*5=30≡2 mod7.

3*9=27≡6 mod7.

So, 2 -6 ≡-4≡3 mod7. Which is correct.

Now, equation (1):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

b=6, c=9.

2*6=12≡5 mod7.

3*9=27≡6 mod7.

So, 5 +6 +d ≡1 mod7 →11 +d ≡1 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4, so 4 +d ≡1 →d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or 11. Since d is a digit, d=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Wait, that's higher than 5624.

So, 5694 is a candidate. But we need to check if this N=
