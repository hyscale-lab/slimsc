Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which has 12 sides. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle should be 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

The problem is about finding rectangles. For a rectangle to form inside a polygon, its sides must be aligned with the sides or diagonals of the polygon. So, in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles.

I recall that in regular polygons, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is a "short" diagonal, and one that skips more vertices is longer. But how does this relate to forming rectangles?

Wait, rectangles require that their sides be at right angles. So, in the dodecagon, two sides (or diagonals) must intersect at 90 degrees to form a rectangle. That makes me think that the sides of the rectangle are either sides of the dodecagon or certain diagonals.

Another approach is to realize that in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles can be determined by choosing four points such that they form a rectangle. But for a regular dodecagon, the symmetry might allow for a more systematic approach.

Wait, I think the key is to consider the possible pairs of parallel sides in the dodecagon. Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So, if I can find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are equal in length and can form the opposite sides of a rectangle, then the number of such combinations will give me the number of rectangles.

Let me try to figure out how many pairs of parallel sides or diagonals there are. In a regular dodecagon, each side has a parallel counterpart. Since there are 12 sides, there are 6 pairs of parallel sides. Similarly, diagonals can also be parallel. So, how many different directions (or slopes) do these sides and diagonals have?

In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is spaced at 30 degrees from the next (since 360/12=30). So, the sides are at 0, 30, 60, ..., 330 degrees. The diagonals, which connect non-adjacent vertices, can have different angles.

Wait, maybe another way: in a regular polygon with n sides, the number of distinct directions for sides and diagonals is n/2 if n is even, because each direction is repeated every other vertex.

But wait, for a dodecagon, n=12, so the number of distinct directions is 6. Because after 6 steps, the direction would repeat but in the opposite orientation. Hmm, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. Each side is at a certain angle
