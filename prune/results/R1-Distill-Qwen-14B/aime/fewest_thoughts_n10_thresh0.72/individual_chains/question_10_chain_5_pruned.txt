Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It turns out Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, Alice chooses set A. Then Bob creates sets B where each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum of B is in A. The number of such B's is 2024.

So, the key is to figure out how the structure of A affects the number of possible B's. Since each B has a maximum element in A, let's think about each element a in A. For a given a, any set B with maximum a can be formed by choosing any subset of the positive integers less than a, and then adding a to it. However, since B must be nonempty, the subsets we choose for each a can't be empty.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because B can include any combination of numbers less than a, plus a. But since B must be non-empty, the subsets can't be empty. So for each a, the number of possible B's is 2^{a-1}, right? Because the number of subsets of a set with (a-1) elements is 2^{a-1}.

But wait, actually, the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1} - 1. Because the total subsets are 2^{a-1}, and we subtract the empty set. So for each a in A, the number of B's with maximum a is 2^{a-1} - 1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the set B can have any combination of numbers less than a, including none, and then a is included. So for each a, the number of B's is 2^{a-1}, because you can choose any subset of the numbers less than a (including the empty subset) to pair with a. But since B must be non-empty, if a is included, even if the subset is empty, B = {a} is still
