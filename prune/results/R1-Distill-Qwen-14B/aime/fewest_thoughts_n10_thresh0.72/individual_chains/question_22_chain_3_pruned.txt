Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, since it's a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal except for the ones opposite each other. Wait, but it's equilateral, so all sides are equal length. That makes sense because it's called an equilateral hexagon. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are all the same length, which I'll call 's'.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me sketch this out mentally. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet at some points forming a triangle. Let's name the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, the triangle PQR has sides PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300.

Wait, but how exactly are these sides related to the hexagon? Maybe I can think of each of these sides as the result of extending the sides of the hexagon. Since AB, CD, and EF are extended, the triangle is formed by these extensions. So, each side of triangle PQR is proportional to the sides of the hexagon but scaled by some factor based on how much we've extended the sides.

Given that all sides of the hexagon are equal, perhaps there's a similarity ratio involved here. If the triangle PQR is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, then perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the hexagon as being inside the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides being parallel to the sides of the triangle. That makes sense because the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel.

Let me denote the triangle as PQR with sides opposite to the vertices as follows: side opposite P is QR=240
