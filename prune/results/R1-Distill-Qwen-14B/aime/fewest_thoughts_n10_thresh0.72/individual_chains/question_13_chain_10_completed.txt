Okay, so I have this problem about Aya walking every morning. Let me try to understand what's going on here. 

So, the problem says that Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take when she walks at a speed that's halfway between her original speed and the increased speed, including the coffee shop time. 

Let me break down the problem. 

First, it says when she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, the total time for walking and coffee is 4 hours. But the walking time alone would be 4 hours minus the coffee time. 

Wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me read it again. It says, "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." Hmm, so does that mean that the total time from starting to leaving the coffee shop is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee break? So the walking time plus the coffee time t minutes equals 4 hours. 

Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes. So again, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which includes both the walking time and the coffee time. 

So, in both cases, the total time is the walking time plus the coffee time t. But the walking time depends on her speed. 

So, maybe I can set up equations based on this. 

Let me note down the given information:

1. Distance walked: 9 km.
2. When speed = s km/h, total time (walk + coffee) = 4 hours.
3. When speed = s+2 km/h, total time (walk + coffee) = 2 hours 24 minutes.
4. We need to find the total time when speed = s + 1/2 km/h.

First, I should convert all the times into the same units for consistency. Since the answer is needed in minutes, let me convert hours into minutes.

1 hour = 60 minutes.

So, the first scenario: total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

The second scenario: 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me compute that. 2*60 = 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes.

So, in both cases, the total time is walking time plus t minutes.

Let me define the walking time as T1 and T2 for the two scenarios.

So, for the first case:

Walking time T1 = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours. But wait, since the total time is in hours, maybe I should keep it in hours for the equations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to have all times in hours. Let me reconsider.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to represent the walking time in hours and add the coffee time in hours as well.

Wait, the coffee time is given in minutes, t. So, perhaps it's better to work in hours and minutes, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, convert everything to minutes.

Wait, let me think again.

Let me define:

- Walking time = distance / speed.

In the first case, speed is s km/h, so walking time is 9 / s hours. The total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus coffee time t minutes. So, the coffee time is t = (4 hours - walking time) converted into minutes.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the equations in terms of hours.

Let me try that approach.

So, for the first case:

Total time = walking time + coffee time.

But the coffee time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

So, total time in hours is 4 = (9/s) + (t/60).

Similarly, for the second case:

Total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait, no, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours? Wait, no, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

Wait, wait: 24/60 = 0.4, so 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours. So, yes, 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

So, the second equation is 2.4 = (9/(s+2)) + (t/60).

So, now I have two equations:

1. 4 = (9/s) + (t/60)
2. 2.4 = (9/(s+2)) + (t/60)

Now, I can subtract the two equations to eliminate t.

Let me write them:

Equation 1: 4 = (9/s) + (t/60)

Equation 2: 2.4 = (9/(s+2)) + (t/60)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

4 - 2.4 = (9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60)

Simplify:

1.6 = 9*(1/s - 1/(s+2))

Because the t terms cancel out.

So, 1.6 = 9*( (s+2 - s) / (s*(s+2)) )

Simplify the numerator in the fraction:

s+2 - s = 2

So, 1.6 = 9*(2) / (s*(s+2))

So, 1.6 = (18)/(s(s+2))

Now, let me rewrite 1.6 as a fraction. 1.6 is 8/5.

So, 8/5 = 18/(s(s+2))

Cross-multiplying:

8 * s(s+2) = 5 * 18

8s(s+2) = 90

Let me expand the left side:

8s^2 + 16s = 90

Bring all terms to one side:

8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0

Simplify this quadratic equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2 to make it simpler:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, we can solve for s using the quadratic formula.

Quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c = 0

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of D is sqrt(784) = 28

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2*4)

We have two solutions:

s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5

Since speed cannot be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

So, the original speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, we can find t by plugging back into one of the equations. Let's use equation 1.

Equation 1: 4 = (9/2.5) + (t/60)

Compute 9 divided by 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours

So,

4 = 3.6 + (t/60)

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

0.4 = t/60

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, the coffee shop time is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time does she take, including the coffee time t.

So, s is 2.5 km/h, so s + 1/2 is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

The walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Then, the total time is walking time plus coffee time: 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60 = 180 minutes. So, 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, when speed is 3 km/h, walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, adding coffee time t=24 minutes, total time is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, in hours: 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours + 0.4 hours = 3.4 hours, which is 3*60 + 24 = 204 minutes.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the quadratic equation steps.

So, we had:

8s² + 16s - 90 = 0

Divide by 2: 4s² +8s -45=0

D=64 + 720=784

sqrt(D)=28

s=( -8 +28 )/(8)=20/8=2.5. Correct.

So, s=2.5.

t=24 minutes.

So, when speed is 3 km/h, time is 3 hours, plus 24 minutes: 3h24m=204 minutes.

Yes, that seems correct.


Aya walks 9 kilometers at two different speeds, with the total time including a coffee stop 't' minutes. 

1. **First Scenario**: At speed \( s \) km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. Walking time = \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours. So, \( 4 = \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \).

2. **Second Scenario**: At speed \( s+2 \) km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Walking time = \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours. So, \( 2.4 = \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \).

Subtracting the two equations eliminates \( t \):
\[
1.6 = 9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = \frac{18}{s(s+2)}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]
Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
\[
4 = \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]
At speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, walking time = \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours = 180 minutes. Total time including coffee:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

**Answer**: \boxed{204}
