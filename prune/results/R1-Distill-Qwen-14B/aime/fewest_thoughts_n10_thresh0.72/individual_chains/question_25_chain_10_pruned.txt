Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, it mentions sets and ownership, so I think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Alright, let me read the problem again and list out the details:

- Total residents: 900
- Number who own a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number who own a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number who own a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So, H is 900.
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.
- We need to find the number who own all four: D, G, S, and H.

Wait, so all residents have at least H, because everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So H is universal here. That might simplify things.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion problems, we can model the different overlaps. But since we have exact numbers for two and three items, maybe that can help us find the four-way overlap.

Let me denote the number of people who own exactly two things as 437, exactly three as 234, and all four is what we're looking for, let's call it x.

Wait, but I think the problem might be using the term "exactly two" and "exactly three" to mean exactly those and nothing more. So, each of these groups doesn't include those who might own more.

So, the total number of residents can be broken down into:

- Only H: Let's say y, but wait, wait, not necessarily. Because everyone owns H, so the residents can have H plus other things. So the counts for D, G, S include H, but perhaps the ones who own exactly two or three might include H.

Wait, no, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, H is a given for everyone. So the residents can be categorized based on how many of D, G, S they also own, in addition to H.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, when it says "437
