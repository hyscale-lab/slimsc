Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths have a length of 16, which makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. 

The key here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction means switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So each time the path switches direction, it's a new segment. 

Wait, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments? Let me think. If a path changes direction n times, then it has n+1 segments. For example, if a path never changes direction, it's just one straight line, but in our case, since it's a grid, that's not possible. So, if a path changes direction four times, it must consist of five segments. 

Each segment would be a straight line either to the right or upwards. So, each segment is a consecutive series of right moves followed by up moves or vice versa. But wait, noâ€”actually, each segment is either all right or all up. So, a path that changes direction four times will have five segments: for example, right, up, right, up, right, up, etc., but the total number of segments is five. 

Now, the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is 8. So, these have to be distributed across the five segments. Each segment must consist of at least one move, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length; otherwise, it's just a direction change without moving. 

So, the problem reduces to distributing 8 right moves into 5 segments and 8 up moves into 5 segments, but each segment must have at least one move. But wait, hold on. Since the direction alternates, the number of segments for right and up moves might be different. 

Wait, actually, the number of right segments and up segments depends on how the directions are arranged. For example, if the path starts with a right segment, then alternates up, right, up, etc., so the number of right segments and up segments could differ by one. Let me think about that. 

If a path has five segments, and it starts with a right move, then the sequence of segments would be right, up,
