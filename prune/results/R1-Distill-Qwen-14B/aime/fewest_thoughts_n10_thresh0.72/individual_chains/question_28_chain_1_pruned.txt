Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. The answer should be in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I think the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is related to its volume (V) and its surface area (A). For a tetrahedron, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. So, I need to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron and its total surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume when I only have the edge lengths? I remember there's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant that can be used to find the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a 5x5 determinant. Let me recall the exact formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²    0  |

So, the determinant is of this 5x5 matrix. Then, V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). But I have to make sure that the determinant is positive for the volume to be real.

Given the problem, the edges are as follows:

AB = sqrt(41), so a² = 41

AC = sqrt(80), so b² = 80

AD = sqrt(89), so c² = 89

BC = sqrt(89), so d² = 89

BD = sqrt(80), so e² = 80

CD = sqrt(41), so f² = 41

So, let me write the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me check: the second row after the first is (1, 0, a², b², c²) = (1, 0, 41, 80, 89). The third row is (1, a², 0, d², e²) = (1, 41, 0, 89, 80). The fourth row is (1, b², d², 0, f²) = (1, 80, 89, 0, 41). The fifth row is (1, c², e², f², 0) = (1, 89, 80, 41, 0). Yes, that looks correct.

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern I can exploit.

First, let me write out the matrix:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

I notice that the matrix is symmetric. That might help in computing the determinant.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is quite involved. Maybe I can use some properties or simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Wait, in an isohedral tetrahedron, all faces are congruent, but I don't think that's the case here. Let me check the face areas.

Wait, since opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a "kite" tetrahedron or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron with congruent opposite edges, which sometimes can be considered a disphenoid. Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, this is a disphenoid.

Disphenoids have some nice properties. I remember that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If opposite edges are equal, does that make the faces congruent? Let me see.

Each face is a triangle. Let's take face ABC: sides AB, BC, AC. The lengths are AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Face ABD: AB, BD, AD. AB is sqrt41, BD is sqrt8
