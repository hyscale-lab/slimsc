Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match any two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. 

The problem is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, that means she must have all four numbers matching, which inherently means she also has at least two numbers matching. So, actually, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), and P(A|B) is equal to P(A)/P(B).

So, I just need to find the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning any prize.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). This will be the denominator for both probabilities.

2. The grand prize is when all four numbers match. There's only one such combination, so the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So, the probability of winning the grand prize, P(A), is 1 / C(10,4).

3. Now, the probability of winning a prize is the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match. Since the grand prize is included in this, the event B (winning a prize) includes event A (winning the grand prize). So, to find P(B), I need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching.

Wait, but actually, in probability terms, when calculating P(B), it's the probability that she wins a prize, which is the same as the probability that the number of matches is at least 2. So, it's the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.

So, let me formalize this:

Let’s denote:

- N = total numbers in the set S = 10
- k = numbers chosen by Jen = 4
- t = numbers drawn from S = 4
- m = number of matching numbers (from 2 to 4)

So, the number of ways to choose exactly m matching numbers is C(4, m) * C(10 - 4, 4 - m). Because she picks m from her 4 numbers, and the remaining (4 - m) from the non-Jen numbers.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly m matches is C(4, m) * C(6, 4 - m).

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for at least two matches is the sum for m=2,3,4.

Let me compute the number of ways for each m.

1. For exactly 2 matches:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90

2. For exactly 3 matches:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

3. For exactly 4 matches:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for at least two matches is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / C(10,4).

Wait, but let me compute C(10,4) first. C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, total possible combinations are 210.

So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

P(B) = (90 + 24 + 1) / 210 = 115 / 210.

But wait, 115 divided by 210 can be reduced. Let me check:

115 and 210 share a common factor of 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Now, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = (
