Okay, so I need to find the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to break it down.

First, let's note down the given information:

- Total residents: 900.

- Number of residents owning each item:
  - Diamond ring: 195
  - Golf clubs: 367
  - Garden spade: 562
  - Candy hearts: Well, it says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.

Wait, so candy hearts are owned by everyone. That might be useful. So the set of candy hearts is the universal set here.

Now, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. And we need to find those who own all four.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion problems, the formula for the union of multiple sets can help find overlaps. But since we have information about exactly two and exactly three, maybe I can use those to find the number who own all four.

Let me denote the sets:

- D = diamond ring owners
- G = golf clubs owners
- S = garden spade owners
- C = candy hearts owners (which is everyone, so C has 900)

We need to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, the number of people owning all four is the same as the number owning diamond, golf, and spade, since everyone has candy hearts.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about not owning one of the other items. Hmm, maybe I should consider all four, but since candy hearts are universal, the overlaps are only about the other three.

Wait, maybe I should model this with the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me recall.

For four sets, the formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since C is the universal set, any intersection with C is the other set. For example, |D ∩ C| = |D|, because everyone has C. Similarly, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G|, because C is universal. So that might simplify things.

But let me think differently. Since everyone owns C, any combination of the other three items is possible. So the problem reduces to considering ownership of D, G, S, with the knowledge that everyone has C.

Wait, but the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things,
