Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. That is, if the digits are d1 and d2, then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n).

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n.

First, let me model the problem mathematically. Let’s denote the two digits in base b as a and c. Since it's a two-digit number, n can be expressed as:

n = a * b + c

where a and c are digits in base b, which means that 0 ≤ a, c < b. But since it's a two-digit number, a cannot be zero, so 0 < a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The sum of the digits is a + c, and this must equal sqrt(n). So:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But n is a * b + c, so substituting:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe rearranging terms would help. Let me collect like terms:

a^2 + (2ac - a*b) + (c^2 - c) = 0

Alternatively, factor out a from the first two terms:

a^2 + a*(2c - b) + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be an integer between 0 and b-1, I can think of this equation as having integer solutions for a given c and b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a quadratic in c instead. Let me rearrange the equation:

c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - a*b) = 0

This is a quadratic in c:

c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - a*b) = 0

For fixed a and b, this equation should have integer roots c. The discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square for c to be an integer.

The discriminant D is:

D = (2a - 1)^2 - 4*(1)*(a^2 - a*b)
= 4a^2 -4a +1 -4a^2 +4a*b
= (-4a +1) +4a*b

So,

D = 4a*b -4a +1

Which can be rewritten as:

D = 4a*(b -1) +1

This discriminant must be a perfect square
