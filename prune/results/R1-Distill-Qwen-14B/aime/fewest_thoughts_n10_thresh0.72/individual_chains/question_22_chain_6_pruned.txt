Okay, so I've come across this geometry problem, and I want to solve it step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. That means all its sides are equal in length, right? And it's convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, it's mentioned that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. That's an important property.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. So, first, let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. When you extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" or something like that.

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as being part of three larger triangles. Maybe the hexagon is inscribed within this larger triangle, with each pair of opposite sides contributing to the sides of the triangle.

Let me think about the properties of such a hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a truncated triangle. Like, if you take a big triangle and cut off smaller similar triangles from each corner, you might end up with a hexagon where each pair of opposite sides is parallel to the sides of the original triangle.

So perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. If that's the case, then the sides of the triangle are made up of the hexagon's sides plus some extensions.

Wait, but the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if AB is part of one side of the triangle, then extending AB beyond B would meet the extension of another side.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of similar triangles. Let me assume that the triangle formed by AB, CD, and EF is similar to the outer triangle. No, wait, not exactly. Because AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which are being extended to form the triangle.

Alternatively, think of the
