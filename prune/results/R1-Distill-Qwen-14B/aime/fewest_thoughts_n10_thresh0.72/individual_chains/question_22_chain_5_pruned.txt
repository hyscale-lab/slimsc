Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That means AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. Also, since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. The problem says that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably visualize this hexagon. Since all opposite sides are parallel and it's equilateral, it must be a special kind of hexagon. Maybe something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides and angles equal, just opposite sides parallel and all sides equal. So, it's a regular-like hexagon but possibly stretched or compressed in some way.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Extending these sides... Wait, AB, CD, and EF are every other side. So extending AB, CD, and EF would form a triangle outside the hexagon. Let me try to imagine this: each of these sides is extended beyond their endpoints, and where they intersect, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" or the "circumtriangle" of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex, this triangle must enclose the hexagon. The hexagon is inscribed in some way inside this triangle.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be considered as being formed by three smaller parallelograms inside the triangle. Because each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the sides of the hexagon are effectively cutting the triangle into smaller sections.

Wait a second, maybe I can think of this as similar to how a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle, with each side of the hexagon parallel to a side of the triangle. But here, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular, so the triangle might not have all sides equal, but in this case, it's 200, 240, 300.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. I need to relate this 's' to the sides of the triangle, which are 200, 240, and 300.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric hexagon. The triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF must then be similar to the triangle formed by the hexagon's sides in some way, but scaled up.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should draw a diagram. Since I can't draw, I'll try to visualize it.

Let me assign labels to the triangle. Let's say the triangle is triangle XYZ, where XY = 200, YZ = 240, and XZ = 300. Wait, actually, no, the sides are 200, 240, 300, but I don't know which corresponds to which
