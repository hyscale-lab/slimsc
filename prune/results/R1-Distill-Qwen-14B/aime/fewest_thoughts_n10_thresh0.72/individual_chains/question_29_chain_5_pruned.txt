Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because the description is a bit complex.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that circle must be passing through four points, which suggests that those points form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find CE.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB and BC are adjacent sides. AB is 107, BC is 16. So, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107, BC=16, meaning CD=107 and AD=16.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with FG=17 and EF=184. So, FG is one side, and EF is another. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, EH=FG=17 and FH=EF=184.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. Hmm, that makes me think that this line could be a diagonal or something. But since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, maybe this line is a side or something else.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That's an important clue. Maybe I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let's set up a coordinate system.

Let's suppose point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Then, point B is at (107, 16) because BC is 16. Point A would be at (0,16) because AB is 107, but wait, that might not align. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so the sides AB and DC are both 107, and sides BC and AD are 16.

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates in a way that makes it easier.

Let me define point D as (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (x, 0), and point B would be at (x, y), and point A would be at (0, y), where x and y are lengths of the sides. But wait, in the problem, BC =16 and AB=107. So, AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side
