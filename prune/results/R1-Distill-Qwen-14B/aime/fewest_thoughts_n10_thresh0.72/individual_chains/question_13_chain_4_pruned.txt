Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about Aya's walks and coffee shop stops. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes. We need to find out how many minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including t minutes again.

Hmm, so the key here is that the time she spends includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time, which is t minutes. So, the total time given for each speed includes both walking and stopping for coffee. 

Let me try to structure this. Let's denote the walking time as T, and the total time including coffee stop as T_total. So, for the first scenario, when her speed is s km/h, her total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes. Similarly, when her speed is s+2 km/h, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes walking time plus t.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says when she walks at s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So, does that mean the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes? Or is the total time 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee stop. I think it's the latter. So, the total time is 4 hours, which is the time she leaves home until she comes back, including the coffee stop. So, walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, for the second case, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, so walking time is 2h24m minus t minutes.

But wait, that might complicate things because t is in minutes, but the speeds are in km/h. Maybe I should convert everything into hours to make it consistent.

Let me write down the variables:

- Distance: 9 km (constant)
- Speed: s km/h (first case)
- Total time including coffee: 4 hours
- Speed: s + 2 km/h (second case)
- Total time including coffee: 2h24m, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.
- We need to find the total time when speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

But wait, the total time includes the coffee stop, which is t minutes. So, the actual walking time is total time minus t minutes.

But since t is in minutes, perhaps it's better to convert everything into hours or into minutes. Let me think.

Let's convert t into hours for the first scenario.

First scenario:

Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes.

Walking time = total time - t minutes = 240 - t minutes.

But her walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. Distance is 9 km, speed is s km/h. So, walking time in hours is 9/s hours. But in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking and coffee. So, the walking time is 4 hours minus the coffee time (t minutes). But t is in minutes, so let's convert it to hours: t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, walking time is 4 - (t/60) hours.

But also, walking time is 9/s hours. So, we have the equation:

9/s = 4 - (t/60)     ...(1)

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Total time = 2h24m = 2.4 hours = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

Walking time is 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

But her speed is s + 2 km/h, so walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours.

So, equation:

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)     ...(2)

Now, we have two equations with two variables, s and t. So, we can solve for s and t first, and then compute the total time when the speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

So, let's write equations (1) and (2):

From equation (1):

9/s = 4 - t/60

From equation (2):

9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - t/60

Let me write them as:

Equation (1):

t/60 = 4 - 9/s

Equation (2):

t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

Since both equal t/60, set them equal to each other.

4 - 9/s = 2.4 - 9/(s + 2)

So, rearranging:

4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

1.6 = 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

1.6 = 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2)) ]

Simplify:

1.6 = 18 / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 / 1.6:

18 divided by 1.6 is the same as 180 divided by 16. Let me compute that.

16 * 11 = 176, so 180 - 176 = 4. So, 11 + 4/16 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

This is a quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Solving for s using quadratic formula:

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

4 + 45 = 49

So, sqrt(49) =7

Thus,

s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

(5)/2 = 2.5 and (-9)/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t.

From equation (1):

9/s = 4 - t/60

s = 2.5, so 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 = 4 - t/60

So,

t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours

t = 0.4 *60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h. So, her speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which is walking time plus t minutes.

Walking time is distance divided by speed: 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours, plus t minutes,
