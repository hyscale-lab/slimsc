Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out what OC squared is, where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to parse the problem step by step.

First, the points are given as O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. I should probably sketch this out to visualize.

Segment AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is in the first quadrant, right? And the family of segments F consists of unit-length segments PQ lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ in F has P somewhere on the x-axis, Q somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is part of the family F, but C is a point that only lies on AB and no other PQ in F. We need to find OC², which will be a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, we have to find p + q.

Hmm, so I think the key is to find the point C on AB that is only on AB and no other PQ from F. That probably means that C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F is a set of line segments PQ, each of length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, the envelope would be the curve that is tangent to each of these segments.

So, if I can find the envelope of the family F, then point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because that would mean C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F, which is AB itself.

So, the plan is:

1. Find the equation of the envelope of the family F of segments PQ.
2. Find the point C where AB is tangent to this envelope.
3. Compute OC² and express it as p/q, then find p + q.

Let me start with finding the envelope.

Each segment PQ has P(p, 0) on the x-axis and Q(0, q) on the y-axis, with the distance PQ = 1. So, the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

Each segment PQ is a straight line between (p, 0) and (0, q). The equation of the line PQ can be found using the two-point form.

The two-point form is (y - 0) = ((q - 0)/(0 - p))(x - p), which simplifies to y = (-q/p)(x - p).

So, y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, this can be written as (q)x + (p)y = pq. But since p² + q² = 1, we can write this as (q)x + (p)y = pq, with p² + q² =1.

Wait, but to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves. The general method is to treat the parameter as a variable and then solve for the condition that the curve and its derivative with respect to the parameter are satisfied.

But in this case, the family of lines depends on two parameters, p and q, but they are related by p² + q² = 1. So, perhaps we can parameterize p and q in terms of a single parameter, say θ.

Let me set p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1. So, θ varies from 0 to π/2 because we're in the first quadrant.

So, the equation of PQ becomes:

y = (-sinθ / cosθ) x + sinθ
=> y = -tanθ x + sinθ

Or, rearranged:
y = (-tanθ)x + sinθ

So, the family of lines is given by F_θ: y = (-tanθ)x + sinθ, where θ ∈ (0, π/2).

To find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, θ) = 0. The envelope satisfies both F(x, y, θ) = 0 and ∂F/∂θ = 0.

Let me write F as F(x, y, θ) = y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0.

So, compute the partial derivative of F with respect to θ:

∂F/∂θ = x * sec²θ - cosθ = 0.

So, we have two equations:

1. y + tanθ x - sinθ = 0
2. x sec²θ - cosθ = 0

Let's solve this system for x and y in terms of θ.

From equation 2: x sec²θ = cosθ
=> x = cosθ / sec²θ
=> x = cosθ * cos²θ
=> x = cos³θ

Similarly, from equation 1:

y = - tanθ x + sinθ

Substitute x = cos³θ and tanθ = sinθ / cosθ:

y = -(sinθ / cosθ) * cos³θ + sinθ
=> y = -sinθ cos²θ + sinθ
=> y = sinθ (1 - cos²θ)
=> y = sinθ sin²θ
=> y = sin³θ

So, the parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = cos³θ
y = sin³θ

This is a well-known parametric curve called the astroid. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Wait, let me verify that. If x = cos³θ, then x^(1/3) = cosθ. Similarly, y^(1/3) = sinθ. So, (x^(1/3))² + (y^(1/3))² = cos²θ + sin²θ =1. Therefore, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1 is the equation of the envelope, which is indeed the astroid.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Now, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB that does not belong to any other segment from F besides AB. That suggests that C is a point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if AB intersects the astroid at C, and it's tangent there, then C would be the only point on both AB and the envelope, meaning it's only on
