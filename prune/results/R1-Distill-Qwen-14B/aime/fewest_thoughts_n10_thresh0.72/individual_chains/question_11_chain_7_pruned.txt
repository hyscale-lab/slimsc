Okay, so I have this problem to solve: Find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what's given. The complex number z has a magnitude of 4, which means |z| = 4. So, z lies on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. The expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. I need to find the maximum real part of this expression.

Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, I can represent z in polar form to make things easier. Let me denote z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That way, I can express both z and 1/z easily because 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression, let's compute each part separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i)z. Let's expand that:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = (75*4 + 117*4i) e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Similarly, compute (96 + 144i)/z. Since z = 4e^{iθ}, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, so:
(96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So now, the entire expression becomes:
(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

I need to find the real part of this. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this expression is Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

Let me compute each real part separately.

First, Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re[(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)].

Multiplying this out:
300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:
300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, for Re(B e^{-iθ}): Let's compute that.

B = 24 + 36i. So,

Re[(24 + 36i)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ))] = Re[(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)].

Multiplying this out:

24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, since i^2 = -1:

24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Now, adding both real parts together:

Real part of the whole expression = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

So, that's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the expression we need to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, so we have an expression of the form M cosθ + N sinθ, except here it's M cosθ - N sinθ, which is similar. To find the maximum value of such an expression, I remember that it can be rewritten in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value is then R.

So, the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). But wait, in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, a = 324, b = -432.

Wait, actually, the general form is A cosθ + B sinθ. The maximum is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, regardless of the sign, the maximum is the magnitude.

Wait, let me think again. If I have an expression like a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, even if one term is negative, the maximum is still sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, in this case, it's 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ. So, a = 324, b = -432.

So, the maximum real part is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000. 24^2 = 576. Then, cross term is 2 * 300 * 24 = 14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000. 32^2 = 1,024. Cross term is 2 * 400 * 32 = 25,600. So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, adding 324^2 + 432^2: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, sqrt(291600
