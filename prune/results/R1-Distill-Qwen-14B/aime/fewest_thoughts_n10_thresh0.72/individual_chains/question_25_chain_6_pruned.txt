Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

So, there are 900 residents total. Out of these, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. Interesting that candy hearts are universalâ€”everybody has them. So, candy hearts are like a base thing everyone owns.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring (let's call this D)
- 367 own a set of golf clubs (let's call this G)
- 562 own a garden spade (S)
- All 900 own candy hearts (H)

Now, it also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four: D, G, S, and H.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles in sets. Maybe I can use that here. Let's recall that formula.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union of four sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection.

But wait, in this problem, we're dealing with exactly two and exactly three owning cases. Maybe I should think about the formula that relates the total number of elements, the unions, and the intersections based on exactly two, three, and four ownerships.

Alternatively, I think the principle can be broken down into the counts of exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the total number of elements is the sum of exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

But wait, in this case, every resident owns at least a candy heart. So, the total number of residents is the sum of all the people who own exactly one, two, three, or four of the four items. But since everyone owns H, it's a bit different. Hmm.

Wait, no. Because H is included in all ownerships. So, when we talk about owning exactly two things, it includes H and one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three
