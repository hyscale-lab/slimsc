Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, wait—no, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. But in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles, and they are perpendicular to each other. So yes, they intersect at right angles and bisect each other.

But in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So the midpoint of both diagonals is the origin. That means if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). So all four points are symmetric with respect to the origin.

So the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, and so on.

Alternatively, another approach is to use vectors. Let me think: since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the position vectors of A and C are negatives of each other, same with B and D.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.

Wait, but AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). So vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q) respectively.

The dot product of AC and BD is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq. For them to be perpendicular, this should be zero. So 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.

So that's one condition: xp + yq = 0.

Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Similarly for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me express that.

The distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C.

Distance AB squared is (x - p)² + (y - q)².

Distance BC squared is (p - (-x))² + (q - (-y))² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².

So, (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2.

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (x² - 2xp + p²) + (y² - 2yq + q²) = x² + p² + y² + q² - 2xp - 2yq.

Right side: (x² + 2xp + p²) + (y² + 2yq + q²) = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2xp + 2yq.

Set them equal:

x² + p² + y² + q² - 2xp - 2yq = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2xp + 2yq.

Subtract x² + p² + y² + q² from both sides:

-2xp - 2yq = 2xp + 2yq.

Bring all terms to left:

-2xp - 2yq - 2xp - 2yq = 0 => -4xp -4yq = 0 => 4xp +4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.

Wait, which is the same condition as before. So that's consistent.

So the condition xp + yq = 0 must hold.

So we have
