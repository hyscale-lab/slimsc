Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of this circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this involves some geometry of spheres and tori. Let me recall what I know about tori and spheres.

A torus can be described using two radii: R, the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus (which is 6 in this case), and r, the radius of the tube itself (which is 3 here). So, in this case, R = 6 and r = 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is bigger, so the torus is tangent to the sphere internally. That means the sphere contains the torus, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they touch externally along a circle.

I think the key here is to find the radii of these tangent circles. So, I need to find r_i and r_o such that the torus is tangent to the sphere of radius 11 inside and outside.

Wait, how exactly does the torus rest on the sphere? Maybe I should consider the centers of the spheres and the geometry of the torus.

Let me think. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11. The torus is centered at the same point as the sphere, perhaps? Or maybe the position is such that the centers are aligned. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think the torus is placed such that its center lies at the center of the sphere.

Wait, when a torus is inside a sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center would be R - r, and the farthest point would be R + r. So, for the torus inside the sphere, the sphere's radius should be at least R + r. Let's check: R is 6, r is 3, so 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere has radius 11, which is larger than 9, so the torus can fit inside.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is smaller, so the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is outside. The closest point on the torus to the center is R - r = 3, and the farthest is R + r = 9
