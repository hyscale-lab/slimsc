Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes factoring or using symmetric expressions can help. Let me write down the given equations clearly.

We have:
1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. So, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to group terms.

I see that a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation.

So the equation becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:
a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

Adding them all together:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

I can factor out the 300 from the quadratic terms:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now, I have:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the sum a + b + c and maybe other symmetric sums. I recall that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote the sum a + b + c as S = 300, and ab + bc + ca as P. Then, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Similarly, for the sum of cubes, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So, substituting S and P again:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3abc = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc.

Let me compute 300³. 300 * 300 = 90,000, then 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.

Now, let's substitute these into our earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting:
300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):
300*90,000 = 27,000,000
300*(-2P) = -600P
So, this part is 27,000,000 - 600P.

Now, subtract the other part: -(27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc)
Which becomes: -27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc.

Putting it all together:
27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Simplify the terms:
27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.
-600P + 900P = 300P
So, we have 300P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:
100P - abc = 2,000,000

So, the equation reduces to:
100P - abc = 2,000,000

Or, rearranged:
abc = 100P - 2,000,000

Hmm, so now we have another equation involving P and abc. Let me think about how to relate this to the original variables.

We know that a + b + c = 300, and P = ab + bc + ca.

I think maybe if I can express abc in terms of P, I might find a way to find possible values for a, b, c.

Wait, but it's a bit tricky. Let me recall that in symmetric equations with three variables, sometimes assuming two variables are equal can help. Let me see if the problem has some symmetry that I can exploit.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero, but let's suppose that a, b, c are all positive integers. But since they can be zero, maybe some of them are zero. Hmm, but if, for example, one of them is zero, say c=0, then the equation becomes a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a²b + ab² = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me check that. If c=0, then the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b). Since a + b = 300, then ab*300 = 6,000,000. So ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.

So, if c=0, then a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. So, we can find the number of solutions where c=0 by solving this system.

Similarly, the same would apply if a=0 or b=0. So, maybe the cases where one variable is zero contribute some solutions. Let me compute how many such solutions there are.

But I should also check if there are solutions where none of the variables are zero.

Let me first handle the cases where one variable is zero.

Case 1: c = 0.

Then, a + b = 300, and ab = 20,000.

We can model this as solving the quadratic equation x(300 - x) = 20,000.

So, 300x - x² = 20,000
Which rearranges to x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Let me compute the discriminant: D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

The square root of 10,000 is 100, so the solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2.

So, x = (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200, or x = (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100.

So, the pairs (a, b) are (200, 100) and (100, 200). So that's two solutions when c=0.

But wait, since a and b are nonnegative integers, these are valid solutions. So, in this case, each solution corresponds to two ordered triples: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But wait, actually, since a and b are interchangeable here, each case would account for two ordered triples if a ≠ b. Wait, no, in this case, a and b are 200 and 100, so they are distinct. So, the number of ordered triples where c=0 is 2.

But wait, in the problem statement, the triples (a, b, c) are ordered, so (200, 100, 0) is different from (100, 200, 0). So, each solution for a and b gives two ordered triples because a and b can be swapped.

Wait, but in this case, since a and b are 200 and 100, the number of ordered pairs (a, b) is 2: (200, 100) and (100, 200). So for c=0, we have two ordered triples: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).

Similarly, when a=0 or b=0, we can have similar situations.

Case 2: a = 0.

Then, b + c = 300, and the second equation becomes b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*300 = 6,000,000.

So, bc = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.

So, we have b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000.

Again, this is a quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0, same as before.

Solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2, so x = 200 or x = 100.

So, the ordered pairs (b, c) are (200, 100) and (100, 200). So, when a=0, the number of ordered triples is two: (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

Case 3: b = 0.

Then, a + c = 300, and the second equation becomes a²c + c²a = ac(a + c) = ac*300 = 6,000,000.

So, ac = 20,000.

So, a + c = 300 and ac = 20,000. Again, same quadratic equation.

Solutions: a = 200, c=100 or a=100, c=200. So, the ordered triples are (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200). So, two solutions here as well.

So, in total, for the cases where one variable is zero, we have 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ordered triples.

Now, I need to check if there are solutions where all a, b, c are positive integers (i.e., none are zero). So, the other case.

So, in that case, all a, b, c are at least 1. So, let's proceed.

From earlier, we had:

100P - abc = 2,000,000

Where P = ab + bc + ca.

We also know that a + b + c = 300.

Hmm, perhaps I can express P in terms of S and the pairwise products.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can use the identity that (a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the correct identity.

Actually, the correct identity is:
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem correct. Let me check.

Wait, no, I think it's:
(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I know that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to standard symmetric identities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Newton's identities or other symmetric polynomial relations.

Alternatively, maybe I can express abc in terms of P, as from
