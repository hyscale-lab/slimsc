Okay, so I've got this geometry problem to solve, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω, and the tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to express AP as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a diagram to visualize the problem. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, I can imagine the triangle with the given points and the circle around it. Points D and P are defined based on tangents and intersections, so I'll need to understand how they relate.

I remember that in a circle, the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. Since D is the intersection of these two tangents, D lies outside the circle, and BD and CD are tangent segments from D to the circle.

I recall that for a point outside a circle, the lengths of the two tangent segments from that point to the circle are equal. So, BD = CD. That might be useful later.

Next, I need to find where AD intersects ω again at P. So, point P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. My goal is to find the length AP.

I think I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from D to ω. So, Power(D) = DB² = DC².

But also, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D can be expressed as DA * DP. So, Power(D) = DA * DP.

Therefore, I can write the equation: DA * DP = DB².

If I can find DA, DB, and DP, I can relate them. But I don't know DA or DP yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for all the points and compute the intersection. But that might be complicated. Let me think about other properties or theorems that might help.

Wait, maybe using triangle similarity or harmonic division? Or perhaps using Menelaus' theorem?

Alternatively, since we know all three sides of triangle ABC, maybe we can find some lengths related to the circumradius or other key points.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, I can first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Maybe that will help in finding other lengths.

To find the circumradius R of triangle ABC, I can use the formula:

R = (a*b*c) / (4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

First, let me compute the area using Heron's formula.

The semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = √[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = √[504] = √[16 * 31.5] = wait, 504 factors as 16 * 31.5 isn't exact. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but 504 actually factors into 16 * 31.5 which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 72 * 7, and 72 is 36 * 2, so √504 = √(72*7) = √72 * √7 = 6√2 * √7 = 6√14. Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So, Δ = √504. Simplify √504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, let me factor 504 properly.

504 divided by 2 is 252.

252 divided by 2 is 126.

126 divided by 2 is 63.

63 divided by 3 is 21.

21 divided by 3 is 7.

So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7.

Therefore, √504 = 2^(3/2) * 3^(2/2) * 7^(1/2) = 2√2 * 3 * √7 = 6√14.

So, Δ = 6√14.

Then, R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14).

Simplify this: (75)/(4√14) can be rationalized as (75√14)/(4 * 14) = (75√14)/56.

So, R = 75√14 / 56.

Hmm, not sure if this will help directly, but perhaps knowing R could be useful later.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier. Let me put point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC=10, and point B somewhere in the plane.

Wait, wait, actually in the Asymptote code, they have C at the origin, A at (10,0), and B at (7.8, 4.4899). So, maybe that's a specific coordinate system. But perhaps I can reconstruct it.

Let me double-check. If I place C at (0,0), A at (10,0), then AC is 10 units. Then, point B is somewhere such that AB=5 and BC=9.

Let me compute coordinates for point B. Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9, so:

x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is 5, so:

(10 - x)² + y² = 25.

Subtract the first equation from the second:

(10 - x)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81.

Expanding (10 - x)^2: 100 - 20x + x².

So, 100 -20x + x² + y² - x² - y² = -56.

Simplify: 100 -20x = -56.

So, 100 +56 = 20x → 156 = 20x → x = 156 /20 = 39/5 = 7.8. So, x =7.8, which is 39/5.

Then, from x² + y² =81:

(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81.

Compute (39/5)^2: (1521)/25.

So, y² = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 → y = sqrt(504)/5 = (6√14)/5. So, y ≈ 4.4899 as in the Asymptote code.

So, coordinates:

A = (10,0)

B = (7.8, 4.4899) ≈ (39/5, (6√14)/5 )

C = (0,0)

Now, the circle ω passes through A, B, C. Let me compute its circumradius and center.

Wait, I already calculated R as 75√14 /56. But let me try to find the circumcircle equation.

The circumcircle can be found using the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AC first. AC is from (0,0) to (10,0). The midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector is the line perpendicular to AC (which is horizontal) passing through (5,0). So
