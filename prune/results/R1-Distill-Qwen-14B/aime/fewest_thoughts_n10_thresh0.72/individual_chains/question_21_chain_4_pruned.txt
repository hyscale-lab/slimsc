Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n are b-eautiful, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can be from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c can be from 0 to b-1.

So, any two-digit number in base b is n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of these two digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. That is, a + c = sqrt(n). But since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be equal to a*b + c. So, we have:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring everything to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a way to express b in terms of a and c.

Wait, let me try to isolate b.

From the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let's subtract c from both sides:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a*b

Then, divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0, which it isn't since a ≥ 1):

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Hmm, let's see if I can factor the numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + c(2a + c - 1)

So, b = [a² + c(2a + c -1)] / a

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Hmm, but since b must be an integer, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. So, a must divide (c² - c). That might be a useful condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation as:

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

So, for b to be an integer, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. So, a | (c² - c). Which is equivalent to a | c(c - 1). Since a and c are positive integers (with c from 0 to b-1), this might help in figuring out possible a and c.

Wait, but c can be zero. Let me check the case when c = 0.

If c = 0, then n = a*b. The sum of digits is a + 0 = a. So, sqrt(n) = a.

But n = a*b, and sqrt(n) = a implies that a = sqrt(a*b). Then, squaring both sides, a² = a*b => a = b, since a ≠ 0.

But wait, in base b, the first digit a must be less than b, so a ≤ b - 1. But if a = b, which is equal to the base, that's not allowed because in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1. So, c = 0 can't give a valid solution because it would require a = b, which is invalid. So, c cannot be zero.

Therefore, c must be at least 1.

So, c ranges from 1 to b-1.

Similarly, a ranges from 1 to b-1.

So, for each base b, I can iterate over a from 1 to b-1, and c from 1 to b-1, and check whether a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). But since this is for a programming competition, perhaps I can find a mathematical way to express this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can reorganize the equation:

Let me denote s = a + c. Then, s = sqrt(n), and n = s².

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So,

s² = a*b + c

But s = a + c, so:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

Because c = s - a.

So, substituting:

s² = a*b + s - a

Let me rearrange this:

s² - s = a*b - a

Factor the right side:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s² - s) / (b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, for a given b, s must be such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1). Then, a must be an integer between 1 and b - 1.

Also, since c = s - a, c must be between 1 and b -1.

So, s must satisfy s - a ≥ 1, because c ≥ 1.

But a = (s² - s)/(b -1), so s - a = s - (s² - s)/(b -1) ≥ 1.

Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider s as a variable and express b in terms of s and a.

Wait, from the equation:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

b = (s² - s)/a + 1

Hmm, since b must be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by a.

So, a must be a divisor of s(s - 1).

Moreover, since a is in 1 to b-1, and b is expressed in terms of s and a, perhaps this can lead us somewhere.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think of another approach.

We can think of for each s, which is a positive integer, the possible values of a must divide s(s
