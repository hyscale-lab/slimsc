Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)."

Alright, so the goal is to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, once we find that \( p \), we need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, I think I should start by understanding the problem better. For a prime \( p \), we want \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). That is, \( n^4 \equiv -1 \) modulo \( p^2 \). So \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \), because squaring both sides gives \( n^8 \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \). So the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) divides 8. Hmm, but wait, the multiplicative order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must divide \( \phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \), right? So, the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) divides both 8 and \( p(p-1) \).

So, for such an \( n \) to exist, 8 must divide \( \phi(p^2) \), which is \( p(p-1) \). So \( p(p-1) \) must be divisible by 8. That gives some condition on \( p \).

Let's see, \( p \) is a prime. So, either \( p \) is 2, or it's an odd prime.

If \( p = 2 \), then \( p-1 = 1 \), so \( \phi(2^2) = 4 \). So, the order of \( n \) modulo 4 must divide 8. Wait, but 4 is a small modulus, let's see if \( n^4 +1 \) is divisible by 4. Let's check for \( n \):

If \( n \) is even, say \( n=2k \), then \( n^4 = 16k^4 \), so \( n^4 +1 = 16k^4 +1 \). Modulo 4, this is 1. So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), which can't be 0. If \( n \) is odd, \( n = 2k+1 \), then \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute that modulo 4.

Expanding \( (2k+1)^4 \), the binomial coefficients are 1,4,6,4,1. So modulo 4, each term is:

1*(2k)^4 = 16k^4 ≡ 0 mod4,

4*(2k)^3*(1) = 4*8k^3 ≡ 0 mod4,

6*(2k)^2*(1)^2 = 6*4k^2 ≡ 0 mod4,

4*(2k)*(1)^3 = 8k ≡ 0 mod4,

1*(1)^4 = 1 mod4.

So overall, \( (2k+1)^4 ≡ 1 mod4 \). Therefore, \( n^4 +1 ≡ 2 mod4 \). So, it's 2 mod4, which isn't 0. So for \( p=2 \), \( p^2=4 \), and \( n^4 +1 \) can't be divisible by 4. So \( p=2 \) is out.

So the next prime is 3. Let's check if \( n^4 ≡ -1 mod9 \).

So we need to find an \( n \) such that \( n^4 ≡ 8 mod9 \) because -1 mod9 is 8.

Let me compute \( n^4 \) mod9 for n from 1 to 8:

1^4 = 1 mod9 → 1

2^4 = 16 mod9 → 7

3^4 = 81 mod9 → 0

4^4 = (256) mod9 → 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4

5^4 = (625) mod9: 625 /9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 → 4? Wait, 5 mod9 is 5, 5^2=25≡7, 5^4=(5^2)^2=7^2=49≡4 mod9. Yes, that's correct.

6^4: 6 mod9 is 6, 6^2=36≡0, so 6^4≡0.

7^4: 7 mod9 is 7, 7^2=49≡4, 7^4=(7^2)^2=4^2=16≡7 mod9.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 7^2=49≡4, then 7^4=(7^2)^2=4^2=16≡7 mod9? Wait, 16 mod9 is 7. So yes, 7^4≡7 mod9.

8^4: 8 mod9 is 8. 8^2=64≡1 mod9, so 8^4=(8^2)^2=1^2=1 mod9.

So n from 1 to 8:

n: 1→1, 2→7,3→0,4→4,5→4,6→0,7→7,8→1.

So n^4 mod9: 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1.

Looking for n^4 ≡8 mod9. But in the above, I see n^4 mod9 is 1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1. There's no n for which n^4≡8 mod9. So for p=3, there's no n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5. So p=5, check if there exists n with n^4≡-1 mod25. So n^4≡24 mod25.

Let me compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24. Hmm, that's a lot, but maybe we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, maybe we can use properties of exponents.
