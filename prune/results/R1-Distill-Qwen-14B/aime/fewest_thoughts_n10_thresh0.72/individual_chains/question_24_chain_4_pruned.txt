Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand each of these properties and figure out what constraints they impose on the list.

Starting with the sum being 30. So whatever numbers we have in the list, when we add them all up, it should equal 30. That's straightforward.

Next, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. Also, it's the unique mode, meaning no other number can have the same frequency as 9. So the count of 9s must be higher than the count of any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, that's interesting. So the median is not part of the list, but it's an integer, and it's positive. That gives me some constraints on how the list is ordered.

Alright, let's start by considering the mode. Since 9 is the mode, it has to appear at least twice, but probably more. Let me think: if the mode is unique, then other numbers can appear at most once less than the mode. So if 9 appears k times, then every other number can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, let's think about the list structure. The median depends on the number of elements in the list. For the median to be an integer that doesn't appear in the list, the list must have an odd number of elements. Because if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which might not necessarily be an integer. Wait, noâ€”if the two middle numbers are the same, the median would be that number. But in our case, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that suggests that the length of the list is odd, so that the median is the middle number when sorted. But that middle number isn't in the list. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky because if the list is sorted, the middle number should be one of the elements, right?

Wait, no. Wait, no, the median is the middle value. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If it's odd, it's the exact middle number. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So that must mean that the list has an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be the middle number, which would have to be in the list. But the median isn't in the list, so the list must have an even number of elements, making the median the average of two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list.

Wait, that makes sense. So the list has an
