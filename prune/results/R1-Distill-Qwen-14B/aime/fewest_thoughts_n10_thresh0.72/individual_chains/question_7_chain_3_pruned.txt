Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance. The question is about the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. They mention the probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is either red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's a rotation that swaps all blue vertices to where red ones were. So, essentially, the blue and red vertices are swapped via some rotation. Wait, but the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. I remember that the rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, meaning it has rotations by multiples of 45 degrees.

So, for each coloring, we can rotate it by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, and check if any of these rotations result in the blue vertices becoming red and red becoming blue. Wait, but the condition is that all blue vertices end up where red ones were. So, perhaps the coloring must be symmetric in a way that allows such a swap via rotation.

Alternatively, maybe the coloring must be such that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since each rotation is an element of the rotation group, the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

But wait, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the coloring is symmetric with respect to that rotation. So, how many such colorings are there?

Alternatively, for each rotation, count the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, but then we have to account for overcounting because color
