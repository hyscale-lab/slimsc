Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has rotational symmetry. That means I can rotate it by multiples of 45 degrees, right? So there are 8 possible rotations: 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, corresponding to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

The problem is about coloring each vertex red or blue, each with probability 1/2. So each coloring is equally likely, and there are 2^8 = 256 total possible colorings.

Now, the key part is that after some rotation, all the blue vertices move to where the red ones were. Alternatively, that means that after rotating by some number of positions, every blue vertex is now on top of a red vertex. So, for a coloring to satisfy this condition, there must exist some rotation such that the set of blue vertices is exactly the image of the set of red vertices under that rotation.

Wait, that might not be the exact condition. Let me think again. If I rotate the octagon by k positions, then each vertex moves k positions clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the direction). So, if I have a coloring where the blue vertices are exactly the same as the red vertices after shifting by k positions, for some k, then the condition is satisfied.

In other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since red and blue are complementary, this implies that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

But wait, the red and blue vertices are complements, so if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the red set is also a rotation of the blue set. That makes sense because rotation is invertible.

So, for each coloring where the blue vertices are a rotation of the red ones, the coloring is counted. So our task is to count all such colorings.

But how do we compute this? Because for each coloring, we have to check if such a rotation exists, and then sum the probabilities.

Alternatively, we can model this as a group action problem, using Burnside's lemma or something similar.

Wait, Burnside's
