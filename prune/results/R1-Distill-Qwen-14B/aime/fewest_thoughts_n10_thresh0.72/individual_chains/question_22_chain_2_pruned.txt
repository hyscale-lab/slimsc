Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon, all sides equal, and opposite sides are parallel. That makes me think it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular since it's just equilateral. Convex means all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Since opposite sides are parallel, it's probably something like a hexagon that can be inscribed in a larger triangle by extending its sides. The triangle given has sides 200, 240, 300. That seems like a scaled-up version of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe I can think of the hexagon as being formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of the larger triangle. If the original triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is inside it, then maybe each side of the hexagon is the side of one of these smaller triangles.

But I'm not sure. Let me recall some properties of such hexagons. If all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, it's called a "zonogon." But this one is also equilateral, so maybe it's a special kind of zonogon.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the hexagon as having sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length 's'. All opposite sides are parallel: AB || CD || EF, BC || DE || FA.

If I extend AB, CD, EF, they meet at a point forming a triangle. Similarly, the other sides might form another triangle. But the problem mentions a single triangle from extending AB, CD, EF. So the extensions of AB, CD, EF meet at a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.

I think this triangle is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, cutting off some smaller similar triangles.

Let me denote the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF as triangle T, with sides 200, 240, 300. Then, the hexagon is such that
