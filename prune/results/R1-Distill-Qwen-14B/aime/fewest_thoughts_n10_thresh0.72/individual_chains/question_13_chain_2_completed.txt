Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning. She has different walking speeds, and each time she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let's break it down. The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at (s + 2) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes.

Wait, so both these times include the coffee shop time. That means the time spent walking plus the coffee shop time equals the total time given.

I need to set up equations for each scenario. Let me denote the walking time as the time she actually spends walking, not including the coffee shop.

First scenario:
Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
Time in coffee shop = t minutes
So, the actual walking time is (240 - t) minutes.

But I can also express the walking time in hours because speed is in km/h. Since the distance is 9 km, the walking time is 9/s hours.

Wait, let me convert that. If she walks 9 km at s km/h, time = distance/speed, so 9/s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. So, 9/s hours + t minutes = 4 hours.

But wait, I need to have consistent units. Let me convert the 4 hours into minutes for easy handling with t.

4 hours = 240 minutes.

So, 9/s hours is equal to (9/s)*60 minutes. Because 1 hour is 60 minutes.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe it's better to work in hours for the first equation.

So, the walking time is 9/s hours. Then, the total time (walking + coffee) is 4 hours, which is 4 = 9/s + t/60.

Because walking time is 9/s hours, and coffee time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes: 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

But again, let's convert everything to hours. 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. Total time is 2.4 hours = 9/(s+2) + t/60.

So now I have two equations:

1. 4 = 9/s + t/60
2. 2.4 = 9/(s+2) + t/60

Hmm, so I can set up these two equations and solve for s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 4 = (9/s) + (t/60)
Equation 2: 2.4 = (9/(s+2)) + (t/60)

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

4 - 2.4 = (9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60)

Which simplifies to:

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s+2)

Simplify the right side. Let's compute 9/s - 9/(s+2):

Factor 9 out: 9*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 9*( (s+2 - s)/(s*(s+2)) ) = 9*(2/(s*(s+2))) = 18/(s*(s+2))

So, 1.6 = 18/(s*(s+2))

Now, solve for s:

Multiply both sides by s*(s+2):

1.6 * s * (s + 2) = 18

Let me write 1.6 as 8/5 to make it easier:

(8/5) * s * (s + 2) = 18

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:

8 * s * (s + 2) = 90

Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:

4 * s * (s + 2) = 45

So, 4s^2 + 8s = 45

Bring all terms to one side:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation. Let's use the quadratic formula:

s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

Discriminant D = 8^2 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So,

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2*4) = [ (-8 +28)/8 , (-8 -28)/8 ]

Compute both roots:

First root: (20)/8 = 2.5
Second root: (-36)/8 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Okay, so s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's use equation 1:

4 = 9/s + t/60

s is 2.5, so 9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours? Wait, no, 9/(2.5) is 3.6 in hours? Wait, no, 9/(2.5) is 3.6 hours. But wait, 9/(s) gives the walking time in hours, right?

Wait, let me compute 9/2.5. 2.5 goes into 9 three times (3*2.5=7.5), with 1.5 left. 1.5/2.5=0.6. So 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 hours walking time, plus t minutes.

But according to equation 1, 4 hours is the total time. So,

4 = 3.6 + (t /60)

Solve for t:

t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours

t = 0.4 *60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, how long does the walk take, including t minutes.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h. The walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours.

Then, adding t minutes (24 minutes), total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes. So, total time is 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, walking time is 9/(s + 1/2) hours, which is 9/3 = 3 hours, plus t minutes (24 minutes). So, 3 hours 24 minutes. Convert that to minutes: 3*60 +24 = 204 minutes.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but let me double-check the earlier calculations to make sure.

s = 2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes.

First scenario: Walking at 2.5 km/h: time is 9/(2.5) = 3.6 hours. 3.6 hours is 3 hours 36 minutes. Add t=24 minutes: 3h36m + 24m = 4 hours, which matches the first scenario.

Second scenario: walking speed is 2.5+2=4.5 km/h. Walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Add t=24 minutes: 2h24m, which matches the second scenario.

So, yes, s=2.5, t=24.

Therefore, when walking at s +1/2 =3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, plus 24 minutes: total 3h24m, which is 204 minutes.

I think that's the answer.


Aya's walk is 9 kilometers long. When walking at \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours, including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. When walking at \( s+2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time when she walks at \( s+\frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including \( t \) minutes.

### Step 1: Convert total times into hours
- First scenario: \( 4 \) hours.
- Second scenario: \( 2 \) hours \( 24 \) minutes \( = 2 + \frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \) hours.

### Step 2: Set up equations
1. \( 4 = \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \)
2. \( 2.4 = \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} \)

### Step 3: Subtract equations to eliminate \( t \)
\[
4 - 2.4 = \frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2}
\]
\[
1.6 = \frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = \frac{18}{s(s+2)}
\]
\[
1.6 \cdot s(s+2) = 18
\]
\[
\frac{8}{5} \cdot s(s+2) = 18 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8s(s+2) = 90 \cdot 5
\]
\[
8s^2 + 16s - 450 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4s^2 + 8s - 225 = 0
\]

### Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4(4)(-225)}}{2(4)} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
Positive solution: \( s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) km/h.

### Step 5: Find \( t \)
Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
\[
4 = \frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60}
\]
\[
4 = 3.6 + \frac{t}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total time at \( s+\frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h
Walking time:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
Total time including coffee shop:
\[
3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 3 \times 60 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time Aya takes, including the coffee shop, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
