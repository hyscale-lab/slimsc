Okay, so I have this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. 

So my task is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. That means, for each base b starting from 2 upwards, I need to count how many numbers n satisfy those two conditions, and find the least b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem.

First, when n is expressed in base b with exactly two digits, that means in base 10, n can be written as a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, right? So a is at least 1, and c is at least 0. Also, in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. But since a is the first digit, a must be at least 1 and less than b. Similarly, c can be from 0 to b-1.

So n = a*b + c.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Which implies that sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. So n must be a perfect square. Let me denote k = sqrt(n). Then n = k^2, and the equation becomes a + c = k.

But since n = a*b + c, substituting k^2 for n gives:

k^2 = a*b + c.

And since a + c = k, I can express c = k - a. So substituting that into the equation for n:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)
=> k^2 = a*b + k - a
=> k^2 = a*(b - 1) + k.

Let me rearrange this equation:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)
=> a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).

Hmm, so a must be an integer because a is a digit in base b. So (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). That is, (b - 1) must divide (k^2 - k).

Also, since a is a digit in base b, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1. Similarly, c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. 

Wait, let me think about the constraints on k. Since n = k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum possible value of n is (b^2 - 1). Because in base b, the largest two-digit number is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So k^2 ≤ b^2 - 1. Therefore, k ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1) which is approximately b, but let me see exactly.

Wait, for base b, the two-digit number ranges from b (which is 10_b) to b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So n is between b and b^2 - 1, inclusive. Therefore, k = sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1). So k is an integer in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], because sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(b^2 - 1). For example, if b=13, sqrt(13^2 - 1) = sqrt(168) ≈ 12.96, which is less than 13. So in general, sqrt(b^2 -1) < b. So k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

But wait, since n must be a perfect square, k must be an integer. So k must satisfy ceil(sqrt(b)) ≤ k ≤ b - 1.

Also, n = k^2 must satisfy n ≥ b (since it's a two-digit number in base b). So k^2 ≥ b. So k ≥ sqrt(b). But since k must be an integer, k ≥ ceil(sqrt(b)).

So for each base b, the possible k's are from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

Given that, let's get back to the equation:

a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, inclusive, so (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer a in that range.

Also, c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1.

So, for each b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1), check if a is integer, and also check if c = k - a is between 0 and b -1. If all conditions are satisfied, then n = k^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So the plan is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. Determine the range of k: from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.
   b. For each k in this range, compute a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)
   c. Check if a is integer and 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1
   d. Check if c = k - a is between 0 and b -1
   e. If both conditions are met, count this k as contributing to a b-eautiful number.

2. For each b, count how many such k's satisfy the conditions.

3. Find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

So, the challenge is to find the minimal b such that the number of valid k's is more than 10.

Given that the problem is asking for the minimal b, I probably need to find for each b, the number of k's, and see when it first exceeds 10.

But I need a smarter way than just brute-forcing each b starting from 2, because b could be large.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the equation a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1), and see what constraints are on b for a given k.

Alternatively, perhaps fix k and then see for which b's this equation holds. But since we're looking for the minimal b, maybe it's better to iterate b from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute the number of valid k's.

But let's think about the equation a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer between 1 and b -1, for each b, the number of valid k's is the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and the result a is within [1, b -1].

Alternatively, for a fixed b, let me denote d = b -1, so d = 1,2,3,...

So n = a*d + c, and a + c = k.

Wait, perhaps another way. Since n = k^2, and n = a*b + c, and a + c = k, we can write:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)
=> k^2 = a*b + k - a
=> k^2 - k = a*(b -1)
=> a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1)

So for each b, d = b -1, then a = (k^2 -k)/d.

So the idea is, for each b, d = b -1, and for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], check if d divides (k^2 -k), and if a is an integer between 1 and d.

Alternatively, since a must be ≤ d, because a ≤ b -1 = d. So (k^2 -k)/d must be ≤ d. So:

(k^2 -k) ≤ d^2
=> k^2 -k ≤ (b -1)^2
But since k ≤ b -1, this might not be necessary because for k = b -1, (k^2 -k) = (b-1)(b-2). d = b -1, so a = (b-1)(b-2)/(b-1) = b -2, which is ≤ d = b -1. So that's okay.

Wait, but for k near b -1, (k^2 -k) is growing quadratically, but d is only linear. Hmm, perhaps this approach needs more thought.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it as for each k, the possible d's (d = b -1) must divide k^2 -k. So d | (k^2 -k). So for each k, d can be any divisor of (k^2 -k), and then b = d + 1.

But since b must be at least 2, d must be at least 1.

Moreover, since a = (k^2 -k)/d must be ≤ d, because a ≤ b -1 = d. So (k^2 -k)/d ≤ d => k^2 -k ≤ d^2.

But d is a divisor of k^2 -k, so d divides k(k -1). So d is a factor of k(k-1).

Wait, but k and k-1 are coprime, since consecutive integers. So the factors of k(k-1) are the products of the factors of k and the factors of k-1.

So for each k, the number of possible d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1), but considering that d must be ≥1, and that d = b -1, so b = d +1 ≥2, so d ≥1.

But since a must be ≤ d, so (k^2 -k)/d ≤
