Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find xy, given some logarithmic equations. Both x and y are greater than 1. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.

The problem states:

log_x(y^x) = 10

and

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

So, both logarithms equal 10. I need to find the product of x and y.

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

So, converting that, it becomes x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Converting that, y^10 = x^{4y}.

Now, I have two equations:

1) x^10 = y^x

2) y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, interesting. So, I have a system of equations here with x and y. I need to solve for x and y.

Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's take the first equation: x^10 = y^x.

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents. Let me try that.

Taking ln on both sides: ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Okay, so 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Take ln again: ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So, now I have two equations:

A) 10 ln x = x ln y

B) 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, so now I have equations A and B in terms of ln x and ln y. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Looking at equation A: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Let me solve for ln y.

From A: ln y = (10 ln x) / x

Similarly, equation B: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

But I can substitute ln y from equation A into equation B.

So, substituting ln y into equation B:

10 * [(10 ln x)/x] = 4y ln x

Simplify left side: (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Hmm, both sides have ln x. Since x and y are greater than 1, ln x is positive, so I can divide both sides by ln x, which won't be zero.

So, (100)/x = 4y

Multiply both sides by x: 100 = 4y x

Divide both sides by 4: 25 = y x

Wait, so xy =25?

Is that the answer? Let me check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, so according to equation B after substitution, I had:

(100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Divide both sides by ln x: 100/x =4y

So, 4y x = 100, hence xy =25.

So, maybe that's it. But just to make sure, let's see if there's consistency.

If xy =25, then y =25/x.

Let me plug this back into equation A to see if it holds.

Equation A: 10 ln x =x ln y.

But y=25/x, so ln y= ln(25/x)= ln25 - ln x.

So, equation A becomes:

10 ln x =x*(ln25 - ln x)

10 ln x =x ln25 -x ln x

Bring all terms to left:

10 ln x +x ln x -x ln25 =0

Factor ln x: ln x (10 +x ) -x ln25=0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can write it as:

ln x (10 +x ) =x ln25

Divide both sides by x:

ln x (10 +x)/x = ln25

Hmm, perhaps I can express this as:

ln x (1 +10/x )= ln25

Alternatively, let me think about another approach.

Since I have x^
