Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle configuration. Let me start by trying to understand the problem and then figure out a plan.

First, the problem says: Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the side lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so let me visualize the setup. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. It's inscribed in a circle, so we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or the circumcircle. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something related to the symmedian maybe? I'm not sure yet.

Hmm, tangents from a point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy.

AD intersects ω again at P. So, AD is a secant, and P is the second intersection point. I remember that when a secant and a tangent are involved, there's a power of a point theorem. The power of D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² or DC², since DB and DC are tangents.

Let me recall the power of a point theorem: If a line passes through D and intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y, then DX * DY = DB². So, in this case, since AD intersects ω at A and P, then DA * DP = DB².

So, if I can find DA, I can find DP and hence find AP since AP = DP - DA or something like that. Wait, actually, AP is the segment from A to P, so if I have DA and DP, I need to be careful about how they relate.

Wait, let's clarify: If AD intersects the circle at A and P, then the power of D is DA * DP = DB². So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA * DP = DB².

Therefore, if I can find DA, I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA? Hmm, wait, no. Because A is on the circle, so DA is the length from D to A, which is outside the circle. Then, when AD passes through A and goes to P, which is another point on the circle, then the power of point D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, more accurately, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² because DB is tangent. So, power of D = DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So, we have DB² = DA * DP. Therefore, DP = DB² / DA.

But we need AP.
