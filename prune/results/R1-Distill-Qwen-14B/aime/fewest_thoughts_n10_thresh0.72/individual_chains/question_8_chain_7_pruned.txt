Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes symmetry can be used. The given equation looks symmetric in a, b, and c, so maybe I can find a way to simplify it using that symmetry.

Let me write down the given equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are a, b, or c. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the second equation. Let me try:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Yes, that seems right because each of the squared terms is multiplied by the sum of the other two variables. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of this sum.

Specifically:

- b + c = 300 - a
- a + c = 300 - b
- a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, same for b and c.

So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe instead of this approach, I can find another way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can express a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b in terms of (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) and other symmetric terms.

I remember that (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b + 3abc

So, from that identity:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

Given that a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

6,000,000 = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

Let me write that equation:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, now I have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So the equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

So, 100Q - P = 2,000,000 → P = 100Q - 2,000,000

Now, I also know that for three variables, the relation between S, Q, and R (where R = a^2 + b^2 + c^2) is given by S² = Q + 2R. Wait, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that for any three variables:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

Wait, no, let me recall correctly. The expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^
