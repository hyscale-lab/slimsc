Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me try to break this down. First, understanding what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b^1 (which is b) to b^2 - 1. So, any two-digit number in base b is between b and b² - 1. 

Wait, actually, more precisely, a two-digit number in base b is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1. So the number n is a * b + c, and the digits are a and c.

The condition given is that the sum of the digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n is a * b + c, substituting that in gives:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Hmm, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's try that:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation to group like terms. Let's subtract a*b and c from both sides:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Let me factor this a bit. Maybe group terms differently:

a² - a b + 2ac + c² - c = 0

Looking at the first two terms, I can factor out an a:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of a or c.

Alternatively, perhaps treat it as a quadratic in a. Let's rearrange the equation:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

Yes, that's a quadratic in a. So, for given b and c, this equation must have integer solutions for a. Since a and c are digits in base b, a must be between 1 and b-1, and c between 0 and b-1.

The quadratic equation is:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

Let me denote this as:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

To solve for a, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c² - c)

Let me compute D:

D = (4c² - 4b c + b²) - 4c² + 4c

Simplify:

4c² -4b c +b² -4c² +4c = (-4b c + b² +4c)

Factor terms:

= b² + ( -4b c + 4c ) = b² + 4c(1 - b )

Hmm, so D = b² + 4c(1 - b) = b² -4c(b -1)

This discriminant must be a perfect square for a to be integer.

So, for each b, we can iterate over possible c (from 0 to b-1) and check if D is a perfect square. Then, if it is, solve for a and check if a is an integer in the allowed range (1 to b-1).

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express a in terms of c and b.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since a + c = sqrt(n) and n = a b + c, then:

sqrt(n) = a + c

But n = a b + c, so sqrt(a b + c) = a + c

Let me square both sides again:

a b + c = (a + c)^2 = a² + 2 a c + c²

Rearranged:

a² + 2 a c + c² - a b - c = 0

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange terms differently.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic in a. Let's solve for a using the quadratic formula:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt(D) ] / 2

Where D is the discriminant as before, which is b² -4c(b -1)

So, for a to be integer, sqrt(D) must be integer, and the numerator must be even.

Let me denote sqrt(D) as k, where k is integer. Then:

k² = b² -4c(b -1)

Which can be rewritten as:

4c(b -1) = b² - k²

So, 4c(b -1) = (b - k)(b + k)

Hmm, interesting. So, 4c(b -1) = (b - k)(b + k)

Because (b - k)(b + k) is equal to b² -k².

So, we can write:

4c(b -1) = (b - k)(b + k)

But since c is an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive, and k is positive integer (since sqrt(D) is positive), perhaps we can find constraints on k.

Let me see. Since b is at least 2, (b -1) is at least 1. So, 4c(b -1) is non-negative because c is non-negative.

So, (b -k)(b +k) is non-negative. Since b + k is always positive (because k is positive, and b is at least 2), then (b -k) must be positive as well. So, b -k > 0 => k < b.

Therefore, k can range from 1 to b -1.

But also, since k² = b² -4c(b -1), and 4c(b -1) = b² -k².

Then, since c is non-negative, 4c(b -1) must be less than or equal to b².

So, 4c(b -1) ≤ b² => c ≤ b²/(4(b -1)).

But since c is less than b, perhaps this gives an upper limit on c.

Wait, let's see: c ≤ (b²)/(4(b -1)).

Hmm, for example, when b is large, this is approximately b/4. So, for
