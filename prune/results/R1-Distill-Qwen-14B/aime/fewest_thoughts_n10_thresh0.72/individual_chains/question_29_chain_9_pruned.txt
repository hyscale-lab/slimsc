Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. I need to find the length of CE. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal, so in rectangle ABCD, BC is 16, which would make AD also 16. AB is 107, so CD is 107 as well. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG is 17, so EH is 17, and EF is 184, so GH would be 184.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on a straight line. So if I imagine the line passing through D, E, C, F, that's the order? Or maybe a different order? Hmm, not sure yet. But I think the line is the base where these four points lie.

Also, A, D, H, G are on a circle. That must mean that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, ADHG is cyclic. Wait, but A is a corner of rectangle ABCD, D is another corner, H is a corner of EFGH, and G is another corner. Interesting.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me suppose that rectangle ABCD is placed such that AB is the base, so A is at the bottom-left, B at bottom-right, C at top-right, D at top-left. Then EFGH is another rectangle attached somewhere. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe EFGH is attached along the line DC? But wait, DC is the top side of ABCD, length 107. But EF is 184, which is longer than DC, so maybe EFGH is a larger rectangle attached to DC?

But wait, ABCD and EFGH are separate rectangles, but their sides might be connected in some way. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps EFGH is attached such that E is on DC, and F is another point on DC. Hmm, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is 107. That doesn't make sense. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps D, E, C, F are arranged in that order on a straight line. So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So the line goes D-E-C-F. So DC is a part of this line, and E and F are points beyond D and C? Or maybe between D and C? Hmm, but since EF is 184, which is longer than DC (107), perhaps E and F are on the same line as DC but extended beyond? So DC is 107, and EF is 184. Hmm, but EF is a side of the rectangle EFGH. So maybe EFGH is a rectangle attached such that EF is part of the line DC extended.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's try that.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB = 107, BC = 16, so the coordinates would be:

- D: (0,0)
- C: (107,0) because DC is 107
- B: (107,16) because BC is 16
- A: (0,16)

Wait, no, wait. If AB is 107, then AB is the base, so A is at (0,0), B at (107,0), C at (107,16),
