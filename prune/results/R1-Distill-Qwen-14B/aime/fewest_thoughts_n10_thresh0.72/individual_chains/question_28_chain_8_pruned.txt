Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths. The goal is to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what I is) to each face, and express it in a particular form. Then, sum m, n, p. Alright, let's start by recalling what I know about tetrahedrons and incenters.

First, a tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and an incenter is a point equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius. So, the problem is essentially asking for the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I remember that for a regular tetrahedron, the inradius can be found with a specific formula, but this tetrahedron isn't regular. The edges are given in pairs: AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89. So, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's called a isosceles tetrahedron or something like that.

I think in such tetrahedrons, the inradius can be found using the formula similar to the inradius of a triangle, which is area over semiperimeter. But for a tetrahedron, I believe the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, no, let me check. In a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is (3 * volume) divided by the total surface area. Because in 3D, the "inradius" relates to the volume and the surface area in a similar way as in 2D, where inradius is area over semiperimeter.

So, the formula is: r = (3V) / A, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and A is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume and the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

But wait, how do I compute the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? I think I need to use coordinates or maybe some formula like Heron's formula but extended to 3D. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute its volume.

Given the symmetric edge lengths, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to simplify calculations.

So, let's try to assign coordinates to the points. Let me think about how to place them.

Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric across some planes. Let me place the points such that the midpoints are at the origin or something.

Wait, another approach: in a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's known that it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c). Or something like that. Maybe that's a way to assign coordinates.

Wait, let's try that. Let me suppose that the four vertices are at points (x, y, z), (-x, -y, z), (-x, y, -z), (x, -y, -z). Let me check if the opposite edges are equal.

Compute AB: distance between (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,z). That would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(4x² + 4y²) = 2 sqrt(x² + y²)

Similarly, CD is the distance between (-x,-y,z) and (x,-y,-z). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the points are A: (x,y,z); B: (-x,-y,z); C: (-x,y,-z); D: (x,-y,-z). So, AB is between A and B: (x,y,z) and (-x,-y,z). So, AB is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = 2 sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, CD is between C and D: (-x,y,-z) and (x,-y,-z). So CD is sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0] = 2 sqrt(x² + y²). So that's consistent with AB=CD=√41.

Similarly, AC is the distance between A (x,y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). So AC is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = 2 sqrt(x² + z²) = √80. Similarly, BD is the distance between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). So BD is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0 + (2z)^2] = 2 sqrt(x² + z²). So that's consistent with AC=BD=√80.

Similarly, BC is distance between B (-x,-y,z) and C (-x,y,-z). So that's sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2 sqrt(y² + z²). And AD is distance between A (x,y,z) and D (x,-y,-z). That's sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2 sqrt(y² + z²) = √89. So that matches BC=AD=√89.

So, from AB=CD=√41, we have 2 sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41)/2 => x² + y² = 41/4.

From AC=BD=√80, 2 sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80)/2 => x² + z² = 80/4 = 20.

From BC=AD=√89, 2 sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89)/2 => y² + z² = 89/4.

So now, we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4
2. x² + z² = 20
3. y² + z² = 89/4

We can solve for x², y², z².

Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4 => z² - y² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.

But equation 3 is y² + z² = 89/4.

So, from z² - y² = 39/4 and z² + y² = 89/4, let's add the two equations:

2 z² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => z² = 16 => z = 4 or -4. Since distance is positive, z=4.

Then, from equation 3: y² + (16) = 89/4 => y² = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or -5/2.

From equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4 => x² + 25/4 = 41/4 => x² = 16/4 = 4 => x=2 or -2.

So, x=2, y=5/2, z=4. So, the coordinates are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)

B: (-2, -5/2, 4)

C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me check if these actually satisfy the distances.

Compute AB: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,-5/2,4). The distance is sqrt[(4)^2 + (-5)^2 + 0] = sqrt(16 +25) = sqrt(41). Correct.

Compute AC: between (2,5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4). Distance is sqrt[(-4)^2 + 0 + (-8)^2] = sqrt(16 +64)= sqrt(80). Correct.

Compute BC: between (-2,-5/2,4) and (-2,5/2,-4). Distance is sqrt[0 + (5)^2 + (-8)^2] = sqrt(25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.

So, these coordinates are correct.

Now, with the coordinates known, we can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The formula for the volume given coordinates of four points is |det(B - A, C - A, D - A)| / 6.

So, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, actually, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D.

Wait, wait, no, to compute the volume with coordinates, it's better to use the scalar triple product formula. So, if we choose A as the origin in the coordinate system, then the vectors AB, AC, AD would form the edges from A, and the volume would be 1/6 times the absolute value of the scalar triple product of these vectors.

But in our case, the points are already in a coordinate system, not necessarily with A at the origin. So, perhaps it's better to compute vectors from one point to the others and then compute the determinant.

Alternatively, another formula for the volume is |(AB × AC) · AD| / 6.

Yes, that's a way. Let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, no, actually, vectors from point A to B, A to C, A to D.

Point A is (2, 5/2, 4).

Point B is (-2, -5/2, 4). So vector AB is B - A = (-4, -5, 0).

Point C is (-2, 5/2, -4). Vector AC is C - A = (-4, 0, -8).

Point D is (2, -5/2, -4). Vector AD is D - A = (0, -5, -8).

So, vectors AB = (-4, -5, 0), AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8).

Now, compute the scalar triple product: AB · (AC × AD).

First, compute AC × AD.

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

AD = (0, -5, -8)

The cross product is determinant:

i  j  k
-4 0 -8
0 -5 -8

= i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0*(-8) = 0; (-5)*(-8)=40 → 0 - 40 = -40 → i*(-40)

j: (-4)*(-8) = 32; 0*(-8)=0 → 32 - 0 = 32 → j*(-32) [since it's subtracted]

k: (-4)*(-5)=20; 0*0=0 → 20 - 0 = 20 → k*(20)

So AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Then, AB · (AC × AD) = (-4, -5, 0) · (-40, -32, 20)

Compute the dot product:

(-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160
