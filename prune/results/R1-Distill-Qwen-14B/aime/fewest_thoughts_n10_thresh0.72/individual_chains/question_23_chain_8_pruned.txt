Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the points A, B, C, D should be such that their midpoints are at the origin.

Wait, so if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, points B and D must be such that their midpoint is also the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider the diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

So, if AC is one diagonal, then BD is the other diagonal, and they are perpendicular. So, maybe I can parametrize the points on the hyperbola such that they satisfy the rhombus conditions.

Let me think: suppose the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. Since the origin is their midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).

Now, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, the slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.

So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. So, (yv)/(xu) = -1. So, yv = -xu. That's a condition that
