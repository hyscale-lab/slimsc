Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. So, ABC is a triangle, and ω is its circumcircle. Then, the tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Hmm, tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the intersection of two tangents from a point outside the circle lies on the polar of that point with respect to the circle, but maybe I don't need that here. 

Next, AD intersects ω again at point P. So, if I draw a line from A through D, it will meet the circumcircle ω at another point P. The problem gives me the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so let's see. I need to find AP. Since AP is a chord of the circle, perhaps I can use some circle theorems or power of a point. Let me think about the power of point D with respect to ω. Because D lies outside the circle, and DB and DC are tangents to ω, the power of D should be equal to DB² = DC².

Wait, power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² because DB and DC are both tangents from D. That's correct. So, Power of D: DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Hmm, so DP * DA = DB². So, if I can find DA and DP, or express them in terms of known quantities, maybe I can find AP.

But I don't know DA yet. Let me think about triangle ABC first. Maybe I can use some properties of triangle ABC to find the circumradius or other lengths that might help. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the semi-perimeter first to find the area using Heron's formula.

The semi-perimeter, s, is (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Then, the area using Heron's formula is √[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = √[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = √[12*7*3*2] = √(504) = √(16*31.5) wait, 504 is 16*31.5? No, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. But maybe 504 can be factored further. 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Alternatively,
