Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says that the set B consists of all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, each box has length, width, and height, let's call them x, y, z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. 

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius would be half of the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the box completely, so the center of the sphere would be at the center of the box, and the radius would reach from the center to any vertex. So, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and the radius r would be (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z² and then divide it by 4.

So, my goal now is to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume. Wait, no, actually, wait. The problem says the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B. So, I suppose we need the maximum possible value of the space diagonal among all boxes in B, because the sphere has to contain all boxes, so the radius has to be at least the largest possible space diagonal divided by 2. Therefore, I need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in B, and then r is half of that maximum. So, r² would be (max(x² + y² + z²))/4.

Wait, but how do I find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23? That seems a bit tricky. I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, we can use Lagrange multipliers. Maybe that's the way to go.

Let me write down the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. Volume: xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z² subject to these constraints.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 27, and V = xyz = 23.

I also remember that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Since P is fixed at 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54. So, if I can maximize S², then x² + y² + z² will be maximized. So, the problem reduces to maximizing S, given that P=27 and V=23.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can consider the relationship between S, P, and V. Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers is the way to go.

So, let's set up the Lagrangian. Let me define the function f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which we want to maximize, subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.
