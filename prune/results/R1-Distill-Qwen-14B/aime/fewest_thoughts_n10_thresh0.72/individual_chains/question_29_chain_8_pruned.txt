Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

First, I should visualize this. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, rectangle ABCD. Let's label it so that AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom side, and DA is the left side. So, moving around the rectangle in order: A, B, C, D.

Then, rectangle EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line. I'm thinking that line is probably the same as DC, but I'm not sure yet. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which is interesting—so those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circle.

Given lengths: BC is 16, which is the height of rectangle ABCD because BC is one of the vertical sides. AB is 107, which is the base of the rectangle. So, ABCD has sides of 107 and 16.

FG is 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is one of its sides. EF is 184, so EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

I need to find CE. So, point C is one of the vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E is a vertex of EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, E is somewhere on the line that includes D, C, and F. So, E is either between D and C or beyond C or beyond D. Hmm, but given that E is a corner of the rectangle EFGH, and F is another point, probably E is beyond C or beyond D. Wait, but in the problem, it's D, E, C, F collinear—so the order is D, then E, then C, then F? Or could it be some other order?

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. The order is important. So, the points are in the order D, E, C, F along a straight line. So starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So the line goes D-E-C-F.

So, the line is going through D, E, C, F in that order. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C from D's perspective.

But both E and F are vertices of the rectangle EFGH. Let's think about how EFGH is situated. Since EFGH is a rectangle, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE.

Given that EF is 184, and FG is 17, so EF is much longer than FG. So, EFGH is a long, skinny rectangle.

Given that E is on the line D-E-C-F, and E is a vertex of EFGH, perhaps the rectangle is attached to that line in some way.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's an important piece of information—so those four points are concyclic. That must mean that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, maybe there's some cyclic quadrilateral properties I can use here.

Let me think about what information I have:

1. Rectangle ABCD: AB = 107, BC = 16. So, coordinates? Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let's try that.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107 and BC = 16, we can assign coordinates as follows:

- D: (0, 0)
- C: (107, 0) because DC is along the x-axis, length AB = 107.
- B: (107, 16)
- A: (0, 16)

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), B at (107, 16), and A at (0, 16). Yeah, that's correct.

So, rectangle ABCD with A(0,16), B(107,1
