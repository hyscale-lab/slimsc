Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n^4 +1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8. But for p^2, the situation is more complicated. I think this has something to do with higher-order congruences and maybe Hensel's lemma? But I'm not too sure about that.

Let me start by looking for primes p where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. That is, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p is solvable. I know that for such primes, -1 must be a quartic residue modulo p. From what I remember, the number of solutions to x^4 ≡ a mod p depends on the exponent and the prime p. So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, p must satisfy certain conditions.

I think the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1. So, for x^4 ≡ -1 mod p to have a solution, the equation must have a solution in the multiplicative group. That means that the order of -1 in the multiplicative group must divide 4, but wait, the order of -1 is 2 because (-1)^2 = 1. So, maybe I need to think about whether 4 divides the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. Hmm, perhaps not exactly, but maybe the multiplicative group modulo p has an element of order 8, which would imply that 8 divides p-1 because the multiplicative group is cyclic.

Wait, if x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then x^8 ≡ 1 mod p, so the order of x modulo p must divide 8. Since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order p-1, 8 must divide p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So p must be a prime where p ≡ 1 mod 8. The smallest primes in this form are 17, 97, etc. Wait, but 2 is also a prime. Let me check if 2 works. For p=2, n^4 +1 is 0 mod 4 when n is odd, because n^4 is 1 mod 2, so 1 + 1 = 2 mod 4, which is 2, not 0. If n is even, then n^4 would be 0 mod 4, so 0 +1 =1 mod 4, which isn't 0 either. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=17. Let me see if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 17. Let's compute some fourth powers mod 17.

Compute 1^4 = 1 mod 17
2^4 = 16 mod 17
3^4 = 81 mod 17. 81 divided by 17 is 4*17=68, 81-68=13. So 13 mod 17.
4^4= (4^2)^2=16^2=256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 256 mod17 is 1.
5^4: 5^2=25, 25 mod17=8, then 8^2=64 mod17=13.
6^4: 6^2=36 mod17=2, 2
