Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it to each of its faces. The point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. That sounds like the incenter of the tetrahedron, right? In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, similar to the incenter in a triangle.

The edge lengths are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, interesting. So opposite edges are equal. That makes me think the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something symmetric. Maybe it's a kind of "mirror" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron might have some nice properties, like maybe all faces are congruent triangles? Wait, but let me check.

Wait, the edges are AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So each pair of opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or maybe "isohedral," but actually, equifacial means all faces are congruent, which might not necessarily be the case here. Let me think.

If I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron and find the areas of each face, then perhaps I can find the inradius. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the volume can be related to the inradius and the total surface area by the formula: Volume = (1/3) * inradius * surface area. So if I can find the volume and the total surface area, I can solve for the inradius.

So, first, I need to compute the volume of this tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a kind of "orthocentric" tetrahedron? Or perhaps it's a tetrahedron that can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

I think a good approach might be to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is centered at the origin or something symmetric. Let me try that.

Let me consider placing the points such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide or something like that. Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume given the edge lengths.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a formula that allows computing the volume of a tetrahedron when all six edge lengths are known. That might be the way to go. I remember the formula is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger matrix for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is a 5x5 matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1   |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0
