Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

But in this case, if A is winning the grand prize and B is winning a prize, then A is a subset of B because if you win the grand prize, you automatically win a prize. So, A ∩ B is just A. Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning a prize.

Let me break this down.

First, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Winning the grand prize means that all four of Jen's numbers are the ones chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the only way this happens is if her 4 numbers are exactly the same as the 4 chosen.

The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4).

The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because there's only one specific set of 4 numbers that Jen has. So, P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this includes cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. However, since winning the grand prize is also included in the prize, when we compute P(B), it's the probability of having at least two matches.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the complement: 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches, which is having zero or one match. So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

First, P(0 matches): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are among Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4).

Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one match is: choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the other 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

So, let's compute these.

C(6,4) is 15.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of ways with exactly one match is 80.

So, total number of ways with 0 or 1 matches is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the probability of not winning a prize is 95 / 210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115 / 210.

Simplifying 115/210: both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Therefore, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, that's 115/210 = 23/42. That seems correct.

But wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Total ways: 210.

Ways with 0 matches: C(6,4)=15.

Ways with 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80.

So, 15+80=95. So, ways with at least 2 matches: 210 -95=115.

So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. Yes, that's correct.

So, now, P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) )= 1 / 115.

Wait, that's interesting. So, 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115.

But wait, 115 is 23*5, and 1 is 1. So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common factors except 1. So, yes, m=1, n=115, so m+n=116.

Wait, is that right? It seems straightforward, but let me think again.

Wait, is P(B) correct? Because P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, which is at least two matches. So, the number of favorable is 115. So, 115/210, which is 23/42. And P(A) is 1/210.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the initial counts. Let me check the counts again.

Total possible lottery outcomes: C(10,4)=210.

Number of ways with 0 matches: C(6,4)=15.

Number of ways with exactly 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80. So, 15+80=95.

Therefore, the number of ways with at least two matches is 210-95=115.

Therefore, P(B)=115/210=23/42.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115. So, probability is 1/115. So, m=1, n=115, m+n=116.

Wait, but wait a second, 115 is 5*23, and
