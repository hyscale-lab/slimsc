Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about finding the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared, that is, p². Then, once we find that prime p, we need to find the smallest positive integer m for which m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n^4 + 1. Then, with that p, find the smallest m such that m^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

Let me think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². Or maybe it's better to approach it by considering primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, and then see when it lifts to modulo p².

I remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue because x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions. But for quartic residues, I think the conditions are more stringent. So, maybe I need to look for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, which would imply that the multiplicative order of some element divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some concepts here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can start by testing small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p² for some n.

Let me list the primes one by one and check.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there exists n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n^4 mod 4. For n odd, n ≡1 mod 2, so n^4 ≡1 mod 4. Then, n^4 +1 ≡2 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. For n even, n^4 is 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 ≡1 mod 4, which isn't 0 mod 4. So, p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3: Let's check if n^4 ≡-1 mod 9. So, n^4 ≡8 mod 9. Let me compute n^4 mod 9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1^4=1 →1 mod9 → not 8
n=2: 16 mod9=7 →7≠8
n=3: 81 mod9=0 →0≠8
n=4: 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4≠8
n=5: 625 mod9: 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 →4≠8
n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9=0 →0≠8
n=7: 7^4=2401 mod9: 2401/9=266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7 →7≠8
n=8:8^4=4096 mod9: 4096/9=455*9=4095, 4096-4095=1 →1≠8
So, none of n=1 to 8 give n^4 ≡8 mod9. Therefore, p=3 is not suitable.

Next prime: p=5. Let's check if n^4 ≡-1 mod25, which is 24 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But maybe there's a smarter way. First, let's find n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Since 25 is 5², let's first check mod5. For n^4 ≡-1 mod5. So, n^4 ≡4 mod5. Let's compute n^4 mod5 for n=1 to 4 (since mod5, n=0 to4).

n=1:1^4=1 mod5→1≠4
n=2:16 mod5=1≠4
n=3:81 mod5=1≠4
n=4:256 mod5=1≠4

Wait, that's odd. So, n^4 mod5 is always 1? Because 2^4=16, 3^4=81, 4^4=256. All are 1 mod5. So, n^4 ≡1 mod5 for any n not divisible by5. So, n^4 ≡1 mod5, which can't be ≡4 mod5. So, there is no solution mod5, which implies that there is no solution mod25 either. So, p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=7. Let's check if n^4 ≡-1 mod49, which is 48 mod49.

Again, first check mod7. Let's compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6.

n=1:1 →1≠6
n=2:16 mod7=2→2≠6
n=3:81 mod7= 81-70=11→11-7=4→4≠6
n=4:256 mod7. 256 ÷7: 7*36=252, 256-252=4 →4≠6
n=5:625 mod7. 625 ÷7: 7*89=623, 625-623=2→2≠6
n=6:1296 mod7. 1296 ÷7: 7*185=1295, 1296-1295=1→1≠6

So, n^4 mod7 is never 6. Therefore, no solution mod7, hence no solution mod49. So, p=7 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=11. Let's check first mod11.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod11, which is 10 mod11.

Compute n^4 mod11 for n=1 to10.

n=1:1→1≠10
n=2:16→5→5≠10
n=3:81→4→4≠10
n=4:256→256-22*11=256-242=14→14-11=3→3≠10
n=5:625 mod11. 625 ÷11=56*11=616, 625-616=9→9≠10
n=6:1296 mod11. 1296 ÷11: 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9→9≠10
n=7:2401 mod11. Let's compute 7^4=2401. Compute 2401 ÷11: 11*218=2398, 2401-2398=3→3≠10
n=8:4096 mod11. 4096 ÷11: 11*372=4092, 4096-4092=4→4≠10
n=9:6561 mod11. 6561 ÷11: 11*596=6556, 6561-6556=5→5≠10
n=10:10000 mod11. 10^4=10000. 10 mod11 is -1, so (-1)^4=1→1≠10

So, again, n^4 mod11 is never 10. Therefore, no solution mod11, so no solution mod121. So, p=11 is out.

Next prime: p=13.

Check n^4 ≡-1 mod13, which is 12 mod13.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to12.

n=1:1→1≠12
n=2:16→3→3≠12
n=3:81→81-6*13=81-78=3→3≠12
n=4:256 mod13: 256 ÷13=19*13=247, 256-247=9→9≠12
n=5:625 mod13: 625 ÷13=48*13=624, 625-624=1→1≠12
n=6:1296 mod13: 1296 ÷13=99*13=1287, 1296-1287=9→9≠12
n=7:2401 mod13: 2401 ÷13=184*13=2392, 2401-2392=9→9≠12
n=8:4096 mod13: Let's see, 8^2=64 mod13=12, so 8^4=(8^2)^2=12^2=144 mod13=1. So 1≠12
n=9:9^4=(9^2)^2. 9^2=81 mod13=3, so 3^2=9 mod13. 9≠12
n=10:10 mod13=10. 10^2=100 mod13=9, 10^4=9^2=81 mod13=3→3≠12
n=11:11 mod13=11. 11^2=121 mod13=4, 11^4=4^2=16 mod13=3→3≠12
n=12:12 mod13=12. 12^2=144 mod13=1, 12^4
