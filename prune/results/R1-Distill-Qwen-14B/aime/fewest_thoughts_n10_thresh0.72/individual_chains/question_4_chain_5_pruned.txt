Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a turn-based game, so I should model it using game theory, specifically looking for winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Since Alice goes first, Bob's chance to win comes into play if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to figure out the pattern of winning and losing positions. Let's start by examining small values of n and see if we can spot a pattern.

For n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice (Bob can't do anything; Alice wins). So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes the last token and wins. Wait, no—if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. So Alice would instead take 1, but that leads to her losing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for Bob. But if Alice takes 4, she can't because there are only 2 tokens. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 token for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't force a win. Wait, that would mean n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. Hmm, wait, but let me think again.

Wait, no, when n=2, Alice must take either 1 or 4, but she can't take 4. So she must take 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob takes that 1 and wins. So for n=2, Alice can't win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me make a table.

Let's make a table for n from 0 to, say, 10, and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n | Outcome (W/L)
0 | L (no moves left, previous player wins)
1 | W (take 1)
2 | ?
3 | ?
4 | W (take 4)
5 | ?
6 | ?
7 | ?
8 | W (take 4, leaving 4, which is W for the next player? Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the next player.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. For each position n, if the current player can make a move that leads the opponent into a
