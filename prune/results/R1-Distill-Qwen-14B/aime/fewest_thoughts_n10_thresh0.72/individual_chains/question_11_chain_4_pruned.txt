Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

First, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:

Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z]

And z is a complex number with |z| = 4. So, z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4.

Since z is a complex number, I can represent it in polar form. Maybe that would make things easier. Let's write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That way, since the modulus is 4, it's straightforward.

So, if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|², and since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. So, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Now, substituting z into the expression, we have:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}

Let's compute 4*(75 + 117i) first. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So this term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Compute (96 + 144i)/4 first. 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So this term becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, the expression simplifies to:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, now I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me express each term in terms of cosine and sine.

Remember that for a complex number A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, the real part is Re[A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}] = Re[A e^{iθ}] + Re[B e^{-iθ}].

So, let's compute Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}] and Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}].

First, Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}]:

Expanding e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ, we get:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ

But i² = -1, so this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

So the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, for Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}]. Let's compute that.

First, e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ.

So,

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ

Again, i² = -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

So the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Now, adding both real parts together:

Total real part = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

Which is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, to find the maximum value of an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, but in this case, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but in our case, B is negative. So, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is that for C cosθ + D sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(C² + D²). So regardless of the signs, the maximum is the amplitude.

So, let's compute sqrt(324² + 432²).

First, compute 324 squared:

324 * 324: Let's compute 300² = 90,000, 24²=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)²= 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400; 104,400 + 576=104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: Hmm, 400²=160,000, 32²=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600.

So, (400 + 32)^2= 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600; plus 1,024 gives 186,624.

So, sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)? Well, 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, the maximum value is 540.

Wait a second, but the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, yes, that's equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ with A=324 and B=-432.

So, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² + 432²), which is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just check if I did everything correctly.
