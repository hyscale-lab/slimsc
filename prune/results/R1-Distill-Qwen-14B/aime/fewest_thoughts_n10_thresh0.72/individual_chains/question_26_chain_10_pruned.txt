Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The lengths of the sides are given: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. It's inscribed in a circle, so ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, drawing a line from A through D, which meets the circle again at P. We're to find AP.

Hmm. So, tangents from D to the circle ω at B and C. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, D must lie on the external tangent from B and C. Wait, actually, the tangent at a point on a circle is unique, so D is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to ω, touching it at B and C.

Wait, but in this case, since B and C are on ω, the lines DB and DC are both tangents. So D is the ex-pole or something with respect to ω. Hmm, perhaps we can use some properties of poles and polars here.

Alternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² and DC², since DB and DC are tangents. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. Wait, is that necessarily true?

Wait, no, that's only if the two tangents are equal in length. But in general, the lengths of the two tangents from a point to a circle are equal. So yes, DB = DC.

So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC, perhaps? Or maybe on
