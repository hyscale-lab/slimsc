Okay, so I have this problem here: There's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, that's a square. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at any angle, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think they are. Let me double-check that. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's a key point. So, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is also the center of the hyperbola, since the hyperbola is centered at (0,0).

So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin. So, the coordinates of the points can be expressed in terms of the endpoints of the diagonals.

Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v). So, the four points are (x, y), (-x, -y), (u, v), (-u, -v). So, these four points form the rhombus.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, another approach is to consider the slopes of the diagonals. If the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1.

But maybe another approach is to parameterize the points on the hyperbola. Let me think about how to represent points on the hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, parametric equations for hyperbola can be written as x = sqrt(20) secθ, y = sqrt(24) tanθ, or in terms of hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t. Hmm, but maybe using hyperbola parametrization with θ could be more straightforward.

Wait, but in hyperbola parametrization, the standard parametrization is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where a² = 20, b² = 24. So, a is sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b is sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6). So, points A and C can be represented as (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ) and (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ), respectively. Similarly, points B and D can be represented as (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ) and (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ), respectively.

Now, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let's compute the slopes of AC and BD.

Slope of AC: Since A is (2√5 secθ, 2√6 tanθ) and C is (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ), the slope is [(-2√6 tanθ) - (2√6 tanθ)] / [(-2√5 secθ) - (2√5 secθ)] = (-4√6 tanθ) / (-4√5 secθ) = (√6/√5) (tanθ / secθ). Simplifying tanθ / secθ: tanθ is sinθ/cosθ, and secθ is 1/cosθ, so tanθ/secθ = sinθ.

So, slope of AC is (√6/√5) sinθ.

Similarly, slope of BD: Points B is (2√5 secφ, 2√6 tanφ) and D is (-2√5 secφ, -2√6 tanφ). The slope is [(-2√6 tanφ) - (2√6 tanφ)] / [(-2√5 secφ) - (2√5 secφ)] = (-4√6 tanφ)/(-4√5 secφ) = (√6/√5) (tanφ / secφ) = (√6/√5) sinφ.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So,

(√6/√5 sinθ) * (√6/√5 sinφ) = -1

Simplify:

(6/5) sinθ sinφ = -1

So,

sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Hmm, that's an important equation. So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Okay, so that's one condition. Now, another condition is that the sides of the rhombus are equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance between consecutive points should be the same.

But maybe we can impose another condition using the properties of a rhombus. Alternatively, since we have points on the hyperbola, perhaps we can use the fact that vectors OA and OB are such that OA and OB are vectors from the origin to points A and B, and since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. Wait, but since diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the midpoint, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, vector OA = - vector OC, and vector OB = - vector OD.

So, another approach is to consider the vectors OA and OB, and since the rhombus is formed by A, B, C, D, the sides are vectors AB, BC, CD, DA. But since it's a rhombus, all these vectors have the same magnitude.

So, let's consider vectors OA and OB. Then, vectors AB = OB - OA, and vectors BC = OC - OB = -OA - OB. So, the magnitudes of AB and BC should be equal.

So, |OB - OA|² = | -OA - OB|².

Let me compute these. Let OA = (x1, y1), OB = (x2, y2).

Then, |OB - OA|² = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.

| -OA - OB|² = (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

So, setting these equal:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1².

Right side: x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2².

So, equate:

x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1² = x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2².

Subtracting the right side from both sides, we get:

-2x1x2 - 2y1y2 = 2x1x2 + 2y1y2.

Bring all terms to the left:

-2x1x2 - 2y1y2 - 2x1x2 - 2y1y2 = 0 =>

-4x1x2 -4y1y2 = 0.

Divide both sides by -4:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, the dot product of OA and OB is zero. So, OA is perpendicular to OB.

Wait, no: OA · OB = x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, which implies that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. So, that
