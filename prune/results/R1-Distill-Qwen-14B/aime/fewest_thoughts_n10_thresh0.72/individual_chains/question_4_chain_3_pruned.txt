Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if he can force a situation where he's the one to take the last token. So, the key is to find the values of n where Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that he ends up taking the last token.

I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. These types of problems often involve identifying "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the losing positions would be the ones where if a player is faced with that number of tokens, they can't force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Let's denote these losing positions as positions where the starting player cannot win.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a function f(n) where f(n) is true if the current player can win when there are n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- f(0): If there are no tokens left, the game is over. But since the last token was taken by the previous player, the current player has lost. So, f(0) = false.
- f(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So, f(1) = true.
- f(2): Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. If you take 4, you can't because there are only 2. So the current player can only take 1, leading to opponent's win. So f(2) = false? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent is now faced with n=1, which is a winning position for them because they can take the last token. So yes, f(2) is false because the current player can't force a win.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's maybe build a table for small n to see the pattern.

Let's list f(n) for n from 0 to, say, 10.

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
f(n): ?

We know:
f(0) = False
f(1) = True (since you can take 1 and win)
f(2): If you take 1, opponent is at f(1)=True, meaning they can win. If you take 4, you can't. So all moves lead to opponent winning. So f(2)=
