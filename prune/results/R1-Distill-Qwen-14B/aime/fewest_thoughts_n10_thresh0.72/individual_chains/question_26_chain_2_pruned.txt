Okay, I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. I need to find the length of AP, which is given in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me recall some properties that might help. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole or something related to the triangle. I think D is the exsimilicenter or something like that. But maybe more importantly, since D is the intersection of tangents from B and C, BD and CD are tangents, so BD = DC. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true because the lengths of the tangents from a point to a circle are equal. So, yes, BD = CD. So triangle BDC is isoceles with BD = CD.

Wait, but triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Maybe I can find some angles or use the Law of Cosines to find angles in triangle ABC. Alternatively, maybe use power of a point.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, the power of D is DB² = DC² = DB * DC. Wait, more accurately, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC² because both are tangent lengths. So, power of D is DB² = DC².

But also, since AD intersects ω at P and A, the power of D with respect to ω can also be expressed as DP * DA = DB². So, DP * DA = DB².

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then since AP = AD - DP, I can find AP.

Hmm, but how do I find DA? Maybe I can find coordinates or use some properties.

Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10 units long. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find the coordinates of B.

We know AB = 5 and BC=9. So, if C is at (0,0) and A is at (10,0), let's find the coordinates of B.

Let me denote B as (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9: so sqrt(x² + y²) = 9, so x² + y² = 81.

The distance from B to A is 5: sqrt( (x -10)² + y² ) =5, so (x -10)² + y² =25.

Subtract the first equation from the second: (x² -20x +100 + y²) - (x² + y²) =25 -81.

So, -20x +100 = -56; -20x = -156; x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, from x² + y²=81, we can find y:

(39/5)² + y²=81.

39² is 1521, so (1521/25) + y² =81.

y²=81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = (504/25). So y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Let me factor 504: 504=16*31.5, but that's not helpful. Wait, 504= 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 16*31 is 496, so 504-496=8, so 16*31 +8=504. Wait, perhaps a better approach.

504= 8*63 = 8*9*7= 72*7. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(72*7)=sqrt(36*2*7)=6*sqrt(14). So y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

So, the coordinates of B are (39/5, 6*sqrt(14)/5). Let me write that as (7.8, approximately 4.4899), which matches the Asymptote code.

So, now we have the coordinates:

A: (10,0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5 )

C: (0,0)

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

First, let me find the equation of the tangent at B to ω.

To find the tangent line at a point on a circle, we can use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

So, first, I need the coordinates of the circumcircle ω's center, O.

Finding the circumcenter O: the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC.

Given that points A(10,0), B(39/5,6√14/5), and C(0,0).

Let me find the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC or something.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using coordinates.

The circumradius can be found using the formula:

R = (a b c) / (4 Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area.

But since we have coordinate points, perhaps computing O directly is better.

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates, we can set up equations for the perpendicular bisectors.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the midpoint of AB. Midpoint M_AB:

x: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 +39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10 =8.9

y: (0 +6√14/5)/2 = (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5.

Slope of AB: (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) )= -6√14/11.

Therefore, the slope of AB is -6√14/11, so the slope
