Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then find r squared expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's call them x, y, and z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by the formula 2(xy + yz + xz), right? And the volume is xyz. So, according to the problem, the surface area is 54, so 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. That simplifies to xy + yz + xz = 27.

The volume is 23, so xyz = 23. Got that.

Now, the problem is about the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The sphere must enclose the box completely. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, stretching from one corner to the opposite corner. So, the sphere must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal, making the radius half of that.

So, I need to find the space diagonal of the box, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Hence, the radius r is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)) / 2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²) / 4. So, the goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z².

Wait, but how do I find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume?

I remember that in optimization problems with multiple constraints, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. So, maybe I should set up a function to minimize, f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third using the constraints and then find the minimum.

Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the minimum occurs when x = y = z? Wait, but no, because if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check the surface area and volume for a cube. If it's a cube, each face is x², so surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube, so the minimal sphere can't be when x = y = z.

So, maybe I can assume two variables are equal to simplify the problem. Let me assume that x = y. Then, I can express z in terms of x using the volume.

If x = y, then volume xyz = x² z = 23, so z = 23 / x².

Surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2(x² + 2xz) = 2x² + 4xz. But surface area is 54, so 2x² + 4xz = 54.

Substituting z from above: 2x² + 4x*(23/x²) = 54.

Simplify that: 2x² + (92)/x = 54.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator: 2x³ + 92 = 54x.

Bring all terms to one side: 2x³ - 54x + 92 = 0.

Simplify by dividing both sides by 2: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me see if I can find a real root. Let's try plugging in x=3: 27 - 81 + 46 = (27+46) -81 = 73 -81= -8. Not zero.

x=2: 8 -54 +46= (8+46) -54=54-
