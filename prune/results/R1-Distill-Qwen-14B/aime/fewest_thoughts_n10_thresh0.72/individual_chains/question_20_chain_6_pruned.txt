Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to place some of them on a 5x5 grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, once placed, adding any more chips would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me break this down. Each row can either have all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But wait, no, actually, the problem says "some of these chips" so the grid doesn't have to be completely filled. Also, the placement must be such that any additional chip would break either the row or column uniformity.

Wait, so the grid is partially filled, with certain rows and columns filled with all white or all black, but not necessarily all of them. And the placement must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

So, each row and each column can be in one of three states: all white, all black, or empty. But if a row is non-empty, it must have all chips of the same color. Similarly for columns.

But the problem is that the rows and columns can't conflict. For example, if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must either be all white or empty. Because if a column is all black, then the intersection with this row would have a black chip, which is a conflict.

Wait, that's a key point. So the color assignments for the rows and columns must be consistent. Let me think about how that works.

Suppose I decide the colors for each row and each column. For each row, it can be white (W), black (B), or empty (E). Similarly for columns. But the color assignments must satisfy that the intersection of a white row and a white column is white, a white row and a black column would be a conflict (since the cell would have to be both white and black, which isn't allowed), so such a placement isn't allowed. Similarly, a black row and white column would conflict, so that's not allowed.

Wait, but if a row is white, then all the columns that intersect with it must either be white or empty? Or
