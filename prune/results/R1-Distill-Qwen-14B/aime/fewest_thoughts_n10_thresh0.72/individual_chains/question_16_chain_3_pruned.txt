Okay, so I have this problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m with the same property.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I remember that for primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, certain conditions hold. But since we're dealing with p², it's a bit more involved.

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if they satisfy the condition. So let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

n can be 1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4.
n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod 4 is 1, so not 0.
Wait, wait. n=1: 1+1=2 mod 4 is 2. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm. So for p=2, n⁴ +1 is congruent to 2 mod 4. So 2 divides n⁴ +1, but 4 does not. So p=2 doesn't work because we need p² to divide n⁴ +1, but 4 doesn't. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3.

Check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since modulo 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod 9. 1≡-1? 1≡-1 mod 9 would mean 2≡0 mod 9, which is false.

n=2: 16 mod 9 is 7. 7≡-1 mod 9? No, because -1 is 8 mod 9. 7≠8.

n=3: 81 mod 9 is 0. 0≡-1? No.

n=4: 256 mod 9. Let's see, 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod 9. 4≡-1? 4+1=5≡0? No.

n=5: 625 mod 9. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod 9. Same as n=4. Not -1.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod 9 is 0, since 9*144=1296. 0≡-1? No.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401/9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. 7 mod 9. Not -1.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod 9: 4096 - 9*455=4096-4095=1. So 1 mod 9. Not -1.

So for p=3, there's no n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is p=5.

Looking for n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25.

So let's compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue, but for quartic residues, it's more specific. Maybe p needs to satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, but in any case, let's compute n⁴ mod 25.

Alternatively, maybe I can find n such that n² ≡ sqrt(-1) mod 25. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1, then (n²)² ≡ -1.

So first, find if there exists a square root of -1 mod 25.

-1 mod 25 is 24. So find x such that x² ≡24 mod25.

Check x=7: 49 mod25=24. Yes! So x=7 is a solution. So n²≡7 mod25.

So then n can be sqrt(7) mod25. Let's find sqrt(7) mod25.

Looking for y such that y² ≡7 mod25.

Let me try y=18: 18²=324. 324 mod25: 25*12=300,
