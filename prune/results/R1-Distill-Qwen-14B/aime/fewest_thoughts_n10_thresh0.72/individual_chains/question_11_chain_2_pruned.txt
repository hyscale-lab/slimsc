Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that complex numbers can be represented in polar form, which might be helpful here since we know the magnitude of z is 4.

First, let me recall that any complex number z with |z| = r can be written as z = r*(cosθ + i sinθ), where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, using Euler's formula, z = re^{iθ}. Since |z| is 4, z = 4e^{iθ}. That seems useful because it might simplify the expression we're dealing with.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2, and since |z|=4, |z|^2 is 16. But wait, actually, for z = re^{iθ}, 1/z is (1/r)e^{-iθ}, so yeah, that's correct.

Now, let's substitute z and 1/z into the given expression. The expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, we get:

(75 + 117i)*(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)*(1/(4e^{iθ})).

Simplify each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}.

Compute 75*4 = 300, and 117*4 = 468. So, that's (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ} because 96/4=24 and 144/4=36.

So, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Because we are to find the largest possible real part, which depends on θ.

To find the real part, I can express each term using Euler's formula and then separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.

So, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Expanding each term:

A e^{iθ} = A (cosθ + i sinθ) = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} = B (cosθ - i sinθ) = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying these out:

First, expand A e^{iθ}:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, expand B e^{-iθ}:

= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1,
