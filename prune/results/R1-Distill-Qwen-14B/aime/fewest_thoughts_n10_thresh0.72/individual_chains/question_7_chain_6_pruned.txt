Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Then, express this probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored red or blue independently with a 50% chance each. The problem is about rotations of the octagon. So, if I rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45), the arrangement of colors changes, but the structure remains the same.

Wait, so the question is asking for the probability that there's a rotation which maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. That is, if I rotate the octagon by some k steps (k from 0 to 7), then for every blue vertex in the original, after rotation, it should be where a red vertex was.

Another way to think about it: after rotation, all blue vertices have to coincide with red positions. So, for each rotation, we can check if this condition holds. But since rotations can be different, perhaps we can model this using group theory or something. But maybe that's overcomplicating.

Let me consider the possible rotations. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, so there are 8 possible rotations: 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, corresponding to shifting the octagon by 0 to 7 positions.

So, for each rotation, we can think of a permutation of the vertices. The condition is that for a given coloring, there exists a rotation such that every blue vertex is mapped to a red vertex.

Wait, that might be equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the set of red vertices under some rotation. But that seems a bit abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue and red sets are related by a rotation.

Wait, no. Because if we rotate the blue set, it should align with the red set. So, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set. So, the coloring must be such that the blue vertices form a rotation image of the red vertices.

But wait, the total number of vertices is 8, so red and blue vertices partition the octagon.

But perhaps more clearly: Let’s denote the set of red vertices as R and blue as B. Then, for some rotation σ, σ(B) is a subset of R. But since R and B are complements, σ(B) must equal R. Because otherwise, if σ(B) is a proper subset, then some elements in R would be missing. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the characteristic vectors. Since each vertex is colored red or blue, we can represent the coloring as a binary vector of length
