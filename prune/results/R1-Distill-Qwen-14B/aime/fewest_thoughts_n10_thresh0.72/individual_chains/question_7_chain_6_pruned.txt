Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, independently, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me think about the octagon and its symmetries. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, and it will look the same after each rotation.

The problem is asking for the probability that such a rotation exists which maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. So, in other words, after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red.

Let me rephrase that: After rotating the octagon by some multiple of 45°, all the blue vertices should be in positions where the original color was red. So, if I have an original coloring, I want to find if there's a rotation that swaps all blue's to red's positions.

Wait, but actually, it's not quite swapping; it's more like, after rotation, the image of the blue vertices must exactly coincide with the set of red vertices in the original coloring.

So, another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Since the octagon is regular, any rotation is a symmetry, so the set of red vertices must be a rotated version of the set of blue vertices.

Wait, but since the octagon is regular, the set of red and blue vertices should form orbits under the rotation group, right?

But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the octagon's vertices as V₀, V₁, V₂, ..., V₇ arranged in a circle. Each vertex V_i is colored red or blue independently with probability 1/2 each.

We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a cyclic shift by k positions for some k) such that after rotating the octagon by k positions, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, so if I rotate by k positions, then the vertex V_i moves to V_{i+k mod 8}. So, the set of blue vertices after rotation is {V_{i+k mod
