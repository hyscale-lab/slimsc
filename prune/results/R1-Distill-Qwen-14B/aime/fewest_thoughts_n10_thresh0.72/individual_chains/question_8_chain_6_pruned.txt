Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I notice that the first equation is a linear equation, and the second one is quadratic in each variable. It might help to express the second equation in terms of the first, or perhaps find a way to relate them.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300.
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at the second equation, I can factor terms. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire second equation can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But wait, since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting those into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

This simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I recall that for three variables, we have some identities:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, from this, I can express a² + b² + c² as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, that's 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, substituting that into our equation:

300[90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute 300 * 90,000. That's 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000. Then 300 * (-2)(ab + bc + ca) is -600(ab + bc + ca).

So now the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Subtracting 6,000,000 from both sides:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0.

So, rearranged:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, that still looks complicated. Maybe I can find another identity to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of symmetric sums.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting that in:

(a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let's compute each term:

(a + b + c)^3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000.
-3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = -3 * 300 * (ab + bc + ca) = -900(ab + bc + ca).
+3abc is just 3abc.
And then +600(ab + bc + ca).

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 -900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 - (900 - 600)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

27,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 21,000,000.

Subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 0.

Divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:

2,000,000 - 100(ab + bc + ca) + abc = 0.

So, now we have:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this is a more manageable equation. Let me write it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.

I can factor out ab, bc, ca terms:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression or find a substitution.

Let me consider adding 100^3 to both sides, but that might be messy. Alternatively, let's try to factor.

Wait, let me factor the terms:

Take ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) + 2,000,000 = 0.

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c.

So substitute that in:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Let's compute each term:

1. ab(c - 100).
2. -100c(300 - c) = -30,000c + 100c².
3. +2,000,000.

So, the equation is:

ab(c - 100) -30,000c + 100c² + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can express ab in terms of the other variables.

Since a + b + c = 300, and a + b = 300 - c, then ab can be expressed using the identity:

(ab) = [(a + b)^2 - (a
