Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The problem is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) with a fixed modulus can be represented in polar form. Since the modulus is 4, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). This might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify operations like multiplication and division.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's compute each part step by step.

First part: \( (75 + 117i)z \). Let's compute this.

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Wait, maybe instead of expanding it directly, I can think of \( z \) as having a modulus and argument, which might help in simplifying the expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Another thought: Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), because the modulus squared is 16. So, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

Hmm, that might be useful. Let me write the original expression again:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

Substituting \( \frac{1}{z} \) with \( \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \), this becomes:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)\frac{\overline{z}}{16} \]

Simplify the second term:

\( (96 + 144i)/16 = 6 + 9i \).

So, the expression becomes:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \]

Hmm, okay. Now, since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

So, substituting \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \), the expression becomes:

\[ (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i) \times 4e^{-i\theta} \]

Which simplifies to:

4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + 4*(6 + 9i)e^{-iθ}

Let me factor out the 4:

4[ (75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (6 + 9i)e^{-iθ} ]

Hmm, okay, so the entire expression is 4 times that sum. Now, maybe I can write each term as a complex number multiplied by an exponential, and then combine them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Let me try that.

Let me consider the first term: (75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

I can write this as (75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Multiplying this out:

= 75 cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term is (6 + 9i)e^{-iθ} = (6 + 9i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 6 cosθ - 6i sinθ + 9i cosθ + 9 sinθ.

Now, let's collect real and imaginary parts for both terms.

First term:

Real part: 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ

Imaginary part: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ

Second term:

Real part: 6 cosθ + 9 sinθ

Imaginary part: -6 sinθ + 9 cosθ

So, adding the
