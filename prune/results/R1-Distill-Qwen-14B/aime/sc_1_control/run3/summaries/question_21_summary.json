      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is written as 6 and 3, which sum up to 9, and the square root of 81 is 9. That makes sense. \n\nThe task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base where there are over ten numbers that satisfy the b-eautiful condition.\n\nLet me break down the problem. \n\nFirst, when a number n is written in base b with exactly two digits, that means it can be expressed as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b. So, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c. \n\nBut since n is equal to a*b + c, we can write the equation as sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. \n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives us:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\na*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe I can rearrange it differently or factor it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this as:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a. So, for given values of b and c, we can solve for a. But since a and c are digits in base b, they have constraints. a must be between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this equation in terms of c. Let me see:\n\nFrom the equation a*b + c = (a + c)^2, perhaps I can express it as (a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nBut that might not be helpful. Let me try another approach. Let me denote s = a + c. Then, s = sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c.\n\nSo, s = a + c and n = a*b + c. Therefore, substituting c = s - a into n:\n\nn = a*b + (s - a) = a*(b - 1) + s.\n\nBut since s = sqrt(n), we have:\n\ns = sqrt(a*(b - 1) + s).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ns^2 = a*(b - 1) + s.\n\nRearranged:\n\ns^2 - s = a*(b - 1).\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1).\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide (s^2 - s). \n\nAlso, since c = s - a, and c must be less than b, we have:\n\nc = s - a < b.\n\nBut a is at least 1, so c = s - a \u2264 s - 1.\n\nBut c must be \u2265 0, so s - a \u2265 0 \u2192 a \u2264 s.\n\nSo, a is between 1 and min(b - 1, s).\n\nLet me write down the key points:\n\n1. s = a + c.\n2. n = a*b + c.\n3. s^2 = n = a*b + c.\n4. So, s^2 = a*b + c \u2192 s^2 = a*b + (s - a) \u2192 s^2 = a*(b - 1) + s \u2192 a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\n5. Since a must be integer, (b - 1) must divide (s^2 - s).\n\n6. Also, a must be \u2264 b - 1, so (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For a given base b, we can find all possible s such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, and (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), and a is between 1 and b - 1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b - 1.\n\nWait, but s is the square root of n, and n is a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b^1 and b^2 - 1. Therefore, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1) \u2248 b - 1/(2b). So, s must be at least 1 (since n is positive) and at most b - 1.\n\nWait, but n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. Therefore, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is just less than b, the maximum value of s is less than b. So, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(b - 1).\n\nWait, but s is a positive integer because a and c are digits, so their sum must be integer. Therefore, s is an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\nWait, but n must be a two-digit number, so n is at least b (since the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal). So, sqrt(n) is at least sqrt(b), which is greater than or equal to sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414. So, s starts from 2 because n must be at least b, which is at least 2, so s must be at least 2.\n\nWait, no, because if b is 2, the smallest two-digit number is 10_2 = 2, and sqrt(2) is about 1.414, but s must be an integer. So, s can't be 1 because 1^2=1 < 2. So, for b=2, s must be at least 2. But 2^2=4, which is 100_2, which is a three-digit number, so s=2 is not possible for b=2.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe for each base b, s can only take certain values where s^2 is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nSo, s must satisfy that s^2 is in [b, b^2 - 1].\n\nSo, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since s must be integer, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)). But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b, so floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)) = b - 1.\n\nWait, let's see for b=2: sqrt(2)\u22481.414, so s starts from 2, but s^2 must be \u2264 3 (since b^2 -1=3). So, s=2: 2^2=4 >3, which is invalid. So, for b=2, there are no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for b=3: sqrt(3)\u22481.732, so s starts at 2. s=2: 2^2=4, which is 11_3 (since 1*3 +1=4). So, digits a=1, c=1, sum=2, which equals sqrt(4)=2. So, 4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nSo, in this case, for b=3, s=2 is valid.\n\nWait, so s can be from 2 up to b-1, but s^2 must be less than b^2, which it is because s is at most b-1, so s^2 is at most (b-1)^2 < b^2. So, for each b, s can range from 2 to b-1, but also s^2 must be \u2265 b, because it's a two-digit number in base b.\n\nWait, the two-digit number in base b is from b (10_b) to b^2 -1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So, s^2 must be \u2265 b and \u2264 (b-1)^2.\n\nSo, for each b, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) = b -1.\n\nSo, s can be from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) up to s_max = b -1.\n\nFor each s in this range, we can check whether (b -1) divides s(s -1), which is s^2 -s, because a = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) must be integer.\n\nAnd a must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive.\n\nAlso, c = s -a must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [s_min, s_max] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and a is in [1, b-1], and c = s -a is in [0, b-1].\n\nTherefore, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers, for each b, we can iterate over s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each s, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then compute a and c, ensuring they are within the required ranges.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\n   b. s_max = b -1.\n\n   c. For each s from s_min to s_max:\n\n      i. Check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If not, skip.\n\n      ii. Compute a = (s^2 -s)/(b-1). Check if a is integer, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\n      iii. Compute c = s - a. Check if c is between 0 and b-1.\n\n      iv. If all conditions are met, count this as a b-eautiful number.\n\n   d. After checking all s, if the count is >10, return this b.\n\nSo, let's try to find the minimal b where the count is more than 10.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming. Maybe we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think about the equation a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Since a must be integer, (b -1) must divide s(s-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid s is equal to the number of s in [s_min, s_max] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, (b-1) must divide the product s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) can be written as a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think that (b-1) must be a product of two factors d and e, where d divides s and e divides s-1, and d and e are coprime.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider that for each s, (b-1) divides s(s-1). So, for each s, (b-1) must be a factor of s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, the possible b-1's are the divisors of s(s-1). So, for each s, b-1 can be any divisor of s(s-1), and then b = divisor + 1.\n\nBut in our problem, we're fixing b and varying s. So, for each b, we need to count the number of s where (b-1) divides s(s-1), with s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nAlternatively, we can think of (b-1) as a number, say k = b-1, and we need to count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that k divides s(s-1).\n\nSo, for each k, how many s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] satisfy k | s(s-1).\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so b = k + 1. Then, for each k, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(k+1)) to k.\n\nWe need to count the number of s in this interval where k divides s(s-1).\n\nBut s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, the factors of k must be distributed between s and s-1.\n\nSo, for k to divide s(s-1), since s and s-1 are coprime, k must be the product of two coprime factors d and e, where d divides s and e divides s-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, e = k/d must also be a divisor, and d and e must be coprime. Then, s \u2261 0 mod d, and s \u2261 1 mod e.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for each such pair (d,e), there exists a unique solution modulo k. So, for each such divisor pair, there is a unique s modulo k that satisfies s \u2261 0 mod d and s \u2261 1 mod e.\n\nTherefore, for each such pair (d,e), where d*e = k and gcd(d,e)=1, there is exactly one s in each block of k consecutive integers that satisfies these congruences.\n\nBut in our case, s is in the range [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k]. So, the number of solutions s for each (d,e) pair is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the solution s lies within the interval.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that k divides s(s-1) is equal to the number of valid (d,e) pairs where the corresponding s lies in the interval.\n\nThis seems a bit abstract, but maybe we can find a way to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of k that are \u2264 s_max, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that for each s, the condition k | s(s-1) is equivalent to s \u2261 0 or 1 mod any prime power dividing k.\n\nWait, perhaps another angle: For each k, the number of s in [1, k] where k divides s(s-1) is equal to the number of s where s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod e for each factor pair (d,e) with d*e = k and gcd(d,e)=1.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of solutions s for each k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of s in [1, k] where k divides s(s-1) is equal to the number of divisors of k, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's take some examples to see.\n\nTake k=6 (so b=7). Then, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(7))=3 to 6.\n\nWe need to find s in [3,6] where 6 divides s(s-1).\n\nCheck s=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So yes.\n\ns=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 6. Yes.\n\ns=5: 5*4=20, which is not divisible by 6 (20/6=3.333). No.\n\ns=6: 6*5=30, which is divisible by 6. Yes.\n\nSo, for k=6, s=3,4,6 are valid. So, three s's.\n\nBut let's see how many divisors k=6 has. 6 has four divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\nBut the number of valid s is 3, which is less than the number of divisors.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: k=4 (b=5). s ranges from 2 to 4.\n\nCheck s=2: 2*1=2, which is not divisible by 4. No.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, which is not divisible by 4. No.\n\ns=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 4. Yes.\n\nSo, only s=4 is valid. So, count=1.\n\nBut k=4 has three divisors: 1,2,4.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAnother example: k=8 (b=9). s ranges from 3 to 8.\n\nCheck s=3: 3*2=6, not divisible by 8.\n\ns=4:4*3=12, not divisible by 8.\n\ns=5:5*4=20, 20/8=2.5. No.\n\ns=6:6*5=30, 30/8=3.75. No.\n\ns=7:7*6=42, 42/8=5.25. No.\n\ns=8:8*7=56, 56/8=7. Yes.\n\nSo, only s=8 is valid. Count=1.\n\nBut k=8 has four divisors:1,2,4,8.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for each k, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors d of k such that d \u2264 s_max and (k/d) \u2264 s_max, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of valid s is equal to the number of ways to write k as d*e where d and e are coprime, and s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod e, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k].\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid s for each k is equal to the number of square factors or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. For each k, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] where s(s-1) is divisible by k.\n\nBut s and s-1 are coprime, so k must be a product of two coprime numbers d and e, where d divides s and e divides s-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, where d \u2264 s, and e =k/d, which must divide s-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, check if d \u2264 s_max and e =k/d divides (s -1), where s \u22610 mod d.\n\nBut s must be in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k], so s can be written as s = d * m, where m is an integer.\n\nAnd since s \u2264k, m \u2264 k/d.\n\nAlso, s must be \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)), so d*m \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)).\n\nAdditionally, e =k/d must divide (s -1) = d*m -1.\n\nSo, e | (d*m -1).\n\nWhich implies that d*m \u22611 mod e.\n\nBut e =k/d, so d*m \u22611 mod (k/d).\n\nMultiply both sides by d: m \u2261 d^{-1} mod (k/d).\n\nBut since d and e=k/d are coprime (because s and s-1 are coprime), d has an inverse modulo e.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, where d \u2264 s_max and e=k/d, we can solve for m in:\n\nm \u2261 d^{-1} mod e.\n\nAnd m must satisfy d*m \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)) and m \u2264 k/d.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, we can check if such an m exists in the range.\n\nIf yes, then s =d*m is a solution.\n\nTherefore, for each k, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of k for which there exists an integer m such that:\n\n1. m \u2261 d^{-1} mod (k/d).\n\n2. d*m \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)).\n\n3. m \u2264 k/d.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of k, we can check these conditions.\n\nThis seems manageable, but still a bit involved.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to find a general formula, I can compute for increasing values of k (and thus b=k+1) the number of valid s, and see when it exceeds 10.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, and considering that for smaller b, the count is low, but it increases as b increases, perhaps the minimal b is somewhere in the higher range.\n\nBut to find it, I need to compute for each b starting from 2 upwards, the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula that relates k and the number of solutions.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation k | s(s-1). So, s(s-1) must be a multiple of k. Since s and s-1 are coprime, k must be expressible as a product of two coprime factors, d and e, where d divides s and e divides s-1.\n\nTherefore, for each pair of coprime divisors d and e of k with d*e=k, there exists a unique solution s modulo k to the system:\n\ns \u22610 mod d\n\ns \u22611 mod e\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nSo, for each such pair (d,e), there is exactly one solution s in the range [1,k]. Therefore, the number of solutions s in [1,k] is equal to the number of such coprime divisor pairs (d,e) of k.\n\nBut in our case, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k]. So, the number of valid s is equal to the number of such pairs where the solution s lies in that interval.\n\nSo, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (d,e) of k = b-1 such that the corresponding s lies in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k].\n\nHmm, so the number of such pairs is equal to 2^{number of distinct prime factors of k}.\n\nBecause each prime factor can be assigned to either d or e, but not both, since d and e must be coprime. So, the number of such pairs is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k.\n\nWait, but each pair (d,e) corresponds to a unique way to partition the prime factors of k into d and e. So, if k has t distinct prime factors, the number of such pairs is 2^t.\n\nBut each pair (d,e) gives a unique solution s in [1,k]. So, the total number of solutions s in [1,k] is 2^t.\n\nBut in our case, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k]. So, the number of valid s is equal to the number of such pairs where s \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)).\n\nTherefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (d,e) of k where the corresponding s is \u2265ceil(sqrt(k+1)).\n\nHmm, but this still doesn't directly give me the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors d of k where d \u2264 s and (k/d) divides (s -1), and s is in the required range.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nMaybe it's better to proceed step by step, trying to compute for increasing k and see when the count exceeds 10.\n\nLet me start with k=1 (b=2):\n\nk=1, s ranges from 2 (since sqrt(2)\u22481.414, ceil is 2) to 1. Wait, but s_max=1, which is less than s_min=2. So, no solutions. Count=0.\n\nk=2 (b=3):\n\ns ranges from 2 to 2.\n\nCheck s=2: 2*1=2, which is divisible by 2. So, yes.\n\nCompute a=(4-2)/2=2/2=1.\n\nc=2-1=1.\n\nCheck if a=1 is \u22642 and c=1 \u22642. Yes.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nk=3 (b=4):\n\ns ranges from 2 to 3.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2. 3 doesn't divide 2. No.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6. 3 divides 6. Yes.\n\nCompute a=(9 -3)/3=6/3=2.\n\nc=3-2=1.\n\nCheck a=2 \u22643, c=1 \u22643. Yes.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nk=4 (b=5):\n\ns ranges from 2 to4.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2. 4 doesn't divide 2. No.\n\ns=3:3*2=6. 4 doesn't divide 6. No.\n\ns=4:4*3=12. 4 divides 12. Yes.\n\na=(16-4)/4=12/4=3.\n\nc=4-3=1.\n\nCheck a=3 \u22644, c=1 \u22644. Yes.\n\nCount=1.\n\nk=5 (b=6):\n\ns ranges from 3 to5.\n\ns=3:3*2=6. 5 doesn't divide 6. No.\n\ns=4:4*3=12. 5 doesn't divide 12. No.\n\ns=5:5*4=20. 5 divides 20. Yes.\n\na=(25-5)/5=20/5=4.\n\nc=5-4=1.\n\nCheck a=4 \u22645, c=1 \u22645. Yes.\n\nCount=1.\n\nk=6 (b=7):\n\ns ranges from 3 to6.\n\ns=3:3*2=6. 6 divides 6. Yes.\n\na=(9-3)/6=6/6=1.\n\nc=3-1=2.\n\nCheck a=1 \u22646, c=2 \u22646. Yes.\n\ns=4:4*3=12. 6 divides 12. Yes.\n\na=(16-4)/6=12/6=2.\n\nc=4-2=2.\n\nCheck a=2 \u22646, c=2 \u22646. Yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20. 6 doesn't divide 20. No.\n\ns=6:6*5=30. 6 divides 30. Yes.\n\na=(36-6)/6=30/6=5.\n\nc=6-5=1.\n\nCheck a=5 \u22646, c=1 \u22646. Yes.\n\nSo, s=3,4,6 are valid.
