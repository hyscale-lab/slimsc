Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I should recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides, while the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. I wonder if there's a specific theorem or formula that relates this condition with other properties of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be calculated using the formula: 

OI² = R(R - 2r)

where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that. Yes, I think that's correct. So, plugging in the given values, R is 13 and r is 6.

Calculating OI²: 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 =13. So, OI is sqrt(13). Interesting.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle formed by points I, A, and O should be a right-angled triangle at I. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. That means we can apply the Pythagorean theorem here.

In triangle IOA, (IO)² + (IA)² = (AO)².

Wait, AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A. But in a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is simply the circumradius, right? So, AO is R, which is 13. So, AO is 13.

So, substituting into the Pythagorean theorem:

OI² + IA² = AO²
13 + IA² = 13²
13 + IA² = 169
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Wait, so IA is 2√39. Okay, that's good. Now, IA is the distance from the incenter I to vertex A. I also remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semiperimeter. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

I think I need a formula that relates IA with other elements of the triangle. Let me recall: in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and the inradius.

Wait, yes! The formula for IA is:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Where r is the inradius, and A is the angle at vertex A.

So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39. Therefore,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39

Let me solve for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13

Wait, because 3/√39 can be rationalized as (3√39)/39 = √39 / 13.

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

From this, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (√39/13)² = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169.

Thus, cos(A/2) = √(130)/13.

Okay, now, I think I can relate this to the sides of the triangle. Remember that in a triangle, the product AB * AC is related to the sides and the angles via the formula:

AB * AC = 2R² sin B sin C

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area.

Wait, the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula: (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not be directly helpful here.

Alternatively, another formula for the area is (a b c) / (4 R), where a, b, c are the sides and R is the circumradius.

Hmm, but I don't know the sides yet, so maybe I need another approach.

Wait, let's think about the formula for IA in terms of the sides. There's a formula in triangle geometry that gives the length of IA in terms of the sides and the angles.

Yes! The formula is:

IA = (r) / sin(A/2)

Wait, that's the same as I used earlier. So, I have IA = 2√39, which gives me sin(A/2) = 3/√39.

So, from here, perhaps I can find cos A, since cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2). Wait, no, cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2).

Wait, cos A = 1 - 2*( (√39
