Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here, but maybe it'll come into play later.

The product given is over all k from 0 to 12. So for each k, we're evaluating the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Wait, but when k=0, what happens? Let me compute that first.

When k=0, ω^0 = 1. So the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term in the product is 1. That might not complicate things too much. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can focus on the terms where k ranges from 1 to 12 instead.

Now, let's look at the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form. Let me see if that's possible.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, z will be another root, specifically ω^k for k=1,2,...,12. So z is a primitive 13th root of unity as well, except when k is a multiple of 13, but since k goes up to 12, z ≠ 1.

So substituting z into the expression, we have 2 - 2z + z². Let me write that as z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, can this quadratic be factored? Let's compute its discriminant: D = (−2)² − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are z = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

But I'm not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate this polynomial to cyclotomic polynomials or minimal polynomials. Let me think.

Wait, 1 + i is a Gaussian integer. Its minimal polynomial over the integers is z² - 2z + 2, which is exactly the quadratic we're dealing with. So that expression is the minimal polynomial for 1 + i, evaluated at z = ω^k.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as the product over all non-trivial 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2). Wait, but z runs over all the roots except 1, since k goes from 1 to 12.

So, the product from k=1 to 12 of (z² - 2z + 2) where z = ω^k. So, the product becomes the product over all roots z ≠ 1 of (z² - 2z + 2
