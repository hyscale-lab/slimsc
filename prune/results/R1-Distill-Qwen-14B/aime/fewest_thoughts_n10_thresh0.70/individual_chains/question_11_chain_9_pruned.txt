Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \), if \( |z| = r \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{r^2} \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( |z|^2 = 16 \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). Maybe that can help simplify the expression.

Let me write \( z \) in its polar form since dealing with modulus and arguments might be easier that way. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Then, \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \), which would make \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{4e^{-i\theta}}{16} = \frac{e^{-i\theta}}{4} \).

Substituting \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) into the original expression, I get:

\[ (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]

Let me compute each term separately. 

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \). Let's factor out the 4:

\( 4(75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} \). Calculate 4*(75 + 117i):

75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468, so first term becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Let's compute \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \):

96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so it's \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So the entire expression is:

\[ (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as a sum of complex exponentials and then find the real part.

Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). So the expression becomes \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

I remember that for complex numbers, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \) and similar for sine terms. But in this case, the coefficients A and B are different. I think I can express this as a combination of sine and cosine terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can write \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \) as \( C e^{i\theta} + C^* e^{-i\theta} \) where C is some complex number, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach: let me write both terms in terms of cosine and sine. So:

\( A e^{i\theta} = A (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)  
\( B e^{-i\theta} = B (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Adding them together:

\( (A + B)\cos\theta + i(A - B)\sin\theta \)

But since the original expression is complex, the real part will be the real components of this sum.

Wait, actually, let's compute the real part of the entire expression. Let me separate real and imaginary parts.

First, compute \( A e^{i\theta} \):

Real part: \( \text{Re}(A) \cos\theta - \text{Im}(A) \sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( \text{Re}(A)
