Okay, let's try to figure out this probability problem. So, we have a regular octagon, and each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. We need to find the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa for the red ones.

Hmm, wait, so if we rotate the octagon, we want the set of blue vertices to exactly match the set of red vertices after the rotation. That means the coloring must be symmetric in a way that allows such a rotation.

First, let me think about the symmetries of a regular octagon. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, and it will look the same. So, the rotation that maps the octagon onto itself can be any multiple of 45°, right?

But in this problem, we're looking for a rotation that swaps the blue and red vertices. So, if after rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red, and every red vertex moves to a position that was originally blue.

Wait, so the coloring must be such that there's a rotation that maps the blue set to the red set. That is, the blue and red colorings are rotations of each other. So, the colorings are related by a rotation. So, the colorings must be in the same orbit under the rotation group.

But how do we count the number of such colorings?

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a group action. The rotation group of the octagon is the cyclic group C8. So, the group acts on the set of colorings. We want colorings fixed by some nontrivial element of the group, but wait, no, actually, we want colorings where the blue set is mapped to the red set by some rotation. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Burnside's lemma or something similar.

Wait, but Burnside's lemma is for counting orbits, but here we're counting colorings that are in the same orbit under the group action. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as follows: for a
