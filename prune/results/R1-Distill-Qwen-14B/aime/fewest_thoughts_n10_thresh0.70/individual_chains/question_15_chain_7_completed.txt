Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right typically involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, I think that means we have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. That makes sense because 8+8=16 steps in total.

Now, the problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. I need to figure out what that means. Changing direction in this context would mean switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time the direction changes, the path alternates between R and U.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. For example, if I have RRUUURRRUU, that's three runs: R, U, R, U. Wait, no, actually, each change in direction starts a new run. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Because each run after the first is started by a direction change.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. If a path starts with R, then each time it switches to U, that's a direction change. Then switching back to R is another direction change, and so on. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the move switches from R to U or U to R.

But how does that relate to the number of runs? If a path has k runs, then it must have changed direction (k-1) times. Because each run after the first is a new direction, which implies a direction change. So, for example, a path with 2 runs (all R's followed by all U's) changes direction once. A path with 3 runs (R, U, R) changes direction twice, and so on.

So in this problem, since the number of direction changes is four, that means the number of runs is five. Because 4 direction changes mean 5 runs. So, the path will switch direction four times, meaning it has five runs. Got it.

So, now I need to count the number of paths with exactly five runs, starting with either R or U, and totaling 16 steps, with 8 R's and 8 U's.

Wait, but the starting direction isn't specified, so I have to consider both possibilities: starting with R or starting with U.

So, first, let's consider the case where the path starts with R. Then, the runs will alternate between R and U. Since there are five runs, the starting direction will determine the sequence. So, starting with R, the runs will be R, U, R, U, R. Alternatively, starting with U, the runs will be U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but the total number of runs is five, so in the first case, starting with R, the number of R runs is three, and U runs is two. While starting with U, the number of U runs is three, and R runs is two. Hmm, because five runs alternating between R and U: starting with R, the number of R runs is (5+1)/2=3, and U runs is 2. Similarly, starting with U, it's the opposite.

But wait, the total number of R's is 8, and U's is 8. So, when starting with R, the number of R runs is 3, and U runs is 2. Each R run must have at least one R, and similarly for U runs. So, the problem reduces to distributing the 8 R's into 3 runs and 8 U's into 2 runs.

Similarly, if starting with U, we distribute 8 U's into 3 runs and 8 R's into 2 runs.

So, the total number of such paths is the number of ways to distribute the R's into 3 runs plus the number of ways to distribute the U's into 3 runs, but wait, no, it's actually the sum of two separate cases: starting with R and starting with U.

Wait, actually, more precisely, let me define:

Case 1: Starts with R, has 5 runs (R, U, R, U, R). So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Case 2: Starts with U, has 5 runs (U, R, U, R, U). So, 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So for each case, we need to compute the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's into the respective number of runs and the 8 U's into their respective number of runs.

In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n indistinct items into k distinct boxes, each with at least one item, is given by the stars and bars theorem. The formula is (n-1 choose k-1). So, for distributing R's into runs, it's (n-1 choose k-1), where n is the number of R's and k is the number of runs.

So, for Case 1: Starting with R.

Number of ways to distribute R's: We have 3 runs of R's, each with at least 1 R. So, the number of ways is (8-1 choose 3-1) = (7 choose 2). Similarly, for U's, we have 2 runs, each with at least 1 U, so (8-1 choose 2-1) = (7 choose 1). So the total number of paths in Case 1 is (7 choose 2) * (7 choose 1).

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U.

Number of ways to distribute U's: 3 runs, each with at least 1 U. So, (8-1 choose 3-1) = (7 choose 2). And for R's, 2 runs, each with at least 1 R: (8-1 choose 2-1) = (7 choose 1). So total paths in Case 2 are also (7 choose 2) * (7 choose 1).

Therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * [ (7 choose 2) * (7 choose 1) ].

Wait, let me compute that.

(7 choose 2) is 21, and (7 choose 1) is 7. So 21 * 7 = 147. Then, 2 * 147 = 294.

So, the total number of such paths is 294.

Wait a second, is that the correct approach? Let me double-check. Because I'm assuming that each direction change is accounted for by switching between R and U runs, and the number of runs is five. So, for each starting direction, we have a certain number of ways to distribute the steps into runs.

I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 294.

But wait, just to make sure, let's think about a small example to see if this approach works.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid. Paths from lower left to upper right: need to make 2 R's and 2 U's, total of 4 steps.

How many paths change direction exactly two times?

Wait, let me see. Changing direction exactly two times would mean three runs. So, starting with R: R, U, R. Or starting with U: U, R, U.

Case 1: Starting with R, so 2 R runs and 1 U run. Wait, no: three runs, so starting with R, the runs are R, U, R. So, 2 R runs and 1 U run.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, to have three runs, you must have, for example, RRUU would be two runs, but RRURUU would be longer. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, you can't have three runs because you only have 2 R's and 2 U's.

Wait, perhaps a 2x2 grid isn't the best example. Let's take a 1x1 grid. Wait, that's trivial. Maybe a 3x3 grid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of a problem with known counts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula.

The general formula for the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k direction changes is given by something like 2 * (sum over runs) with combinations.

Wait, but perhaps I should refer back to the approach I took.

In any case, using the stars and bars method, the number of ways to distribute the steps into runs is correct.

So, I think the answer is 294.


To solve the problem, we consider paths on an $8 \times 8$ grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 steps. The goal is to count paths that change direction exactly four times.

A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. If a path changes direction four times, it has five runs of consecutive R's or U's. These runs alternate between R and U, starting with either R or U. 

### Case 1: Starting with R
- The runs are R, U, R, U, R (3 R runs and 2 U runs).
- Distribute 8 R's into 3 runs: $\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways.
- Distribute 8 U's into 2 runs: $\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7$ ways.
- Total paths for this case: $21 \times 7 = 147$.

### Case 2: Starting with U
- The runs are U, R, U, R, U (3 U runs and 2 R runs).
- Distribute 8 U's into 3 runs: $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways.
- Distribute 8 R's into 2 runs: $\binom{7}{1} = 7$ ways.
- Total paths for this case: $21 \times 7 = 147$.

### Total Paths
Summing both cases gives $147 + 147 = 294$ paths.

The final answer is $\boxed{294}$.
