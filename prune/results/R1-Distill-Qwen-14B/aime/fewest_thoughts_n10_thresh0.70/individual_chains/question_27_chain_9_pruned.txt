Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the torus T has a radius of 3 for the circle being revolved, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, the big circle (the path) has a radius of 6, and the tube around it has a radius of 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem is about the torus resting inside and outside the sphere and the circles where they are tangent. When T is inside S, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is sitting inside it, touching along a circle. The same when it's outside, but the torus is bigger relative to the sphere.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the sphere has radius 11, the torus's tube radius is 3, and the distance from the center to the axis is 6. So the sphere is pretty big compared to the torus.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, their normals must be aligned at the point of tangency. So, perhaps we can model the torus and sphere as surfaces in 3D space and find their points of tangency.

Let me think about the equations of the torus and the sphere.

The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with the z-axis as the axis of revolution, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis (6 in this case), and r is the radius of the generating circle (3 here). So plugging in:

(√(x² + y²) -
