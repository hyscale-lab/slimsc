Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, it's like a donut shape where the tube has a radius of 3, and the center of the tube is 6 units away from the axis.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i. And when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should probably recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, the major radius R would be 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

Wait, but actually, the major radius is the distance from the axis of revolution to the center of the generating circle. Since the generating circle has a radius of 3 and is revolved around an axis 6 units away from its center, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, the torus is a standard donut with R=6 and r=3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere internally. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching externally. The lines of tangency are circles on both the torus and the sphere. The radii of these circles on the sphere are r_i and r_o respectively. I need to find these two radii.

I think I need to consider the geometry of tangency between the sphere and the torus. Let me think about both cases: internal and external tangency.

First, internal tangency: the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. The sphere has radius 11, so the center of the sphere is at some point, and the torus is placed such that it's just touching the sphere from the inside.

Similarly, for external tangency: the torus is outside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Here, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch at a single circle.

I need to find the radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere in both cases.

Wait a second, maybe I should model this in 3D coordinates. Let's place the torus and the sphere in a coordinate system such that their centers align along the z-axis. For the internal tangency case, the center of the sphere is at the origin, and the torus is centered at (0,0, d), where d is some distance from the sphere's center. But wait, since they are tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on internal or external.

Wait, but the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is a surface, not a solid. So, the torus itself doesn't have a radius; it's a surface with major radius 6 and minor radius 3. Hmm, maybe I need to find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center, such that the sphere and the torus are tangent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the points where the sphere and torus touch. At the point of tangency, their tangent planes are the same, so their normals are colinear. That might be a way to approach it.

Let me think about the equations of the sphere and the torus.

The sphere is straightforward: x² + y² + z
