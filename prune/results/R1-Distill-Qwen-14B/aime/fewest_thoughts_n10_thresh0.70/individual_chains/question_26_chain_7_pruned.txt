Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to express AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's start by drawing a rough sketch based on the Asymptote code. So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, forming the point from which AD is drawn, intersecting ω again at P.

I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle from a common external point, the lengths are equal. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're tangents from D to ω. That might be useful later.

I also recall that power of a point could be helpful here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² or DC². Since D lies outside the circle, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA. So, DP * DA = DB². Hmm, that might help relate AP and DP.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let's think. The power of point D with respect to ω is indeed equal to DB², and since AD intersects ω at P, the power is also equal to DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA. Therefore, DP = DB² / DA. But I don't know DB or DA yet.

Hmm, maybe I can find DA first. If I can find DA, and then compute DB, I can find DP, and then since AP = AD - DP, I can find AP.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles or something else.

Wait, let's see. Since ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10, I can compute some of its properties, like its circumradius. Maybe that will help.

Let me compute the semi-perimeter first. s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area of ABC is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, but 504 is 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504, yes. Maybe it's better to write it as 504 = 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 4*126 = 4*9*14 = 4*9*2*7 = 8*9*7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, because sqrt(8) is 2√2, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(7) is √7. So 2*3 = 6, and √2*√7 = √14. So yes, area is 6√14.

So area = 6√14.

Then, the circumradius R can be found using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). So, a=5, b=9, c=10. So, R = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Then, rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = 75√14 / 56.

Hmm, okay. Now, what else? Maybe we can find the coordinates of the points by coordinate geometry. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of harmonic division or projective geometry. But perhaps using coordinates would be more straightforward.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10 units. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find the coordinates of point B.

Given AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, point A is at (10,0), point C is at (0,0). Let point B be at (x,y). Then, the distance from A to B is 5, so sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] = 5. Distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt[x^2 + y^2] = 9.

So, we have two equations:

1. (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25
2. x^2 + y^2 = 81

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

x^2 + y^2 - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25

Simplify:

x^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56

x^2 - x^2 + 20x - 100 = 56

20x - 100 = 56

20x = 156

x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8

So, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, substitute back into equation 2: x^2 + y^2 = 81.

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81

(1521/25) + y^2 = 81

y^2 = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25) - (1521/25) = (504)/25

Thus, y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5, but as before, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is messy. Let me factor 504: 504 = 16 * 31.5. Wait, no, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, which is not integer. Let me factor differently.

504: divide by 2, get 252. Again by 2, 126. Again by 2, 63. Then 63=7*9=7*3². So, 504=2³ * 3² * 7. So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So, y = (6√14)/5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A: (10,0)

B: (39/5, 6√14/5)

C: (0,0)

Okay, now, point D is the intersection of the tangents to ω at B and C. So, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C, then find their intersection point D.

First, the equation of the tangent at a point on a circle. The general equation is that the tangent at point (x1, y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r². Wait, no. Wait, the standard equation for the tangent line at (x1, y1) on a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r^2.

Wait, no, that's actually the equation for the tangent line if (x1, y1) is on the circle. Let me double-check. Alternatively, it's (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = 0, but that's the equation for the tangent line if (x1, y1) is the
