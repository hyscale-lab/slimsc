Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram or the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's one thing everyone has. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Now, the tricky part: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four—so the candy hearts plus the other three items. Let me write down what I know.

Total residents: 900.

Owners of each item:
- Diamond rings (D): 195
- Golf clubs (G): 367
- Garden spades (S): 562
- Candy hearts (C): 900 (since every resident owns this)

People owning exactly two things: 437
People owning exactly three things: 234

We need to find the number of people owning all four, which is C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S.

Wait, but in inclusion-exclusion, the formula usually involves the sum of individual sets, subtracting the pairwise intersections, adding the triple intersections, and so on. But here, we have information about exactly two and exactly three. I need to connect these pieces.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:

|C ∪ D ∪ G ∪ S| = |C| + |D| + |G| + |S| - |C∩D| - |C∩G| - |C∩S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |C∩D∩G| + |C∩D∩S| + |D∩G∩S| - |C∩D∩G∩S|

But wait, in this problem, every resident owns at least the candy hearts. So C is the universal set here. That means
