Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially when their modulus is given, it's often helpful to express them in polar form. So, if |z| = 4, then I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier to handle, especially because we'll be dealing with powers and reciprocals.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form is just the reciprocal of the modulus and the negative of the argument.

Now, let's substitute these into the original expression. The first term is (75 + 117i)z. Plugging in z as 4e^{iθ}, this becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}. Let me compute the scalar multiplication first: 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So, that term simplifies to (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

The second term is (96 + 144i)/z, which, with z = 4e^{iθ}, becomes (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let's compute that scalar multiplication: 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So, this term simplifies to (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Putting it all together, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, to find the real part of this expression, I can expand each term using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me handle each term separately. Starting with the first term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Multiplying this out:

300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 is -1, that last term becomes -468 sinθ. So, combining like terms, the real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ, and the imaginary part is (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Similarly, for the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ). Let's expand this:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ. Combining like terms, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ, and the imaginary part is (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, adding the two expressions together, the total real part Re is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24)cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly, the imaginary part is (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since the problem asks for the real part, we can focus on Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, where θ is a real number (since z can be any complex number with |z|=4, θ can be any angle).

I recall that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ) or C sin(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude, given by sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is then C.

Wait, in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, A is 324 and B is -432. So, the maximum value of Re is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2: 324 is 18^2 * 1 (since 18^2 is 324). Wait, 18^2 is 324, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Alternatively, 324 * 324. Let me calculate it step by step.

324 * 324:

Calculate 300*300 = 90000
300*24 = 7200
24*300 = 7200
24*24 = 576
So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400, plus 576 is 104976.

Similarly, (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let me compute 432^2.

432^2: 400^2 = 160000, 2*400*32 = 2*12800 = 25600, 32^2 = 1024. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2 = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 +25600 = 185600, plus 1024 is 186624.

So, 324^2 = 104976 and 432^2 = 186624.

So, sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600). Hmm, what is sqrt(291600)?

Well, 500^2 is 250000, 540^2 is 291600 because 54^2 is 2916, so 540^2 is 291600. Therefore, the maximum value is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. The maximum of this is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Wait, is that correct? Because I remember that for A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, even if B is negative, the square removes the sign, so yes, it's correct.

So, sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540. So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. The expression is Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, the amplitude is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2), which is 540. So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

So, the answer is 540.

But just to make sure, let me see if I can represent Re in another way. Let's factor out 108 from 324 and 432.

324 ÷ 108 = 3, 432 ÷ 108 = 4. So, Re = 108*(3 cosθ - 4 sinθ). Then, 3 cosθ -4 sinθ can be expressed as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(3^2 +4^2)=5. So, Re = 108*5 cos(θ + φ) = 540 cos(θ + φ). The maximum value of this is 540, as the cosine function has a maximum of 1. So, that confirms it.

Yep, so the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Expanding each term using Euler's formula and combining like terms, the real part of the expression is found to be:

\[
\text{Re} = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of this expression, we recognize it as a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value of \(A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Calculating this for \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\), we get:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\boxed{540}
