Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there can be a lot of symmetry that helps in counting such shapes.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's also convex, so all the vertices point outward. Now, the problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, a rectangle here would be formed by connecting four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that the sides of the rectangle are either edges or diagonals of the polygon.

Wait, but not every four points will form a rectangle. Rectangles require that the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, how do such rectangles form? I think it's related to the concept of diameters and axes of symmetry.

Regular dodecagons have a lot of symmetry. There are multiple lines of symmetry, each passing through opposite vertices or midpoints of opposite sides. These lines might be useful in forming rectangles because they can serve as the diagonals of the rectangles.

Let me think about how rectangles form in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, say 2n sides, a rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices that lie on perpendicular axes of symmetry. For example, in a square (4-gon), the only rectangle is the square itself, formed by its four vertices. In a regular hexagon (6-gon), I believe you can form rectangles by selecting every other vertex in a certain way.

But wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, but when you connect every other vertex, you get a equilateral triangle, not a rectangle. So maybe rectangles in regular polygons are more specific.

Wait, perhaps in a regular dodecagon, which has 12 sides, the regularity and the number of sides allow for more rectangles. Let me consider smaller regular polygons to see if I can find a pattern.

Take a square (4-gon). How many rectangles can you form? Only one, which is the square itself. So that's 1.

In a regular hexagon (6-gon), I'm not sure if rectangles can be formed. Let me think. If I take two opposite sides, but wait, in a regular hexagon, the opposite sides are separated by two edges. So, if I connect vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., but wait, that's a triangle. Alternatively, maybe taking two pairs of opposite vertices: for example, vertices 1, 2, 4, 5. But that would form a quadrilateral, but is it a rectangle?

Wait, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices is twice the length of the side times sin(60°), but if I connect vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, it forms a regular triangle. But if I connect 1, 2, 4, 5, that's a trapezoid, not a rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe if I connect vertices that are two apart, but I'm getting confused. Maybe the regular hexagon doesn't have rectangles except when considering non-adjacent vertices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of central angles. In a regular polygon with 12 sides, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/12=30 degrees. So each vertex is 30 degrees apart around the center.

If a rectangle is to be formed by four vertices, the central angles between each pair of adjacent vertices in the rectangle should correspond to the sides and diagonals of the rectangle. For a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and the angles between sides should be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in the polygon, the central angles between the vertices can't be 90 degrees because 30 degrees is the base. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon, and their corresponding central angles add up to 180 degrees, making them perpendicular?

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the sides of the rectangle correspond to chords that are perpendicular in the polygon. So, if two chords are perpendicular, their corresponding central angles add up to 90 degrees. Wait, but 30 degrees is the unit, so 90 degrees would be three steps around the polygon. Hmm, maybe that's a way.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the rectangle is determined by a certain step between vertices. For example, in a dodecagon, each side is a step of 1, and a diagonal might be a step of 2, 3, etc., up to 5 before it starts repeating (since step n is the same as step 12-n in a 12-gon).

So, in a regular dodecagon, the possible step sizes between vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then 6, but step 6 would be the diameter, directly opposite.

Now, for a rectangle, we need four vertices such that the sides are either sides or diagonals, and the angles are 90 degrees. So, perhaps each rectangle is determined by two different step sizes, and the corresponding chords are perpendicular.

Let me think: if I take two different step sizes, say 'a' and 'b', such that the chords corresponding to these steps are perpendicular. Then, the four vertices would form a rectangle.

Wait, but how do we determine if two chords are perpendicular? The central angles corresponding to the chords should add up to 90 degrees. Let me think again.

The central angle for a step 'a' is 30a degrees. For two chords to be perpendicular, the sum of their central angles should be 90 degrees. So, 30a + 30b = 90 → a + b = 3. So, a and b must be two integers that add
