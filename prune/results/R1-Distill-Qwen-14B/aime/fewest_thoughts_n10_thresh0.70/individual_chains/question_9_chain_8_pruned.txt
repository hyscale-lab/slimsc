Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let's write down what we know. The two logarithmic equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe that can help here. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = (ln a)/(ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm.

So, applying that to the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = (ln y^x)/(ln x) = 10

Simplify y^x: that's y raised to the power of x, so when taking the natural log, that becomes x * ln y. So the numerator is x * ln y.

So now, the equation becomes:

(x * ln y) / (ln x) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Again, using the change of base formula, that's (ln x^{4y}) / (ln y) = 10

Simplify x^{4y}: that's x raised to the 4y power, so ln x^{4y} = 4y * ln x.

So the equation becomes:

(4y * ln x) / (ln y) = 10

Now I have two equations:

1. (x * ln y) / (ln x) = 10
2. (4y * ln x) / (ln y) = 10

Hmm, let me denote these equations as Equation (1) and Equation (2) respectively.

Let me see if I can relate these two equations to eliminate some variables.

From Equation (1), I can write:

x * ln y = 10 * ln x
=> x = (10 * ln x) / (ln y)    [Equation 1a]

Similarly, from Equation (2):

4y * ln x = 10 * ln y
=> 4y = (10 * ln y) / (ln x)
=> y = (10 * ln y) / (4 * ln x)
=> y = (5 * ln y) / (2 * ln x)  [Equation 2a]

Hmm, so from Equation 1a, x is expressed in terms of ln x and ln y. From Equation 2a, y is expressed similarly. Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

Let me express both x and y in terms of (ln x) and (ln y). Let me denote:

Letâ€™s set a = ln x and b = ln y. Since x and y are greater than 1, a and b are positive real numbers.

So, a = ln x, b = ln y.

Then, from Equation (1a):

x = (10a)/b

Wait, because x = (10 * ln x)/(ln y) = (10a)/b.

Similarly, from Equation (2a):

y = (5b)/(2a)

So now, we have expressions for x and y in terms of a and b.

But wait, a is ln x and b is ln y.

So, let's write:

x = e^{a} because a = ln x.

Similarly, y = e^{b}.

So, substituting x and y in terms of a and b into the expressions from Equation 1a and 2a:

From Equation 1a:

x = (10a)/b => e^{a} = (10a)/b

From Equation 2a:

y = (5b)/(2a) => e^{b} = (5b)/(2a)

So now, we have two equations:

1. e^{a} = (10a)/b   [Equation 3]
2. e^{b} = (5b)/(2a) [Equation 4]

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between a and b.

Let me try to express b from Equation 3 and substitute into Equation 4.

From Equation 3:

b = (10a)/e^{a}

Substitute this into Equation 4:

e^{b} = (5b)/(2a)

But b is (10a)/e^{a}, so substitute that in:

e^{b} = [5*(10a/e^{a})]/(2a) = [50a / e^{a}]/(2a) = (50a)/(2a e^{a}) ) = 25/(e^{a})

So now, the equation becomes:

e^{b} = 25 / e^{a}

I can write e^{b} = 25 e^{-a}

But since b = (10a)/e^{a}, let's substitute that into the left side:

e^{(10a)/e^{a}} = 25 e^{-a}

Hmm, this looks tricky. Perhaps taking the natural logarithm of both sides could help.

Taking ln on both sides:

(10a)/e^{a} = ln(25) - a

So, (10a)/e^{a}
