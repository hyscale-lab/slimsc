Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. I need to maximize the real part of this expression. Let me break it down.

First, since z is a complex number with |z|=4, I can represent z in polar form. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of θ and maybe use trigonometric identities.

But wait, the expression involves both z and 1/z. Since |z|=4, then |1/z|=1/4. So 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So that could be useful.

So let me rewrite the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ})).

Let me compute each term separately. Let's compute (75 + 117i) first. Maybe it would be helpful to factor this complex number to see if it can be expressed in terms of magnitude and angle. So, 75 + 117i.

The magnitude is sqrt(75^2 + 117^2). Let's compute that:

75^2 = 5625
117^2 = 13689

So sum is 5625 + 13689 = 19314. Sqrt(19314). Let me see, 139^2 is 19321, which is just a bit more than 19314, so sqrt(19314) is approximately 139 but a little less. Wait, maybe 139^2 is 19321, so sqrt(19314) is 139 - (7/278) approximately, using linear approximation. But maybe it's exact? Wait, 75 and 117, do they have a common factor? 75 is 25*3, 117 is 13*9, so 3 is a common factor. So 75 = 3*25, 117=3*39. So 3*(25 + 39i). Hmm, that's a factor of 3. So 75 + 117i = 3*(25 + 39i). Maybe 25 + 39i is a familiar number? Let me see.

25^2 + 39^2 is 62
