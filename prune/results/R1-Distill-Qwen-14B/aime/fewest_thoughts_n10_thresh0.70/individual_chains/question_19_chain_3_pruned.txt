Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand everything.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. First, let's recall some important properties and formulas related to triangle centers and radii.

The circumradius R is given as 13. The inradius r is 6. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, IA ⊥ OI. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods here, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about what IA is. IA is the line from the incenter I to vertex A. And OI is the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular.

Wait, maybe using vectors could help here. Let me try that approach.

Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system. Maybe place point I at the origin to simplify things? Or perhaps place O somewhere else. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use barycentric coordinates, but that might get complicated.

Wait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance between the incenter I and the circumcenter O is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, I remember that formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr. So plugging in R=13 and r=6, we get:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, that's interesting.

So, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. That means triangle OIA is a right triangle at I. So, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras theorem:

OA² = OI² + IA²

But wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So,

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, IA = 2*sqrt(39). That's the length from incenter I to vertex A.

Hmm, I also remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using another formula. Let me recall. I think it's IA = r / sin(A/2). Wait,
