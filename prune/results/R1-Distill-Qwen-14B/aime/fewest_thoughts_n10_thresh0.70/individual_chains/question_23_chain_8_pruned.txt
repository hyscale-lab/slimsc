Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I remember that a hyperbola is a type of conic section, and a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal. The problem says that points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, so BD is one of the diagonals, and we're looking for an upper bound on BD squared.

First, let me visualize this. The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening horizontally because the positive term is with x². The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, points A and C are on one diagonal, and B and D are on the other.

Wait, no. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the origin is the intersection point, then the coordinates of the opposite vertices are negatives of each other. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and similarly for B and D.

So, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. Let me write the hyperbola equation again:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for any point on this hyperbola, its coordinates (x, y) satisfy that equation.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the lengths of the sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Also, the area of the rhombus can be expressed as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

But maybe I don't need the area right now. Let me think about the properties of the rhombus. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals. So, if I denote the coordinates of the points, let's say A is (p, q), B is (r, s), C is (-p, -q), and D is (-r, -s). So, A and C are opposites, and B and D are opposites.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1. Let me define the diagonals. The diagonals are AC and BD. Diagonal AC connects A(p, q) to C(-p, -q), so it's the line from (p, q) to (-p, -q). The slope of AC is ( -q - q ) / ( -p - p ) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.

Similarly, diagonal BD connects B(r, s) to D(-r, -s), so the slope is (-s - s)/(-r - r) = (-2s)/(-2r) = s/r.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So,

(q/p) * (s/r) = -1.

Which means (q*s)/(p*r) = -1 => q*s = -p*r.

That's one condition.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.

Let me write the distance formulas.

Distance AB: sqrt[(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2]

Distance BC: sqrt[(-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2]

Distance CD: sqrt[(-r + p)^2 + (-s + q)^2]

Distance DA: sqrt[(p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2]

Wait, but in a rhombus, all these distances are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

Alternatively, since all sides are equal, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.

But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola.

Wait, another thought: since A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, for point A: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1, similarly for B: r²/20 - s²/24 = 1, and same for C and D.

But since C is (-p, -q), plugging into the hyperbola equation:

(-p)^2 /20 - (-q)^2 /24 = p²/20 - q²/24 = 1, which is the same as for A.

Same for D: (-r)^2 /20 - (-s)^2 /24 = r²/20 - s²/24 = 1, same as for B.

So, all four points satisfy the same hyperbola equation.

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. The lengths of the diagonals are AC and BD.

Wait, but the question is about BD^2. So, I need to find BD², which is the square of the distance between B and D.

But since B is (r, s) and D is (-r, -s), the distance BD is sqrt[( -r - r )^2 + ( -s - s )^2] = sqrt[(-2r)^2 + (-2s)^2] = sqrt[4r² + 4s²] = 2*sqrt(r² + s²).

Therefore, BD² is (2*sqrt(r² + s²))² = 4(r² + s²).

So, BD² = 4(r² + s²). So, we need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

So, essentially, we need to find the supremum (least upper bound) of 4(r² + s²) over all such rhombi. But since it's a hyperbola, which extends to infinity, perhaps BD² can be made arbitrarily large. But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Wait, so maybe BD² is bounded above, and we need the supremum.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood. Maybe BD² has a maximum value, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that maximum, but the wording is confusing.

Wait, no, the wording says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the infimum of the upper bounds of BD². Wait, but if BD² can be arbitrarily large, then any number would be less than BD² for all rhombi, which doesn
