Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I guess makes sense because moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. The question is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, changing direction exactly four times. Let me think about what that means. Each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, if you start by moving right, the first direction change would be to up, then maybe right again, and so on.

Wait, but the problem says "change direction exactly four times." So, does that mean that the path alternates direction four times? Or does it mean that there are four points where the direction changes? I think it refers to the number of times the direction switches. For example, a path that goes right, then up, then right, then up, and so on would change direction multiple times. Each switch from right to up or up to right counts as a direction change.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that break down? Let's see. Let's consider that the path starts with either a right move or an up move. Let's say it starts with right. Then, each direction change would alternate between up and right. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment.

Wait, let me clarify: the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So if you have four direction changes, you have five segments. Each segment is a consecutive series of moves in the same direction.

But for an 8x8 grid, each path must consist of exactly 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So, the total number of moves is 16. If a path has five segments, then these segments are alternately right and up moves. So, if it starts with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. Or, if it starts with up, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up.

Wait, but each time you change direction, you switch, so starting with right, four direction changes would give
