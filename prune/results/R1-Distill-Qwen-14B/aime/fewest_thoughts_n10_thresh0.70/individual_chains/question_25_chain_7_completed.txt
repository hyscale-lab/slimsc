Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it. There are 900 residents in total.

The problem says that 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. Wait, so candy hearts are universal—everybody has them. That might be important.

Then it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. Hmm, this seems like a problem that involves sets and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let me recall, the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. But since we have information about exactly two and exactly three, I think I'll need to break it down differently.

First, let's list out all the things:

1. Diamond ring (D) - 195
2. Golf clubs (G) - 367
3. Garden spade (S) - 562
4. Candy hearts (C) - everyone, so 900.

Each resident owns at least one of these, but wait, no, actually, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. So, everyone has C. So, the total number is 900.

The residents can own one, two, three, or all four of these items. But the problem gives us specific numbers:

- Exactly two: 437
- Exactly three: 234
- We need to find exactly four.

So, let's think about how to model this. Maybe using the principle for four sets. I remember that the formula for the union of four sets is a bit complex, but here, since we know exactly how many are in exactly two, exactly three, and we know the total, maybe we can find the overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the sum of individual sets, the sum of their pairwise intersections, etc., to the total.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the total number of items owned. Each resident owns at least one, but since some have multiple, the total number of items is more than 900.

Wait, but the problem is about ownership counts. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using the principle for exactly two and exactly three overlaps.

Let me define:

Let me denote the number of people who own exactly four items as x. That's what we're trying to find.

We know that:

- Number owning exactly two: 437
- Number owning exactly three: 234
- Number owning exactly four: x
- The rest own exactly one item.

Wait, but since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, which is one item. But some might own more. So, the number of people owning exactly one item would be 900 minus those who own two, three, four.

So, exactly one: 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 -x = 229 - x.

Wait, but that can't be right because 437 + 234 is 671, plus x, so 900 - 671 -x = 229 -x.

Wait, but 229 -x could be negative if x is more than 229, which can't happen since x can't be more than the smallest set, which is 195. Hmm, that might be a problem. Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let me think, the total ownerships (counting each item a person owns) would be the sum of all the individual counts.

But wait, each resident has at least one item, but some have multiple. So, the total number of ownerships is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set.

But wait, the problem gives the counts for each set:

- D:195, G:367, S:562, and C:900.

So, the total number of ownerships is 195 + 367 + 562 + 900. Let me calculate that.

195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024. So, total ownerships = 2024.

But each resident contributes 1 to the total ownerships for each item they own. So, the total ownerships is also equal to the sum over all residents of the number of items they own.

Let me denote:

- Let a = number of residents who own exactly 1 item.
- b = exactly 2 items (437)
- c = exactly 3 items (234)
- d = exactly 4 items (x, which we need to find)

So, total residents: a + b + c + d = 900.

Total ownerships: a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4 = 2024.

We can write:

a + 437 + 234 + x = 900 → a = 900 - 437 -234 -x = 900 - 671 -x = 229 - x.

Now, the total ownerships equation:

a*1 + b*2 + c*3 + d*4 = (229 -x)*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + x*4.

Let me compute this:

(229 - x) + 874 + 702 + 4x.

Let me compute term by term:

229 - x + 874 = 1103 - x.

1103 - x + 702 = 1805 - x.

1805 - x + 4x = 1805 + 3x.

So, the total ownerships is 1805 + 3x.

But we know that total ownerships is 2024, so:

1805 + 3x = 2024 → 3x = 2024 - 1805 = 219 → x = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

Wait, let me double-check that. So, a=229 -73=156. So, 156 own exactly one, 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and 73 own four.

Adding up: 156 + 437 = 593, 593 +234=827, 827 +73=900, which matches.

Now, total ownerships: 156*1=156, 437*2=874, 234*3=702, 73*4=292.

Adding: 156 +874=1030, 1030 +702=1732, 1732 +292=2024, which matches the earlier total.

So, the calculation seems consistent.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( a \) be the number of residents who own exactly one item.
   - Let \( b = 437 \) be the number of residents who own exactly two items.
   - Let \( c = 234 \) be the number of residents who own exactly three items.
   - Let \( d = x \) be the number of residents who own all four items.

2. **Total Residents**:
   \[
   a + b + c + d = 900
   \]
   Substituting \( b \) and \( c \):
   \[
   a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x
   \]

3. **Total Ownerships**:
   Each resident contributes to the total ownership count based on the number of items they own. The total number of ownerships is the sum of the sizes of each set:
   \[
   195 \, (\text{D}) + 367 \, (\text{G}) + 562 \, (\text{S}) + 900 \, (\text{C}) = 2024
   \]
   The total ownerships can also be expressed as:
   \[
   a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 2 + c \cdot 3 + d \cdot 4 = 2024
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   (229 - x) \cdot 1 + 437 \cdot 2 + 234 \cdot 3 + x \cdot 4 = 2024
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   229 - x + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   1805 + 3x = 2024
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   3x = 219 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
