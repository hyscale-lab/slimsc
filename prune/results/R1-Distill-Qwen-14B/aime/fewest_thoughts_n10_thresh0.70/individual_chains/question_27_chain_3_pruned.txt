Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, I remember a torus is like a donut shape, formed by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the torus T has a radius of 3, and it's being revolved around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius, I think, is 6, and the minor radius is 3. 

Then, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The question is about when T rests inside S and when it's outside. When it's inside, they're internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, externally tangent with radius r_o. The difference r_i - r_o is m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles when the torus is inside and outside the sphere. Let me try to visualize this.

First, let's recall that for a torus, the surface is defined by two radii: R, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution (so major radius), and r, the radius of the generating circle (minor radius). In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent internally. The sphere has radius 11. So, the centers must be positioned such that the distance between their centers plus the torus's major radius equals the sphere's radius? Wait, not sure.

Wait, when two surfaces are tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on external or internal tangent.

But the torus is a bit more complicated since it's a surface of revolution. So, maybe the tangent circle lies in a plane that intersects both the sphere and the torus. 

Let me think. When T is inside S, the closest point on T to the center of S would be along the axis of the torus. Since the torus is centered at the same point as S? Or is it offset? Wait, the problem says "rests on the inside" and "rests on the outside." So, maybe when it's resting inside, its center coincides with the sphere's center? Or perhaps it's placed such that the center of the torus is at the center of the sphere?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus and sphere in a coordinate system. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T is then placed such that its own center is also at the origin. Because when it's resting inside or outside, the centers are aligned.

But wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, so the maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus must be less than or equal to 11. The torus has a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. So, the points on the torus can get as close as R - r = 6 -
