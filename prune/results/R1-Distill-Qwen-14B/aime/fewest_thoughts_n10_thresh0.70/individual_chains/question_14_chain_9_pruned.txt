Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

"Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Let Q and R be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when N is divided by 1000. Find Q + R."

Alright, so the goal is to find the largest four-digit number N such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, once we have N, we need to divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder), then add Q and R together.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, N is a four-digit number. So, it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the greatest such number, so ideally, we want N to be as close to 9999 as possible, but of course, it has to satisfy that condition about changing any digit to 1.

Let me denote the digits of N as a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit, b is the hundreds, c is the tens, and d is the ones digit. So, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, the condition is that if any one digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, that means if we take N, change a to 1, or change b to 1, or change c to 1, or change d to 1, in each case, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, let's formalize that.

1. Changing a to 1: The new number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing b to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Divisible by 7.

3. Changing c to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.

4. Changing d to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Hmm, okay. So, for each of these four cases, I can write an equation:

1. (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) mod 7 = 0

2. (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) mod 7 = 0

3. (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) mod 7 = 0

4. (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) mod 7 = 0

So, four modular equations. Maybe I can write each of these as congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Now, maybe I can compute the coefficients modulo 7 first to simplify these equations.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

- 1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

- 100 divided by 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. Thus, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

- 10 divided by 7 is 1 with remainder 3. So, 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

- 1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, substituting these into the equations:

1. (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7

2. (6a + 2 + 3c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7

3. (6a + 2b + 3 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7

4. (6a + 2b + 3c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now I have four congruences:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, okay. So, I can write each of these as:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7 (because -2 mod7 is 5)

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4)

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6)

So, now the four equations are:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7

2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod7

3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod7

4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod7

Hmm, okay. So now I have four equations with variables a, b, c, d, all digits (so 0-9, except a can't be 0 because it's a four-digit number). We need to find the largest N, so we should maximize a, then b, then c, then d.

Let me see how to solve these equations.

First, perhaps I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

For example, take equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡1

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡5

If I subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 -1 mod7

Simplify:

6a - 2b ≡4 mod7

Which is equation 2 - equation 1: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7

Simplify that:

Divide both sides by 2: 3a - b ≡2 mod7

So, 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, maybe subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡5

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡4

Subtract equation3 from equation2:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5-4 mod7

Simplify: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, maybe subtract equation4 from equation3:

Equation4: 6a +2b +3c ≡6

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4

Subtract equation3 from equation4:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) ≡6-4 mod7

Simplify: 3c -d ≡2 mod7

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

Also, subtract equation1 from equation4:

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6

Equation1: 2b +3c +d ≡1

Subtract equation1 from equation4:

(6a +2b +3c ) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7

Simplify: 6a -d ≡5 mod7

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7

Hmm, okay, so now I have these derived equations:

From equation2 - equation1: 3a - b ≡2 mod7 → equation A

From equation2 - equation3: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7 → equation B

From equation4 - equation3: 3c -d ≡2 mod7 → equation C

From equation4 - equation1: 6a -d ≡5 mod7 → equation D

So, now we have four equations: A, B, C, D.

Let me write them again:

A: 3a - b ≡2 mod7

B: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7

C: 3c -d ≡2 mod7

D:6a -d ≡5 mod7

Hmm, and also, we have the original equations, but maybe these can help.

So, perhaps we can solve for variables step by step.

Let me see. From equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 → b ≡3a -2 mod7

Similarly, from equation D:6a -d ≡5 mod7 → d ≡6a -5 mod7

From equation C:3c -d ≡2 mod7 → d ≡3c -2 mod7

So, from equation D and C, we have:

6a -5 ≡3c -2 mod7

Which is: 6a -5 -3c +2 ≡0 mod7 →6a -3c -3 ≡0 mod7 →6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

We can factor 3: 3(2a -c) ≡3 mod7 → 2a -c ≡1 mod7 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, we can divide both sides by 3)

So, 2a -c ≡1 mod7 → equation E.

Similarly, from equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7

But from equation A, we have b ≡3a -2 mod7. Let's substitute that into equation B.

So, 3c -2*(3a -2) ≡1 mod7

Simplify:3c -6a +4 ≡1 mod7 →3c -6a ≡1 -4 mod7 →3c -6a ≡-3 mod7 →3c -6a ≡4 mod7.

Factor 3:3(c - 2a) ≡4 mod7 → c -2a ≡(4/3) mod7.

Wait, division in mod7: 3 inverse mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So, 4/3 mod7 is 4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, c -2a ≡6 mod7 → equation F.

But from equation E:2a -c ≡1 mod7 → c -2a ≡-1 mod7 → which is c -2a ≡6 mod7, since -1 mod7 is 6.

Wait, equation F says c -2a ≡6 mod7, which matches with equation E.

So, consistent.

So, from equation E: 2a -c ≡1 → c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So, now, let me summarize:

From equation A: b ≡3a -2 mod7

From equation E: c ≡2a -1 mod7

From equation C: d ≡3c -2 mod7

From equation D: d ≡6a -5 mod7

So, since both expressions for d must be equal mod7, set 3c -2 ≡6a -5 mod7.

But since c ≡2a -1 mod7, substitute c:

3*(2a -1) -2 ≡6a -5 mod7

Compute left side:6a -3 -2 =6a -5 → which is equal to the right side:6a -5.

So, 6a -5 ≡6a -5 mod7 → which is an identity, so no new information.

Thus, we can proceed.

So, now, we have:

b ≡3a -2 mod7

c ≡2a -1 mod7

d ≡6a -5 mod7

But since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9, a≠0), we need to find a, b, c, d such that these congruences hold, and also that when we set any digit to 1, the number is divisible by 7.

Moreover, we need the largest possible N, so starting from a=9 down, trying to find a suitable a, then b, c, d.

So, let me think about how to approach this.

Since a is the thousands digit, we can start with a=9 and see if we can find b, c, d that satisfy the above congruences and the conditions.

But first, let's note that a is from 1 to9, b,c,d from0 to9.

So, starting with a=9.

Compute b≡3*9 -2 mod7 →27 -2=25 mod7. 25 divided by7 is 3*7=21, 25-21=4 →25≡4 mod7. So, b≡4 mod7. So, possible values for b:4,11,18,... But since b is a digit, only 4 is possible. So, b=4.

Similarly, c≡2*9 -1 mod7 →18-1=17 mod7. 17-14=3 →17≡3 mod7. So, c≡3 mod7. Possible c=3,10,17,... But c is a digit, so c=3.

Then, d≡6*9 -5 mod7 →54-5=49 mod7. 49 is divisible by7, so d≡0 mod7. So, d can be 0 or7, since d is a digit.

So, with a=9, b=4, c=3, d=0 or7.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all the original equations.

Wait, no, we have to ensure that when changing any digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by7.

So, let's check each of the four cases:

1. Change a to 1
