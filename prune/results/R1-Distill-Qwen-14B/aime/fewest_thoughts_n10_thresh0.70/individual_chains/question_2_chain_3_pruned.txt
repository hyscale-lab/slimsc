Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family of segments F consists of all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a unit segment connecting a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and all these segments are in the first quadrant.

Now, there's a unique point C on segment AB, which is different from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from the family F except AB. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant, so each PQ is such that P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q) with sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, since PQ is of length 1.

Wait, no, actually, for a segment from (p,0) to (0,q), the length is sqrt(p^2 + q^2). So for it to be of unit length, p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, the family F consists of all such segments where P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), with p and q positive real numbers satisfying p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, each such segment is a line connecting (p,0) to (0,q), and since p and q are positive, all these segments lie in the first quadrant.

So, the problem is about these unit-length segments and how they relate to the segment AB. Specifically, we're looking for a point C on AB that is only on AB and not on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments in F (other than AB itself, which is part of F since OA is (1/2,0) and OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2), so AB is a segment in F with length 1? Let me check that.

Wait, is AB of unit length? Let's compute the distance between A and B. A is at (1/2, 0) and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is a segment in F since it connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), which are P and Q points with p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, and indeed (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so AB is in F.

So, each segment in F is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) with p^2 + q^2 =1. Now, the point C is on AB, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, I need to find such a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB.

So, first, maybe I should parametrize AB and then find a point C on AB such that for any other PQ in F, C doesn't lie on PQ. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F.

Wait, I've heard of the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if F is a family of lines, their envelope might be a curve that each line in F is tangent to. So, maybe the point C lies on this envelope, and AB is the only line in F that passes through C.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB meets the envelope of F, which would mean that C is the only point on AB that's on the envelope. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe this is the right approach.

Alternatively, since each PQ in F is a line, maybe the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the envelope might
