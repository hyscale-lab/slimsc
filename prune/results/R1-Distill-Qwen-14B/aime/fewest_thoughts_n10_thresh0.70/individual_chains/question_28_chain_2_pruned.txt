Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which will be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm, so first, the point I is equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, the problem is essentially asking for the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I recall that it can be calculated using the formula:

r = (3V) / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, my plan is to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and compute the total surface area S. Then, use the formula above to find the inradius r.

First, I need to figure out the volume. But to compute the volume, I might need more information about the edges or maybe the coordinates of the vertices.

Wait, the given edge lengths are AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). This seems symmetric. Maybe this tetrahedron is a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure if that's the correct term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which might imply some kind of symmetry.

Let me think about how I can model this tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in such a way that it's symmetric with respect to the origin or some point.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me assume that point A is at (x, y, z), and then find coordinates for B, C, D such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something like that. Or perhaps it's a disphenoid.

Yes! A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think that's exactly what this is. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, but in this case, the faces might not be congruent, but the opposite edges are equal.

Wait, no, actually, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent. But in this problem, the edges are given as AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, if the opposite edges are equal, it's a disphenoid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetragonal disphenoid, which has four congruent triangular faces, but in this case, the edges are of different lengths, so maybe it's a general disphenoid.

In any case, for a disphenoid, I think there's a formula for volume and surface area.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Cayley-Menger determinants to compute the volume. Because with all the edge lengths given, that might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1
1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2
1 a^2 0 d^2 e^2
1 b^2 d^2 0 f^2
1 c^2 e^2 f^2 0

So, in this problem, we have:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

Wait, let me list this properly:

AB = sqrt(41), which is the edge between A and B.

AC = sqrt(80), edge between A and C.

AD = sqrt(89), edge between A and D.

BC = sqrt(89), edge between B and C.

BD = sqrt(80), edge between B and D.

CD = sqrt(41), edge between C and D.

So, the edge lengths are:

a = AB = sqrt(41)
b = AC = sqrt(80)
c = AD = sqrt(89)
d = BC = sqrt(89)
e = BD = sqrt(80)
f =
