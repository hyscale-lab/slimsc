Okay, so I came across this math problem, and I thought it would be a good challenge to work through it. The problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a specific divisibility property. Let me try to understand what exactly is being asked here.

The problem states: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer such that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Alright, so let's break it down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that changing any single digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. That's interesting because it implies that N itself might have some relation to 7, but it's not necessarily divisible by 7 itself. 

Let me think about how changing each digit to 1 affects the number. For example, N has four digits: let's say N is represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So if we change A to 1, we get 1BCD; changing B to 1 gives A1CD; changing C to 1 gives AB1D; changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest N that satisfies this condition. So, to approach this, I think I need to figure out the constraints that each digit must satisfy so that when we change that digit to 1, the number is divisible by 7.

Let me consider each digit position separately.

1. Changing the thousands digit (A) to 1: So the number becomes 1BCD. Let's denote this number as N1 = 1000*1 + B*100 + C*10 + D. Since N is the largest possible, A should be as large as possible. But when we change A to 1, N1 must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (B) to 1: The number becomes A1CD. Let's denote this as N2 = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D. This must also be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (C) to 1: The number becomes AB1D. Denote this as N3 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D. Must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the units digit (D) to 1: The number becomes ABC1. Denote this as N4 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1. Also must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four numbers (N1, N2, N3, N4), they must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me write down the congruences.

For N1: 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

For N2: 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

For N3: 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

For N4: 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, that's four congruences.

I should probably compute the coefficients of A, B, C, D modulo 7 for each of these.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Compute 1000 ÷ 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

And 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, 1000 ≡6 mod7, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.

So, for each of the four congruences:

N1: 6 + 2*B + 3*C + D ≡0 mod7.

N2: 6*A + 2 + 3*C + D ≡0 mod7.

N3: 6*A + 2*B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

N4: 6*A + 2*B + 3*C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from N1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (from N2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (from N3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7. (from N4)

So, these four must all be true.

Now, the variables are A, B, C, D, which are digits, so each is between 0 and 9, inclusive. Also, since N is a four-digit number, A is between 1 and 9.

Our goal is to find the maximum N, so we should start with A=9 and see if we can find B, C, D such that all four equations hold. If not, decrement A and try again.

But let's see if we can find relationships between these equations.

Let me write down the four equations again:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7. Let's compute -6 mod7 as 1, since 7-6=1. So equation 1: 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation 2: 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7. -2 mod7 is 5, so 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7.

Equation 3: 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7. -3 mod7 is 4, so 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod7. -1 mod7 is 6, so 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7.

So now the four equations are:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡5 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡4 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7. (Equation 4)

Hmm. Maybe we can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7.

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's write that as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7. Let's note this as Equation 5.

Similarly, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:

Equation 3 - Equation 1: (6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7.

So, 6A -3C ≡3 mod7. Let's note this as Equation 6.

Similarly, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:

Equation 4 - Equation 1: (6A + 2B + 3C) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7. Let's note this as Equation 7.

Wait, no, let's double-check that subtraction.

Wait, Equation 4 is 6A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation 1 is 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

So, Equation4 - Equation1: (6A + 2B +3C) - (2B +3C + D) ≡6 -1 mod7.

Which simplifies to 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, Equation 7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Now, let me summarize the equations we have so far:

Equation 5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Equation 6: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Equation 7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Equation 1: 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

So, perhaps we can express D from Equation7: D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation6: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7 => 3C ≡6A -3 mod7 => 3C ≡6A -3 mod7.

We can factor 3 out: 3(C) ≡3(2A -1) mod7. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7.

The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So multiplying both sides by 5:

C ≡5*(3)(2A -1) mod7? Wait, no, wait. Wait, equation6 is 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Wait, let me re-express equation6.

6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Let me write this as -3C ≡3 -6A mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1: 3C ≡6A -3 mod7.

So, 3C ≡6A -3 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3(C) ≡3(2A -1) mod7.

Since 3 is invertible mod7, we can divide both sides by 3:

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So, C ≡ (2A -1) mod7. Let's note this as Equation8.

Similarly, equation5: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as -2B ≡4 -6A mod7 => 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: B ≡3A -2 mod7, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4.

Wait, 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

So, B ≡ (6A -4) * 4 mod7.

Wait, 6A -4 mod7 multiplied by 4.

Wait, perhaps I should do it step by step.

From 2B ≡6A -4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So:

B ≡ (6A -4) * 4 mod7
