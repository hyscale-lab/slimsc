Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm. Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, when we have expressions like this, sometimes it helps to represent z in polar form. Since the modulus of z is given as 4, that might be useful. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense because |z| = 4, so the modulus is 4, and θ can vary from 0 to 2π.

Wait, but actually, z can also be written as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Either way is fine, but maybe using Euler's formula is more compact. So z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|², which is 16 here.

So substituting into the expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let's compute each term.

First term: (75 + 117i) * z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let's denote A = 4*(75 + 117i) and B = (24 + 36i). Then, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of A e^{iθ} is Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ, and similarly, the real part of B e^{-iθ} is Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ. Because e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. So when we take the real part, we have Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

Wait, let me make sure. Actually, for any complex number C = c + di, Re(C e^{iθ}) = c cosθ - d sinθ, and Re(C e^{-iθ}) = c cosθ + d sinθ. So putting it together, the total real part of the entire expression is Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = [Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ].

So let's compute Re(A), Im(A), Re(B), and Im(B).

A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i. So Re(A) = 300, Im(A) = 468.

B = 24 + 36i. So Re(B) = 24, Im(B) = 36.

So putting it together:

Real part = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

That's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So the real part of the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. Since θ can be any angle between 0 and 2π, I can treat this as a function of θ and find its maximum.

I remember that an expression of the form M cosθ + N sinθ can be rewritten as K cos(θ + φ), where K = sqrt(M² + N²) and φ is some angle. The maximum value of this expression is then K, because the cosine function has a maximum of 1.

So in this case, M is 324, and N is -432. So our expression is 324
