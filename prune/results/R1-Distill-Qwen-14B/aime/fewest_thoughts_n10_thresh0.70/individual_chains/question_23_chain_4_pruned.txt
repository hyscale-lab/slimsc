Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. So, they intersect at 90 degrees. So, the point where they intersect is the midpoint for both diagonals. In this case, the problem states that the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Since A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means that points are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Because the origin is the midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA must be equal. Let's denote the coordinates:

A: (x, y)
C: (-x, -y)
B: (p, q)
D: (-p, -q)

So, the sides of the rhombus are AB, BC, CD, DA.

Let me compute the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]. Similarly, the length of BC is sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2], and so on. Since all sides are equal, their squares must be equal. So, maybe it's easier to work with squared distances.

So, let's write down the squared lengths:

AB² = (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2
BC² = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2
CD² = (-p - (-x))² + (-q - (-y))² = (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2
DA² = (x - (-p))² + (y - (-q))² = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2

Wait, but in a rhombus, not only are all sides equal, but the opposite sides are also parallel. So, vectors AB and DC should be equal, and vectors BC and AD should be equal. So, perhaps that's another way to approach this.
