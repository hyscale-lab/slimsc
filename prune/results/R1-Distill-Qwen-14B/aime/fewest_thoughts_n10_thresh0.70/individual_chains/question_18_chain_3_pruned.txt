Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So, it's a 12-sided polygon, and each side is equal in length.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. The key is probably figuring out how many pairs of parallel sides exist, because a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, there are sides and diagonals. So, the sides of the rectangle can be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals, meaning that the sides of the rectangle lie along these lines.

I think the approach here is similar to finding rectangles in a grid, but in this case, it's a circular arrangement. Maybe I can think of the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle, with each vertex equally spaced around the circumference.

Each vertex is separated by an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees.

To form a rectangle, I need four vertices such that they form a quadrilateral with all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, which is a regular 12-gon, the sides and diagonals have specific lengths and angles.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting opposing vertices that are a certain number of steps apart. For example, in a regular hexagon, which is a 6-gon, you can form rectangles by connecting every other vertex.

But a dodecagon is more complex. So, I need to find all sets of four vertices that form a rectangle.

I remember that in a regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles can be calculated using combinations where the vertices are spaced in a way that forms right angles.

Wait, but how exactly does that work?

Maybe I should think about the diagonals as vectors. Since the polygon is regular, the diagonals can be represented as vectors in the complex plane, each with a certain
