Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. So, S has numbers from 1 to 10, making it 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. And she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, which is getting all four numbers correct. Event B is winning a prize, which is getting at least two numbers correct.

So, I need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she automatically has at least two numbers correct, right? So, P(A and B) is just P(A), because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (at least two correct numbers). 

Let me start by figuring out the total number of possible lottery outcomes. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). 

Calculating that: C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize, P(A), is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she's picking 4 distinct numbers, and the lottery also picks 4, there's only one combination where all four are correct. So, P(A) = 1 / 210. 

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, B includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers are chosen. 

Wait, but since the grand prize is exactly four, which we've already considered in P(A), when calculating P(B), we can either include all cases of two, three, and four, or maybe we can compute it as 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two correct numbers. But maybe it's easier to compute the cases for exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four, and sum those probabilities.

Let me try that. 

First, the number of ways she can have exactly k numbers correct, where k is 2, 3, or 4. 

For exactly k correct numbers, she has to choose k numbers from her 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the numbers she didn't pick. Since the total set S has 10 numbers, and she picked 4, there are 6 numbers she didn't pick.

So, the number of ways for exactly k correct numbers is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

So, let's compute that for k=2,3,4.

For k=2: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for event B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes, and total possible is 210. So, 115/210.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as
