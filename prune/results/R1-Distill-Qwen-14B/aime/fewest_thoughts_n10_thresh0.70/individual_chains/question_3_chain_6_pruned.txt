Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she's won a prize, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), and P(B) is the probability of winning a prize.

So, the problem boils down to finding P(A)/P(B). Let's define the events more precisely:

- Let G be the event that Jen wins the grand prize, meaning all four of her numbers are chosen.
- Let P be the event that Jen wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen.

We need to compute P(G | P) = P(G) / P(P).

First, I'll compute P(G), the probability of winning the grand prize. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination of n items taken k at a time.

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = 210. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 210.

To win the grand prize, all four of Jen's numbers must be chosen. There's only one such combination, so P(G) = 1 / 210.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. Actually, the number of ways to choose all four of her numbers is 1, so yes, P(G) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(P), the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her four numbers are among the four chosen. Winning a prize includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the complement probability: the probability that she doesn't win a prize, which is the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen (i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen). Then subtract this from 1 to get P(P).

Let me try both approaches and see which is easier.

Approach 1: Compute the number of ways where exactly k of her numbers are chosen, for k=2,3,4, and sum them up.

Approach 2: Compute the number of ways where k=0 or k=1, sum them, and subtract from the total.

I think Approach 2 might be simpler because it involves fewer terms, so let's try that.

The total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4) = 210.

Number of ways where exactly zero of her numbers are chosen: That means all four numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not in her chosen set). So, the number of such combinations is C(6,4) = 15.

Number of ways where exactly one of her numbers is chosen: Choose 1 number from her 4, and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, C(6,3) is 20, so 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the number of ways where she doesn't win a prize is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways she wins a prize is total minus non-winning: 210 - 95 = 115.

So, P(P) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. 210 total,
