Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, okay. So, that means these four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting, so they're concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE. 

First, let me recap the properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB = CD, BC = AD, and all other sides accordingly. Similarly for EFGH, EF = GH, FG = EH, etc.

So, let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16, which is one side of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD = BC = 16. Also, AB = 107, so CD = AB = 107.
  
- EF = 184, which is one side of rectangle EFGH. Therefore, GH = EF = 184. FG = 17, so EH = FG = 17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to sketch this mentally or maybe on paper. Let me think of a straight line with points D, E, C, F in that order. So, D-E-C-F. That means DE + EC + CF = DC or DF? Wait, no, because D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line is D-E-C-F. So, the distance from D to F is DE + EC + CF.

Wait, but in the case of rectangles, ABCD and EFGH, points D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD. Similarly, E and F are adjacent corners of EFGH. So, in the line D-E-C-F, E is between D and C, and F is after C.

Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so it's in that order. So, D comes first, then E, then C, then F. So, the line is D-E-C-F.

So, in that case, the distance from D to E is some value, then E to C is CE, which is what we're trying to find, then C to F is another value.

Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, the sides DC and AB are opposite sides, so DC = AB = 107. So, the distance from D to C is 107. But according to the collinear points, D-E-C-F, the distance from D to C is DE +
