Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let's make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

So, to find b-eautiful numbers, I need to consider numbers n such that:
- n is a two-digit number in base b. That means n is between b and b² - 1, inclusive. Because in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² -1.

So, the range for n is [b, b² -1].

Next, the digits of n in base b must add up to sqrt(n). Let's denote the two digits as d1 and d2. So, n in base b is d1*d2, which is d1*b + d2. Also, d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). 

So, mathematically, we have n = d1*b + d2, and d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). 

Let me square both sides of the second equation to get rid of the square root: (d1 + d2)² = n.

But n is also equal to d1*b + d2. So substituting, we have:
(d1 + d2)² = d1*b + d2.

Let me write that equation down:
(d1 + d2)² = d1*b + d2.

Now, rearranging terms, we get:
d1² + 2*d1*d2 + d2² = d1*b + d2.

Let's bring all terms to one side:
d1² + 2*d1*d2 + d2² - d1*b - d2 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d2. Maybe I can consider variables d1 and d2. But I think another approach might be more straightforward.

Since d1 and d2 are digits in base b, they must satisfy 0 ≤ d1, d2 ≤ b-1. Also, since it's a two-digit number, d1 must be at least 1, so d1 ∈ {1, 2, ..., b-1}, and d2 ∈ {0, 1, ..., b-1}.

From the equation (d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2, let's denote s = d1 + d2. Then, s² = d1*b + d2. But since d2 = s - d1 (from s = d1 + d2), we can substitute:

s² = d1*b + (s - d1)
s² = d1*(b - 1) + s

Let's rearrange this:
s² - s = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d2 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b -1.

So, let's think about possible s. Since d1 and d2 are digits, their sum s = d1 + d2 must satisfy s ≥ 1 (since d1 ≥1) and s ≤ (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. 

But since s is the square root of n, which is a two-digit number in base b (so n is between b and b² -1), then s must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² -1). Since sqrt(b² -1) is just a bit less than b, s can be from 2 up to b-1, because sqrt(b) is the smallest integer s such that s² ≥ b.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the possible values of s. The smallest s is when n is as small as possible. The smallest two-digit number in base b is b, so sqrt(b) is the smallest possible s. But s must be an integer because it's the sum of two digits, which are integers. So, s must be an integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b). But s is also the sum of two digits, so s can't be more than 2*(b-1). 

But let's think about it step by step.

Given that n is a two-digit number in base b, n = d1*b + d2. The digits satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ d2 ≤ b-1.

The sum s = d1 + d2 must equal sqrt(n). So n = s². Therefore, s must be an integer such that s² is a two-digit number in base b. So, s² must be ≥ b and ≤ (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1. So, s must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b² -1). Since sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

Wait, let me see: For example, when b=13, as in the problem, n=81, which is s=9. 9²=81, which is within 13 to 169-1=168. So, s can be from 4 (since sqrt(13)≈3.605, so next integer is 4) up to 12, since 12²=144, which is less than 168.

But wait, for n to be a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b, which is the smallest two-digit number (10_b = b). So, s² must be ≥ b. Therefore, s must be ≥ sqrt(b). So, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But sqrt(b² -1) is just less than b, so floor(sqrt(b² -1)) is b-1. Hence, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.

So, for each base b, the possible values of s are integers from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to s_max = b-1.

For each such s, we can compute d1 as (s² - s)/(b - 1), and d2 as s - d1, then check if both d1 and d2 are valid digits (i.e., between 0 and b-1, inclusive, and d1 ≥1).

So, the plan is:
1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, check how many s's (from s_min to s_max) give valid d1 and d2.
2. Once we find a base b where the number of such s's (i.e., number of b-eautiful numbers) exceeds 10, we return that b as the answer.

But this could be time-consuming if done by hand. Maybe we can find a formula or pattern.

Let me re-examine the equation:

d1 = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, s(s - 1) must be divisible by (b - 1).

Similarly, d2 = s - d1 = s - (s² - s)/(b -1) = [s(b -1) - (s² - s)] / (b -1)
Simplify numerator:
s(b -1) - s² + s = s(b -1 +1) - s² = s*b - s².

Wait, that seems off. Let me compute d2 properly:

d2 = s - d1 = s - (s² - s)/(b -1)
= [s(b -1) - (s² - s)] / (b -1)
= [s*b - s - s² + s] / (b -1)
= [s*b - s²]
