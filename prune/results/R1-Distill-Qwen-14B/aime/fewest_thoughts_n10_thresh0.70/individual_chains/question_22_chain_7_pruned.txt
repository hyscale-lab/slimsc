Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's a type of hexagon similar to a regular one but maybe not necessarily with all sides equal beyond being equilateral. The key here is that it's convex and equilateral, with opposite sides parallel.

Now, the problem says that if you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal, but the angles can vary as long as it's convex.

When we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. That triangle has sides of 200, 240, and 300. I think this triangle is the outer triangle formed by the extensions of these three sides.

I remember something about similar triangles and maybe using the properties of the hexagon to relate the sides. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, I think the sides AB, CD, EF are each extended to form the triangle. So, the lengths of these extensions must relate to the side length of the hexagon.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side by some distance, maintaining the parallelism.

When you extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three non-consecutive sides. So, the triangle they form is probably the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inscribed inside it. The sides of this triangle are longer than the sides of the hexagon because they include the extensions.

I think the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon, but scaled up. Wait, but the hexagon isn't necessarily regular, so maybe the triangle isn't similar? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a centrally symmetric hexagon, given that opposite sides are parallel. That might help in breaking down the problem.

Let me think of the hexagon as being made up of three pairs of opposite sides. Each pair is translated by some vector, maintaining parallelism. Since the hexagon is convex, these vectors must be in such a way that the overall shape doesn't fold in on itself.

Now, considering the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, where X is the intersection of AB and CD's extensions, Y is the intersection of CD and EF's extensions, and Z is the intersection of EF and AB's extensions.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Actually, the extensions of AB, CD, and EF would each form one side of the triangle. So, the extension of AB meets the extension of CD at some point, say X; the extension of CD meets the extension of EF at Y; and the extension of EF meets the extension of AB at Z. So, triangle XYZ has sides XY, YZ, and ZX with lengths 200, 240, and 300.

But wait, the side lengths are 200, 240, and 300. So, triangle XYZ has sides of these lengths. But how does the hexagon fit into this?

Since the hexagon is inside this triangle, each side of the triangle is formed by two sides of the hexagon. For example, the side
