Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let's break down the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such N with the given property.

The property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N and change the thousands digit to 1, the number is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds, tens, or units digit to 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are the digits, and A is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

When we change any digit to 1, we get four different numbers:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should aim for N as close to 9999 as possible, but it must satisfy the given condition.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then, each of the modified numbers can be written as:

1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But since N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then, each of these modified numbers can be expressed as N with one digit changed.

So, for each modified number, let's write it in terms of N.

1. Changing A to 1: (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) - (1000A - 1000) = N - 1000(A - 1)
   So, N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod7 → N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod7

But wait, 1000 mod7: Let's compute 1000 divided by 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

So, 1000(A - 1) ≡ 6(A -1) mod7.

Thus, N ≡ 6(A -1) mod7.

Similarly, for the second modified number:

2. Changing B to 1: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - (100B - 100)
   So, N - (100(B -1)) ≡ 0 mod7

100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7. So, 100(B -1) ≡ 2(B -1) mod7.

Thus, N ≡ 2(B -1) mod7.

Third modified number:

3. Changing C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = N - (10C -10)
   So, N - 10(C -1) ≡ 0 mod7.

10 mod7 = 3, so 10(C -1) ≡ 3(C -1) mod7.

Thus, N ≡ 3(C -1) mod7.

Fourth modified number:

4. Changing D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C +1 = N - (D -1)
   So, N - (D -1) ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡ (D -1) mod7.

So, putting it all together, we have four congruences:

1. N ≡ 6(A -1) mod7
2. N ≡ 2(B -1) mod7
3. N ≡ 3(C -1) mod7
4. N ≡ (D -1) mod7

But we also know that N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, substituting N into each congruence:

1. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6(A -1) mod7
2. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 2(B -1) mod7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 3(C -1) mod7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + D ≡ (D -1) mod7

Let me compute each of these congruences step by step.

First, let's compute N mod7. Since N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

We can compute each coefficient mod7:

1000 ≡ 6 mod7,
100 ≡ 2 mod7,
10 ≡3 mod7,
1 ≡1 mod7.

So, N ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + D mod7.

So, the four congruences become:

1. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 6(A -1) mod7
2. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 2(B -1) mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 3(C -1) mod7
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ (D -1) mod7

Let's simplify each of these.

1. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 6A -6 mod7
   Subtract 6A from both sides:
   2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7
   Since -6 ≡1 mod7 (because 7-6=1), so:
   2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7

2. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 2B -2 mod7
   Subtract 2B from both sides:
   6A +3C + D ≡ -2 mod7
   -2 ≡5 mod7, so:
   6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

3. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡3C -3 mod7
   Subtract 3C from both sides:
   6A +2B + D ≡-3 mod7
   -3 ≡4 mod7, so:
   6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ D -1 mod7
   Subtract D from both sides:
   6A + 2B +3C ≡-1 mod7
   -1 ≡6 mod7, so:
   6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

So now, we have four simplified congruences:

1. 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7
2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7
3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7
4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Let me write them again:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7

Equation (2): 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

Equation (3): 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm, perhaps I can use linear combinations of these equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see.

First, let's see Equation (2) minus Equation (1):

Equation(2) - Equation(1):

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) = 6A -2B ≡5-1=4 mod7

So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Let me note that as Equation (5):

Equation (5): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation(2) - Equation(3):

(6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) = 3C -2B ≡5-4=1 mod7

So, 3C -2B ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (6).

Equation (6): 3C -2B ≡1 mod7

Similarly, let's look at Equation (4):

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Let me see if I can express this in terms of Equations (5) or (6). 

From Equation (5): 6A -2B =4 mod7.

Let me solve for 6A: 6A =4 +2B mod7.

So, substituting 6A in Equation (4):

(4 +2B) +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Simplify:

4 +4B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Subtract 4 from both sides
