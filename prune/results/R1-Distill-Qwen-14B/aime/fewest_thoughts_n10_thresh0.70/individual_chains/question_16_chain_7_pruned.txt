Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n^4 + 1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. That's because n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p must divide 8. But the order can't be 1 because n ≡ 1 mod p would mean 1 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p, which would imply p=2. Wait, but if p=2, does that work?

Let me check p=2. If n is even, say n=2k, then n^4 + 1 would be 16k^4 + 1. Is that divisible by 4? Let's see: 16k^4 is divisible by 4, and 1 is 1 mod 4. So 16k^4 +1 is 1 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work because n^4 +1 is only 1 mod 4, never 0 mod 4. So the next prime is 3.

For p=3: Let's see if there's an n where n^4 ≡ -1 mod 3. Compute n^4 mod 3. The possible residues mod 3 are 0,1,2.

n=0: 0^4=0 mod 3
n=1: 1^4=1 mod 3
n=2: 2^4=16 ≡ 1 mod 3.

So n^4 mod 3 is either 0 or 1. So n^4 ≡ -1 mod 3 would require 1 ≡ -1 mod 3 → 1 ≡ 2 mod 3, which is false. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next prime is 5. Let's see if there's an n where n^4 ≡ -1 mod 5.

Compute n^4 mod 5 for n=1 to 4.

n=1: 1
n=2: 16 ≡ 1 mod 5
n=3: 81 ≡ 1 mod 5
n=4: 256 ≡ 1 mod 5.

Wait, all n^4 mod 5 are 0 or 1. So n^4 ≡ -1 mod 5 would mean 1 ≡ -1 mod 5 ⇒ 1 ≡4 mod5, which is false. So p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime: 7. Let's check if n^4 ≡ -1 mod7.

Compute n^4 for n=1 to 6 mod7.

n=1:1
n=2:16≡2
n=3:81≡4
n=4:256≡256-7*36=256-252=4
n=5:625. 625/7=89*7=623, 625-623=2.
n=6:1296. 1296/7=185*7=1295, so 1296≡1.

So n^4 mod7: 1,2,4,4,2,1.

Looking for -1 mod7, which is 6. None of the residues are 6. So p=7 doesn't work.

Next prime is 11. Let's see.

But wait, maybe I should think about properties of primes where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. I remember that for such a congruence to have a solution, the order of n modulo p must be 8, which means that 8 divides p-1 (by Fermat's little theorem, since the multiplicative order divides p-1). So p ≡1 mod8.

Wait, but earlier I saw that primes like 3,5,7 aren't 1 mod8. So maybe the primes I'm looking for are primes where 8 divides p-1. So the primes p must be 1 mod8. So the smallest primes would be 17, 97, etc? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the primes where -1 is a quartic residue. So for p ≡1 mod8, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, which is divisible by 8, so there are solutions to x^4 ≡ -1 mod p.

Wait, but for p=17, which is 1 mod8, let's check if n^4 ≡-1 mod17 has a solution.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16.

n=1:1
n=2:16
