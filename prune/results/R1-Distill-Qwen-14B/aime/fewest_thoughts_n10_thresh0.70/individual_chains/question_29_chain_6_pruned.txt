Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. So, we have two rectangles. ABCD is one rectangle, so AB is one side, BC is another. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so EF and FG are sides.

Given the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that line is probably the side where the two rectangles are connected or something. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That probably means that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral, which might have some properties I can use.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16: Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one side. So, in rectangle ABCD, BC is one of the shorter sides, perhaps. Wait, but AB is 107, which is longer. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107 and BC is 16. So, AB is the length, BC is the width.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is the longer side, FG is the shorter side.

So, rectangles are ABCD (length 107, width 16) and EFGH (length 184, width 17).

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, that line must be DC for rectangle ABCD, but wait, E is a point on that line as well. Hmm, maybe E is a point extending from D? Or perhaps the two rectangles are placed in a way that their sides overlap along that line.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points to visualize better.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16, 0) because BC=16. Then, since AB=107, A would be at (0,107). Wait, no, wait. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then AB is the vertical side, BC is the horizontal side? Or is AB the horizontal side?

Wait, actually, I might have to define the rectangle properly. Let me think: in rectangle ABCD, moving from A to B to C to D and back to A. So, if AB is 107, BC is 16, then AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side.

So, maybe if I place point A at (0,0). Then B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Wait, that makes sense. So, in this coordinate system, AB is horizontal, BC is vertical.

But then, where are the other rectangle EFGH located? EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, point D is at (0,16), point C is at (107,16). So, the line DC is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is a horizontal line at y=16.

So, points E and F must lie somewhere on this line.
