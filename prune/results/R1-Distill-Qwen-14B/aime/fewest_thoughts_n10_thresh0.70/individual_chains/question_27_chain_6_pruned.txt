Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, which are the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere internally and externally, respectively. Then, I have to express this difference as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the torus. A torus is like a donut shape, formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units, and the axis is in the plane of the circle, 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle itself is 3. That means the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6 + 3 = 9, right? Wait, no, actually, the major radius R is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus. Since the circle is being rotated around an axis 6 units away, the major radius would be 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside and outside of this sphere, and in each case, it's tangent along a circle with radii r_i and r_o. I need to find these two radii and then their difference.

I'm a bit confused about how exactly the torus is positioned relative to the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, it's also tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles for internal and external tangency.

Let me think about the geometry here. Both the torus and the sphere are surfaces of revolution, so their intersection when tangent should lie along a circle. For internal tangency, the torus is inside the sphere, so the point of tangency is on the outer part of the torus. For external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, so the point of tangency is on the inner part of the torus.

I recall that when two surfaces are tangent, their tangent planes at the point of tangency are the same. So, perhaps I can model this by considering their centers and the distance between them.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is moving inside and outside. Maybe I should consider the centers of the sphere and the torus.

The sphere S has radius 11, so its center is at some point O. The torus T is a surface created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis at distance 6 from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis, which is the center of the torus. Let me denote the center of the torus as point C.

So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the center C of the torus would be inside the sphere. The distance from O to C would then be such that the sphere and torus are tangent. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the center C would be outside the sphere, and the distance from O to C would be determined by the external tangency.

Wait, maybe I should model the torus as a surface with a certain geometry and find the points where it's tangent to the sphere.

I remember that the equation of a torus can be written in 3D coordinates, but maybe there's a simpler way to think about this since both are surfaces of revolution.

Let me consider the cross-sectional view. If I take a cross-section through the axis of the torus, I'll see a circle of radius 3, and the sphere will appear as a circle
