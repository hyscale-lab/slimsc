Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. Hmm, it's a classic inclusion-exclusion problem, I think. 

Alright, let me list down the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So H is 900.

Also, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Wait, so each resident owns at least one thing, right? Because H is 900, same as the total. So no one owns zero items. That's good to know.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle. For four sets, the formula would be:

Total = |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D∩S∩H| + |G∩S∩H| - |D∩G∩S∩H|

But wait, since everyone owns H, the candy hearts, that might simplify things. Because H is a universal set here. So any intersection involving H will include all the people in the other sets. Hmm, that's an important point.

Wait, but actually, H is a set that includes everyone, so for any two sets A and B, A∩B is the same as A∩B∩H, since H is everyone. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about it without H for a second.

Wait, no, since H is something everyone has, maybe I can model it as four items but one of them is universal. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed with the standard inclusion-exclusion.

But let's think about what we're given. We know the exact numbers for exactly two and exactly three. So perhaps it's better to model this using the principle for exactly two and exactly three overlaps.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets can be broken down into terms for single sets, subtract the pairwise intersections, add the triple overlaps, subtract the quadruple overlaps, etc.

But the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things. So maybe we can use that information to find the quadruple overlap.

Let me think about the formula for the union. Since every resident owns at least one item, the total should be equal to the union of D, G, S, H, which is 900.

So applying the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |
