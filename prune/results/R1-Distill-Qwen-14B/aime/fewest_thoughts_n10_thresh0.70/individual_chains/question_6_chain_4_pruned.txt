Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, so I'll need to break them down step by step. Let me write down what's given.

First, the functions f(x) and g(x) are defined as:
- f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |
- g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |

Then, the two graphs are:
1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations, meaning where these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, okay, so the first thing is to understand what f and g look like. Since both f and g are absolute value functions, they will create V-shaped graphs. Let me try to sketch or imagine their shapes.

Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

Let me consider |x| first. The graph of |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value: |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since we're taking the absolute value again, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the negative parts get flipped back up.

So, f(x) will have a V-shape. Let me think about the critical points. The inner function |x| - 1/2 is zero when |x| = 1/2, so at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So f(x) will have its vertex there.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The function inside is |x| - 1/2. So, when |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) is a V-shape that goes up from x = -1/2 to x = 1/2, with a maximum at the middle, which is 1/2. Then, outside of that interval, it goes back up as |x| increases.

Wait, actually, let me plot some points:

- At x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2
- At x = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0
- At x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2
- At x = -1/2: same as x=1/2, it's 0.

So f(x) is a V-shape that peaks at 1/2 in the middle and goes down to 0 at x = ±1/2, then up again. So it's like a diamond shape between -1/2 and 1/2, reaching up to 1/2 at x=0.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Again, let's analyze it. The inner function is |x| - 1/4. So, when |x| >= 1/4, it's non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4. When |x| < 1/4, it's negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, the graph of g(x) is a V
