Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, I have to find the smallest such \( m \) for that particular \( p \).

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

First, let's check \( p = 2 \). If \( p = 2 \), then \( p^2 = 4 \). I need to find if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4.

Let me compute \( n^4 + 1 \) mod 4 for different \( n \):

- If \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). Not divisible by 4.
- If \( n \) is odd, say \( n = 2k + 1 \), then \( n^4 = (2k + 1)^4 \). Let's compute modulo 4:

Expanding \( (2k + 1)^4 \) using the binomial theorem:

\( (2k + 1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1 \).

Modulo 4, all terms except the last two are 0:

\( 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
\( 32k^3 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
\( 24k^2 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
\( 8k \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
So, \( (2k + 1)^4 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). Then, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \). Also not divisible by 4.

So, for \( p = 2 \), there's no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 4. So, 2 is not the prime we're looking for.

Next prime is 3. So \( p = 3 \), \( p^2 = 9 \). Let's see if there exists \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by 9.

We can check \( n \) modulo 9. Because if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 9 \), then \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).

Let me compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \) for \( n = 0 \) to 8.

- \( n = 0 \): \( 0^4 = 0 \mod 9 \)
- \( n = 1 \): \( 1^4 = 1 \mod 9 \)
- \( n = 2 \): \( 16 \mod 9 \) is 7
- \( n = 3 \): \( 81 \mod 9 = 0 \)
- \( n = 4 \): \( 256 \mod 9 \). Let's compute 256 / 9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod 9.
- \( n = 5 \): \( 625 \mod 9 \). 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod 9.
Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5^4 is 625. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4, yes, so 4 mod 9.
- \( n = 6 \): 1296 mod 9: 1296 is 9*144, so 0 mod 9.
- \( n = 7 \): 7^4 = 2401. 2401 /9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7 mod 9.
- \( n = 8 \): 8^4 = 4096. 4096 mod 9: 4+0+9+6=19 → 1+9=10 → 1+0=1? Wait, maybe a different way.

Wait, it's easier to compute 8^4 mod 9:

Note that 8 ≡ -1 mod 9.

So 8^2 ≡ (-1)^2 = 1 mod 9.

8^4 = (8^2)^2 ≡ 1^2 = 1 mod 9.

So 8^4 ≡ 1 mod 9. So, 8^4 +1 = 2 mod 9.

So let me tabulate:

n | n^4 mod 9
0 | 0
1 | 1
2 | 7
3 | 0
4 | 4
5 | 4
6 | 0
7 | 7
8 | 1

So, looking for \( n^4 ≡ -1 \mod 9 \), which is same as 8 mod 9.

Looking at the table, n=2: 7, n=7:7. Hmm, no n^4 mod9 is 8. So, no n where n^4 ≡ 8 mod9. So, no solution for p=3.

So, moving on to next prime, p=5. p^2=25.

So, we need to check if there's n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod25.

Which is equivalent to n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

So, I need to find n where n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Let me try to compute n^4 mod25 for different n.

But since 25 is a bit bigger, perhaps I can look for patterns or use Euler's theorem.

Euler's theorem says that for a and n coprime, a^φ(n) ≡1 mod n. Here, φ(25)=20.

But since 4 and 25 are coprime, n^20 ≡1 mod25.

Wait, but that's for n coprime to 25, which is 1,2,...,24.

So, n^20 ≡1 mod25.

But n^4 would have an order dividing 20, so possible orders are 1,2,4,5,10,20.

We need n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Let me try some small n:

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1 mod25. Not 24.

n=2: 16 → 16 mod25. Not 24.

n=3: 81 mod25: 81-3*25=6. 6 mod25.

n=4: 256 mod25: 256 -10*25=256-250=6. 6 mod25.

n=5: 625 mod25=0. Not 24.

n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 mod25: 1296 /25=51*25=1275, 1296-1275=21. So 21 mod25.

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25: 2401-96*25=2401-2400=1. So 1 mod25.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod25: 4096 - 163*25=4096 -4075=21. So 21 mod25.

n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561 mod25: 6561 - 262*25=6561-6550=11. So 11 mod25.

n=10: 10^4=10000 mod25=0.

n=11: 11^4=14641 mod25. Let's see: 14641-585*25=14641-14625=16. So 16 mod25.

n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736 mod25: 20736 - 829*25=20736-20725=11. So 11 mod25.

n=13: 13^4=28561. 28561 mod25: 28561 -1142*25=28561-28550=11. 11 mod25.

n=14: 14^4=38416. 38416 mod25: Let's compute 14^2=196, mod25: 196-7*25=196-175=21. Then, 21^2=441 mod25: 441-17*25=441-425=16. So 16 mod25.

n=15: 15^4=50625 mod25=0.

n=16: 16^4=65536. 65536 mod25: 65536 - 2621*25=65536-65525=11. So 11 mod25.

Wait, but I'm not getting 24 mod25 in any of these. Hmm.

Wait, maybe n=7: 7^4=2401≡1 mod25, which is not 24. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try negative numbers, but since mod25 is the same for n and n+25, perhaps I can compute n from 1 to 12 and see, because beyond 12 it's repeating in some way.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck n=7: 7^4 is 2401. 2401 divided by 25: 25*96=2400, so remainder 1. So yes, 1 mod25.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe using quadratic residues or something else.

Wait, if n^4 ≡ -1 mod25, then raising both sides to the power of 2, we get n^8 ≡1 mod25. So, the order of n modulo 25 divides 8, but also divides φ(25)=20. So the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4. So the order is 1,2,4.

So, n^4 ≡1 mod25 if the order is 1 or 2, but we have n^4 ≡-1 mod25. So, perhaps the order is 8, but that would contradict the earlier reasoning. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's try to find an n such that n^2 ≡ some number mod25, and then square that. Let me think.

Suppose we let y = n^2, then n^4 = y^2. So, we're looking for y^2 ≡ -1 mod25. So, we can first check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod25.

Quadratic residues mod 25 can be found by computing squares of numbers 1 to 12 mod25:

1^2=1
2=4
3=9
4=16
5=0
6=36-25=11
7=49-2*25= -1=24
Wait, 7^2=49 mod25=24. So, 24 is a quadratic residue mod25. So, 24 is a square mod25.

So, y^2 ≡24 mod25. So, y can be 7 or 18, since 7^2=49≡24, and 18^2=(25-7)^2=7^2=49≡24.

So, y=7 or y=18 mod25. So, n^2 ≡7 or 18 mod25.

Now, do 7 and 18 have square roots mod25? Let me check if 7 is a quadratic residue mod25.

Wait, earlier when I computed squares mod25, 1^2=1, 2=4, 3=9,4=16,5=0,6=11,7=24,8=14,9=6,10=0, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute squares properly.

Wait, 1^2=1
2^2=4
3^2=9
4^2=16
5^2=0
6^2=36 mod25=11
7^2=49 mod25=24
8^2=64 mod25=14
9^2=81 mod25=6
10^2=100 mod25=0
11^2=121 mod25=21
12^2=144 mod25=19
13^2=169 mod25=19 (since 169-6*25=169-150=19)
14^2=196 mod25=21 (196-7*25=196-175=21)
15^2=225 mod25=0
16^2=256 mod25=6 (256-10*25=6)
17^2=289 mod25=14 (289-11*25=289-275=14)
18^2=324 mod25=24 (324-12*25=324-300=24)
19^2=361 mod25=11 (361-14*25=361-350=11)
20^2=400 mod25=0
21^2=441 mod25=16 (441-17*25=441-425=16)
22^2=484 mod25=9 (484-19*25=484-475=9)
23^2=529 mod25=4 (529-21*25=529-525=4)
24^2=576 mod25=1 (576-23*25=576-575=1)
25^2=625 mod25=0.

So, the quadratic residues mod25 are: 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24.

Looking at the squares, so 7 is not a quadratic residue mod25, because I don't see 7 in the list. So, n^2 ≡7 mod25 has no solution.

So, y^2 ≡24 mod25 implies y=7 or 18 mod25. But then n^2 ≡7 or 18 mod25.

But wait, 7 isn't a quadratic residue, as per above. So, does that mean that n^2 ≡7 mod25 has no solution? Let me check.

Looking at the squares I computed, 7 isn't present. So, no solution. Similarly, 18 isn't present either. Wait, 18 isn't in the list of quadratic residues, which are 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24.

So, n^2 ≡7 mod25 has no solution, and n^2≡18 mod25 also has no solution? Wait, 18 is not in the quadratic residues either. So, wait, how did we get y=7 and y=18? Because y^2=24 mod25, which is achieved when y=7 or 18, but then n^2 would have to be 7 or 18, which isn't possible. So, that would mean that there's no solution for n^4 ≡-1 mod25.

But wait, that can't be right, because I thought that for p=5, there exists an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 25. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's consider that n^4 ≡ -1 mod25. Then, n^8 ≡1 mod25. So, the multiplicative order of n modulo25 must divide 8. But φ(25)=20, so the order must also divide 20. Hence, the order must divide gcd(8,20)=4. So, possible orders are 1,2,4.

If order is 1: n ≡1 mod25. Then, n^4=1 mod25, which is not -1. So, no.

Order 2: n^2 ≡1 mod25. Then, n^4=1 mod25, again not -1.

Order 4: n^4 ≡1 mod25, which is same as above. Hmm, so this suggests that n^4 cannot be -1 mod25, which would mean that p=5 is not the prime we're looking for. But that contradicts my previous understanding because I thought 5 was the prime where n^4 +1 is divisible by 25.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try to find an n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Wait, maybe trying n=7: 7^4=2401 mod25 is 1, as I saw earlier.

Wait, n=2: 16 mod25.

n=3: 81 mod25=6.

n=4: 256 mod25=6.

n=6: 1296 mod25=21.

n=7: 2401 mod25=1.

n=8: 4096 mod25=21.

n=9: 6561 mod25=11.

n=11: 14641 mod25=16.

n=12: 20736 mod25=11.

n=13: 28561 mod25=11.

n=14: 38416 mod25=16.

n=16: 65536 mod25=11.

n=17: 83521 mod25: 83521 - 3340*25=83521-83500=21. So 21 mod25.

n=18: 104976 mod25: 104976 - 4199*25=104976-104975=1. So 1 mod25.

n=19: 130321 mod25: 130321 - 5212*25=130321-130300=21 mod25.

n=21: 194481 mod25: 194481 - 7779*25=194481-194475=6 mod25.

n=22: 234256 mod25: 234256 - 9370*25=234256-234250=6 mod25.

n=23: 279841 mod25: 279841 - 11193*25=279841-279825=16 mod25.

n=24: 331776 mod25: 331776 - 13271*25=331776-331775=1 mod25.

Wait, I'm not seeing any n where n^4 is 24 mod25. So, perhaps there is no such n for p=5, which would mean that the next prime is the one we're looking for.

Wait, but I thought that 5 is the prime where n^4 +1 is divisible by 25. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Let me check n=10: 10^4=10000, which is 0 mod25. So, 10^4 +1=1 mod25, which isn't 0. So, no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try n=5: 5^4=625, which is 0 mod25. So, 625+1=626. 626 mod25: 625 is 0, so 626 is 1 mod25, not 0. So, no.

Wait, maybe I should consider that 5^2=25 divides n^4 +1. So, perhaps n^4 ≡-1 mod25. But if that's impossible, then p=5 is not the prime we're looking for.

So, maybe the next prime, p=13? Wait, wait, let me check p=13, but perhaps I should check p=17 first.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check p=5 again. Maybe I can find a solution. Let me compute n=7, which gives 7^4=2401≡1 mod25. No. How about n=2: 16 mod25. Not 24.

Wait, perhaps n= 5k + something? Let me try n=5k +3. Let me compute n=3: 81 mod25=6. n=8: 4096 mod25=21. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Let's solve n^4 ≡24 mod25.

We can write this as n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

We can use Hensel's lemma to lift solutions from mod5 to mod25.

First, check if there's a solution mod5.

n^4 ≡ -1 mod5. Since -1 mod5 is 4. So, n^4 ≡4 mod5.

Compute n^4 mod5 for n=0,1,2,3,4:

n=0: 0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod5=1
n=3:81 mod5=1
n=4:256 mod5=1.

So, n^4 mod5 is 0 or 1. So, there's no solution mod5 to n^4≡4. Thus, there's no solution mod25 either. So, p=5 is invalid.

Wait, that changes things. So, p=5 is not the prime. Then, the next prime is p=13.

Wait, wait, let me check p=7. Wait, I skipped p=7. So, p=7, p^2=49.

Is there an n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod49? So, n^4 ≡-1 mod49.

Let me try to find such an n.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Hensel's lemma again. Let's check mod7 first.

n^4 ≡-1 mod7. Since -1 mod7 is 6.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=0 to6:

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4
n=4:256 mod7. 256 /7: 7*36=252, so 256 mod7=4.
n=5:625 mod7. 625-7*89=625-623=2. So 2 mod7.
n=6:1296 mod7. 1296 /7= 185*7=1295, so 1296 mod7=1.

So, n^4 mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. So, 6 is not achieved. Therefore, there's no solution mod7, so no solution mod49 either. So, p=7 isn't the prime.

Next prime is p=13. Let me check p=13, p^2=169.

We need to check if there's an n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod169, i.e., n^4 ≡-1 mod169.

Alternatively, let's first check mod13.

n^4 ≡-1 mod13. Since -1 mod13 is 12.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=0 to12:

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod13=3
n=3:81 mod13=3 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3)
n=4:256 mod13: 13*19=247, 256-247=9. So 9.
n=5:625 mod13: 13*48=624, so 625 mod13=1.
n=6:1296 mod13: 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9. So 9.
n=7:2401 mod13: Let's see, 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9. So 9.
n=8:4096 mod13: Let's compute 8^2=64 mod13=12. Then 12^2=144 mod13=1. So, 8^4= (8^2)^2=12^2=1 mod13.
n=9:9^4=(9^2)^2=81^2 mod13. 81 mod13=3, so 3^2=9 mod13.
n=10:10^4=(10^2)^2=100^2 mod13. 100 mod13=9, so 9^2=81 mod13=3.
n=11:11^4=(11^2)^2=121^2 mod13. 121 mod13=4, so 4^2=16 mod13=3.
n=12:12^4=(12^2)^2=144^2 mod13. 144 mod13=1, so 1^2=1 mod13.

So, looking for n^4 ≡12 mod13. From the above, n=5 gives 1, n=8 gives 1, others give 0,3,9,1. So, no n satisfies n^4 ≡12 mod13. Therefore, there's no solution mod13, so no solution mod169 either. Thus, p=13 is not the prime.

Next prime is p=17. Let's check p=17, p^2=289.

We need to check if there's n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod289, i.e., n^4 ≡-1 mod289.

First, check mod17.

n^4 ≡-1 mod17. Since -1 mod17 is 16.

Compute n^4 mod17 for n=0 to16:

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16 mod17=16
n=3:81 mod17=13 (since 17*4=68, 81-68=13)
n=4:256 mod17: 17*15=255, 256-255=1. So, 1.
n=5:625 mod17: 17*36=612, 625-612=13. So,13.
n=6:1296 mod17: Let's compute 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4. So,4.
n=7:2401 mod17: Let's compute 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4. So,4.
n=8:4096 mod17: 17*241=4097, so 4096 mod17= -1 mod17=16.
n=9:6561 mod17: 17*386=6562, so 6561 mod17= -1=16.
n=10:10000 mod17: Let's compute 17*588=10000- let's see, 17*588=17*(500+88)=8500+1496=9996. So, 10000-9996=4. So,4 mod17.
n=11:14641 mod17: Let me compute 14641 /17: 17*862=14654, which is larger than 14641. So, 17*861=14637, 14641-14637=4. So,4 mod17.
n=12:20736 mod17: Let me compute 17*1219=20723, 20736-20723=13. So,13 mod17.
n=13:28561 mod17: 17*1680=28560, 28561-28560=1. So,1 mod17.
n=14:38416 mod17: Let me compute 38416/17. 17*2259=38403, 38416-38403=13. So,13 mod17.
n=15:50625 mod17: Let me compute 17*2978=50626, so 50625 mod17=50625-50626= -1=16 mod17.
n=16:65536 mod17: Let me compute 17*3855=65535, so 65536 mod17=1.

So, looking for n^4 ≡16 mod17. From above, n=2 gives 16, n=8 gives16, n=9 gives16, n=15 gives16. So, these are the possible n mod17.

So, we have solutions mod17. Now, we can try to lift these solutions to mod17^2=289 using Hensel's lemma.

Let me pick n=2 mod17. Let me write n=2 +17k, where k is an integer between 0 and16.

We need to find k such that (2+17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

First, compute (2+17k)^4 mod289. Let me expand this using the binomial theorem.

(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Since 17^2=289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher power will be 0 mod289. So, we can ignore terms beyond the second power.

So, (2 +17k)^4 ≡ 16 + 4*8*(17k) + 6*4*(17k)^2 mod289.

But (17k)^2=289k^2≡0 mod289. So, only the first two terms matter.

So, ≡16 + 4*8*17k mod289.

Compute 4*8=32. So, 32*17=544. So, 544k mod289.

Now, 544 divided by 289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So, 544 ≡255 mod289.

So, (2+17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289.

We need this ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So, 16 +255k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 16 from both sides: 255k ≡272 mod289.

Now, solve for k: 255k ≡272 mod289.

We can write this as 255k ≡272 mod289.

First, check if 255 and 289 are coprime. 289=17^2. 255=3*5*17. So, gcd(255,289)=17.

Since 272 is divisible by 17 (272/17=16), we can divide the equation by 17.

255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17.

So, equation becomes: 15k ≡16 mod17.

Now, solve 15k ≡16 mod17.

We can find the inverse of 15 mod17. 15 and 17 are coprime.

15*x ≡1 mod17.

Testing x=8: 15*8=120 mod17. 17*7=119, so 120-119=1. So, x=8 is the inverse.

So, k ≡16*8 mod17.

16*8=128 mod17. 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So, k≡9 mod17.

So, k=9 +17m, where m is an integer. But since we're working mod289, and k was originally from 0 to16, let's see what k is.

Wait, but in our initial setup, k was between 0 and16 because n=2+17k, and we're working mod289. So, the solution for k is 9 mod17. So, k=9 is the solution.

Therefore, n=2+17*9=2+153=155 mod289.

So, n=155 is a solution mod289. Let's check:

Compute 155^4 +1 mod289.

But let me compute 155 mod17 first: 155/17=9*17=153, so 155≡2 mod17, which matches our earlier solution.

Now, compute 155^4 mod289.

We can compute this as (2+17*9)^4, which we already have:

(2 +17k)^4 ≡16 +255k mod289. With k=9, this is 16 +255*9=16 +2295.

2295 mod289: Let's compute 289*7=2023, 2295-2023=272. So, 16 +272=288 mod289.

So, 288 ≡-1 mod289. Therefore, 155^4 ≡-1 mod289, which means 155^4 +1≡0 mod289.

So, yes, n=155 is a solution.

But wait, the problem asks for the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p^2, where p is the least prime where such an m exists. So, p=17, and m=155.

Wait, but wait, is there a smaller m than 155 that satisfies the condition? Because Hensel's lemma gives us the solution as 155, but maybe a smaller number would work.

Alternatively, let's see if there's a smaller solution. Let me check n=155-289= -134, but that's negative, so we take positive by adding 289: -134 +289=155. So, the smallest positive solution is 155.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Perhaps I should check if a smaller number works.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 155^4 mod289 step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 155 mod289 is 155. Let me compute 155^2 mod289:

155^2 = 24025. Now, 289*83=24047. 24025 is less than that. Let's compute 289*83: 289*80=23120, 289*3=867, total 23120+867=23987. Hmm, perhaps a better way is to compute 24025 /289.

Compute 289*83=23987. 24025-23987=38. So, 155^2 ≡38 mod289.

Then, 155^4 = (155^2)^2 ≡38^2 mod289.

38^2=1444. 289*4=1156. 1444-1156=288. So, 1444 ≡288 mod289.

Which is indeed -1 mod289. So, yes, 155^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Therefore, m=155 is the minimal positive integer such that m^4 +1 is divisible by 17^2=289.

Wait, but is there a smaller positive integer than 155 that satisfies m^4 ≡-1 mod289?

Let me check n=34: 34 mod17=0. So, n=34 would be 0 mod17, which doesn't help because earlier we saw that n=0 mod17 gives n^4=0 mod17, which isn't -1.

Similarly, n=17: 17^4=83521. 83521 mod289: Let's compute 289*289=83521. So, 83521 mod289=0. So, 17^4 +1=1 mod289. Not 0.

Wait, perhaps n=90: 90 mod17=90-5*17=90-85=5. So, 5 mod17. Earlier, n=5 mod17 gives n^4=1 mod17. So, 90^4 would be 1 mod17, which isn't -1. So, no good.

Alternatively, maybe n=85: 85 mod17=0. So, n^4=0 mod17, which is not -1.

Alternatively, perhaps n= 155 is indeed the smallest.

Wait, let me check n=155-17=138: 138 mod17=138-8*17=138-136=2. So, 2 mod17. So, 138^4 mod289: let's compute.

138 mod289=138.

Compute 138^2 mod289:

138^2=19044. Let's compute 19044 divided by289.

289*65=289*(60+5)=17340 +1445=18785.

19044-18785=259. So, 138^2 ≡259 mod289.

Then, 138^4= (138^2)^2 ≡259^2 mod289.

Compute 259^2=67081. Now, 289*232=289*(200+32)=57800 +9248=67048.

67081-67048=33. So, 259^2 ≡33 mod289.

So, 138^4 ≡33 mod289, which isn't -1. So, no.

Similarly, n=155-34=121: 121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2 mod17. So, 121^4 mod289.

Compute 121 mod289=121.

121^2=14641. 14641 mod289: Let's compute 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. So, 121^2≡191 mod289.

Then, 121^4=191^2 mod289.

191^2=36481. Now, 289*126=289*(120+6)=34680 +1734=36414.

36481-36414=67. So, 191^2≡67 mod289. Not -1.

Hmm, perhaps n=155 is indeed the smallest solution.

Wait, another approach: Since n=2 mod17, the minimal solution is 2 mod17, but to get n^4≡-1 mod289, we needed to lift it to n=155 mod289. So, 155 is the minimal positive integer in this case.

So, the least prime p is 17, and the least m is 155.

Wait, but I thought earlier that p=5 could be a candidate, but since there's no solution mod5, then p=17 is the next possible prime.

So, the answer is m=155.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, we determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

1. **Checking small primes:**
   - For \( p = 2 \), \( p^2 = 4 \). Checking \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 4, we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
   - For \( p = 3 \), \( p^2 = 9 \). Checking \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 9, we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).
   - For \( p = 5 \), \( p^2 = 25 \). Checking \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 25, we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 25 \).
   - For \( p = 7 \), \( p^2 = 49 \). Checking \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 7 and 49, we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 49 \).
   - For \( p = 13 \), \( p^2 = 169 \). Checking \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 13 and 169, we find no \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 169 \).

2. **Checking \( p = 17 \), \( p^2 = 289 \):**
   - First, check modulo 17. We find that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \) has solutions \( n \equiv 2, 8, 9, 15 \mod 17 \).
   - Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution \( n \equiv 2 \mod 17 \) to modulo 289. We find \( n = 155 \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \).

3. **Verification:**
   - Compute \( 155^4 + 1 \mod 289 \) to confirm it is divisible by 289. The calculations confirm \( 155^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \).

Thus, the least prime \( p \) is 17, and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is 155.

**Answer:**  
The least positive integer \( m \) is \(\boxed{155}\).
