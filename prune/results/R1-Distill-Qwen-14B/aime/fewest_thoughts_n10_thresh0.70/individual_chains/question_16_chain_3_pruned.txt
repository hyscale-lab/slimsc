Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That suggests that the order of n modulo p is 8. But wait, the order must divide p-1 because of Fermat's little theorem, right? So, 8 divides p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8. That's a start. So primes like 17, 97, etc., are candidates. But the problem is asking for primes p² dividing n⁴+1. So it's not just p dividing n⁴+1, but p² as well.

I think this brings in Hensel's lemma or lifting the exponent lemma. Maybe I can use some properties of modular arithmetic here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². Hmm, so n has an order dividing 8 modulo p². But does it have order 8? Or maybe not, because the multiplicative order modulo p² is different from that modulo p.

I recall that if p is an odd prime, and if p divides n² + 1, then n² ≡ -1 mod p² might have solutions under certain conditions. But wait, in our case, it's n⁴ + 1. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². For that, I think I need to consider the conditions under which x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. So, maybe I should start by looking for small primes and see if they satisfy this condition.

Let me try small primes first. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
