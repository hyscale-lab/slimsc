Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation xⁿ = 1. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, which means ω¹³ = 1, and ωᵏ ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. Also, the minimal polynomial for primitive roots is the cyclotomic polynomial, Φ₁₃(x), which is of degree 12 because 13 is prime.

The product given is over k from 0 to 12. But wait, when k=0, ω⁰ = 1. So the term when k=0 is (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. Hmm, so that term is just 1. So maybe the product simplifies a bit because of that.

So the product becomes 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). So now I can focus on that part.

Let me denote f(ω) = 2 - 2ω + ω². So for each k from 1 to 12, I have f(ωᵏ). So the product is the product of f(ωᵏ) for k=1 to 12.

Wait, since ω is a primitive 13th root, ωᵏ for k=1 to 12 are all the other roots. So maybe I can consider this product as evaluating some polynomial at specific points.

I recall that the product over (x - ωᵏ) for k=1 to 12 is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x), which is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating such a polynomial.

But in this case, each term is f(ωᵏ) = 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. So I need to find a way to express this as a product over f(ωᵏ). Maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are ωᵏ, and then relate the product to that polynomial evaluated at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate f(ωᵏ). Let me see:

f(ωᵏ) = 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let me factor this expression:

Hmm, 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let me write it as ω²ᵏ - 2ωᵏ + 2. Wait, that's a quadratic in ωᵏ. Maybe I can factor it:

Let me let y = ωᵏ. Then f(y) = y² - 2y + 2. Let's check if this factors: discriminant is (2)² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So it's (y - [1 + i])(y - [1 - i]).

So f(y) = (y - (1 + i))(y - (1 - i)). So then, f(ωᵏ) = (ωᵏ - (1 + i))(ωᵏ - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product over k=1 to 12 of f(ωᵏ) is equal to the product over k=1 to 12 of (ωᵏ - (1 + i))(ωᵏ - (1 - i)).

So that's [product over k=1 to 12 (ωᵏ - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product over k=1 to 12 (ωᵏ - (1 - i))].

Wait,
