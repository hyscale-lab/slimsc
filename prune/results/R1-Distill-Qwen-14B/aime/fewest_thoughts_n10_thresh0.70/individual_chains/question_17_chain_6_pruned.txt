Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set B. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The final answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I need to find p+q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. So given SA=54 and V=23, I can probably write equations involving l, w, h.

Wait, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Oh right, because the sphere needs to enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere is the longest distance in the box, which is the space diagonal. So the radius r would be half of that.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in set B, then r would be half of that, and r squared would be (diagonal^2)/4. But wait, no, actually, the space diagonal is sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2). So r^2 would be (l^2 + w^2 + h^2)/4.

But wait, I need to find the minimal r such that all boxes in B fit inside the sphere. So actually, I think I need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal across all boxes in B and then take half of that as r. So r squared would be (max diagonal^2)/4.

But how do I find the maximum diagonal? Because for different boxes with the same surface area and volume, the diagonal can vary. So I need to find the maximum possible l^2 + w^2 + h^2 given that 2(lw + lh + wh)=54 and lwh=23.

Hmm, okay, so I have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 ⇒ lw + lh + wh = 27
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the maximum of l^2 + w^2 + h^2. Wait, but l, w, h are positive real numbers.

I remember that for three variables, l^2 + w^2 + h^2 can be expressed in terms of (l + w + h)^2 - 2(lw + lh + wh). So that would be (l + w + h)^2 - 2*27 = (l + w + h)^2 - 54.

So if I can find the maximum of (l + w + h)^2, then I can find the maximum of l^2 + w^2 + h^2.

Wait, but is that correct? Because l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = (l + w + h)^2 - 2(lw + lh + wh) = (l + w + h)^2 - 54.

So to maximize l^2 + w^2 + h^2, I need to maximize (l + w + h)^2. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (l + w + h)^2 given the constraints.

Hmm, but how? I think I can use methods from optimization, like Lagrange multipliers, but since this is a problem likely solvable with algebra, maybe I can find a relationship between l, w, h.

Alternatively, I can think of the problem in terms of symmetric variables. Let me consider that for maximum diagonal, the box might not be symmetric, but perhaps two sides are equal? Or maybe it's a cube?

Wait, a cube has all sides equal, but given that the surface area and volume are fixed, it's unlikely to be a cube. Let me check: For a cube, SA would be 6s^2=54 ⇒ s^2=9 ⇒ s=3. Volume would be s^3=27, but our volume is 23, which is less. So the cube case isn't applicable here.

So, the box isn't a cube. Hmm. I need another approach.

Maybe I can express l, w, h in terms of variables that can be optimized. Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h. So, we have:

1. xy + xz + yz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

I recall that for symmetric expressions, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that.

Let f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz = 27
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it. Let me assume x = y = a, and z = b. So the box is a square prism.

Then, the constraints become:

1. a^2 + 2ab = 27
2. a^2 b = 23

Let me solve for b from the second equation: b = 23/(a^2)

Substituting into the first equation:

a^2 + 2a*(23/(a^2)) = 27 ⇒ a^2 + (46/a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a: a^3 + 46 = 27a ⇒ a^3 -27a +46=0

Hmm, solve for a: a^3 -27a +46=0

Looking for rational roots, possible candidates are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0

a=2: 8 -54 +46=0 → Yes, a=2 is a root.

So, factor the polynomial: (a-2)(a^2 + 2a -23)=0

So, the other roots are from a^2 +2a -23=0 → a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since a must be positive, a= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a values are 2 and (-1 +2√6). Let's check if a=2 gives a valid solution.

If a=2, then from b=23/(a^2)=23/4=5.75. So the sides are 2,2,5.75. Let's compute l^2 +w^2 +h^2 = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 +33.0625=41.0625.

Wait, but if a= -1 +2√6≈3.898, then b=23/(a^2)=23/( ( -1 +2√6 )^2 )

Let me compute a^2: ( -1 +2√6 )^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6 ≈25 -9.798≈15.202

Then b≈23/15.202≈1.513.

So x=y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Compute l^2 +w^2 +h^2≈ (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.513)^2≈15.198 +15.198 +2.289≈32.685.

Hmm, so in this case, the sum is smaller than the case when a=2. So, if we take a=2, the sum is larger (41.0625). So perhaps the maximum occurs when two sides are equal and the third is different, specifically when a=2.

But wait, is this the maximum possible?

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when all three variables are different. But how can I be sure?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers for three variables.

So, we have f(x,y,z)=x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + xz + yz=27

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23

We can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - λ(xy + xz + yz -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Take partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) =0

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) =0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) =0

And the constraints:

xy + xz + yz=27

xyz=23

So, we have a system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)
4. xy + xz + yz=27
5. xyz=23

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can assume symmetry. Suppose that two variables are equal, say x=y. Then, perhaps we can find a solution.

Let’s set x=y=a, then z=b.

So, the equations become:

From equation 1 and 2, since x=y, equations 1 and 2 should be equal.

Equation 1: 2a = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)
Equation 2: 2a = λ(a + b) + μ(ab) → same as equation 1, so consistent.

Equation 3: 2b = λ(2a) + μ(a^2)

Constraints:

Equation 4: a^2 + 2ab =27
Equation 5: a^2 b=23

So, from equation 5: b=23/(a^2)

Substitute into equation 4: a^2 + 2a*(23/(a^2))=27 → same as earlier.

Which gives a^3 -27a +46=0, which we've already solved, with roots a=2 and a=-1 ±2√6. So a=2 and a≈3.898.

Now, from equation 3: 2b = 2λ a + μ a^2

But from equation 1: 2a = λ(a + b) + μ a b

Let me denote equation 1 as: 2a = λ(a + b) + μ a b → equation (A)

Equation 3: 2b = 2λ a + μ a^2 → equation (B)

Let me write equation (A) as:

2a = λ(a + b) + μ a b → equation (A)

Equation (B) as:

2b = 2λ a + μ a^2 → equation (B)

Let me try to solve for λ and μ from these two.

From equation (A):

λ(a + b) = 2a - μ a b → λ = [2a - μ a b]/(a + b)

Substitute λ into equation (B):

2b = 2 * [ (2a - μ a b)/(a + b) ] * a + μ a^2

Let me compute each term:

First term: 2 * [ (2a - μ a b)/(a + b) ] * a = 2a*(2a - μ a b)/(a + b) = [4a^2 - 2 μ a^2 b]/(a + b)

Second term: μ a^2

So equation (B) becomes:

2b = [4a^2 - 2 μ a^2 b]/(a + b) + μ a^2

Multiply both sides by (a + b) to eliminate denominator:

2b(a + b) = 4a^2 - 2 μ a^2 b + μ a^2 (a + b)

Expand left side: 2ab + 2b^2

Right side: 4a^2 - 2 μ a^2 b + μ a^3 + μ a^2 b = 4a^2 + μ a^3

So, equation becomes:

2ab + 2b^2 = 4a^2 + μ a^3

Let me rearrange:

μ a^3 = 2ab + 2b^2 -4a^2

So, μ = [2ab + 2b^2 -4a^2]/a^3

Simplify numerator:

Factor out 2b: 2b(a + b) -4a^2

Wait, 2ab + 2b^2 = 2b(a + b). So:

μ = [2b(a + b) -4a^2]/a^3 = [2b(a + b) -4a^2]/a^3

Now, substitute b=23/(a^2) into this expression:

μ = [ 2*(23/a^2)*(a + 23/a^2) -4a^2 ] /a^3

Compute term by term:

First term: 2*(23/a^2)*(a + 23/a^2) = 2*(23/a^2)*(a) + 2*(23/a^2)*(23/a^2) = 46/a + (529)/a^4

Second term: -4a^2

So numerator:

46/a + 529
