Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let's understand what the problem is asking. We need a four-digit number N. So N is between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing that digit with 1 should give us a number that's a multiple of 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where Q is N divided by 1000 and R is the remainder. So, for example, if N is 9876, then Q is 9 and R is 876, so Q + R is 885.

Okay, so let's break this down. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being from 1 to 9 and B, C, D from 0 to 9.

The property says that if we replace any one digit with 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, replacing A with 1 should give us a number (1BCD) divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD divisible by 7, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D divisible by 7, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1 divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Hmm, so we can write four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our job is to find the largest ABCD that satisfies all four conditions.

Since we want the largest possible N, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find such a number. But since this is a mathematical problem, there must be a smarter way than brute-forcing each number.

Let me think about how the modulo 7 condition works. Each of these modified numbers must be 0 mod 7, so perhaps we can express each condition in terms of the original number N.

Let's express N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we replace A with 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Replacing C with 1 gives N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Replacing D with 1 gives N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N itself is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, which we can call N.

Let me see if we can relate N to each of these modified numbers.

For N1: N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N1 = N - 1000A + 1000*1.

Wait, that's N - 1000(A - 1).

Similarly, N1 = N - 1000(A - 1).

But since N1 must be divisible by 7, then N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which implies N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, for N2: N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N2 = N - 100B + 100.

So, N2 = N - 100(B - 1).

Again, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, so N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which implies N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7.

Similarly for N3: N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Which is N - 10C + 10.

So, N3 = N - 10(C - 1).

Thus, N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7.

And for N4: N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Which is N - D + 1.

So, N4 = N - (D - 1).

Thus, N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

So, summarizing the four conditions:

1. N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7

2. N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7

3. N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7

4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

But N is the same in all these, so all four expressions must be congruent modulo 7.

So, 1000(A - 1) ≡ 100(B - 1) ≡ 10(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

Hmm, that's a key insight. So, all four of these expressions must be congruent modulo 7.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's calculate 1000 ÷ 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, as 10-7=3.

And 1 mod7 is 1.

So, substituting:

1. 1000(A -1) mod7 is 6*(A -1) mod7.

2. 100(B-1) mod7 is 2*(B -1) mod7.

3. 10*(C -1) mod7 is 3*(C -1) mod7.

4. (D -1) mod7.

All these must be equal modulo7. Let me denote this common value as K mod7. So,

6*(A -1) ≡ 2*(B -1) ≡ 3*(C -1) ≡ (D -1) ≡ K mod7.

So, each of these expressions equals K modulo7.

Therefore, we can write equations:

6*(A -1) ≡ K mod7,

2*(B -1) ≡ K mod7,

3*(C -1) ≡ K mod7,

(D -1) ≡ K mod7.

So, K is the same for all four.

Our goal is to find the largest N=ABCD such that all four conditions are satisfied for some K.

But since we need the largest N, perhaps we can find the largest possible A, then B, etc., ensuring that these equations hold.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can express each digit in terms of K.

Let me see:

From the first equation:

6*(A -1) ≡ K mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod7. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, since 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, A-1 ≡ 6K mod7.

Similarly, from the second equation:

2*(B -1) ≡ K mod7.

The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, B-1 ≡4K mod7.

Third equation:

3*(C -1) ≡ K mod7.

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C-1 ≡5K mod7.

Fourth equation:

D -1 ≡ K mod7.

So, D ≡ K +1 mod7.

So, now we can express each digit in terms of K.

Let me write each in terms of K:

A = (6K +1) mod7

Wait, no. A-1 ≡6K mod7 → A ≡ (6K +1) mod7.

Similarly,

B ≡ (4K +1) mod7,

C ≡ (5K +1) mod7,

D ≡ (K +1) mod7.

But A, B, C, D are digits. So for each digit, we have:

A is from 1 to9, so A ≡ (6K +1) mod7. But A must be an integer from 1 to9, so A is the smallest non-negative integer ≡ (6K +1) mod7 and ≥1.

Similarly, B is from0-9, so B ≡ (4K +1) mod7.

Same for C: C ≡ (5K +1) mod7.

D is from0-9, D ≡ (K +1) mod7.

But since all digits must be as large as possible (since we want the largest N), perhaps we can find K such that when we compute these expressions, the digits A, B, C, D are as large as possible.

But wait, K is mod7, so K can be from 0 to
