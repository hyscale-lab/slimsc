Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P(a,0) to Q(0,b), where a and b are positive real numbers. The length of PQ is 1, so sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1. That means a^2 + b^2 = 1, right?

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. That makes sense.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that is not on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed in F.

So, C is a point on AB, somewhere between A and B, but not equal to A or B. The key property is that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, first, maybe I should parametrize segment AB and find the coordinates of point C. Then, I need to ensure that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, perhaps I can find the condition under which a point on AB is not on any other PQ in F.

Let me start by parametrizing AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write the parametric equations for AB. Let's let t be a parameter between 0 and 1. When t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B.

So, the coordinates of a general point C on AB can be written as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t )

Now, I need to find the value of t for which C is not on any other PQ in F. That is, for any other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

So, let's consider another segment PQ in F. Let P be (a, 0) and Q be (0, b) with a^2 + b^2 = 1. The equation of PQ is x/a + y/b = 1, right? Because it's a straight line from (a, 0) to (0, b).

So, the equation is x/a + y/b = 1. We can rearrange this as bx + ay = ab.

Now, for point C = (x, y) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy this equation: b x + a y = a b.

But since C is on AB, its coordinates are expressed in terms of t as above. So, substituting x and y:

b*( (1/2)(1 - t) ) + a*( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) = a b

Let me write that equation:

b*( (1 - t)/2 ) + a*( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) = a b

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

b(1 - t) + a (sqrt(3) t) = 2 a b

Now, I can rearrange this equation:

b - b t + a sqrt(3) t = 2 a b

Bring all terms to one side:

b + (a sqrt(3) - b) t - 2 a b = 0

Hmm, so that's an equation in terms of t, but a and b are related by a^2 + b^2 = 1.

Wait, but for C to lie on PQ, this equation must hold for some a and b with a^2 + b^2 = 1. So, for each t, we have an equation that must be satisfied by some a and b. However, we want to find the t for which there exists no such a and b except when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is part of F, so when PQ is AB, then a = 1/2 and b = sqrt(3)/2. So, in that case, the equation must hold. But for other PQs, we need that the equation does not hold for any a and b except when PQ is AB.

So, perhaps the point C is such that the equation:

b(1 - t) + a sqrt(3) t = 2 a b

has no solution (a, b) other than a = 1/2 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but I might be approaching this the wrong way. Let me think again.

We need to ensure that the point C is not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ, the point C does not lie on it.

So, if I can find a t such that the equation b(1 - t) + a sqrt(3) t = 2 a b has no solution (a, b) with a^2 + b^2 = 1 except when (a, b) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), then that t would correspond to point C.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this as an optimization problem. For each point C on AB, the minimal distance from C to some segment PQ in F. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each point C on AB, except A and B, we can find the set of segments PQ in F that pass through C. If for some C, this set is only AB, then that's our point.

So, to find such a C, we need that the line through C and some P on x-axis and Q on y-axis with PQ of length 1 is only AB. So, the system of equations has only one solution, which is PQ = AB.

So, perhaps we can set up the equation for a general PQ passing through C, and find the t such that the only solution is (a, b) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, let's write down the equation again:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 2 a b

We can rearrange this:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t - 2 a b = 0

Let me write it as:

b*(1 - t - 2a) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, let me write it as:

b*(1 - t) = a*(2b - sqrt(3) t)

So, b = [a (2b - sqrt(3) t)] / (1 - t)

Wait, but that seems a bit circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Wait, let me consider a and b as variables with a^2 + b^2 = 1. So, for a given t, the equation is linear in a and b.

Let me write the equation again:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 2 a b

Let me rearrange terms:

b*(1 - t - 2a) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 0

Hmm. So, this is a linear equation in a and b, but with a coefficient involving a in the first term. That complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation as:

b*(1 - t) = a*(2b - sqrt(3)*t)

Then, divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠ 0, which it isn't since Q is on the y-axis and in the first quadrant):

1 - t = a*(2 - (sqrt(3)*t)/b )

But since a^2 + b^2 =1, perhaps we can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Alternatively, let me think of this as a system of two equations:

1. a^2 + b^2 = 1

2. b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 2 a b

We can try to solve this system for a and b. For a given t, we can attempt to find solutions (a, b). We want to find t such that this system has only the solution (a, b) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). For all other t, perhaps there are other solutions.

So, let's attempt to solve this system.

From equation 2:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 2 a b

Let me rearrange:

b*(1 - t - 2a) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 0

Hmm, maybe express this as:

b*(1 - t - 2a) = -a sqrt(3) t

So,

b = [ -a sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2a )

But this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps express a in terms of b.

Wait, let me take equation 2:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t = 2 a b

Let me bring all terms to one side:

b*(1 - t) + a*sqrt(3)*t - 2 a b = 0

Factor terms with a:

a*(sqrt(3) t - 2 b) + b*(1 - t) = 0

So,

a*(sqrt(3) t - 2 b) = -b*(1 - t)

So,

a = [ -b*(1 - t) ] / (sqrt(3) t - 2 b )

Hmm, perhaps substitute this into equation 1: a^2 + b^2 = 1.

So,

[ (-b (1 - t) ) / (sqrt(3) t - 2 b) ]^2 + b^2 = 1

This looks complicated, but maybe I can write it as:

[ b^2 (1 - t)^2 ] / (sqrt(3) t - 2 b)^2 + b^2 = 1

Let me write this as:

b^2 [ (1 - t)^2 / (sqrt(3) t - 2 b)^2 + 1 ] = 1

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe cross-multiplying:

Let me denote denominator as D = (sqrt(3) t - 2 b )

So, equation becomes:

b^2 (1 - t)^2 + b^2 D^2 = D^2

So,

b^2 [ (1 - t)^2 + D^2 ] = D^2

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the original equation after substitution is:

[ a ]^2 + b^2 = 1

Which is [ (-b(1 - t)/D ) ]^2 + b^2 = 1

So, [ b^2 (1 - t)^2 ] / D^2 + b^2 = 1

Factor b^2:

b^2 [ (1 - t)^2 / D^2 + 1 ] = 1

Which is:

b^2 [ ( (1 - t)^2 + D^2 ) / D^2 ] = 1

But D = sqrt(3) t - 2 b, so D^2 = (sqrt(3) t - 2 b)^2 = 3 t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2

So,

(1 - t)^2 + D^2 = (1 - 2t + t^2) + (3 t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2 ) 

Which is:

1 - 2t + t^2 + 3 t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2

Combine like terms:

1 - 2t + (1 + 3) t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2

So, 1 - 2t + 4 t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2

So, putting this back into the equation:

b^2 [ (1 - 2t + 4 t^2 - 4 sqrt(3) t b + 4 b^2 ) / D^2 ] = 1

Hmm, getting a bit too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, since we know that AB is in F, and any other PQ in F will intersect AB at some point C only if C is on both PQ and AB. But we want C to be on AB but not on any other PQ in F. So, perhaps the point C is such that the line PQ is tangent to AB at C. Wait, but AB is a straight line, so if PQ is another segment in F, unless PQ is AB, it can't be tangent. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait another thought: For each point C on AB (except A and B), the set of segments PQ in F passing through C is a set of lines through C intersecting the x-axis at P and y-axis at Q, with PQ of length 1. We need to find a point C where this set is empty except for PQ=AB.

So, perhaps for each C, there is at most one PQ in F passing through it. But for most points, there might be two such segments, except for some special point where only one exists.

Wait, this is similar to the concept of envelope of lines. The set of all such PQ lines in F would form a curve, and points on AB that are not on this envelope would lie on only one such PQ, while points on the envelope would lie on infinitely many. Hmm, but I'm not too sure.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of dual curves. The family F consists of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a^2 + b^2 =1. So, a and b lie on the unit circle. So, the envelope of these lines can be found by eliminating a and b.

Wait, maybe I can find the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. So, if I can find this envelope, then points on AB that lie on the envelope would be the points where AB is tangent to the envelope. But maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a circle. Let me see.

Given the family of lines x/a + y/b = 1, with a^2 + b^2 =1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we have two equations:

F(a,b,x,y) = x/a + y/b -1 = 0

and the derivative with respect to a parameter. Wait, but here a and b are related by a^2 + b^2 =1, so maybe we can parameterize a and b in terms of an angle θ.

Let me set a = cos θ, b = sin θ, since a^2 + b^2 =1.

So, the equation of the line becomes x / cos θ + y / sin θ = 1.

Now, to find the envelope, we can take the derivative of F with respect to θ and set it equal to zero.

So, dF/dθ = -x sin θ / cos^2 θ - y cos θ / sin^2 θ = 0

So,

-x sin θ / cos^2 θ - y cos θ / sin^2 θ = 0

Multiply both sides by cos^2 θ sin^2 θ to eliminate denominators:

- x sin^3 θ - y cos^3 θ = 0

So,

x sin^3 θ + y cos^3 θ = 0

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the envelope equation.

Wait, another method: The envelope satisfies both F(a,b,x,y)=0 and dF/da = 0, but in this case, since a and b are related by a constraint, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, since a = cos θ and b = sin θ, the line equation is x sec θ + y csc θ =1.

So, x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1.

The envelope is found by solving this equation together with its derivative with respect to θ set to zero.

So, the derivative d/dθ (x / cos θ + y / sin θ -1 ) =0.

Which is x sin θ / cos^2 θ + y (-cos θ) / sin^2 θ =0.

So,

x sin θ / cos^2 θ = y cos θ / sin^2 θ

Simplify:

x sin^3 θ = y cos^3 θ

So,

(x / y) = (cos^3 θ / sin^3 θ ) = (cot θ)^3

Let me denote cot θ = k. Then, x / y = k^3.

Also, from the original line equation:

x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1.

Express cos θ and sin θ in terms of k.

Since cot θ = k, then cos θ = k sin θ.

Also, cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ =1 => k^2 sin^2 θ + sin^2 θ =1 => sin^2 θ (1 + k^2 )=1 => sin θ = 1 / sqrt(1 + k^2 )

Thus, cos θ = k / sqrt(1 + k^2 )

So, substituting into the line equation:

x / (k / sqrt(1 + k^2 )) + y / (1 / sqrt(1 + k^2 )) =1

Simplify:

x * sqrt(1 + k^2 ) / k + y * sqrt(1 + k^2 ) =1

Factor sqrt(1 + k^2 ):

sqrt(1 + k^2 ) (x / k + y ) =1

So,

sqrt(1 + k^2 ) = 1 / (x / k + y )

Now, square both sides:

1 + k^2 = 1 / (x/k + y )^2

Let me write this as:

( x/k + y )^2 (1 + k^2 ) =1

But (x /k + y )^2 = (x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y /k + y^2 )

Multiplying by (1 +k^2):

(x^2 /k^2 + 2 x y /k + y^2 )(1 +k^2 ) =1

This seems quite involved. Maybe expand it:

x^2 (1 +k^2 ) /k^2 + 2x y (1 +k^2 ) /k + y^2 (1 +k^2 ) =1

Hmm, perhaps this is too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another approach: The envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a^2 + b^2 =1 is a circle called the envelope circle. I remember that the envelope of such lines is a circle with radius 1/2, centered at (1/2, 1/2). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the unit circle. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps I should parametrize the envelope differently. Let's think in terms of x and y. Let me write the equation x cos θ + y sin θ = cos θ + sin θ. Wait, no, because x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1. Let me write it as x sec θ + y csc θ =1.

Wait, perhaps if I square both sides and use the identity sec^2 θ =1 + tan^2 θ, etc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write x sec θ + y csc θ =1 as:

x / cos θ + y / sin θ =1

Multiply both sides by sin θ cos θ:

x sin θ + y cos θ = sin θ cos θ

Hmm, but this seems similar to what I had before.

Wait, perhaps using the method of resultants. The envelope is found by eliminating θ between the two equations:

x sin θ + y cos θ = sin θ cos θ

and

x sin^3 θ = y cos^3 θ

Wait, from earlier, we had x sin^3 θ = y cos^3 θ.

So, let me write x sin^3 θ = y cos^3 θ as (x/y) = (cos^3 θ)/(sin^3 θ) = (cot θ)^3

So, cot θ = (x/y)^{1/3}

So, tan θ = (y/x)^{1/3}

So, sin θ = (y)^{1/3} / sqrt( (y)^{2/3} + (x)^{2/3} )

Similarly, cos θ = (x)^{1/3} / sqrt( (x)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3} )

Wait, perhaps using the expression tan θ = (y/x)^{1/3}, so sin θ = (y)^{1/3} / sqrt( (x)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3} )

But this is getting messy. Alternatively, perhaps let me set u = x^{1/3}, v = y^{1/3}. Then, tan θ = v/u.

So, sin θ = v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ), cos θ = u / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Then, substituting into the equation x sin θ + y cos θ = sin θ cos θ:

x [ v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ) ] + y [ u / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ) ] = [ v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ) ] [ u / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ) ]

Simplify left side:

( x v + y u ) / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Right side:

u v / (u^2 + v^2 )

So,

( x v + y u ) / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ) = u v / (u^2 + v^2 )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ):

x v + y u = u v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Hmm, but x = u^3, y = v^3.

So, substituting x = u^3, y = v^3:

u^3 v + v^3 u = u v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Factor left side:

u v (u^2 + v^2 ) = u v / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Assuming u v ≠0 (since x and y are positive), we can divide both sides by u v:

u^2 + v^2 = 1 / sqrt(u^2 + v^2 )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(u^2 + v^2 ):

(u^2 + v^2 )^(3/2) =1

So,

u^2 + v^2 =1

But u = x^{1/3}, v = y^{1/3}

So,

(x^{1/3})^2 + (y^{1/3})^2 =1

Which is:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1

So, the envelope is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

That's a known curve. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Therefore, any point on AB that lies on this astroid is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, to find point C, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The parametric equation of AB is:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

We can write AB in terms of a line equation.

Let me find the equation of AB. Since it goes from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3)

So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. Plugging in point A (1/2,0):

0 = -sqrt(3)(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, to find the point of tangency between this line and the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

We can use the condition that the line is tangent to the astroid. So, substituting y from the line into the astroid equation and ensuring that the system has exactly one solution.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1:

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^{2/3} =1

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe we can parametrize the astroid and find the point where AB is tangent.

The astroid can be parametrized as:

x = cos^3 θ

y = sin^3 θ

for θ in [0, 2π)

So, the derivative dy/dx for the astroid is found by differentiating y and x with respect to θ:

dx/dθ = -3 cos^2 θ sin θ

dy/dθ = 3 sin^2 θ cos θ

So, dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ) = [3 sin^2 θ cos θ ] / [ -3 cos^2 θ sin θ ] = - sin θ / cos θ = -tan θ

So, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at parameter θ is -tan θ.

Now, the equation of the tangent line at θ is:

(y - sin^3 θ) = (-tan θ)(x - cos^3 θ )

We know that this tangent line must coincide with AB, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the slope of the tangent line is -sqrt(3). Therefore,

-tan θ = -sqrt(3) => tan θ = sqrt(3) => θ = π/3 or 4π/3.

But since the astroid is in the first quadrant (as x and y are positive), θ is in the first quadrant. So, θ = π/3.

So, at θ = π/3, the point on the astroid is:

x = cos^3(π/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8

y = sin^3(π/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8

So, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

But wait, is this point on AB?

Let me check if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) lies on AB.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plugging x =1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 )= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Yes, so the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) lies on AB and is the point of tangency with the astroid.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Therefore, OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2.

Calculating this:

(1/64) + (27/64) = (1 +27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So, OC^2 is 7/16, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me just verify.

Wait, the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1 is indeed the envelope of the family F, so the point C is where AB is tangent to this astroid. We found that to be at θ=π/3, giving point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), which is on AB.

So, yes, OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So, the answer is 7 +16=23.


To solve the problem, we first note that the family $\mathcal{F}$ consists of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\overline{PQ}$ lies in the first quadrant and satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ where $P = (a, 0)$ and $Q = (0, b)$. The equation of such a segment is $\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1$.

The line segment $\overline{AB}$ is part of $\mathcal{F}$ since $A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ have a distance of 1. The parametric equation of $\overline{AB}$ is given by:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2}(1 - t), \quad y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t
\]
for $t \in [0, 1]$.

We seek a point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ that does not lie on any other segment from $\mathcal{F}$ except $\overline{AB}$. This point $C$ is the unique point where $\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the envelope of the family $\mathcal{F}$. The envelope of the family of lines $\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1$ with $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ is found to be the astroid $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.

To find the point of tangency, we parameterize the astroid as $x = \cos^3\theta$, $y = \sin^3\theta$. The slope of the tangent to the astroid at any point $\theta$ is $-\tan\theta$. The line $\overline{AB}$ has the equation $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which has a slope of $-\sqrt{3}$. Thus, we set $-\tan\theta = -\sqrt{3}$, giving $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

At $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$, the point on the astroid is:
\[
x = \cos^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}, \quad y = \sin^3\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
This point $(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8})$ lies on $\overline{AB}$ and is the unique point $C$ not on any other segment from $\mathcal{F}$.

Finally, the distance squared from $O$ to $C$ is:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, giving $p + q = 23$.

$\boxed{23}$
