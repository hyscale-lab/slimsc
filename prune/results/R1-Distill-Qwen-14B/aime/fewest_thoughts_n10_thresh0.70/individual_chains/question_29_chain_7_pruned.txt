Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given the lengths BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let's try to visualize the problem. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. The sides BC and FG are given, as well as AB and EF. Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16 (so AD = 16 as well)
- AB = 107 (so CD = 107)
- FG = 17 (since EF is given as 184, so FG is 17 meaning GH is 17)
- EF = 184 (so EH = 184)

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So that line must pass through D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe a different order. Wait, it depends on how the rectangles are placed. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, and their sides are given, perhaps they are aligned in a way that some sides are parallel.

Wait, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So four points lying on a circle, which means they are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That should give us some properties to work with, perhaps using cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let's assume rectangle ABCD is placed such that AB is horizontal, BC is vertical. So, point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Then rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, perhaps placed somewhere such that D, E, C, F are on a straight line
