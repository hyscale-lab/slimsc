Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in Aimeville and their ownership of various items. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem states that there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The counts for these are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Also, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these four items, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items.

Hmm, so I remember from set theory that we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve problems like this. But wait, this isn't just about three sets; it's four because each resident owns a bag of candy hearts as well. So, candy hearts are like a fourth item that's owned by everyone, right? So, actually, maybe all residents are in the set for candy hearts.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, the 900 residents each own a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal in this context. So, the problem is about four sets: A (diamond rings), B (golf clubs), C (garden spades), and D (candy hearts). Since every resident owns D, the total number of residents is the same as the size of set D. So, |D| = 900.

But the problem mentions ownership of exactly two and exactly three items. Let me make sure I understand the given data correctly. 

So, the counts for each item are:
- |A| = 195
- |B| = 367
- |C| = 562
- |D| = 900

But since D is universal, it's the total population. So, when we talk about residents owning exactly two or three items, are they referring to the other three items (A, B, C) or including D as well?

Wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, when it mentions that 437 own exactly two things, that must include D as one of the items. Similarly, 23
