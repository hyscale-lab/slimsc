Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with tokens. There's a stack of n tokens, and they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner, assuming he plays optimally.

Hmm, so this is a game theory problem. It's about determining the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win, right? So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, which would mean it's a winning position for Bob.

To model this, I think I should figure out the pattern of winning and losing positions. Let's denote W as a winning position and L as a losing position.

Let me try to list out the positions for small n and see the pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is W. Bob can't do anything here because Alice already took the last token.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, then Bob is left with 1 token. Bob can take that 1 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but she can't because there's only 2 tokens. So Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. So Bob can take the last token and win. Wait, that would mean n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Because whatever she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is L.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if Alice is at n=2, and she takes 1, Bob is left with 1, which he can take and win. So Alice can't win in that case. So n=2 is an L position.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So Bob is now in an L position, meaning Alice can force Bob into a losing position. So n
