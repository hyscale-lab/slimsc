Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number, N, that has a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The problem says it's the greatest such number with the given property. So, I probably need to find the largest possible four-digit number where changing any single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7.

Let me think about the digits of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number with digits a, b, c, d. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Now, if I change any one of these digits to 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. That means, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number that's a multiple of 7.

So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 and keeping the others the same should result in a number divisible by 7. Therefore, for each position, the original number N must satisfy a certain condition related to divisibility by 7.

Let me formalize this. Let's say we replace the thousands digit a with 1. Then the new number is 1bcd. This number, 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d, must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit b with 1 gives a number a1cd, which is 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d, and this must be divisible by 7. The same goes for replacing c and d with 1.

So, for each digit, replacing it with 1 must result in a number that is 0 modulo 7. Therefore, N must be such that:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But wait, actually, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. When we replace a digit with 1, that's equivalent to N - (original digit) * (place value) + 1 * (place value). So, for each digit, the modified number is N - digit*place + 1*place = N + (1 - digit)*place. So, this modified number must be divisible by 7.

Therefore, for each digit position, N + (1 - digit_i)*place_i ≡ 0 mod 7. Which implies that N ≡ -(1 - digit_i)*place_i mod 7.

So, N must satisfy four congruence relations, each corresponding to a digit position. Let's write these down.

For the thousands place (digit a):
N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
=> N ≡ - (1 - a)*1000 mod 7

Similarly, for the hundreds place (digit b):
N + (1 - b)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7
=> N ≡ - (1 - b)*100 mod 7

Tens place (digit c):
N + (1 - c)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7
=> N ≡ - (1 - c)*10 mod 7

Ones place (digit d):
N + (1 - d)*1 ≡ 0 mod 7
=> N ≡ - (1 - d)*1 mod 7

So, N must satisfy all four congruences simultaneously. Therefore, each of these expressions must be congruent to N modulo 7.

Let me compute each of these terms modulo 7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 divided by 7: 7*14 = 98, so 100 - 98 = 2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 divided by 7 is 3 with remainder 1. So, 10 ≡ 1 mod 7.

1 mod 7 is just 1.

So, substituting:

For thousands place:
N ≡ -(1 - a)*6 mod 7

For hundreds place:
N ≡ -(1 - b)*2 mod 7

For tens place:
N ≡ -(1 - c)*1 mod 7

For ones place:
N ≡ -(1 - d)*1 mod 7

Alternatively, since N has to satisfy all four congruences, each expression must be equal to N mod 7. Therefore, all four expressions must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

So, let me write them as:

1. N ≡ 6(a - 1) mod 7
2. N ≡ 2(b - 1) mod 7
3. N ≡ 1(c - 1) mod 7
4. N ≡ 1(d - 1) mod 7

Wait, because -(1 - a) is a -1, multiplied by 6. So, 6*(a - 1) mod 7.

Similarly, 2*(b - 1) mod 7, etc.

So, all four expressions are equal to N mod 7. Therefore, 6(a - 1) ≡ 2(b - 1) ≡ (c - 1) ≡ (d - 1) mod 7.

Let me denote this common value as k, so:

6(a - 1) ≡ k mod 7
2(b - 1) ≡ k mod 7
(c - 1) ≡ k mod 7
(d - 1) ≡ k mod 7

So, each of these expressions equals k modulo 7. Therefore, we can set up equations:

From the first equation: 6(a - 1) ≡ k mod 7
From the second: 2(b - 1) ≡ k mod 7
From the third: (c - 1) ≡ k mod 7
From the fourth: (d - 1) ≡ k mod 7

So, all four are congruent to k. Therefore, each expression is equal to k modulo 7.

So, let me express each digit in terms of k.

From the first equation:
6(a - 1) ≡ k mod 7
=> a - 1 ≡ 6^{-1} * k mod 7
What's the inverse of 6 mod 7? Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse is 6.

Therefore, a -1 ≡ 6k mod7
=> a ≡ 6k +1 mod7

Similarly, from the second equation:
2(b -1) ≡ k mod7
=> b -1 ≡ (2^{-1})*k mod7
The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b -1 ≡4k mod7
=> b ≡4k +1 mod7

From the third equation:
c -1 ≡k mod7
=> c≡k +1 mod7

And from the fourth equation:
d -1≡k mod7
=> d ≡k +1 mod7

So, now, each digit can be expressed in terms of k. Also, since a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), their congruence modulo 7 can help us find their possible values.

But since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, we want N as large as possible, which means we want a, b, c, d to be as large as possible, preferably 9, but subject to the conditions above.

So, let's consider each digit:

a is thousands digit, so a can be from 1 to 9.

b, c, d can be from 0 to 9.

Since we want N as large as possible, we should try to maximize a, then b, then c, then d, as much as possible, while satisfying the congruence conditions.

So, let's think about k.

k is equal to all four expressions modulo7. Since a, b, c, d are digits, the values of k are determined by their congruence.

Given that, let's think about how to choose k such that a, b, c, d are as large as possible.

Let me note that each digit is expressed in terms of k:

a = (6k +1) mod7
b = (4k +1) mod7
c = (k +1) mod7
d = (k +1) mod7

But since digits can be higher numbers, we can add 7 to these to make them as large as possible.

But let's see: each digit can be written as:

a = 6k +1 +7m, where m is an integer such that a is between 1 and9.

Similarly for b, c, d.

But perhaps another approach is to consider possible k values (0 to6), and for each k, compute a, b, c, d, and then find the maximum N.

Since k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 mod7.

So, let's consider each possible k from 0 to6:

For each k, compute a, b, c
