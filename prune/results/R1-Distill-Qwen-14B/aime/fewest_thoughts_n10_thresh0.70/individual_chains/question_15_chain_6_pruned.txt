Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. The paths have a length of 16, which I think means they consist of 16 steps, right? Because in a grid, each step is either right or up. So for an 8x8 grid, to go from the corner to the opposite corner, you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. 

The problem says these paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction means switching from moving right to moving up or vice versa. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then at some point you switch to moving up, and so on. Each switch counts as a change in direction.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path. Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. If a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five segments. Wait, because the first segment doesn't count as a change yet, right? So for example, if you have one change, you have two segments. So four changes would mean five segments.

So each path can be broken down into five segments, each of which is either all right moves or all up moves. Since the total number of right moves is 8 and up moves is 8, these five segments must sum up to 8 in each direction.

Now, I need to figure out how to distribute these 8 right moves into five segments, and similarly for the up moves. But wait, actually, the segments alternate between right and up. So the first segment could be right, then up, then right, etc., or it could be up first, then right, and so on. But in our case, since we're starting at the lower left corner and moving to the upper right, I think the direction alternates until the end. 

Wait, no, actually, the path can start with either a right or an up move. But for the total number of direction changes to be exactly four, the number of segments in each direction should be such that they add up correctly.

Let me think again. If there are five segments, they must alternate between right and up. So the number of right segments and up segments could either be three right and two up, or three up and two right. Because five segments would mean that one direction has three segments and the other has two. Because starting with right would lead to right, up, right, up, right segments (so three right segments and two up segments). Similarly, starting with up would lead to three up segments and two right segments.

So, the number of right segments is either three or two, same with up. Wait, no, since five is odd, starting with one direction will give that direction three segments, and the other direction two. So for example:

Case 1: Starts with right, then alternates, resulting in three right segments and two up segments.

Case 2: Starts with up, then alternates, resulting in three up segments and two right segments.

Therefore, I need to calculate the number of paths for both cases
