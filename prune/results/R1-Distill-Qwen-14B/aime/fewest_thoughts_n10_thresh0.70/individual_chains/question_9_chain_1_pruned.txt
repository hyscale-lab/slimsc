Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make things clearer. Let me write down the two equations given:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think it might help to use the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So applying that to both equations:

Equation 1 becomes: log_x(y) * x = 10
Equation 2 becomes: log_y(x) * 4y = 10

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. For the first equation, log_x(y^x) is equal to x * log_x(y), yes. And that equals 10. Similarly, the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) is 4y * log_y(x), which equals 10. So that gives me:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, now I have two equations. I wonder if I can express log_x(y) and log_y(x) in terms of each other. I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as something, maybe 'a', to make it easier. Let's say:

Let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/a.

Substituting these into the two equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * (1/a) = 10

So equation 1 is x * a = 10, which I can write as x = 10 / a.

Equation 2: 4y / a = 10, so 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. So x = 10 / a and y = (5a)/2.

Hmm, but I need another equation to relate x and y. Wait, since a is log_x(y), which is log_x(y) = a, but I also have y expressed in terms of a. Let me see.

Wait, a = log_x(y). So that means y = x^a. Because by definition, if log_b(c) = d, then c = b^d.

So, y = x^a. But from earlier, y is also (5a)/2.

So substituting x from equation 1: x = 10/a, so y = (10/a)^a.

But we also have y = (5a)/2.

So, setting them equal: (10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln[(10/a)^a] = ln[(5a)/2]

Simplify the left side: a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Let me write that:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] = ln(5a) - ln(2)

Wait, because ln(10/a) is ln(10) - ln(a), right? And ln(5a/2) is ln(5a) - ln(2).

So expanding both sides:

Left side: a*ln(10) - a*ln(a)

Right side: ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

So the equation becomes:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution, but perhaps I can find a value for 'a' that satisfies it. Let me rearrange the equation:

Bring all terms to the left:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0

Factor terms with 'a':

a*(ln(10) - ln(a)) - (ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)) = 0

Wait, maybe a better approach is to try specific integer values for 'a' to see if they fit. Let's test a=2.

Substituting a=2 into the equation:

Left side: 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) ≈ 2*(2.302585) - 2*(0.693147) ≈ 4.60517 - 1.38629 ≈ 3.21888

Right side: ln(5) + ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.60944

Wait, 3.21888 ≈ 1.60944? No, that's not equal. So a=2 doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

If a=2, then left side is 2*ln(10) - 2*ln(2) ≈ 2*2.302585 - 2*0.693147 ≈ 4.60517 - 1.386294 ≈ 3.21888

Right side: ln(5) + ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.60944. So 3.21888 ≈ 1.60944? No, so not equal.

What about a=1? Let's see:

Left side: 1*ln(10) - 1*ln(1) = ln(10) - 0 ≈ 2.302585

Right side: ln(5) + ln(1) - ln(2) = ln(5) - ln(2) ≈ 1.60944 - 0.693147 ≈ 0.91629. Not equal.

a=3:

Left: 3*ln(10) -3*ln(3) ≈ 3*(2.302585) - 3*(1.098612) ≈ 6.907755 - 3.295836 ≈ 3.61192

Right: ln(5) + ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.60944 + 1.098612 - 0.693147 ≈ 1.60944 + 1.098612 = 2.708052 - 0.693147 ≈ 2.014905. So 3.61192 ≈ 2.014905? No.

Hmm, maybe a fractional value? Let's try a= something else. Maybe a=5?

Left: 5*ln(10) -5*ln(5) ≈5*(2.302585) -5*(1.60944) ≈11.512925 -8.0472≈3.465725

Right: ln(5) + ln(5) - ln(2) = 2*ln(5) - ln(2) ≈2*(1.60944) -0.693147≈3.21888 -0.693147≈2.52573. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe a= some other number. Alternatively, perhaps I can let a =2, but that didn't work. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to manipulate the equation further.

Wait, maybe let's express the equation as:

a * ln(10) - a * ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] - ln(a) = ln(5) - ln(2)

Let me compute ln(5) - ln(2) ≈1.60944 - 0.693147≈0.916293

So, the equation becomes:

a * [ln(10) - ln(a)] - ln(a) ≈0.916293

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I can let u = a, and write the equation as:

u * (ln(10) - ln(u)) - ln(u) = 0.916293

But I'm not sure how to solve this analytically. Maybe a numerical approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that a is a nice number, like 2 or 5, but from above, a=2 didn't work. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, let's go back to the step where I had:

y = x^a, and from earlier, y = (5a)/2.

So, substituting x =10/a into y =x^a, y = (10/a)^a. But y is also (5a)/2. So,

(10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Let me take natural logs again:

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Simplify the left side: a*(ln10 - ln a)

Right side:
