Okay, so I'm looking at this geometry problem, and I want to find the length of AP in the given triangle ABC. Let me try to understand the problem first.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. We have triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, first, maybe I should verify if this is a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC (10), so yes, it's a valid triangle. Similarly, the other sides also satisfy the triangle inequality, so that's good.

Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle, we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or perhaps some power of a point. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is called the exsymmedian point or something like that? Or maybe it's the ex-pole? Not sure, but tangents from a common point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC? Wait, no, actually, the lengths from D to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB and DC would be equal because D is outside the circle, and the two tangent segments from D to ω are equal. So, DB = DC.

Wait, but in this case, the tangents are at B and C, so the lengths DB and DC should be equal. So, D is equidistant from B and C. That might be useful.

So, AD is a line from A to D that intersects the circumcircle ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. We need to find AP.

I remember that when dealing with points outside a circle and tangents, the power of a point could be helpful. The power of point D with respect to ω would be DB² = DC² because DB = DC, and that should equal DP * DA because D lies on AD, which intersects ω at A and P.

Wait, power of a point says that for a point D outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length, so DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, DP * DA = DB².

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA.

But to find DB, I might need to find some lengths in triangle ABC or maybe use coordinates or trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles or Menelaus' theorem.

Wait, given that ABC has sides 5,9,10, perhaps I can compute some angles or use the Law of Cosines to find angle at A or something.

Let me try that. Let me compute the coordinates of the triangle first.

Wait, perhaps placing the triangle in a coordinate system would make this easier. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10. Then, point B is somewhere such that AB is 5 and BC is 9.

So, coordinate system: C(0,0), A(10,0). Let me find the coordinates of B.

Let’s denote B as (x,y). Then, from BC = 9, the distance from C(0,0) to B(x,y) is √(x² + y²) = 9 → x² + y² = 81.

From AB = 5, the distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is √((x-10)² + y²) = 5 → (x-10)² + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x-10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 → (x² - 20x + 100) + y² - x² - y² = -56 → -20x + 100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 39/5. Then, from x² + y² = 81, we can find y:

(39/5)² + y² = 81 → (1521/25) + y² = 81 → y² = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25 → y = √(504)/5 = (√504)/5. Simplify √504: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, which is not integer. Wait, let me factor 504.

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126
