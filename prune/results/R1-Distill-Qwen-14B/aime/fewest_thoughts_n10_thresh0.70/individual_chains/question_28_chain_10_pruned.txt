Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius, which I think can be calculated using the volume and the surface areas.

Wait, right, for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / A_total, where A_total is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.

So, I need to find the volume of this tetrahedron and the total surface area. Then, compute r as 3V divided by A_total.

But how do I find the volume? Well, for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. I've heard of that before. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1
1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2
1 a^2 0 d^2 e^2
1 b^2 d^2 0 f^2
1 c^2 e^2 f^2 0

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix, but I can plug in the given lengths.

Given:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)

AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)

AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)

BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)

BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)

CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

So, the squared lengths are:

a² = 41, b² = 80, c² = 89, d² = 89, e² =80, f²=41.

Let me construct the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

Yes, so that is correct.

So, the matrix M is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

So, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, then take 1/288 of that, and that will be V². Then, I can take the square root to get V.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be tedious. Maybe I can find some symmetry or properties to simplify it.

Wait, I notice that the edge lengths are symmetrical. AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, the tetrahedron is isohedral? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. So, this is a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that the case here?

Wait, let
