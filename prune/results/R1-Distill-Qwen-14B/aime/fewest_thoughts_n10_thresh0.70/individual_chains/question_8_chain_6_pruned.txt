Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but let's try to break it down.

First, I notice that both equations are symmetric in a, b, and c. That probably means that the solutions might have some symmetry as well. Maybe the variables are equal or have some kind of pattern. Let me think about how I can approach this.

The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That's a linear equation, so it's about the sum of the variables. The second equation is quadratic in each variable, which makes it a bit trickier. Let me write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Wait, I can factor this a bit. Let me group terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, putting it all together, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, since we know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, we can substitute for (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b). Let's see:

From a + b + c = 300, we get:
b + c = 300 - a
a + c = 300 - b
a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's a nice simplification. So now the equation is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 300 to make it simpler:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the most helpful step. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:

300(a² + b² + c²) = 6,000,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³).

So, dividing both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² = 20,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³)/300.

Not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I should consider other approaches.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca, and other symmetric sums.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, let me write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (300)^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Calculating (300)^3: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, let's plug this back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Expanding that:

300a² + 300b² + 300c² -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

300a² + 300b² + 300c² + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

300a² + 300b² + 300c² + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Let me factor out 3 from the entire equation:

3[100a² + 100b² + 100c² + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 33,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100a² + 100b² + 100c² + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can express some of these terms in terms of symmetric sums.

Wait, I know that a + b + c = 300, and let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.

Let S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc.

We can also note that a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2.

So, a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

So, substituting this into our equation:

100*(90,000 - 2S2
