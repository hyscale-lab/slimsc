Alright, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me recall that for a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume is lwh. So, in this problem, we're given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. That sphere's diameter has to be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. Therefore, r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, we need to find the minimum value of (l² + w² + h²)/4, given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, no, actually, since the sphere must contain all possible boxes in the set B, we need the maximum possible space diagonal, right? Because the sphere has to contain the box regardless of its dimensions, so the sphere's radius must accommodate the largest possible space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, we need to maximize the space diagonal, given the surface area and volume constraints, and then take that maximum value to compute r.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the sphere must contain each box, so for each individual box, the sphere must be large enough to contain it. So, the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, to find r, we need the maximum value of sqrt(l² + w² + h²) over all boxes in B, then divide that by 2, then square it to get r squared. Alternatively, since r squared is (l² + w² + h²)/4, we need to find the maximum of l² + w² + h² under the given constraints.

So, the problem reduces to: maximize l² + w² + h², given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Hmm, okay, so I need to set up an optimization problem with constraints. Let me denote variables x = l, y = w, z = h for simplicity.

So, we have
