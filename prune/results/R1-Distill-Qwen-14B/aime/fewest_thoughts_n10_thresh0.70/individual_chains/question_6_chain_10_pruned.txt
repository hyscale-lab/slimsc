Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are defined by the equations y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. Let me try to visualize these functions.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Absolute value functions create V-shaped graphs. The inner part is |x|, which is a V pointing upwards with its vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that's shifting the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, ||x| - 1/2|, this actually reflects any negative parts back up. So, when |x| - 1/2 is negative, which happens when |x| < 1/2, the outer absolute value will flip the graph back up.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that has its vertex at |x| = 1/2, which is at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. The value at the vertex would be 0, because |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. Then, for |x| >= 1/2, it's just |x| - 1/2, so the slopes are 1 and -1 on either side.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. This is similar but with 1/4. So, the vertex is at |x| = 1/4, which is x = 1/4 and x = -1/4. The value at those points is 0. For |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|, so the graph is a V upside down? Wait, no. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, when you have | |x| - a |, for positive a. For |x| < a, | |x| - a | = a - |x|, which is a downward-opening V with vertex at (0,a). Then, for |x| >= a, it's |x| - a, which is upward-opening with vertex at (a,0) and (-a,0). So, yes, f(x) is a V that goes down to 0 at |x|=1/2 and then back up. Similarly, g(x) is a V that goes down to 0 at |x|=1/4, and then back up.

So, f(x) is a W shape, with the bottom at 0 at x=±1/2, and the top at x=0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. Similarly, g(x) is a W shape with the bottom at x=±1/4, f(0)=1/4.

Wait, no, actually, when a is subtracted inside the absolute value, the graph for f(x) would have a V that has its vertex at |x|=1/2, but the direction depends on the inner part. So when |x| is less than 1/2, | |x| - 1/2 | becomes 1/2 - |x|, which is a downward V between x=-1/2 and x=1/2. Then, outside that interval, it's |x| - 1/2, which is an upward V. So yes, f(x) is a W shape with the middle dip at x=0, f(0)=1/2, and the upward Vs at x=±1/2.

Same for g(x). So, g(x) is a W shape with the middle dip at x=0, g(0)=1/4, and the upward Vs at x=±1/4.

Okay, so now I understand f and g. Next, I need to consider the compositions of these functions. Specifically, the functions inside y=4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me parse this. For the first equation, y is equal to 4 times g of f of sin(2πx). So, it's a composition of functions: start with sin(2πx), apply f to it, then apply g to the result, then multiply by 4.

Similarly, for the second equation, x is equal to 4 times g of f of cos(3πy). So, start with cos(3πy), apply f, then g, then multiply by 4.

So, both sides involve the same structure: 4 g(f(something)).

Let me think about what these functions look like.

First, let's consider the inner functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). These are sine and cosine functions with different periods. For sin(2πx), the period is 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k. So here, k=2π, so period is 1. Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3.

So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave that completes a cycle every 1 unit in x. cos(3πy) is a cosine wave that completes a cycle every 2/3 units in y.

Then, these are passed through f and then g, which as we saw, create W-shaped transformations. So, let's think about f(sin(2πx)).

Since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, let's compute f(sin(2πx)).

The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. So sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1. Then, when we take |sin(2πx)|, it's between 0 and 1. Then, subtract 1/2: |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

So, when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, the value is |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

Wait, but since f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, it's the same as | |x| - 1/2 |, so that's exactly what I just described.

So f(sin(2πx)) is | | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Similarly, g of that would be || | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Wait, so f(sin(2πx)) is | | sin(2π
