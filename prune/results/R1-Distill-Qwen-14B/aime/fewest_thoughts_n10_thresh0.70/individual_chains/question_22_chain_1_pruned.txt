Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All opposite sides are parallel, and when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. It's convex and equilateral, so all its sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. That makes me think it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all internal angles equal. Instead, it's more like a stretched or compressed version where opposite sides are parallel but sides can have different angles.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating one side over the other. Maybe it's a centrally symmetric hexagon? Not sure, but symmetry might play a role here.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me try to imagine this triangle. So, if I extend AB beyond B and C, CD beyond D and E, and EF beyond F and A, they should meet to form a triangle.

Wait, no, actually, the sides of the triangle are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, maybe each of these sides is one side of the triangle? Let me think.

Suppose we have triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Each side of T is an extension of AB, CD, EF respectively. So, AB is a part of the side of length 200, CD is part of 240, and EF is part of 300.

But the triangle is formed by these extensions. So, perhaps if I consider the hexagon as being cut off from the triangle T. The hexagon would be the portion of the triangle that's left after cutting off three smaller triangles from the corners.

Wait, that's an interesting idea. If the hexagon is inside the triangle T, and each side of the hexagon is a portion of the sides of T, but since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side of the hexagon is equal, and the extensions beyond the hexagon's sides form the sides of triangle T.

Alternatively, maybe each side of the triangle is an extension of a side of the hexagon. So, each side of the triangle is longer than the corresponding side of the hexagon.

Given that the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are the same length, say 's'. Then the triangle's sides are each longer than 's' by some amount.

But how exactly?

Perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon's triangle? Wait, not sure.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose the triangle T has sides of 20
