Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a number N, which is the greatest four-digit positive integer with a specific property. The property is that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when we divide N by 1000, we get a quotient Q and a remainder R. The task is to find Q + R.

Hmm. Alright, so N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need the greatest such N, meaning we want the largest possible four-digit number with that property.

Let me denote the digits of N as a, b, c, d. So, N can be written as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a can't be zero since it's a four-digit number.

The property is that if you change any one digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

So, let's consider each digit:

1. If we replace a with 1, the number becomes 1bcd, which is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
2. If we replace b with 1, the number becomes a1cd, which is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
3. If we replace c with 1, the number becomes ab1d, which is 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This must be divisible by 7.
4. If we replace d with 1, the number becomes abc1, which is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives us four conditions that N must satisfy.

Let me try to write these conditions mathematically.

First, let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, when we change b to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

When we change c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

When we change d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four congruence relations.

Let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7 for each digit position.

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 mod7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7: 10-7=3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 mod7: 1.

So, the four conditions become:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we now have four congruence equations:

Equation1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Equation2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Equation3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7.

Equation4: 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm. This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can manipulate these equations to find relations between the digits.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, consider Equation1 and Equation2.

Equation2 - Equation1: (6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) ) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a + 2 -6 - 2b ≡0 mod7.

Which is: 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

We can write this as 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Wait, but 6 and 7 are coprime, so 6 has an inverse mod7. Alternatively, maybe factor differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7 => (6a -2b)*4 ≡4*4 mod7.

Compute (6a *4) mod7: 6*4=24≡3 mod7, so 3a.

(-2b *4)= -8b ≡-1b mod7, since 8≡1 mod7.

So, 3a -b ≡16 mod7. 16 mod7 is 2.

So, 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, equation A: 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation3 from Equation2.

Equation2:6a +2 +3c +d.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d.

Equation2 - Equation3: (6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3 +d) ) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 2 -3c -2b +0 ≡0 mod7.

So: -2b -3c +2 ≡0 mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1: 2b + 3c -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, equation B: 2b + 3c ≡2 mod7.

Now, let's subtract Equation4 from Equation3.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c +1.

Equation3 - Equation4: (6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 3 + d -3c -1 ≡0 mod7.

So: 2 + d -3c ≡0 mod7.

Which is equation C: d -3c ≡-2 mod7, which is same as d -3c ≡5 mod7.

Alternatively, d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 2 + d -3c ≡0 mod7.

So, d -3c ≡ -2 mod7.

Since -2 mod7 is 5, so d -3c ≡5 mod7.

So, d ≡3c +5 mod7.

But since d is a digit (0-9), this gives a possible value for d in terms of c.

Similarly, let's subtract Equation4 from Equation2.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, let's look at Equation4.

Equation4:6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

We can write this as 6a + 2b + 3c ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7.

So, equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We also have equation B:2b +3c ≡2 mod7.

So, let me substitute equation B into equation4.

From equation B: 2b +3c =2 +7k for some integer k.

Plugging into equation4:6a + (2 +7k) ≡6 mod7.

Which is 6a +2 ≡6 mod7.

So, 6a ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 is 6.

So, a ≡4*6 mod7.

4*6=24≡3 mod7.

Thus, a ≡3 mod7.

Since a is a digit from 1 to9 (as it's the thousands digit), possible values for a are 3 and 10? Wait, 10 is not a digit. So a can be 3, 10 is invalid, so a=3.

Wait, but a is a digit, so a can be 3 or 3+7=10, but 10 is not a digit. So a must be 3.

So, a=3.

Okay, so that's a crucial piece of information: a=3.

So, N is of the form 3bcd, where b, c, d are digits.

Now, let's go back to equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Since a=3, then 3*3 -b ≡2 mod7 =>9 -b ≡2 mod7.

9 mod7 is 2, so 2 -b ≡2 mod7 => -b ≡0 mod7 => b ≡0 mod7.

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values for b are 0 and 7.

So, b=0 or 7.

But since we want the greatest four-digit number N, which is 3bcd, to be as large as possible, we should set b as high as possible. So between 0 and 7, 7 is higher. So let's set b=7 first, and see if it works.

So, b=7.

Now, equation B:2b +3c ≡2 mod7.

Plugging b=7: 2*7 +3c ≡2 mod7.

14 +3c ≡2 mod7.

14 mod7 is 0, so 0 +3c ≡2 mod7 =>3c ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

So, c≡2*5 mod7 => c≡10 mod7 => c=3.

So, c=3.

So now, c=3.

From equation C: d ≡3c +5 mod7. Wait, earlier we had d≡3c +5 mod7?

Wait, equation C was d -3c ≡5 mod7. So, d ≡3c +5 mod7.

Since c=3, d≡3*3 +5=9+5=14≡0 mod7.

So, d≡0 mod7.

Since d is a digit (0-9), possible values for d are 0 and7.

Again, since we want the largest possible N, which is 3 7 3 d, we should choose d=7.

So, d=7.

So, putting it all together: a=3, b=7, c=3, d=7.

So, N=3737.

Wait, but let's verify each condition to make sure.

First, let's check each modified number.

1. Replace a with 1: 1737. Let's see if 1737 is divisible by 7.

Compute 1737 /7: 7*248=1736, so 1737-1736=1. So remainder 1. Not divisible. So that's a problem.

Hmm, so that's not working. So our assumption that b=7 might not be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's double-check.

From equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

a=3, so 9 -b ≡2 mod7 =>9 mod7 is 2, so 2 -b ≡2 mod7.

So, -b ≡0 mod7 =>b≡0 mod7. So b=0 or 7.

But when we set b=7, the resulting number when a is replaced by 1 is 1737, which is not divisible by 7.

So, perhaps b=7 is not acceptable, and we need to try b=0.

So, let's try b=0.

So, b=0.

Then, equation B:2b +3c ≡2 mod7.

So, 0 +3c ≡2 mod7 =>3c ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 5 (inverse of 3 mod7): c ≡10 mod7 => c=3.

So, c=3.

Then, equation C: d ≡3c +5 mod7.

c=3, so 3*3=9, 9+5=14≡0 mod7.

So, d≡0 mod7. So d=0 or7.

Again, to get the largest N, which is 3 0 3 d, set d=7.

So, N=3037.

Wait, let's check the conditions for N=3037.

Replace a with 1: 1037.

Check if 1037 is divisible by7.

7*148=1036, so 1037-1036=1. Remainder1. Not divisible.

Hmm, again, not working.

Wait, so maybe even with b=0 and d=7, it doesn't satisfy the condition. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let's step back.

We have a=3.

From equation A:3*3 -b ≡2 mod7 =>9 -b ≡2 mod7 =>2 -b ≡2 mod7 (since 9 mod7 is 2) => -b ≡0 mod7 =>b≡0 mod7.

So, b=0 or7.

But when b=7, replacing a with1 gives 1737, which isn't divisible by7.

When b=0, replacing a with1 gives 1037, which isn't divisible by7.

Hmm. So, perhaps even with a=3, the modified numbers aren't divisible by7.

So, perhaps we need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.

Let me go back and verify each step.

We have N=abcd, which is 1000a +100b +10c +d.

The four conditions when replacing each digit with1:

1. 1000 +100b +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000a +100 +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000a +100b +10 +d ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

We converted these to mod7:

1. 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Then, we did:

Equation2 - Equation1 = 6a +2 +3c +d - (6 +2b +3c +d) =6a -2b -4≡0 mod7.

Which simplifies to 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Divide by 2: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Then, we considered equation2 - equation3:

Equation2:6a +2 +3c +d.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d.

Subtract: (6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3 +d) )=2 -2b +3c -0.

Wait, wait, I think I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, let's compute equation2 - equation3:

6a +2 +3c +d - (6a +2b +3 +d) = (6a -6a) + (2 -3) + (3c - 2b) + (d -d) = (-1) +3c -2b.

So, -1 +3c -2b ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -2b -1≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Earlier, I thought equation B was 2b +3c ≡2 mod7, but that was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.

Wait, equation2 - equation3: equation2 is 6a +2 +3c +d.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d.

So, subtracting: (6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3 +d) = (2 -3) + (3c - 2b) + (d -d) + (6a -6a) = (-1) +3c -2b.

So, -1 +3c -2b ≡0 mod7.

Thus, equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Earlier, I thought it was 2b +3c ≡2 mod7, which was wrong. So that was a mistake.

Similarly, when I subtracted equation3 - equation4, let me check that again.

Equation3:6a +2b +3 +d.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c +1.

So, equation3 - equation4: (6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) = (3 -1) + (d -3c) =2 +d -3c.

So, 2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

Which is equation C: d -3c ≡-2 mod7, or d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had equation C as 2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7, which is correct.

So, equation C is d ≡3c -2 mod7.

But earlier, I had equation B wrong.

So, equation B is 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, let me re-express the equations with the correct equation B.

So, equations:

Equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation C:d ≡3c -2 mod7.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, let's go step by step.

We found that a=3.

So, a=3.

From equation A:3*3 -b ≡2 mod7 =>9 -b ≡2 mod7 =>2 -b ≡2 mod7 => -b ≡0 mod7 =>b≡0 mod7.

So b=0 or7.

So, let's try b=7 first.

So, b=7.

From equation B:3c -2*7 ≡1 mod7 =>3c -14 ≡1 mod7.

14 mod7 is0, so 3c ≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod7, which is5.

So, c≡5*1=5 mod7.

So, c=5 or12 (but 12 is invalid, so c=5.

So, c=5.

Now, from equation C:d ≡3c -2 mod7.

c=5, so 3*5=15≡1 mod7. 1 -2=-1≡6 mod7.

So, d≡6 mod7.

Since d is a digit (0-9), possible values are 6 and13 (invalid), so d=6.

So, d=6.

So, now we have a=3, b=7, c=5, d=6.

So, N=3756.

Now, let's check each condition.

1. Replace a with1:1756.

Is 1756 divisible by7? Let's check.

7*250=1750. 1756-1750=6. So remainder6. Not divisible.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 3c=15≡1 mod7, so 1-2= -1≡6 mod7. So d=6.

So, d=6.

So, N=3756.

Check replacing a with1:1756.

1756 divided by7: 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6. So, 1756=7*250+6. Not divisible.

Hmm, so that doesn't work.

So, perhaps b=7 is not acceptable. Let's try b=0.

So, b=0.

From equation B:3c -2*0 ≡1 mod7 =>3c≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5: c≡5 mod7.

So, c=5 or12 (invalid), so c=5.

From equation C: d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=5: 3*5=15≡1 mod7. 1-2=-1≡6 mod7.

So, d=6.

Thus, N=3056.

Check replacing a with1:1056.

1056 divided by7: 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6. So, remainder6. Not divisible.

Hmm, again, not working.

Wait, so perhaps a=3 is correct, but even with that, neither b=0 nor b=7 works.

So, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps a=3 is correct, but let's check equation4.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We have a=3, so 6*3=18≡4 mod7.

So, equation4:4 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So, 2b +3c ≡2 mod7.

Wait, equation B is 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, equation B:3c -2b=1 mod7.

Equation4:2b +3c=2 mod7.

Wait, adding equation B and equation4:

(3c -2b) + (2b +3c) =1 +2 mod7.

Which is 6c=3 mod7.

So, 6c≡3 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of6 mod7, which is6.

So, c≡3*6=18≡4 mod7.

So, c=4 or11 (invalid). So, c=4.

Wait, but earlier, with a=3, equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, if c=4, then 3*4=12≡5 mod7.

So, 5 -2b ≡1 mod7 => -2b ≡-4 mod7 =>2b≡4 mod7 =>b≡2 mod7.

Since b is a digit, possible values are 2 or9.

So, b=2 or9.

We want N to be as large as possible, so set b=9.

So, b=9.

Then, from equation C: d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=4, so 3*4=12≡5 mod7. 5-2=3. So, d≡3 mod7.

So, d=3 or10 (invalid). So, d=3.

Thus, N=3 9 4 3, which is 3943.

Now, let's check each condition.

1. Replace a with1:1943.

Check if 1943 is divisible by7.

Compute 7*277=1939. 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

Hmm, that's not working.

Wait, let's compute 1943/7.

7*277=1939. 1943-1939=4. So, remainder4.

Not divisible.

Hmm, so perhaps this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, let's recap.

We have a=3.

Equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7 =>3*3 -b=9 -b≡2 mod7 =>2 -b≡2 mod7 =>-b≡0 mod7 =>b≡0 mod7.

So, b=0 or7.

But when b=0, we get N=3056, which when a is replaced, gives 1056, which isn't divisible by7.

When b=7, we get N=3756, which when a is replaced gives1756, which isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps a=3 is not acceptable.

Wait, but earlier steps suggested that a=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the step where I found a=3.

From equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

And from equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Adding them: 6a +2b +3c +3c -2b ≡6 +1 mod7 =>6a +6c ≡7 mod7 =>6a +6c ≡0 mod7.

Factor out 6:6(a +c) ≡0 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, this implies a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, a +c ≡0 mod7.

Earlier, from equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, perhaps with a +c≡0 mod7, let's see.

So, a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, c≡-a mod7.

So, if a=3, then c≡-3 mod7 =>c=4 (since -3 mod7=4).

So, c=4.

So, from equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

3*4=12≡5 mod7.

So, 5 -2b ≡1 mod7 => -2b ≡-4 mod7 =>2b≡4 mod7 =>b≡2 mod7.

So, b=2 or9.

So, let's set b=9 for maximum N.

So, b=9.

From equation C:d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=4, so 3*4=12≡5 mod7. 5-2=3 mod7.

So, d≡3 mod7. So, d=3 or10 (invalid). So, d=3.

Thus, N=3 9 4 3=3943.

Now, check each condition:

1. Replace a with1:1943.

Check if 1943 is divisible by7.

Compute 7*277=1939. 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to check other possibilities.

Wait, equation C: d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=4, so d≡5-2=3 mod7.

So, d=3 or10.

Wait, 10 is invalid, so d=3.

So, N=3943.

But replacing a with1 gives1943, which isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps a=3 isn't the correct value.

Wait, earlier, from equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

From equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We can try solving these together.

Let me denote equation4 as:

6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. [Equation4]

And equation B as:

3c -2b ≡1 mod7. [Equation B]

Let me add equation4 and equation B.

Equation4 + equation B:

6a +2b +3c +3c -2b ≡6 +1 mod7.

So, 6a +6c ≡7 mod7 =>6a +6c ≡0 mod7.

Factor out6:6(a +c)≡0 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, this implies a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, c≡-a mod7.

So, if a=3, c=4.

If a=10, but a is a digit, so a can be 3, 10 is invalid. So a=3, c=4.

So, with a=3, c=4.

From equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So, 3*4=12≡5 mod7.

So, 5 -2b ≡1 mod7 =>-2b≡-4 mod7 =>2b≡4 mod7 =>b≡2 mod7.

So, b=2 or9.

So, let's try b=2.

So, b=2.

From equation C:d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=4, so d≡12 -2=10≡3 mod7.

So, d=3 or10 (invalid). So, d=3.

Thus, N=3 2 4 3=3243.

Check conditions:

Replace a with1:1243.

Check divisibility by7: 7*177=1239. 1243-1239=4. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to try b=9.

So, b=9.

From equation C:d≡3c -2 mod7=12-2=10≡3 mod7.

So, d=3.

So, N=3943.

Check condition1:1943.

As before, not divisible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, let's go back.

We had equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We also have a +c≡0 mod7.

So, with a=3, c=4.

But when we set b=9, we get N=3943, which doesn't satisfy condition1.

So, perhaps a=3 is not acceptable.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps a=3 is correct, but we need to find other possible values.

Alternatively, perhaps a=3 is correct, but we have to adjust other digits.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when replacing a digit, the number must be divisible by7, not necessarily that N itself has to be divisible by7.

Wait, let me check N=3943.

N=3943.

We can check if N itself has any properties, but the problem doesn't state that N is divisible by7, only that when any one digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7.

So, perhaps N=3943 is acceptable, but when I replace a with1, it's not.

Wait, but according to the problem, when a is replaced by1, the number must be divisible by7. So, N=3943 doesn't satisfy that condition.

So, perhaps our approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when we replace a digit, the resulting number is divisible by7, but N itself may not be.

So, perhaps N=3943 isn't correct because changing a to1 gives1943, which isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps we need to find another set of digits.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider other values of a.

Wait, earlier, I concluded that a=3, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let's re-examine the step where I found a=3.

From equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

From equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Adding them:6a +6c ≡0 mod7 =>a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, a +c ≡0 mod7.

So, c≡-a mod7.

So, for a=3, c=4.

For a=10, which is invalid, but a=3 is the only possibility.

Wait, perhaps a=3 is correct.

So, a=3, c=4.

From equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

3*4=12≡5 mod7.

So,5 -2b≡1 mod7 =>-2b≡-4 mod7 =>2b≡4 mod7 =>b≡2 mod7.

So, b=2 or9.

So, trying b=2 and9.

But with both, the resulting N when a is replaced by1 isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps this suggests that a=3 is not acceptable.

But wait, how did we get a=3 earlier?

From equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We thought that a=3, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving equation4.

Wait, equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We also have equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Let me solve these two equations together.

Let me express equation B as 3c =2b +1 mod7.

So, 3c=2b +1 mod7.

From equation4:6a +2b + (2b +1) ≡6 mod7.

Wait, because 3c=2b +1 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3c=6a +2b + (2b +1) =6a +4b +1 ≡6 mod7.

So, 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

So, 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

We can factor this as 2*(3a +2b) ≡5 mod7.

Hmm, but 2 and7 are coprime, so multiply both sides by4 (the inverse of2 mod7).

So, 3a +2b ≡5*4 mod7 =>3a +2b ≡20 mod7 =>20 mod7=6.

So, 3a +2b ≡6 mod7.

But from equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, now we have:

Equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation D:3a +2b ≡6 mod7.

Let me subtract equation A from equation D.

Equation D - equation A: (3a +2b) - (3a -b) ≡6 -2 mod7.

So, 3b ≡4 mod7.

So, 3b≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5: b≡20 mod7 => b≡6 mod7.

So, b=6 or13 (invalid). So, b=6.

So, b=6.

Now, from equation A:3a -6 ≡2 mod7 =>3a ≡8 mod7 =>3a≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5: a≡5 mod7.

So, a=5 or12 (invalid). So, a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, from equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

b=6: 3c -12 ≡1 mod7.

-12 mod7: 12-7=5, so -5 mod7=2.

So, 3c +2 ≡1 mod7 =>3c≡-1 mod7 =>3c≡6 mod7.

Multiply by5: c≡30 mod7 =>30-28=2. So, c=2 or9.

So, c=2 or9.

Since we want the largest possible N, set c=9.

So, c=9.

From equation C:d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=9:3*9=27≡6 mod7. 6-2=4 mod7.

So, d≡4 mod7.

Thus, d=4 or11 (invalid). So, d=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4=5694.

Now, let's check each condition.

1. Replace a with1:1694.

Check divisibility by7: 7*242=1694. So, 1694 is divisible by7.

Good.

2. Replace b with1:5194.

Check if5194 is divisible by7.

Compute 7*742=5194. Yes, it is divisible.

3. Replace c with1:5614.

Check divisibility by7.

7*802=5614. Yes, it is divisible.

4. Replace d with1:5691.

Check divisibility by7.

7*813=5691. Yes, it is divisible.

So, N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

Now, check if N is the greatest such number.

Wait, perhaps there's a larger number.

Wait, since a=5, which is the highest possible under mod7.

But let's see if we can get a higher N.

Wait, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

We can try to increase d to7, but then d=7.

Wait, d=4 is the only possible value for d, as per equation C.

Wait, equation C:d≡3c -2 mod7.

c=9:3*9=27≡6 mod7. 6-2=4 mod7. So, d=4 or11 (invalid). So, d=4.

So, N=5694.

Is there a higher N?

Wait, perhaps with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

If we try to increase c to9, which we did.

But what if c=2?

Then, c=2, d≡3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So, d=4.

So, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

But 5624 is less than5694.

So, 5694 is the larger.

Alternatively, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

But wait, could we have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, and then try to increase d to7?

But d=4 is the only valid digit for d.

Wait, no, because d≡4 mod7, so d=4 or11, which is invalid.

So, d=4.

So, N=5694.

Now, check if this is the maximum possible.

Wait, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

But let's check if we can have a higher N.

Wait, N=5694.

Wait, is there a higher four-digit number that satisfies the conditions?

Wait, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest possible.

Alternatively, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest.

Wait, let's check if there is a higher N.

Wait, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest possible with a=5.

But perhaps there's a larger a?

Wait, a=5 is the maximum under mod7. Because a=5, which is less than7.

Wait, but a=5 is the highest possible a that satisfies a≡5 mod7 and a is a digit (1-9).

So, yes, a=5 is the highest possible.

So, N=5694 is the maximum four-digit number satisfying the conditions.

So, now, we need to find Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Divide 5694 by1000: quotient Q=5, remainder R=694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm.

5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder694.

Yes, so Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

So, the answer is699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote the digits of \( N \) as \( a, b, c, d \), so \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

We analyze the conditions when each digit is replaced by 1:

1. Replacing \( a \) with 1: \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \) must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing \( b \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \) must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing \( c \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \) must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing \( d \) with 1: \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \) must be divisible by 7.

Converting these conditions modulo 7, we derive a system of congruences. After solving these congruences, we find that \( a = 5 \), \( b = 6 \), \( c = 9 \), and \( d = 4 \). Thus, \( N = 5694 \).

When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q = 5 \) and the remainder \( R = 694 \). Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
