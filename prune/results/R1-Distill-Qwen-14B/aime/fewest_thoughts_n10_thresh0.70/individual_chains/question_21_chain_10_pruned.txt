Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least integer base b (greater than or equal to 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits, right? And since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, each digit must be less than b, so d1 and d0 are integers from 0 to b-1, with d1 at least 1.

So, n = d1 * b + d0, and the sum of the digits is d1 + d0. The condition for being b-eautiful is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives (d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0. Expanding the left side: (d1)^2 + 2*d1*d0 + (d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

Hmm, so moving everything to one side: (d1)^2 + 2*d1*d0 + (d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0. Let me rearrange terms: (d1)^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0)^2 - d0 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Let me consider d1 as the variable, so the equation is:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b) * d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0.

For each base b, I can try different d0 and solve for d1, but I need to remember that d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation differently. Let me try to write it as:

d1^2 + 2*d0*d1 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0 + something? Wait, no, I think I already did that.

Wait, another approach: since n = d1*b + d0, and n = (d1 + d0)^2, because sqrt(n) is d1 + d0. So, (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

Let me write this as: (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.

Let me denote s = d1 + d0. Then, s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But since d0 = s - d1, substituting that into the equation gives s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1). Simplifying:

s^2 = d1*b + s - d1
s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)
So, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, d1 must be equal to (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). But d1 has to be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each possible s, I can compute d1, and then check if d0 = s - d1 is a valid digit (i.e., between 0 and b-1), and then check if n is a two-digit number in base b.

Wait, but what is the range of possible s
