Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it properly.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² would satisfy this condition. Wait, quartic residues... So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That would mean that -1 is a fourth power modulo p².

But maybe I should think about it step by step.

First, let's find such a prime p. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Let's check each one to see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Starting with p=2:

We need to see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3,...

n=1: 1⁴=1, 1+1=2. 2 mod4=2, not 0. So 4 doesn't divide 2.

n=2: 2⁴=16, 16+1=17. 17 mod4=1, not 0.

n=3: same as n=1, since 3 is odd, 3⁴=81≡1 mod4. So 81+1=82≡2 mod4.

So it seems for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3.

We check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since 9 is small):

n=1:1⁴=1 → 1+1=2≡2 mod9. No.

n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8≡8 mod9. No.

n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0+1=1 mod9. No.

n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, so 256≡4 mod9. 4+1=5≡5 mod9. Not 0.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625/9: 9*69=621, so 625≡4 mod9. 4+1=5. Same
