Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999, and when I read them top to bottom, the three numbers should add up to 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9. Let me label the rows as Row 1 and Row 2, and the columns as Column 1, Column 2, Column 3.

So the grid looks like this:

Row 1: C1 | C2 | C3

Row 2: D1 | D2 | D3

Wait, actually, the problem says the grid is 2x3, so two rows and three columns. So, each row has three cells, and each column has two cells. Let me denote the cells as follows:

Row 1: A | B | C

Row 2: D | E | F

So the grid is:

A B C

D E F

Now, when reading left to right, the two numbers formed are ABC and DEF. So ABC is a three-digit number, right? Similarly, DEF is another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

On the other hand, reading top to bottom, the three numbers formed are AD, BE, CF. Wait, no, I think I need to clarify. When reading top to bottom, each column forms a number. So Column 1 is A followed by D, which is a two-digit number, AD. Similarly, Column 2 is B followed by E, BE, and Column 3 is C followed by F, CF. So the three numbers are AD, BE, and CF, and their sum should be 99. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, to recap, the conditions are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999

2. AD + BE + CF = 99

We need to find the number of possible digit arrangements in the grid that satisfy both conditions.

Let me write down the equations more formally.

Let me denote the digits as follows:

A, B, C are the digits in the first row.

D, E, F are the digits in the second row.

So, the first condition is:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999

And the second condition is:

10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99

So, we have two equations:

Equation (1): 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

Equation (2): 10A + D + 10B + E +
