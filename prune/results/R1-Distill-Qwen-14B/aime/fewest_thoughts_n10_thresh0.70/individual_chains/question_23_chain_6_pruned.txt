Alright, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.

The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis is 2b, where b² =24, so b=2*sqrt(6). 

Now, the rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes.

Let me try to visualize this. Points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the distance between A and B is equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But wait, in a rhombus, the sides are equal but the diagonals aren't necessarily equal. The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, but their lengths can vary.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is formed by four points on the hyperbola, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm. So the question is about the square of the length of diagonal BD, and we need to find the infimum of BD², or the greatest lower bound? Wait, no, wait: it says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So that would be the infimum, the greatest lower bound, the minimum possible value of BD² across all possible such rhombi. Because if we're looking for a number that is less than BD² for all rhombi, the largest such number would be the minimal BD².

So our goal is to find the minimum possible value of BD², given that ABCD is a rhombus with vertices on the hyperbola and diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, let's denote the points as follows:

Let A = (x, y), then C = (-x, -y). Similarly, let B = (p, q), then D = (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length.

So, AB² = BC² = CD² = DA².

Compute AB²: The distance between A and B.

AB² = (x - p)² + (y - q)².

Similarly, BC² = (p + x)² + (q + y)².

Wait, no: Point B is (p, q), point C is (-x, -y). So BC is from B(p, q) to C(-x, -y). So BC² = (-x - p)² + (-y - q)².

Similarly, CD² is the distance from C to D: C(-x,-y) to D(-p,-q), so CD² = (-p + x)^2 + (-q + y)^2.

And DA² is the distance from D to A: D(-p,-q) to A(x, y), so DA² = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2.

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB² = BC² = CD² = DA².

Thus, AB
