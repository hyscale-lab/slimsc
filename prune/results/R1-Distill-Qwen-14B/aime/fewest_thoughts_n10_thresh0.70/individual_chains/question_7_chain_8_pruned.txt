Okay, so I came across this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention the probability will be m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, we have a regular octagon, which means it has 8 sides and 8 vertices, all equally spaced around a circle. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. That means for each vertex, the color is red with probability 1/2 and blue with probability 1/2.

Now, the key part is figuring out the probability that there's a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8=45) such that when we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, if we consider the octagon before any rotation, let's say the original coloring is some arrangement of red and blue vertices. After rotating it by k positions (where k is from 0 to 7), all the blue vertices in the original should end up on red vertices. 

Wait, but if we rotate the octagon, the colors themselves don't change, only their positions. So, if we have a rotation that maps each blue vertex to a red position, that means the set of blue vertices in the original must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or put another way, the blue vertices must form a rotationally equivalent set to the red vertices. 

Alternatively, thinking in terms of transformations, the set of blue vertices must be a shifted version of the set of red vertices. So, the coloring must be such that when you rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all blue vertices align with red ones. 

This seems related to group theory and cyclic groups because we're dealing with rotations of a regular polygon, which form a cyclic group of order 8. Maybe I can model this problem using group actions or something similar.

Let me try to formalize it a bit. Let's denote the octagon's vertices as labeled 0 through 7 in a circular manner. Each coloring can be represented as a subset S of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, where each element is either in S (blue) or not (red). The problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation (element of the cyclic group C8) that maps S to the complement of S, i.e., S is mapped to the set of red vertices.

Wait, the complement of S would be the red vertices. So, if S is the set of blue vertices, then the red vertices are the complement, which is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \ S. So, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation r (element of C8) such that r(S) = complement(S). 

Alternatively, r(S)
