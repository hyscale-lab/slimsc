Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break it down. So, Alice picks set A. Then Bob is creating sets B where each B is a finite, non-empty set of positive integers, and the maximum element of each B is in A. The number of such B's is 2024, and from that, we need to figure out what A is, specifically the sum of its elements.

Let me think about how Bob is generating these sets. For each element 'a' in A, Bob can create sets B where the maximum is 'a'. So, how many such sets are there for a given 'a'?

Well, if the maximum is 'a', then the other elements of B must be less than 'a'. So, for each 'a', the number of possible B's with maximum 'a' is the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with 'a'.

Wait, because a set B with maximum 'a' must include 'a' and any subset of the numbers less than 'a'. But since the set must be non-empty, and 'a' is included, the subsets of the smaller numbers can range from empty set (but then B would just be {a}) up to all subsets. But wait, no: the set B is non-empty, but since it includes 'a', it's automatically non-empty, so the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} can be any subset, including the empty subset.

So, for each 'a', the number of sets B with maximum 'a' is 2^{a-1}. Because the number of subsets of a set with (a-1) elements is 2^{a-1}, each of which corresponds to a set B where B = subset ∪ {a}.

So, the total number of sets B Bob can list is the sum over all 'a' in A of 2^{a-1}.

But the problem says Bob's list has 2024 sets. So, sum_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of the elements of A, given that.

So, we need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024. Then, compute sum_{a ∈ A} a.

Hmm, okay, so we're looking for a set A whose elements satisfy that the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024. Let me think about how to find such a set A.

Since 2^{a-1} is a power of two, each term is double the previous. So, perhaps A is a set where the corresponding exponents give a binary representation of 2024.

Wait, because when you sum different powers of two, you can represent numbers in binary. So, 2024 in
