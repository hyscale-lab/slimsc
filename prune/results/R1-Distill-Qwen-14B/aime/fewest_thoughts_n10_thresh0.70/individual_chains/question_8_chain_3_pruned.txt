Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let's look at the given equations:

1) a + b + c = 300
2) a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) satisfying both.

Starting with the first equation, since it's a linear equation, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's say c = 300 - a - b. Then, I can substitute c into the second equation to reduce the number of variables.

So, substituting c = 300 - a - b into the second equation gives:

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)²a + (300 - a - b)²b = 6,000,000

That looks really messy, but maybe I can expand and simplify it.

Let me expand each term step by step.

First term: a²b remains as is.

Second term: a²*(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b

Third term: b²a remains as is.

Fourth term: b²*(300 - a - b) = 300b² - a b² - b³

Fifth term: (300 - a - b)² * a. Let's compute (300 - a - b)² first.

(300 - a - b)² = 300² - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)²
= 90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b²

So, multiplying by a:
= 90000a - 600a(a + b) + a³ + 2a²b + a b²

Similarly, sixth term: (300 - a - b)² * b = 90000b - 600b(a + b) + a²b² + 2a b² + b³

Wait, actually, I think I might have made a mistake in expanding that fifth term. Let me double-check.

Wait, (300 - a - b)^2 is (300 - (a + b))^2, which is 300^2 - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2. Expanding that:

= 90000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b².

Yes, that's correct. So when we multiply by a, each term in the expansion is multiplied by a:

= 90000a - 600a(a + b) + a*(a²) + 2a*(ab) + a*(b²)
= 90000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b²

Similarly, when we multiply by b:

= 90000b - 600b(a + b) + b*(a²) + 2b*(ab) + b*(b²)
= 90000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2a b² + b³

So now, putting all the terms back into the equation:

First term: a²b
Second term: 300a² - a³ - a²b
Third term: b²a
Fourth term: 300b² - a b² - b³
Fifth term: 90000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b²
Sixth term: 90000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2a b² + b³

Now, let's sum all these terms together:

Let me list all the terms:

1. a²b
2. +300a²
3. -a³
4. -a²b
5. +b²a
6. +300b²
7. -a b²
8. -b³
9. +90000a
10. -600a²
11. -600ab
12. +a³
13. +2a²b
14. +a b²
15. +90000b
16. -600ab
17. -600b²
18. +a²b
19. +2a b²
20. +b³

Now, let's combine like terms.

First, let's look for the a³ terms:

- a³ (term 3) + a³ (term 12) = 0

Next, b³ terms:

- b³ (term 8) + b³ (term 20) = 0

Now, terms with a²b:

1. a²b (term1) -a²b (term4) +2a²b (term13) +a²b (term18) = (1 -1 +2 +1)a²b = 3a²b

Similarly, terms with ab²:

5. b²a (term5) -a b² (term7) +a b² (term14) + 2a b² (term19) = (1 -1 +1 +2)ab²= 3ab²

Terms with a²:

2. +300a² (term2) -600a² (term10) = (300 - 600)a² = -300a²

Terms with b²:

6. +300b² (term6) -600b² (term17) = (300 - 600)b² = -300b²

Terms with a:

9. +90000a (term9)

Terms with b:

15. +90000b (term15)

Terms with ab:

11. -600ab (term11) -600ab (term16) = (-600 -600)ab = -1200ab

So putting it all together, the equation becomes:

3a²b + 3ab² -300a² -300b² +90000a +90000b -1200ab = 6,000,000

Hmm, let's factor where possible.

Looking at 3a²b + 3ab², we can factor 3ab(a + b).

Similarly, -300a² -300b² is -300(a² + b²).

Then, +90000a +90000b is 90000(a + b).

And -1200ab.

So, putting it together:

3ab(a + b) - 300(a² + b²) + 90000(a + b) - 1200ab = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe we can factor out some terms or find a way to express a² + b² in terms of (a + b)^2.

We know that a² + b² = (a + b)^2 - 2ab.

So, let's substitute that in:

3ab(a + b) - 300[(a + b)^2 - 2ab] + 90000(a + b) - 1200ab = 6,000,000

Let me expand this:

3ab(a + b) - 300(a + b)^2 + 600ab +90000(a + b) -1200ab = 6,000,000

Now, let's combine like terms:

First, the terms involving ab:

3ab(a + b) +600ab -1200ab

= 3ab(a + b) -600ab

Then, the terms involving (a + b)^2:

-300(a + b)^2

And the terms involving (a + b):
