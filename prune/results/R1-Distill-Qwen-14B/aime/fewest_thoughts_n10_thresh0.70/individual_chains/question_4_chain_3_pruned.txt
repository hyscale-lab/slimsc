Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with tokens. The goal is to find out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of how Alice plays. 

Let me start by understanding the game rules. There's a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, it's a turn-based game with two possible moves each time.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So the idea is to find all n where Bob can win, meaning that Alice is in a losing position when the game starts. Because if Bob can always respond to Alice's moves to bring her back to a losing position, he can win.

Let me try to model this. I think I can use dynamic programming to figure out for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's define:

- If n = 0, it means the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

Wait, actually, when n=0, the previous player has just taken the last token, so the current player can't do anything and loses. So, n=0 is a losing position.

For n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. But wait, if the opponent is left with n=1, which is a winning position for them because they can take the last token. So does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, could the current player take 4? No, because n=2, they can't take 4. So the only
