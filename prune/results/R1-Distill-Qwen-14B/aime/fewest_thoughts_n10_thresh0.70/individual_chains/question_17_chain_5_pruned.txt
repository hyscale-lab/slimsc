Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, a rectangular box has length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, and z. So, the surface area S of a rectangular box is given by the formula S = 2(xy + yz + xz). And the volume V is given by V = xyz.

Given that S = 54 and V = 23, so we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

Now, I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, which is r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, to minimize r, I need to minimize the space diagonal d, which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z².

So, the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.

This looks like an optimization problem with constraints. I can probably use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me recall, Lagrange multipliers help find the extrema of a function subject to equality constraints.

So, the function to minimize is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

The constraints are:
1. g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Wait, but with two constraints, I might need to use a method that handles multiple constraints, like using two Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of others using the constraints and substitute.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of symmetric variables. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the minimum occurs when x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z = a, then:

Surface area: 6a² = 54 ⇒ a² = 9 ⇒ a = 3.

Volume: a³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere likely doesn't have x = y = z. So, maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs at some other point where variables aren't equal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's suppose I solve for z from the volume equation:

z = 23/(xy)

Then, substitute this into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify:

xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27

Hmm, that
