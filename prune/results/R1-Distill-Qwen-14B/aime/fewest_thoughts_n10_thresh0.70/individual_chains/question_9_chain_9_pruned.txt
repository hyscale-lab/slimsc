Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations to make it clearer. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both x and y are greater than 1, which is good because logarithms are defined for positive numbers greater than 1 in this context.

I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. For example, log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that to simplify both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying that property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, okay, so that's simpler. Let me write that down.

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I have two equations involving logs with bases x and y. I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b), thanks to the change of base formula. So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A.

Wait, let me make sure I get that right. If log_x(y) = A, then y = x^A. Alternatively, log_y(x) would be log_y(x) = 1/A because x = y^{1/A}. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, let me set A = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/A.

Substituting into the two equations:

Equation 1 becomes x * A = 10.

Equation 2 becomes 4y * (1/A) = 10.

So now I have a system of two equations:

1. x * A = 10

2. (4y) / A = 10

Hmm, okay, so now I have x and y in terms of A. Let me see if I can express x and y in terms of A and then relate them.

From Equation 1: x = 10 / A.

From Equation 2: (4y)/A = 10 => 4y = 10 A => y = (10 A)/4 = (5 A)/2.

So, I have x = 10 / A and y = (5 A)/2.

But remember
