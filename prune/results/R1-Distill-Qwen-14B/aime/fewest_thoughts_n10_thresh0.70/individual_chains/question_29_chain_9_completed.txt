Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Hmm, let me try to visualize the problem first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting; so those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16, so that means ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the length and BC is the width. So, AB is 107 units long, and BC is 16 units. Therefore, the sides are 107 and 16. So, the rectangle is longer along AB and shorter along BC.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width. So, EF is much longer than FG.

Now, both rectangles are such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, then all these points are on this line. Also, A, D, H, G are on a circle. So, those four points lie on a circle, which means that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Wait, let me think about the positions of the rectangles. ABCD and EFGH are two separate rectangles. Since D and E are consecutive points on the line, perhaps the rectangles are adjacent in some way?

Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so D is one of its corners. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, with E being one of its corners. So, if D and E are on the same line, maybe the rectangles are connected in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles are placed such that their sides are along the same line but in different directions. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier.

Let me try to assign coordinate system. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity, since it's a common point. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, let me figure out the coordinates of the other points.

If D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, from D, moving along CD, which is equal in length to AB (but not the same direction). Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, if AB is 107, then CD is also 107. Similarly, BC is 16, so AD is 16.

Wait, but I placed D at (0,0). So, where are the other points?

Let me think: In rectangle ABCD, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107, 0) because DC is 107 units long. Then, from C, moving up by BC=16 units to reach B, so B would be at (107,16). Then, from B, moving left along AB to reach A, which should be at (107 - 107, 16) = (0,16). Wait, but that would make AD from (0,0) to (0,16), which is 16 units, which matches BC. That makes sense. So, the coordinates are:

- D: (0,0)
- C: (107,0)
- B: (107,16)
- A: (0,16)

Okay, that looks correct.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Points E, F, G, H. Let me figure out their positions. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), so the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0), and beyond. So, E must be somewhere on the x-axis either between D and C or beyond.

Wait, since E is a corner of rectangle EFGH. Let's think about the order of the points on the line. If points are D, E, C, F, then E is to the right of D, and F is to the right of C. So, E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe beyond C. But given that EF is 184, which is quite long, maybe E is to the left of D or F is beyond C.

Wait, let me think again. If D, E, C, F are in order on a line, then from D, moving towards E, then to C, then to F. So, the order is D --- E --- C --- F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Alternatively, perhaps D is on one side, E is somewhere else, but considering the problem statement, I think the order is D, E, C, F collinear, so that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

So, E is on the x-axis between D (0,0) and C (107,0). Let's denote E's coordinates as (e,0), where 0 < e < 107. Similarly, F is beyond C, so F is at (f, 0), where f > 107.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let's figure out its dimensions. EF is 184, which is the length of the side from E to F. So, the distance from E to F is 184. Since both E and F are on the x-axis, their y-coordinates are 0. So, the length EF is |f - e| = 184. So, f = e + 184.

Similarly, FG is 17. Since FG is a side of the rectangle EFGH, which is perpendicular to EF, since it's a rectangle. So, the side FG is vertical, either upwards or downwards from F. So, from F, moving up (let's assume upwards for now) 17 units to reach G. So, G would be at (f,17).

Then, from G, moving left along GH, which is equal in length to EF, which is 184. So, H would be at (f - 184, 17). Then, from H, moving down 17 units to reach E again? Wait, but E is at (e,0). So, H is at (f - 184,17), and then moving down 17 units would bring us to (f - 184,0). But E is at (e,0), so f - 184 must equal e. Because H is connected to E, but wait, in the rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So, HE should be equal and parallel to FG.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

In rectangle EFGH, sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH must also be 184 and HE must be 17. So, starting from E, which is at (e,0), moving along EF to F, which is at (e+184, 0). Then, moving up FG to G, which is at (e+184,17). Then, moving left along GH to H, which is at (e,17). Then, moving down HE to E again, which would be at (e,0). Wait, that can't be right because HE would be vertical, from H to E, which is 17 units, but then H is at (e,17), E is at (e,0), so that works. So, the rectangle EFGH is constructed as follows:

- E: (e, 0)
- F: (e + 184, 0)
- G: (e + 184, 17)
- H: (e, 17)

Wait, that makes sense. So, the rectangle is 184 units long along the x-axis and 17 units tall along the y-axis.

So, points:

- E: (e, 0)
- F: (e + 184, 0)
- G: (e + 184, 17)
- H: (e, 17)

So, now, the other condition is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e,17), and G is at (e+184,17). So, these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on a single circle. So, I need to find the value of e such that these four points lie on a circle.

Wait, to find e, I can use the condition that four points lie on a circle. The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. Alternatively, I can use the determinant condition for concyclic points.

But perhaps it's easier to use the power of a point or other properties. Alternatively, since three points can define a circle, I can find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, and then check the condition that G also lies on it.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's get the coordinates of A, D, H, G:

- A: (0,16)
- D: (0,0)
- H: (e,17)
- G: (e + 184,17)

We need these four points to lie on a circle.

Let me first find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H. Once I have that, I can substitute G's coordinates into the equation to solve for e.

So, let's find the equation of the circle passing through (0,0), (0,16), and (e,17).

A general circle equation is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Since the circle passes through (0,0), substituting x=0, y=0:

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.

So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Now, the circle passes through (0,16):

Substitute x=0, y=16:

0 + 256 + 0 + 2f*16 = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.

So, f = -8.

Now, the equation is x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now, it also passes through H: (e,17):

Substitute x = e, y =17:

e² + 289 + 2g*e - 16*17 = 0.

Compute 16*17: 272.

So, equation becomes:

e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0 => e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

So, equation (1): e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Now, we need another condition to find g. Wait, but we have only one equation so far. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can find the center and radius of the circle. The center is at (-g, 8), since the general form is (h,k) = (-g, -f) = (-g,8). The radius squared is h² + k² - c = g² + 64.

So, the center is at (h,k) = (-g,8), and radius squared is g² + 64.

Wait, but the circle passes through A (0,16), D (0,0), and H (e,17). So, let's compute the distances from the center to these points.

Distance from center (-g,8) to D (0,0):

√[ (-g - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2 ] = √(g² + 64) = radius.

Distance to A (0,16):

√[ (-g - 0)^2 + (8 - 16)^2 ] = √(g² + 64) = same as radius.

Distance to H (e,17):

√[ (-g - e)^2 + (8 -17)^2 ] = √[ (e + g)^2 + 81 ].

This must equal the radius, which is √(g² + 64). So,

√[ (e + g)^2 + 81 ] = √(g² + 64).

Squaring both sides:

(e + g)^2 +81 = g² +64.

Expanding (e + g)^2: e² + 2eg + g².

So:

e² + 2eg + g² +81 = g² +64.

Simplify:

e² + 2eg +81 =64.

So,

e² + 2eg = -17.

Which is the same as equation (1): e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Hmm, so that doesn't give any new information. So, perhaps I need another condition.

Wait, but the circle also passes through point G: (e + 184,17).

So, let's substitute G into the circle equation.

The circle equation is x² + y² + 2g x -16 y = 0.

Substitute x = e + 184, y =17:

(e + 184)^2 + 289 + 2g(e +184) -16*17 = 0.

Compute 16*17: 272.

So,

(e + 184)^2 + 289 + 2g(e +184) -272 = 0.

Simplify:

(e + 184)^2 + 2g(e +184) +17 =0.

Now, expand (e + 184)^2: e² + 368 e + (184)^2.

So,

e² + 368 e + 33856 + 2g(e +184) +17 =0.

Simplify:

e² + 368 e + 33856 + 2g e + 368 g +17 =0.

Combine like terms:

e² + (368 + 2g) e + (33856 + 368 g +17) =0.

Simplify constants: 33856 +17=33873.

So:

e² + (368 + 2g) e + 33873 + 368 g =0.

Now, from equation (1): e² + 2g e = -17.

Let me see if I can express this equation using equation (1). Let's denote equation (1): e² + 2g e = -17.

So, e² = -17 - 2g e.

Substitute e² into the above equation:

(-17 -2g e) + (368 + 2g) e + 33873 + 368 g =0.

Simplify:

-17 -2g e + 368 e + 2g e + 33873 + 368 g =0.

Notice that -2g e and +2g e cancel out.

So, remaining terms:

-17 + 368 e + 33873 + 368 g =0.

Combine constants: -17 +33873 = 33856.

So,

368 e + 368 g +33856 =0.

Factor out 368:

368 (e + g) +33856 =0.

Divide both sides by 368:

(e + g) + 33856 / 368 = 0.

Compute 33856 / 368:

Let me compute 368 × 92: 368 ×90=33120, 368 ×2=736. 33120+736=33856. So, 368 ×92=33856.

Thus,

(e + g) +92=0 => e + g = -92.

So, equation (2): e + g = -92.

From equation (1): e² + 2g e +17=0.

So, we have:

e + g = -92 → g = -92 -e.

Substitute g into equation (1):

e² + 2*(-92 -e)*e +17=0.

Compute 2*(-92 -e)*e: 2*(-92 e -e²)= -184 e -2e².

So,

e² -184 e -2e² +17=0.

Simplify:

-e² -184 e +17=0.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

e² + 184 e -17=0.

So, quadratic equation: e² + 184 e -17=0.

Solving for e using quadratic formula:

e = [-184 ± sqrt(184² + 4*17)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184² = (180 +4)^2 = 180² + 2*180*4 +4²= 32400 + 1440 +16= 33856.

So, 4*17=68.

So, discriminant is 33856 +68=33924.

sqrt(33924): Let's see, 184²=33856, so sqrt(33924)=184 + (33924-33856)/(2*184 +1) ?

Wait, no, that's a linear approximation. Alternatively, notice that 184²=33856, 185²=34225. 33924 is between them. Let's compute 184.5²: (184 +0.5)^2=184² +2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25, which is higher than 33924. So, sqrt(33924)=~184.2.

But maybe 184.2²= approx 184² + 2*184*0.2 +0.2²=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64, which is close to 33924. So perhaps it's 184.18 or something, but for exact value, it's better to factor.

Wait, 33924=4*8481.

8481, let me see. 8481 divided by 3 is 2827, which is again divided by 3: 942.333, no, 2827 ÷3 is 942.333, which is not integer. Hmm. Maybe 8481 is a square? Let me check sqrt(8481)= approx 92.1.

Wait, 92²=8464, 93²=8649. So, no. So, 33924=4*8481, which can't be factored into perfect squares. So, perhaps the square root is irrational. So, we'll proceed with sqrt(33924).

Thus,

e = [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ] / 2.

Hmm, but e must be a positive number since point E is between D(0,0) and C(107,0). So, e is between 0 and 107.

So, let's compute the positive root:

sqrt(33924)= approx 184.2 as above.

So,

e = [ -184 + 184.2 ] / 2 ≈ (0.2)/2=0.1.

Wait, that's about 0.1, which is positive but very small. Hmm, but let's see if that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(33924) precisely.

Let me compute 184²=33856. 33924-33856=68.

So, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184² +68)=sqrt( (184)^2 +68 ). Hmm, perhaps it's not a whole number.

Wait, 184²=33856, 185²=34225. 33924 is 33856 +68=184² +68.

Wait, 68=4*17. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, in equation (1): e² + 2g e +17=0.

In equation (2): e + g = -92 → g= -92 -e.

Substituting into equation (1):

e² + 2*(-92 -e)*e +17=0.

Which is e² - 184 e -2 e² +17=0.

That simplifies to -e² -184 e +17=0, which is e² +184 e -17=0.

So, that's correct.

But the solution for e is [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17) ] / 2.

Wait, 184²=33856, 4*17=68. So, sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).

So, yeah, that's correct.

So, e is [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] / 2. The other root is negative, so we take the positive one.

Wait, but sqrt(33924)= approx 184.183, so:

e ≈ [ -184 + 184.183 ] / 2 ≈ (0.183)/2 ≈ 0.0915.

So, e≈0.0915. That's a very small e, almost at D. So, point E is very close to D, but on the x-axis.

Wait, but is that possible? Let me think. If E is nearly at D, then the rectangle EFGH is a long, thin rectangle extending from near D to F, which would be at e +184≈0.0915+184≈184.0915, which is way beyond C (which is at 107,0). So, F would be at (184.0915,0).

But then, point G would be at (e +184,17)≈(184.0915,17), and H would be at (e,17)≈(0.0915,17).

So, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H≈(0.0915,17), G≈(184.0915,17) lie on a circle.

Hmmm. That seems plausible, but let's see.

Wait, but in the problem statement, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E is between D and C. Wait, but in this case, e≈0.0915, so E is just a bit to the right of D, between D and C, which is at 107.

Wait, but F is way beyond C, at 184.0915, which is beyond C (107,0). So, that's okay.

But let me think again. If E is at approximately 0.0915, then the distance CE would be C's x-coordinate minus E's x-coordinate: 107 - 0.0915≈106.9085. So, approximately 107. But the problem states that BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184, so maybe CE is exactly 107? But that seems too neat.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me go back and check.

Wait, in equation (1): e² +2g e +17=0.

From equation (2): e +g =-92 → g= -92 -e.

Substitute into equation (1):

e² +2*(-92 -e)*e +17=0 → e² -184 e -2 e² +17=0 → -e² -184 e +17=0 → multiply both sides by (-1): e² +184 e -17=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the solution is e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17) ] / 2.

Wait, 184²=33856, 4*17=68. So, sqrt(33856+68)=sqrt(33924).

So, 33924=4*8481. Hmm, 8481. Let me check if 8481 is a perfect square. Wait, 92²=8464, 93²=8649. So, between 92 and 93, but not a perfect square.

So, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, but 8481 is 92² + 17=8464+17=8481.

So, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(92² + 17). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can factor 8481:

Divide by 3: 8481 ÷3=2827. 2827 ÷3=942.333, no.

2827 ÷7=403.857, no. 2827 ÷13≈217.46, no.

2827 ÷17≈166.29, no. Hmm, maybe 2827 is prime? Not sure.

But perhaps it doesn't matter because the exact value might not be an integer.

So, going back, e ≈0.0915. So, CE=107 - e≈106.9085≈106.91.

But the problem is likely set up to have CE as an integer. So, perhaps my mistake is in assuming the position of E.

Wait, perhaps I got the order of D, E, C, F wrong. Maybe E is beyond C, so the order is D, C, E, F. Because if E is beyond C, then E's coordinate e would be greater than 107. Let me check that.

Wait, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order could be D --- C --- E --- F, or D --- E --- C --- F. The original assumption was D --- E --- C --- F, but perhaps it's D --- C --- E --- F.

Let me try that.

So, if E is beyond C, then E's coordinate would be e >107, and F would be e +184. So, F would be at e +184, which is way beyond C.

But then, point E is beyond C, so E is at (e,0) where e>107.

In that case, the rectangle EFGH would have E at (e,0), F at (e+184,0), G at (e+184,17), H at (e,17).

Then, the four points A, D, H, G would be:

A: (0,16)

D: (0,0)

H: (e,17)

G: (e+184,17)

Again, they are supposed to lie on a circle.

So, using similar approach as before, find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, and then substitute G into it.

Proceeding as before:

Circle passes through (0,0), (0,16), (e,17).

General equation: x² + y² + 2gx +2fy +c=0.

Passing through (0,0): c=0.

Equation: x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Passing through (0,16):

0 +256 +0 +32f=0 → 32f= -256 → f= -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16 y=0.

Passing through H (e,17):

e² + 289 +2g e -16*17=0.

16*17=272.

So, e² +289 +2g e -272=0 → e² +2g e +17=0 → equation (1).

Now, passing through G (e+184,17):

Substitute into equation:

(e+184)^2 +17² +2g(e+184) -16*17=0.

Compute:

(e+184)^2 +289 +2g(e+184) -272=0.

Simplify:

(e+184)^2 +2g(e+184) +17=0.

Expanding:

e² + 368 e + 33856 +2g e + 368 g +17=0.

So,

e² + (368 + 2g) e + (33856 + 368 g +17)=0.

Simplify constants: 33856+17=33873.

So,

e² + (368 + 2g) e + (33873 + 368 g)=0.

Now, from equation (1): e² +2g e = -17.

Express e² = -17 -2g e.

Substitute into the above equation:

(-17 -2g e) + (368 +2g) e +33873 +368 g=0.

Simplify:

-17 -2g e +368 e +2g e +33873 +368 g=0.

Again, -2g e +2g e cancels.

So,

-17 + 368 e +33873 +368 g=0.

Combine constants: -17 +33873=33856.

So,

368 e +368 g +33856=0.

Factor out 368:

368 (e + g) +33856=0.

Divide both sides by 368:

e +g +92=0 → e +g =-92 → equation (2).

So, same as before.

So, equation (1): e² +2g e +17=0.

Equation (2): e +g =-92 → g= -92 -e.

Substitute into equation (1):

e² +2*(-92 -e)*e +17=0 → e² -184 e -2 e² +17=0 → -e² -184 e +17=0 → e² +184 e -17=0.

Same quadratic as before.

So, e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17) ] /2.

Which is same as before.

So, same result: e≈0.0915.

But if E is beyond C, then e would have to be greater than 107, but the solution e≈0.0915 is less than 107. So, that suggests that E is between D and C, not beyond.

So, perhaps E is between D and C, but then CE=107 - e≈107 -0.0915≈106.9085, which is approximately 107, but not exactly.

But perhaps the exact value is 107. Let me check.

Wait, is there a way to have e= something that would make CE=107? That would require that E is at (0,0), but E is at (e,0). If E were at D, which is (0,0), then CE would be CD=107. But E is a different point.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system.

Wait, perhaps I should have placed point D at a different coordinate. Maybe I should have placed point C at (0,0). Wait, let me try that.

Alternative approach: Let me place point C at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point D would be at (-107,0), because CD is 107. Then, point B would be at (0,16), and point A at (-107,16).

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should place point A at (0,0). Let me try that.

Place A at (0,0). Then, since AB=107, point B would be at (107,0). BC=16, so point C is at (107,16). Then, point D is at (0,16).

So, rectangle ABCD has coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- B: (107,0)
- C: (107,16)
- D: (0,16)

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear on a straight line. So, D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, the line is y=16.

Wait, but in this coordinate system, point D is at (0,16), C is at (107,16). So, the line is horizontal at y=16. So, points E and F must lie on y=16.

Wait, but rectangle EFGH. Points E, F, G, H.

Wait, if E is on y=16, then rectangle EFGH must have sides either vertical or horizontal.

Wait, but if EF is 184, and FG is 17, then EF is a horizontal side of 184 units, and FG is vertical of 17 units.

So, point E is at (e,16), F is at (e+184,16), G is at (e+184,16+17)=(e+184,33), H is at (e,33).

Wait, but then points A, D, H, G are supposed to lie on a circle. Let's see where these points are.

Point A: (0,0)

Point D: (0,16)

Point H: (e,33)

Point G: (e+184,33)

So, these four points lie on a circle.

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.

Again, using the general equation x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Passing through A (0,0):

0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So, equation: x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Passing through D (0,16):

0 +256 +0 +32f=0 → 32f= -256 → f= -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16 y=0.

Passing through H (e,33):

e² + 1089 +2g e -16*33=0.

16*33=528.

So,

e² +1089 +2g e -528=0 → e² +2g e +561=0 → equation (1).

Passing through G (e+184,33):

(e+184)^2 + 33² +2g(e+184) -16*33=0.

Compute:

(e+184)^2 +1089 +2g(e+184) -528=0.

Simplify:

(e+184)^2 +2g(e+184) +561=0.

Expanding:

e² + 368 e + 33856 +2g e + 368 g +561=0.

So,

e² + (368 +2g) e + (33856 +368 g +561)=0.

Simplify constants: 33856 +561=34417.

So,

e² + (368 +2g) e +34417 +368 g=0.

From equation (1): e² +2g e = -561.

So, substitute e²= -561 -2g e into the above equation:

(-561 -2g e) + (368 +2g) e +34417 +368 g=0.

Simplify:

-561 -2g e +368 e +2g e +34417 +368 g=0.

Again, -2g e +2g e cancels.

So,

-561 +368 e +34417 +368 g=0.

Combine constants: -561 +34417=33856.

So,

368 e +368 g +33856=0.

Factor out 368:

368 (e +g) +33856=0 → e +g +92=0 → e +g =-92 → equation (2).

So, same as before.

So, equation (1): e² +2g e +561=0.

Equation (2): e +g =-92 → g= -92 -e.

Substituting into equation (1):

e² +2*(-92 -e)*e +561=0 → e² -184 e -2 e² +561=0 → -e² -184 e +561=0 → e² +184 e -561=0.

Solving:

e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33856.

4*561=2244.

So, discriminant=33856 +2244=36100.

sqrt(36100)=190.

Wow, that's a perfect square! So,

e = [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

So, two solutions:

e = ( -184 +190 )/2 =6/2=3.

e = ( -184 -190 )/2= (-374)/2= -187.

So, e=3 or e=-187.

Since in this coordinate system, E is on the line y=16, between D (0,16) and C (107,16), so e must be between 0 and 107. So, e=3 is acceptable, and e=-187 is not, as it would be to the left of D.

So, e=3.

So, point E is at (3,16).

Then, point F is at (e+184,16)= (3+184,16)= (187,16).

Point G is at (187,33).

Point H is at (3,33).

Now, CE is the distance between C (107,16) and E (3,16). Since both are on y=16, the distance is |107 -3|=104.

So, CE=104.

Wait, that's an integer. So, that must be the answer.

But wait, let me confirm everything.

So, in this coordinate system, A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), H is at (3,33), G is at (187,33).

We can check if these four points lie on a circle.

Equation of the circle is x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

From earlier steps, we have c=0, f=-8, and from e=3, g= -92 -e= -92 -3= -95.

So, equation is x² + y² +2*(-95)x +2*(-8)y=0 → x² + y² -190x -16y=0.

Let's check point A (0,0):

0 +0 -0 -0=0 → yes.

Point D (0,16):

0 + 256 -0 -256=0 → yes.

Point H (3,33):

9 + 1089 -190*3 -16*33=9 +1089 -570 -528= (9 +1089)=1098; (570 +528)=1098. So, 1098 -1098=0 → yes.

Point G (187,33):

187² +33² -190*187 -16*33.

Compute 187²: 187*187= let's compute 200²=40000, subtract 13*200=2600, add 13²=169. Wait, no, that's (200-13)^2=200² -2*200*13 +13²=40000 -5200 +169=40000-5200=34800; 34800+169=34969.

33²=1089.

190*187= compute 200*187=37400, minus 10*187=1870 → 37400-1870=35530.

16*33=528.

So, 34969 +1089 -35530 -528.

Compute 34969 +1089=36058.

35530 +528=36058.

So, 36058 -36058=0 → yes.

So, all four points lie on the circle.

Thus, CE is the distance between C (107,16) and E (3,16), which is |107 -3|=104.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given geometric configuration. We place rectangle $ABCD$ with $A$ at $(0,0)$, $B$ at $(107,0)$, $C$ at $(107,16)$, and $D$ at $(0,16)$. Points $D$, $E$, $C$, and $F$ are collinear on the line $y=16$, with $E$ between $D$ and $C$, and $F$ beyond $C$. Rectangle $EFGH$ has $EF=184$ and $FG=17$, so $E$ is at $(e,16)$, $F$ at $(e+184,16)$, $G$ at $(e+184,33)$, and $H$ at $(e,33)$.

The condition that points $A$, $D$, $H$, and $G$ lie on a circle leads us to solve for $e$. Using the circle equation and substituting the coordinates of these points, we derive the quadratic equation $e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0$. Solving this gives $e = 3$ (since $e = -187$ is not feasible). Thus, $E$ is at $(3,16)$.

Finally, the length of $CE$ is the horizontal distance between $C$ at $(107,16)$ and $E$ at $(3,16)$, which is $107 - 3 = 104$.

$\boxed{104}$
