Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to picture it. Triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So first, let me recall some geometry concepts. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole or something related to the polar line. Wait, tangents from a common external point are equal in length. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Also, since AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P, perhaps we can use some power of a point theorem or something related to intersecting chords. Let me think.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since DB and DC are tangents, the power of D is DB² = DC². Also, since AD is a secant, the power of D is DP * DA = DB². Because the power of D is equal for both the tangent and the secant.

Wait, but I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can compute DB using the triangle's sides. Hmm, to compute DB, perhaps I need coordinates or use trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion? No, that might be too complicated for this problem.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or some properties of harmonic division or something. Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Wait, perhaps coordinate geometry would be a good approach here. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, and C.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point A is at (10,0) since AC=10. Point B is somewhere in the plane. We know AB=5 and BC=9. So, coordinates of B must satisfy distance from A (10,0) is 5, and from C (0,0) is 9.

So, let's compute the coordinates of B. Let me denote B as (x,y). Then, distance from C: √(x² + y²) = 9 ⇒ x² + y² = 81.

Distance from A: √((x - 10)² + y²) = 5 ⇒ (x - 10)² + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 10)² + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 ⇒ x² -20x +100 + y² - x² - y² = -56 ⇒ -20x + 100 = -56 ⇒ -20x = -156 ⇒ x = 156/20 = 39/5 =
