Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's see. I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. The key here is to figure out for which values of n the second player (Bob) can force a win, regardless of the first player's (Alice's) moves.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A losing position is one where no matter what move the player makes, the opponent can always respond in a way that forces a win. So, if Bob is to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning that whatever Alice does, Bob can bring the game back to another losing position for Alice, eventually leading her to lose.

Let me try to model this. Let's start by listing the possible values of n and determine whether they're winning (W) or losing (L) positions.

Base case: n = 0. Well, if there are no tokens left, the game is already over. So, the player who just moved has won. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. But Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1 from n=2, she leaves n=1. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2 is less than 4. So, Alice can only take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. Wait, that means n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, but wait, no. Wait, if it's Alice's turn and n=2, she has to take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. So, for Alice, n=2 is a losing position because whatever she does, Bob can win. So, n=2 is L?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think. When n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving n=1. Then Bob can take 1 and win. So, in this case, Alice cannot force a win from n=2, so n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice). So, Bob can win if n=2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, we're supposed to find the number of n where Bob can have a winning strategy, meaning that n is a losing position for Alice. So, if n=2 is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but let me get this straight. So, for n=2, Alice can't win because she can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob who takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving n=2. From above, n=2 is a losing position for Bob, meaning that Bob can't force a win from n=2. So if Alice takes 1, leaving n=2, Bob is in a losing position. Thus, n=3 is a winning position for Alice. So, n=3 is W.

Wait, but wait, alternatively, Alice could take 4, but n=3 is less than 4, so she can't. So, she can only take 1. So, she leaves n=2, which is a losing position for Bob. So, n=3 is W.

n=4: Alice can take 1, leaving n=3 (which is W for Bob), or take 4, leaving n=0, which is a losing position for Bob because Bob can't move and Alice just took the last token. Wait no, wait, if Alice takes 4 from n=4, she takes the last token and wins. So, n=4 is a W position because Alice can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if she takes 1, leaving n=3 for Bob, which is a W position for Bob. So, regardless of what Alice does, Bob can win from n=3. So, if Alice leaves n=3, Bob can take 1, leaving n=2 which is a losing position for Alice. So, n=3 is W for Bob. So, when n=4, Alice can choose to take 4 and win. So, n=4 is a W position for Alice, so Bob can't win in that case.

Wait, but wait, so n=4 is a W position because Alice can win immediately. So, n=4 is W.

Hmm, maybe I should make a table for small n and see the pattern.

Let me list n from 0 to, say, 10, and mark each as W or L.

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Result: Let's compute each step.

n=0: L (since you can't move)
n=1: From n=1, you can take 1, leading to n=0 (L). So, current player can force a win. So, W.
n=2: From n=2, the player can take 1, leading to n=1 (W). Or can't take 4. So, the only move leads to W for the opponent. So, current player can't force a win. So, L.
n=3: From n=3, the player can take 1, leading to n=2 (L). So, current player can force opponent into L, so W.
n=4: The player can take 1, leading to n=3 (W), or take 4, leading to n=0 (L). So, the player can choose to take 4 and win. So, W.
n=5: From n=5, the player can take 1, leading to n=4 (W), or take 4, leading to n=1 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So, current player can't force a win. So, L.
n=6: From n=6, the player can take 1, leading to n=5 (L), or take 4, leading to n=2 (L). So, either move leads to opponent being in L. So, current player can choose either and force opponent into L. So, W.
Wait, wait, no. Wait, n=5 is L, so if the current player takes 1, leaving n=5 (L), then opponent is in a losing position. So, current player can win. So, n=6 is W.

n=7: From n=7, the player can take 1, leading to n=6 (W), or take 4, leading to n=3 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So, current player can't force a win. So, L.

n=8: From n=8, the player can take 1, leading to n=7 (L), or take 4, leading to n=4 (W). So, the player can choose to take 1, leaving n=7 (L) for the opponent. So, current player can force a win. So, W.

n=9: From n=9, the player can take 1, leading to n=8 (W), or take 4, leading to n=5 (L). So, the player can take 4, leaving n=5 (L) for the opponent. So, current player can win. So, W.

n=10: From n=10, the player can take 1, leading to n=9 (W), or take 4, leading to n=6 (W). So, both moves lead to opponent in W positions. So, current player can't force a win. So, L.

Hmm, so the results so far:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Result: L W L W W L W L W W L

Wait, let me check n=5. From n=5, taking 1 leaves n=4 (W), and taking 4 leaves n=1 (W). So, the player can't force the opponent into L, so n=5 is L. That seems right.

Similarly, n=7: taking 1 leads to n=6 (W), taking 4 leads to n=3 (W). So, n=7 is L.

n=10: taking 1 leads to n=9 (W), taking 4 leads to n=6 (W). So, n=10 is L.

So, the pattern so far is:

n | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Result | L W L W W L W L W W L

So, the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10.

Hmm, let's see if this pattern continues. Let me compute a few more.

n=11: From n=11, can take 1 to n=10 (L) or 4 to n=7 (L). So, current player can take 1, leaving n=10 (L), so opponent is in L. So, current player can win. So, n=11 is W.

n=12: From n=12, take 1 to n=11 (W) or take 4 to n=8 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So, current player can't force a win. So, n=12 is L.

n=13: From n=13, take 1 to n=12 (L) or take 4 to n=9 (W). So, player can take 1, leaving n=12 (L). So, n=13 is W.

n=14: From n=14, take 1 to n=13 (W), take 4 to n=10 (L). So, player can take 4, leaving n=10 (L). So, n=14 is W.

n=15: From n=15, take 1 to n=14 (W), take 4 to n=11 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent. So, n=15 is L.

n=16: From n=16, take 1 to n=15 (L) or take 4 to n=12 (L). So, player can take either, leaving opponent in L. So, n=16 is W.

n=17: From n=17, take 1 to n=16 (W), take 4 to n=13 (W). So, both moves lead to W for opponent. So, n=17 is L.

n=18: From n=18, take 1 to n=17 (L), or take 4 to n=14 (W). So, player can take 1, leaving n=17 (L). So, n=18 is W.

n=19: From n=19, take 1 to n=18 (W), take 4 to n=15 (L). So, player can take 4, leaving n=15 (L). So, n=19 is W.

n=20: From n=20, take 1 to n=19 (W), take 4 to n=16 (W). So, both moves lead to W for opponent. So, n=20 is L.

Hmm, so from n=0 to n=20, the L positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.

Wait, let me list the L positions:

n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Looking at the differences between these numbers:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

10 to 12: +2

12 to 15: +3

15 to 17: +2

17 to 20: +3

So, the pattern alternates adding 2 and 3. So, 0, +2=2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20,...

So, the losing positions are numbers that can be expressed as 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc., following this pattern.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a periodic sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers of the form 5k + 0, 5k + 2, or something else.

Looking at the L positions up to n=20: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20.

Let me see, 5*0=0, 5*1=5, 5*2=10, 5*3=15, 5*4=20.

Hmm, and then in between, we have 2,7,12,17. Which are 5k-3? Let's see:

5*0 + 2 = 2

5*1 +2=7

5*2 +2=12

5*3 +2=17

Yes, that fits. So, the losing positions are n=5k and n=5k+2, where k is a non-negative integer.

Wait, 5k: 0,5,10,15,20,...

5k+2: 2,7,12,17,22,...

So, the L positions are n=5k and n=5k+2.

Wait, let me check n=22. Let's see if n=22 is a losing position.

n=22: Let's see, from n=22, can the player take 1 to n=21 or 4 to n=18.

n=21: Let's see, is n=21 a W or L? Hmm, from earlier, n=20 is L, so n=21 would be W because you can take 1 to leave n=20 (L). So, from n=22, taking 1 leaves n=21 (W), taking 4 leaves n=18 (W). So, both moves lead to W for the opponent, so n=22 is L, which fits 5*4 + 2=22.

Yes, that seems to hold.

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. So, n ≡ 0 mod 5 or n ≡ 2 mod 5.

Wait, but let me check n=5*0=0 (L), 5*1=5 (L), 5*2=10 (L), etc. And 5k+2: 2,7,12,17,22 (all L).

So, the L positions are when n mod 5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, wait, but n=5: yes, L.

n=7: 7 mod5=2, yes.

n=10:10 mod5=0, yes.

n=12:12 mod5=2, yes.

So, that seems correct.

So, in general, the losing positions are n where n ≡ 0 mod5 or n ≡2 mod5.

So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, which occurs when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, now, the problem is to count the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 mod5 and how many are congruent to 2 mod5.

First, numbers ≡0 mod5: these are multiples of 5. The maximum n is 2024. The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020, since 2020=5*404. So, there are 404 numbers (from 5*1=5 up to 5*404=2020).

Wait, but wait: n must be positive, so n starts at 1. So, n=5 is the first multiple of 5. So, numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. The count is (2020)/5=404 numbers.

Wait, but 5*1=5, 5*2=10, ..., 5*404=2020. So, 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: these are numbers of the form 5k+2, where k≥0.

The smallest positive number is 2 (k=0: 5*0+2=2), then 7 (k=1), 12(k=2), ..., up to the largest ≤2024.

What's the largest 5k+2 ≤2024?

We can write 5k+2 ≤2024 →5k ≤2022 →k ≤2022/5=404.4, so k=404.

So, 5*404 +2=2020 +2=2022.

So, the numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022. How many terms?

The first term is 2=5*0+2, the last term is 2022=5*404 +2.

So, the number of terms is 405 (from k=0 to k=404).

Wait, because when k=0, we get 2, which is the first term. So, the count is 404 +1=405 numbers.

Wait, let me confirm:

The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is (last term - first term)/common difference +1.

So, for the sequence 2,7,12,...,2022.

last term=2022, first term=2, common difference=5.

Number of terms = (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the total number of losing positions (n≡0 or 2 mod5) up to 2024 is the sum of the counts for each case.

But wait, let me confirm whether 2024 itself is included or not.

Wait, the problem says n ≤2024. So, the maximum n is 2024.

So, for n=2024: 2024 mod5 is 2024 ÷5=404*5=2020, remainder 4. So, 2024 mod5=4.

So, 2024 is not a losing position because 4 mod5 is neither 0 nor 2.

So, the last losing position in each case is 2020 for n≡0 mod5, and 2022 for n≡2 mod5.

So, the counts are:

n≡0 mod5: 404 numbers.

n≡2 mod5:405 numbers.

Wait, but wait, when k=404, 5k+2=2022, which is ≤2024, so that's included.

So, total losing positions ≤2024 is 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me check: is 2022 ≤2024? Yes, so that's included.

So, the total number of n's where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but let me double-check the counts.

For n≡0 mod5: from 5 to 2020, steps of 5.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.

For n≡2 mod5: from 2 to 2022, steps of5.

Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.

So, total is 404+405=809.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's take a small n and see.

Like, up to n=10.

n=10 is a losing position (0 mod5). So, numbers are 5,10: two numbers.

Wait, wait, from 5 to10: 5,10. So, 2 numbers. But according to the formula, up to 10: n≡0 mod5: 10/5=2, so 2 numbers.

n≡2 mod5: numbers 2,7: two numbers. So, total 4. Let me check the list:

n=0: L, but we're considering positive integers, so n starts at 1.

Wait, wait, in the problem statement, n is a positive integer, so n=1,2,3,...,2024.

So, for the count, n=0 is excluded. So, for n≡0 mod5, the numbers start at 5,10,... up to 2020. So, 404 numbers.

n≡2 mod5: numbers start at 2,7,12,... up to 2022. So, 405 numbers.

So, total 404+405=809.

But let me check with the initial list up to n=10.

In that case, n=5 and 10 are the 0 mod5 cases: two numbers.

n=2,7 are the 2 mod5 cases: two numbers.

Total 4 numbers, which aligns with the count above. So, 404+405=809.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that 2 is included in the 2 mod5 case. Yes, because n=2 is allowed, being a positive integer.

So, the final answer is 809. So, the number of positive integers n≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The key is to identify the losing positions, where the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**: Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \( n \) tokens. The player who removes the last token wins.

2. **Losing Positions**: A position \( n \) is losing if every possible move (removing 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - \( n = 0 \): Losing position (no moves possible).
   - \( n = 1 \): Winning position (take 1 token to win).
   - \( n = 2 \): Losing position (taking 1 token leaves \( n = 1 \), a winning position for the opponent).

4. **Pattern Identification**: By analyzing small values of \( n \), we observe that losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). This pattern continues as \( n \) increases.

5. **Counting Losing Positions**:
   - **For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)**: The numbers are \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \). There are \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \) such numbers.
   - **For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)**: The numbers are \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \). There are \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \) such numbers.

6. **Total Losing Positions**: Adding the counts, there are \( 404 + 405 = 809 \) losing positions for \( n \leq 2024 \).

### Conclusion:
The number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \( \boxed{809} \).
