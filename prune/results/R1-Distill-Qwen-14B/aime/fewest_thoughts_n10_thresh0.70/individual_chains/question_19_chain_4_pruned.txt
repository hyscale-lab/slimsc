Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's unpack this step by step.

First, some background. The circumradius (R) is 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius (r) is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter (O) is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter (I) is the center of the inscribed circle.

The key condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line segment from I to A is perpendicular to the segment from O to I.

I remember that in a triangle, the incenter and circumcenter have some interesting relationships, especially depending on the type of triangle. But here, the triangle isn't necessarily specified, so I can't assume it's equilateral or anything like that.

I need to find AB · AC. Let me think about what AB · AC represents. In a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to other properties, like area or other lengths. Maybe I can express AB and AC in terms of other known quantities.

Let me recall some formulas that might be helpful here. The area of a triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius as:

Area = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

And the area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius as:

Area = (a * b * c) / (4R),

where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.

So, maybe I can relate these two expressions for the area.

But before that, perhaps I should consider the given condition: IA ⊥ OI.

I think I can use coordinate geometry here. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify the problem. Let me try that.

Let me set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin (0, 0). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and if I is at (0, 0), then O must lie somewhere along the line perpendicular to IA at I. Wait, but IA is a line segment from I to A, so if IA is perpendicular to OI, then O must lie along the line that's perpendicular to IA at I.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates such that I is at (0, 0), and O lies along the y-axis, making IA perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe that's a good approach.

Wait, actually, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is the incenter, maybe we can model this in such a way that the line OI is along one axis, and IA is along the other.

Let me try to assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume that point I is at (0, 0). Since OI is a line from I to O, and IA is perpendicular to OI, then if I can set O along the y-axis, then IA must be along the x-axis.

Wait, is that correct? If OI is along the y-axis and IA is along the x-axis, then IA is perpendicular to OI. That makes sense.

So, let me assign coordinates:

- Let incenter I be at (0, 0).

- Let O be at (0, k) along the y-axis.

- Then point A must lie somewhere along the x-axis, because IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the y-axis.

Wait, no. IA is a line from I to A. If OI is along the y-axis, then IA must be along the x-axis to be perpendicular. So, point A must lie somewhere on the x-axis, let's say at (a, 0).

Similarly, points B and C will be somewhere else in the plane. But perhaps this setup can help us find relations between the sides.

Given that, let me note down:

- I is at (0, 0).

- O is at (0, k), where k is the distance between O and I.

But wait, the distance between O and I can be found using the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumradius.

I recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Where R is the circumradius, and r is the inradius.

So, plugging in the given values:

OI = sqrt(13(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13).

So, OI is sqrt(13), which is the distance between O and I. Since in our coordinate system, O is at (0, k), and I is at (0, 0), the distance OI is |k - 0| = |k|. So, k = sqrt(13). Therefore, O is at (0, sqrt(13)).

Wait, but in some triangles, O can be inside or outside the triangle. Since the inradius is 6 and the circumradius is 13, which is larger. In an acute triangle, the circumradius is outside, but wait, inradius is inside. Hmm, perhaps the triangle is acute. But maybe that's not so important right now.

So, now, point A is at (a, 0), since IA is along the x-axis.

Wait, but then IA is the segment from I(0,0) to A(a, 0). So, the length IA is |a|.

But in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. So, IA is not necessarily equal to the inradius.

Wait, that's
