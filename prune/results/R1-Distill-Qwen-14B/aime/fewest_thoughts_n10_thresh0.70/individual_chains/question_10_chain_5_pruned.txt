Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, Alice picks a set A. Then, for Bob, every finite nonempty set B he lists must have its maximum element in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create various sets B where a is the maximum.

Wait, so for a given a in A, how many such sets B can Bob create? Well, if a is the maximum, then all other elements in B must be less than a. So, the other elements are chosen from {1, 2, ..., a-1}. The number of possible non-empty subsets of these elements is 2^{a-1} - 1. Because each element can be either included or excluded, but we exclude the empty set.

But wait, no. Because each B must have a as the maximum, but B can be any non-empty set where the maximum is exactly a. So for each a, the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. Because even the set containing just {a} is allowed, which corresponds to the empty subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. 

Wait, right. So for each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is exactly 2^{a-1}. Because for each of the elements less than a, you can choose whether to include them or not, and since B has to be non-empty, but wait noâ€”because B is non-empty, but when you include a, the rest can be empty. So for each a, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let's test this with a small a. Let's say a=1. Then the only set B is {1}, so that's 1 set. According to the formula, 2^{0}=1, which is correct.

For a=2, the sets are {2}, {1,2}. That's 2 sets. According to the formula, 2^{1}=2, correct.

For a=3, the sets
