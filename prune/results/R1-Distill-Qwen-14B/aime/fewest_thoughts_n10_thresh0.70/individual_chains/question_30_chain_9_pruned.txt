Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But maybe that's more than I need right now.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can factor this or simplify it somehow. Maybe factor out something common. Let's see:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k. So each term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So the term is x² - 2x + 2 where x is a 13th root of unity, except for x=1 because ω ≠1.

Wait, but x can be ω^k where k=0 to 12, which includes x=1 when k=0. Wait, but the problem says ω ≠1, but the product is from k=0 to 12. So when k=0, ω^0 =1, so that term becomes 2 -2*1 +1² = 2 -2 +1 = 1. So that term is 1. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) where x=ω^k.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the product over all k=0 to 12, which would include the term at k=0, which is 1, so the product remains the same as the product from k=1 to 12. So maybe I can think of this as the product over all x where x is a 13th root of unity (including 1) of (x² - 2x + 2), then divide by the term at x=1, which is 1² - 2*1 +2 = 1 -2 +2=1. So it's the same as the product over all x (including x=1) of (x² -2x +2). Wait, but maybe I can use the fact that the product over all roots of a polynomial evaluated at a function can be connected to the polynomial's value.

Wait, more precisely, for a polynomial f(x), the product over all the roots α of f of (x - α) is f(x). But here, we have a product over roots of unity of a quadratic function, so maybe I can relate this to some cyclotomic polynomial.

Wait, but the product I'm considering is the product over all x where x^13=1 of (x² -2x +2). So that's the same as evaluating the product over x in the 13th roots of unity of (x² -2x +2). Now, how can I compute that?

I remember that the product of (x - a_k) over all roots a_k of a polynomial is equal to the polynomial evaluated at x. So perhaps if I consider the polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, and then for the 13th roots of unity, I can think of the product over all x such that x^13 =1 of f(x) as the product over x^13=1 of (x² - 2x + 2). 

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this product to the resultant or something else. Wait, another approach: since x^13 =1, perhaps we can compute f(x) modulo x^13 -1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, more systematically: Let's consider the product P = product_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k. So each term is f(ω^k), where f(x) = x² -2x +2. So the product P is the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. 

But the product over all k of f(ω^k) can be related to the value of the resultant of f(x) and the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x). Because Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for ω, and it's equal to (x^13 -1)/(x-1) = x^12 +x^11 + ... +x +1.

Wait, but I think the product over all roots ω^k of Φ₁₃(x) of f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and Φ₁₃(x). Or perhaps it's the product of f evaluated at each root of Φ₁₃(x). So more precisely, if f(x) is a polynomial, then product_{ω} f(ω) where ω runs over the roots of Φ₁₃(x), is equal
