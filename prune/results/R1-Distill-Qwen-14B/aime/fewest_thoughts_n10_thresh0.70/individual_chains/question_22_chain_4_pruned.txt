Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions. But wait, a regular hexagon has all sides equal and angles equal, but here it's just equilateral, so angles might not be equal. But opposite sides are parallel, which is a key point.

Let me recall that in such hexagons, each pair of opposite sides is both equal in length and parallel. Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Now, the problem mentions that when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. Interesting. So, this triangle is external to the hexagon, formed by these three sides.

I think this triangle is called the "external triangle" of the hexagon. Maybe similar concepts exist in geometry where extending sides of a polygon leads to another figure. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are of the same length, which I'll denote as 's'. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA is equal to 's'.

Now, given that opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides. So, if AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA.

Wait, no. Wait, let me get this straight. The problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. That makes sense.

So, if I imagine the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, the hexagon could be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure, but since it's convex and equilateral, it's a bit more structured.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. So, these sides are the extensions beyond the hexagon. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Imagine the hexagon with sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Extending AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these lines meet to form a triangle. So, the triangle's sides are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

Alternatively, maybe the extensions of AB, CD, and EF meet each
