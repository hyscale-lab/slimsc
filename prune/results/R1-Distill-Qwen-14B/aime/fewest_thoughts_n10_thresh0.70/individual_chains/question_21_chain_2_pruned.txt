Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me try to break down the problem. 

In base b, a two-digit number would be represented as something like "ab" where a is the first digit (the 'tens' place in base 10) and b is the second digit (the 'units' place). But wait, actually, in base b, each digit must be less than b. So the first digit a can be from 1 to b-1, and the second digit can be from 0 to b-1. 

So, the value of the two-digit number in base b is equal to a*b + c, where a is the first digit and c is the second digit. Therefore, n = a*b + c. 

The problem states that the sum of the digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. 

Putting this together, we have two equations:
1. n = a*b + c
2. sqrt(n) = a + c

Let me square both sides of the second equation to eliminate the square root. That gives:
n = (a + c)^2

So now, substituting the first equation into this, we have:
a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of a and c. Let me rearrange this to make it clearer:
(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Expanding the left side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange the terms differently. Let's bring all terms to one side:
a^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0

This looks like a quadratic in a. So, for given values of a and c, we can perhaps find possible bases b. But wait, actually, a and c are digits in base b, so a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

But perhaps I can express this equation in terms of b. Let me try that.

From the equation:
a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me solve for b:
a*b = (a + c)^2 - c
b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

Simplify the numerator:
(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So, b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a

I can split this into separate terms:
b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer as well. Let's denote that term as k:
(c^2 - c)/a = k, where k is an integer.

So, a must be a divisor of (c^2 - c). Let's write this as:
a | (c^2 - c) => a divides c(c - 1)

So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). Since a and c are digits in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

But since a is a positive integer, let's note that c(c - 1) can be zero or positive because c is at least 0. Wait, c can be 0, so c(c - 1) would be 0 when c=0 or c=1. So, if c is 0 or 1, then (c^2 - c) is zero, so (c^2 - c)/a is zero, meaning that k is zero. Thus, for c=0 or c=1, b becomes:

b = a + 2c + 0 = a + 2c

Since a is between 1 and b-1, and c is 0 or 1.

But let's think about the constraints here. For each base b, we can have different a and c values, as long as a is a divisor of c(c-1). So maybe I can consider different cases based on c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of c and a, and then find possible b's.

Wait, let me try to approach this differently. Since n = (a + c)^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b (which is 10_b) and b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). So, n must satisfy:

b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1

But n is also equal to (a + c)^2, so:

b ≤ (a + c)^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Taking square roots:

sqrt(b) ≤ a + c ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1) ≈ b - ε, where ε is a small positive number.

But since a and c are digits, a is at least 1, and c is at least 0, so a + c is at least 1. So, sqrt(b) must be less than or equal to a + c, which is at least 1.

But for a + c to be an integer, sqrt(b) must be less than or equal to a + c, which is also an integer. So, (a + c) must be an integer between 1 and approximately b.

Wait, but given that n = (a + c)^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 - 1, so:

b ≤ (a + c)^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Let me take square roots:

sqrt(b) ≤ a + c ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b, so a + c must be less than b. So, a + c is in [sqrt(b), b).

But a + c is an integer, so sqrt(b) must be less than or equal to a + c < b.

This gives us a range for a + c: from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

But since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, a + c is at least 1, but the lower bound is actually sqrt(b), so unless sqrt(b) is less than or equal to 1, which only happens when b ≤ 1, which it's not because b ≥ 2. So, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(b)).

Wait, no. Because a + c must be at least 1, but since sqrt(b) is at least sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so a + c must be at least 2 for b ≥ 2.

Wait, for b=2, sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so a + c must be at least 2, since it's an integer.

Hmm, perhaps we can model this as follows: for each possible base b, find all pairs (a, c) where a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, such that (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Wait, but for each b, how many such pairs exist? The problem wants the least b where the number of such pairs is more than ten.

So, perhaps I can model the equation and find, for each b, how many solutions (a, c) exist, then find the smallest b with more than ten solutions.

So let's get back to the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange terms:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Which is:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can group terms differently.

Let me try to solve for c in terms of a and b. Let's treat this as a quadratic equation in c.

So, c^2 + (2a - 1)c + (a^2 - a*b) = 0

This is a quadratic in c: c² + (2a -1)c + (a² - a b) = 0

We can solve for c using the quadratic formula:

c = [-(2a - 1) ± sqrt((2a -1)^2 - 4*1*(a² - a b))]/(2)

Simplify the discriminant:

D = (2a - 1)^2 - 4(a² - a b)
= 4a² -4a +1 -4a² +4ab
= (-4a +1) +4ab
= 4ab -4a +1
=4a(b -1) +1

So, D = 4a(b -1) +1

For c to be an integer, D must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k², where k is a positive integer.

So,

4a(b -1) +1 = k²

Or,

k² = 4a(b -1) +1

This equation must hold for some integer k. Let's rearrange this:

k² -1 =4a(b -1)

So,

(k -1)(k +1) =4a(b -1)

Since (k -1) and (k +1) are two even numbers (since k is either even or odd, their product is even). Wait, if k is odd, then k-1 and k+1 are both even, so their product is divisible by 4. If k is even, then k-1 and k+1 are both odd, so their product is odd, which would conflict with the right-hand side, which is 4a(b-1), hence divisible by 4. So, k must be odd. Because if k is even, the left side would be (even -1)(even +1) = odd * odd, which is odd, but
