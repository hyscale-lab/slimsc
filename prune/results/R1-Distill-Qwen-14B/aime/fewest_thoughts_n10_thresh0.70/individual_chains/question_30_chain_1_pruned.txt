Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me try to understand what this means. First, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because ω ≠ 1 and ω^13 = 1. So, ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity.

The product is over all these roots, but each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, for each root ω^k, we compute this expression and multiply them all together. Then, take that product modulo 1000.

I remember that when dealing with roots of unity, especially in products, cyclotomic polynomials might come into play. Or maybe some clever factoring or recognizing patterns.

Let me write down the product:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm. Let me see if I can factor or simplify each term. The term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write this as something squared or something else.

Wait, let's try to see if this can be expressed in terms of ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, 2 - 2x + x². Hmm, is that a quadratic in x?

Let me rearrange it: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's x² - 2x + 2. Can this be factored? Let's check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, roots are complex. So, it's irreducible over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers, we can factor it.

Wait, but maybe I can relate this quadratic to another expression. Let's see, x² - 2x + 2 can be written as (x - 1)^2 + 1. So, yeah, (x - 1)^2 + 1 = x² - 2x + 2. So, each term is (x - 1)^2 + 1, which is the same as (ω^k - 1)^2 + 1.

Not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product as evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Since ω^k are roots of x^13 - 1 =0, except for x=1.

Wait, maybe if I consider the polynomial f(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a generating function or relate this product to another polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite each term in the product as something else. Let me try to factor 2 - 2x + x².

Wait, x² - 2x + 2. Let me see if that can be written as (x - a)(x - b). But since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex. So, maybe it's (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Let me check: (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) = x² - 2x + (1 + 1) = x² - 2x + 2. Yes, exactly. So, each term factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, each term is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), where x = ω^k.

So, the product P is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

But wait, since each term is a product of two factors, the entire product is equal to ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, P = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

But now, these products are products over all 13th roots of unity of (ω^k - a), where a is (1 + i) and (1 - i). I remember that the product over all roots of unity of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1, because the roots are ω^0, ω^1,...,ω^12.

Wait, but more precisely, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. So, if I plug in x = (1 + i), then ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 + i) - ω^k) = (1 + i)^13 - 1.

Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} ((1 - i) - ω^k) = (1 - i)^13 - 1
