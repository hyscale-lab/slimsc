Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, since \( |z| = 4 \), \( \overline{z} = \frac{16}{z} \) because \( z\overline{z} = |z|^2 = 16 \). That might come in handy later.

The expression given is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\). I need to find the maximum real part of this. Let me denote this expression as \( E \), so:

\( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \)

Since \( z \) is on the circle of radius 4, I can parameterize it as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi) \). Let me substitute this into the expression.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i)z \):

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Let me compute the magnitude of \( 75 + 117i \) to make things easier. The magnitude is \( \sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \). Let's calculate that:

\( 75^2 = 5625 \)

\( 117^2 = 13689 \)

Adding them gives \( 5625 + 13689 = 19314 \). So the magnitude is \( \sqrt{19314} \). Hmm, what's that approximately? Well, 139^2 is 19321, which is just a bit more than 19314, so sqrt(19314) is approximately 139. Hmm, but maybe exact value is better for later steps. Alternatively, perhaps factor 75 and 117 to see if there's a common factor.

Wait, 75 = 15*5, 117 = 13*9. So 75 and 117 have a common factor of 3? Let's check:

75 รท 3 = 25, 117 รท 3 = 39. So, 75 + 117i = 3*(25 + 39i). So, the magnitude squared is 25^2 + 39^2 = 625 + 1521 = 2146. So the magnitude is sqrt(2146). Hmm, that's maybe not so helpful. Maybe I can write \(75 + 117i = k \cdot e^{i\phi}\), where \(k\) is the magnitude and \( \phi \) is the argument.

Similarly, for the second term \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \), since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So,

\( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 24(4 + 6i)e^{-i\theta} \)

Wait, 96 รท 4 = 24, 144 รท 4 = 36. So, 96 + 144i = 24*(4 + 6i). Wait, 4 and 6 have a common factor of 2, so 4 + 6i = 2*(2 + 3i). So, 96 + 144i = 24*2*(2 + 3i) = 48*(2 + 3i). Or perhaps better to compute the magnitude of 96 + 144i.

Compute the magnitude: sqrt(96^2 + 144^2). Let me compute 96^2: 9216, 144^2: 20736. Sum is 9216 + 20736 = 300, let me see: 9216 + 20736 is 30000? Wait, 9216 + 20736:

9216 + 20000 = 29216, then subtract 736 to get 20736: Wait
