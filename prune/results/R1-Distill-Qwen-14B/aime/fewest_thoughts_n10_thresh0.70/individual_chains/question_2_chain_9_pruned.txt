Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway from O to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, and the length PQ is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q are in the positive axes.

So, for any such segment PQ, we can represent it parametrically. Let me think. If P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), then the length PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1. So all such PQ segments are from points (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1, with p and q positive because it's the first quadrant.

So the family F is all such segments PQ where p and q are positive and satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Now, we have the line segment AB. Let's figure out the coordinates of A and B again. A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is the line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

The problem says there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB and isn't on any other PQ in F besides AB.

Wait, so for every point C on AB (except A and B), we want to check if it's on any other PQ in F. But the problem states that there's exactly one such C that isn't on any other PQ besides AB. So, we have to find that point.

The question then asks for OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Once we find OC², it's equal to p/q, and we have to find p + q where p and q are coprime.

So, how to approach this?

I think the key is to find the point C on AB that is the intersection point of AB with exactly one segment from F, which is AB itself. So, for other segments PQ in F, point C should not lie on any of them.

Wait, but all segments in F are from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q). So, if we can parameterize all possible PQs and find when they intersect AB, and then find a point C that is only on AB and no other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ besides AB. So, if we can find the envelope of all these PQ segments, then C would
