Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what Bob is doing. He's listing all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is an element of A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can include any number of smaller positive integers in the set B, as long as the maximum is a.

Wait, so each set B is finite and nonempty. For a particular a in A, the number of possible B's with max element a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because B must include a, and can include any combination of the smaller numbers. But since B has to be nonempty, including a alone is allowed, but other combinations too.

But wait, no. The set B can consist of a alone, or a along with some subset of the numbers less than a. So, for each a, the number of possible B's with max a is 2^{a-1}, because there are a-1 numbers less than a, and each can be either included or excluded. So, for each a in A, there are 2^{a-1} possible sets B where the maximum is a.

Therefore, the total number of such sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. So, total sets = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

Bob's list has 2024 sets, so sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, the problem reduces to finding the set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024, and then finding the sum of elements in A.

Wait, but A is a set of positive integers, so each element is unique. So, the sum is 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... = 2024, where a1, a2, ... are distinct positive integers.

I need to find such a set A where the
