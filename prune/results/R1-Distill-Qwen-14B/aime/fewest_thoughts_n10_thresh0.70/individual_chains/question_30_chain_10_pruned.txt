Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But how does that help me here?

The product given is over k from 0 to 12, which is all the 13th roots of unity. That might be useful because when you multiply terms involving roots of unity, sometimes cyclotomic polynomials come into play. But the expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated.

Let me see if I can factor this expression or relate it to something I know. Let's look at ω^{2k}. Since ω^13 = 1, ω^{2k} is also a root of unity, specifically a 13th root because 2 and 13 are coprime (since 13 is prime). So ω^{2k} is another primitive 13th root of unity. That might not help directly, but perhaps there's a symmetry or pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the expression inside the product. Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². Let me see if this quadratic can be factored or related to something else. So 2 - 2z + z². Hmm, let's rearrange it: z² - 2z + 2. That's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it, but I don't think it factors over integers. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a cyclotomic polynomial or minimal polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product over all z = ω^k of (z² - 2z + 2). Wait, but each term is 2 - 2z + z², which is the same as z² - 2z + 2. So the product is the same as the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each z being a 13th root of unity, except z=1 because ω ≠ 1, but actually, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so z=1 is included. Wait, the product includes k=0 to 12, so z=1 is included.

But wait, if I include k=0, then z=1, and the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 +
