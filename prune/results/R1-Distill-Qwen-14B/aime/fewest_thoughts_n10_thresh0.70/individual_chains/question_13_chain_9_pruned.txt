Okay, so I have this problem where Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given based on her walking speed, and I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Let me start by understanding the problem. Aya's walk is 9 kilometers each time. When she walks at a speed of s km/h, the total time taken is 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent at the coffee shop. Similarly, when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the walking time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes at the coffee shop.

Wait, but the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. So that 4 hours includes both the walking time and the coffee break. Similarly, the 2 hours and 24 minutes includes walking and the same t minutes. So I think the key here is to separate the walking time from the total time to find s and t.

Let me define variables properly.

Letâ€™s denote:
- d = 9 km (distance of the walk)
- s = walking speed in km/h
- t = coffee shop time in hours (since the time is given in hours for the total duration, I think it's better to convert everything into hours to keep the units consistent)

Wait, but the problem says t is in minutes. Hmm, maybe I should convert t into hours when I set up the equations.

Alternatively, I can set up the equations in hours and minutes. Let me think.

Let me try this approach: for each scenario, the total time is the walking time plus the coffee time, which is t minutes. So for the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes. Similarly, the second scenario has a total time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, right? Wait, no, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours? Wait, actually, 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

Wait, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/
