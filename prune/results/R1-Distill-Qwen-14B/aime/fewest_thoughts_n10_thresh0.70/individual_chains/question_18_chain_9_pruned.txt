Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, there are a lot of diagonals and sides, so the number of possible rectangles could be quite large. 

First, I need to understand the structure of a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles are equal. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. In a regular dodecagon, the number of diagonals is given by the formula n(n-3)/2, where n is the number of sides. So for 12 sides, that would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. So in total, along with the 12 sides, there are 66 lines (sides + diagonals). But not all of these are of the same length.

Wait, the problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal. So, the sides of the rectangle can be either sides of the dodecagon or diagonals. But for a rectangle to be formed, the sides must be parallel. So, in the dodecagon, for each pair of parallel sides, we need to find another pair of parallel sides that are perpendicular to them, forming the opposite sides of the rectangle.

I think the key here is to realize that a regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle. So, all the vertices lie on a circle, and the sides and diagonals correspond to chords of that circle. The lengths of these chords depend on the number of sides they skip. For example, a side skips 0 vertices, a diagonal that connects to the next-next vertex skips 1 vertex, and so on. Wait, actually, in a polygon, a side is between two adjacent vertices, which skips 0 vertices. A diagonal that connects a vertex to another two steps away skips 1 vertex, etc.

In a regular dodecagon, the length of a chord (
