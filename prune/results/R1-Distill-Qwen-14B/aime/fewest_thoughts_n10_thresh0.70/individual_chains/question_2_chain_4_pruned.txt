Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

First, the problem mentions points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher than 1/2, since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. 

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, P is somewhere along the x-axis, Q is somewhere along the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both P and Q have positive coordinates.

So, for each such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q) with p and q positive, and the distance between them is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1. 

The family F consists of all such segments PQ, each of which is a unit length in the first quadrant with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. 

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. 

Distance between A and B: sqrt( (1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Okay, so AB is indeed a member of family F. 

So, AB is one of these PQ segments, and C is a point on AB that's not on any other PQ from F. So, C is unique in that way. We need to find OC^2, where O is the origin, and then express it as a fraction p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, how do I approach this?

I think the key is to parameterize the segments PQ and find their equations, then find where they intersect AB, and determine the point C that isn't on any other PQ except AB.

First, let me find the equation of AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any other segment PQ in F has endpoints P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of PQ can be found using the two-point form. Let me derive that.

The equation of PQ: It goes from (p, 0) to (0, q). So, the slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q. 

So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Now, we need to find points C on AB that lie on other segments PQ. So, C is on AB and on PQ, but not equal to A or B. So, we need to find points of intersection between AB and PQ, and find which point C is only on AB and none of the other PQs.

But wait, the problem states that there is a unique such point C on AB. So, perhaps this point is where all the PQs are tangent to AB or something? No, because they are lines of unit length, so maybe it's the point where the envelope of these PQs touches AB.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider all possible PQs and find their envelope, then find where AB intersects this envelope. The point C would be that intersection point, as it's the only point on AB that's also on the envelope, meaning it's the only point on AB that's on any PQ, but since it's on AB, and AB is a PQ, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all PQs.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me parameterize AB. Since AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write its parametric equations. Let me let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at A, and t=1 is at B. So, the parametric equations would be:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be expressed as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), where t is between 0 and 1.

Now, C lies on some PQ from F, which has equation y = (-q/p)x + q, with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, substituting the coordinates of C into the equation of PQ:

(sqrt(3) t)/2 = (-q/p)*( (1 - t)/2 ) + q

Let me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(3) t = (-q/p)(1 - t) + 2q

But p^2 + q^2 = 1, so perhaps I can express p in terms of q or vice versa.

Let me denote p = sqrt(1 - q^2). But wait, p and q are both positive since they're in the first quadrant.

Alternatively, let me solve for p in terms of q: p = sqrt(1 - q^2).

So, substituting p into the equation:

sqrt(3) t = (-q / sqrt(1 - q^2)) (1 - t) + 2q

Hmm. So, this seems complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me move all terms to one side:

sqrt(3) t - 2q = (-q (1 - t))/sqrt(1 - q^2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - q^2):

[sqrt(3) t - 2
