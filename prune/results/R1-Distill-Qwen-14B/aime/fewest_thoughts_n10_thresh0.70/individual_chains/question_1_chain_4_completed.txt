Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me write that:

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

Now, this relates the product of x, y, z. Maybe I can use this with the earlier equations.

Looking back at equation (1a): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). Let me express x in terms of y and z: x = y z 2^(1/2). Similarly, equation (2a): y = x z 2^(1/3). Equation (3a): z = x y 2^(1/4).

Alternatively, maybe express each variable as a multiple of the product of the other two, and then substitute.

Alternatively, let me take equation (1a): x = y z * 2^(1/2). Let me plug this into equation (2a): y = (x z) * 2^(1/3). But x is y z 2^(1/2), so substituting:

y = (y z * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3)

Simplify:

y = y * z * 2^(1/2) * z * 2^(1/3)

= y * z² * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)

Compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6.

So y = y * z² * 2^(5/6)

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so not zero):

1 = z² * 2^(5/6)

So z² = 2^(-5/6)

Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12) because square root is exponent 1/2.

So z = 2^(-5/12)  ...(5)

Similarly, now that I have z, I can find y and x.

Wait, let me think. Maybe I can find x and y using z.

From equation (1a): x = y z * 2^(1/2). Since z is found, maybe express x in terms of y.

But perhaps it's better to use equation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12). Since I know z, I can express x y as 2^(-13/12) / z.

Compute z: z = 2^(-5/12), so 1/z = 2^(5/12). So x y = 2^(-13/12) * 2^(5/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So x y = 2^(-2/3)  ...(6)

Similarly, from equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me plug z into this.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(1/3) = 2^(4/12), and 2^(-5/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12)  ...(7)

Now, from equation (6): x y = 2^(-2/3)

Substituting y from equation (7):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) ) = 2^(-2/3)

So x² * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x² = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x² = 2^(-7/12)

Therefore, x = 2^(-7/24) since square root is exponent 1/2.

Wait, wait. Let me think. 2^(-7/12) is x squared, so x is 2^(-7/24) because (-7/12)*(1/2) = -7/24.

Wait, but wait. 2^(-7/12) is x², so x is sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Correct.

So x = 2^(-7/24)  ...(8)

Now, from equation (7): y = x * 2^(-1/12)

Substituting x from (8):

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8)  ...(9)

So now, I have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Hmm, let me check if these satisfy equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Compute x y: 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-7/24 - 9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply by 2^(1/4): 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(-8/12 + 3/12) = 2^(-5/12), which is z. So yes, that works. Good.

Now, the next step is to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Since all the exponents in x, y, z are negative, but when we raise them to exponents, their signs will change, so the log is of a positive number, and the absolute value is just the positive value.

First, let's compute x⁴ y³ z².

Expressed in exponents of 2:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))⁴ = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-3/8))³ = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-5/12))² = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Combine the exponents:

Sum = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Compute each term in 24 as denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So m = 25, n = 8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me just double-check all steps because I don't want to make an error in calculation.

Let me recheck the exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24)

x⁴: (-7/24)*4 = -7/6

y = 2^(-3/8)

y³: (-3/8)*3 = -9/8

z = 2^(-5/12)

z²: (-5/12)*2 = -5/6

So exponents sum: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Convert to common denominator 24.

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Correct.

So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So yes, m + n is 33.


To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\), so \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), so \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), so \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Next, we multiply all three equations together:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{(xyz)^2}
\]

The right side simplifies to:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{(xyz)^2} = 2^{13/12} \implies (xyz)^2 = 2^{-13/12} \implies xyz = 2^{-13/24}
\]

Using this result, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2. After solving the system, we find:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

We then compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Combining these:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

The absolute value is:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
