Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, what does it mean for a number n to be b-eautiful? It says that when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, n has to be a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits (in base b) must be sqrt(n).

Let me break this down. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can be from 0 to b-1. So, n = a*b + c, and the sum of the digits is a + c. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n).

So, substituting n, we have a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding the left side, we get a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c.

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms. So, a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express b in terms of a and c. Let's see.

Looking at the equation: a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c. I can solve for b:

a*b + c = a² + 2ac + c²
=> a*b = a² + 2ac + c² - c
=> b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c)/a

Simplify that:

b = a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

Since b has to be an integer, (c² - c) must be divisible by a. So, a divides (c² - c). That's an important point.

Also, since a and c are digits in base b, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c is between 0 and b-1.

But since a and c are digits in base b, and n is a two-digit number in base b, we have n = a*b + c, and a >=1, c >=0, a <= b-1, c <= b-1.

Given that, let me think about how I can approach this systematically. Perhaps I can iterate over possible values of a and c and find possible b's, then for each b, count the number of such pairs (a, c) that satisfy the conditions, and then find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as for each b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me try to express this equation in terms of a and c:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Simplify numerator:

= [a² + 2ac + c² - c] / a

= a + 2c + (c² - c)/a

So, as before, (c² - c) must be divisible by a.

Which can be written as a divides (c² - c) = c(c - 1). So, a must be a divisor of c(c-1).

But since a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps for each c, I can find a's that divide c(c - 1). But maybe it's more manageable to fix a and c and find b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of possible a and c and compute b, then for each b, count how many such (a, c) pairs produce the same b. Then, the goal is to find the smallest b where the count is more than 10.

But since b can be large, I need a way to compute this without too much computation.

Let me think about the possible range for a and c:

Since c is a digit in base b, c < b. Also, a is a digit, so a < b.

But n = a*b + c must be a perfect square, because sqrt(n) = a + c, which is an integer.

So, n must be a perfect square, let's say k^2, where k = a + c. So, n = k² = a*b + c.

Thus, for each k, we can express b as:

b = (k² - c)/a

But since a and c are digits, with a >=1, c >=0, and a < b, c < b.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think for each k, and then find a and c such that k = a + c, and b = (k² - c)/a is an integer, and a and c satisfy the digit conditions.

But k must be at least something. The minimal k is when a=1 and c=0, so k=1. But n =1* b +0 = b. So sqrt(n) =1, so b would have to be 1, but b >=2. So that's impossible. So perhaps the smallest k is when a=1, c=1, so k=2. Then n =1*b +1 = b +1, and sqrt(n)=2. So b+1=4, so b=3. Is that possible? Let me check.

Wait, let's think through an example. For example, the problem statement says 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see: 81 in base 13 is 6*13 + 3 = 81, and 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). So that's correct.

Another example: Let's see if 1
