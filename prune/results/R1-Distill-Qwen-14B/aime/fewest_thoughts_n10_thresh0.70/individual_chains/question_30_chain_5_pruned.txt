Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the remainder when the product ∏_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω ≠ 1. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling what roots of unity are. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. The roots are e^(2πik/13) for k from 0 to 12. Since ω ≠ 1, we're excluding the root at 1, but wait, in the product, k goes from 0 to 12, so when k=0, ω^0 is 1. So the first term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the product will include 1 as a factor when k=0, but the rest are for k=1 to 12.

Wait, maybe I should write that down. The product is over k=0 to 12, so each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). When k=0, this becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1, so the first term is 1. The rest, for k=1 to 12, are (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So the entire product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So that's the same as product_{k=1}^{12}(2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Now, I need to evaluate this product. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, maybe I can relate this product to some polynomial whose roots are these terms. The idea is that if I can find a polynomial that has roots at ω^k, then the product over (something involving ω^k) would be the product of the polynomial evaluated at those roots, which might relate to the constant term or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} in terms of ω^k. Let me see: Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, the product becomes product_{z≠1, z^13=1} (2 - 2z + z^2).

So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity except z=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, that seems manageable. 

Now, I know that for a polynomial P(z), the product of (z - a_k) over roots a_k is P(z). But in this case, I have a product over (z^2 - 2z + 2
