Okay, let's see. I have this problem where there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. They satisfy two logarithmic equations:

log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^n) = n*log_b(a), this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. But wait, log_x(y) is just the exponent I need to raise x to get y. Let me denote log_x(y) as k for a moment. So, log_x(y) = k means x^k = y. 

But substituting back into the equation, I have x * k = 10. So, x times log_x(y) equals 10. Hmm, but since y = x^k, maybe I can rewrite this in terms of x and k.

Wait, actually, let's go back. The original equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Alternatively, using the definition of logarithms, this means x^10 = y^x. So, x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, this means y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find x and y such that both equations are satisfied, with x and y greater than 1.

Hmm, maybe I can express both equations in terms of one variable. Since both equations relate x and y, perhaps I can substitute one into the other.

From the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Let's take the xth root of both sides, which gives y = x^{10/x}.

So, y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. Let me write that as y = x^{10/x}.

Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the second equation. The second equation is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Substituting y, we get (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}

Simplifying the left side: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}.

The right side is x^{4y} = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

So, the equation becomes x^{100/x} = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}

Since the bases are the same (base x), the exponents must be equal. So,

100/x = 4*(x^{10/x})

Hmm, okay, so now I have 100/x = 4*x^{10/x}.

Let me write that as 100/x = 4x^{10/x}

Divide both sides by 4:

25/x = x^{10/x}

Hmm, so 25/x equals x^{10/x}. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this easier to handle.

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x})

Simplify the right side using the logarithm power rule: ln(x^{10/x}) = (10/x)*ln(x)

So, ln(25/x) = (10/x) * ln(x
