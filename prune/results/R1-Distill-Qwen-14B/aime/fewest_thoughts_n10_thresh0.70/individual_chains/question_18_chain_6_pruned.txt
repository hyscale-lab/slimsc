Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a number of sides that's a multiple of 4, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, which is 3 times 4, I suspect that there might be a systematic way to count all possible rectangles.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle can be calculated, but maybe I don't need that right now. The key is that it's symmetric, so perhaps the number of rectangles can be found using combinatorial methods, considering the symmetry.

I remember that in a regular polygon, a rectangle is formed by selecting pairs of opposite sides. Wait, no, that's for a quadrilateral. Maybe I should think in terms of selecting vertices that are opposite each other in such a way that they form right angles. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, not just right angles. So maybe I need to find all sets of four points that form rectangles, meaning that the sides are either sides or diagonals, and the angles are 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, right angles aren't the only angles possible. So perhaps rectangles are formed when the sides are aligned in such a way that they form 90-degree angles. Maybe the key is to find all pairs of parallel sides that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, in a regular polygon, sides are all the same length, but diagonals can be of different lengths. So in a dodecagon, the diagonals can be of various lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, connecting adjacent vertices is a side, connecting every other vertex is a diagonal of a certain length, and so on.

So, perhaps to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of steps around the polygon. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick two vertices that are k steps
