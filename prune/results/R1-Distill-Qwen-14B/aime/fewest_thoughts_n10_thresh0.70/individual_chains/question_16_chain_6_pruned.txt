Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m that satisfies this condition.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that for primes p, certain properties hold regarding the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p. But here it's n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², which is a bit different because it's modulo p squared, and it's the fourth power.

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if for any of them, there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Starting with p=2.

Check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4.

Wait, -1 mod 4 is 3. So n⁴ mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod4=1
n=2: 16 mod4=0
n=3: 81 mod4=1
So possible residues are 0 or 1. So 3 is not achieved. Therefore, no solution for p=2.

Wait, but maybe p=2 is a special case because 2 is the only even prime. So perhaps I need to check higher primes.

Next prime is p=3.

So we need to check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

What is -1 mod 9? It's 8.

So compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1,2,...,8.

n=1:
