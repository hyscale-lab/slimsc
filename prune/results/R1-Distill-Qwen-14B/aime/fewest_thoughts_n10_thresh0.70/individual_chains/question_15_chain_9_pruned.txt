Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay. Let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction, which is C(16,8). But here, the problem is more specific: we need the number of paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction? Well, in a path made up of right and up moves, a direction change occurs when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, if you have a sequence like RRUURRUU, the direction changes occur at the points where you switch from R to U or U to R. Let me count: from R to U after the first two Rs, then U to R after the first two Us, then R to U again after the next two Rs, and then U to R again. So that's three direction changes. Hmm, but wait, the total number of direction changes would be one less than the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if there are k runs, then the number of direction changes is k-1. So, in the example above, there are four runs (RR, UU, RR, UU), so three direction changes.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means there are five runs in total. Each run is a consecutive sequence of either R or U. Now, the runs can start with R or U. So, for the entire path, the sequence of runs will alternate between R and U. Wait, but it can also start with either R or U.

So, first, I need to figure out how many runs there are. Since the number of direction changes is four, that means five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R or U. Now, these runs can be either R then U then R then U, etc., or U then R then U then R, etc., depending on whether the path starts with R or U.

So, let's think about the structure of such a path. Let's say the path starts with R. Then the runs alternate R, U, R, U, and so on. Since there are five runs, the starting run is R, the next is U, then R, then U, then R. Alternatively, if it starts with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U. Hmm, wait, but with five runs, whether starting with R or U, the
