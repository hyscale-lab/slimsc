Okay, I'm going to try to solve this geometry problem. Let's see... The problem is about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and we need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is given in a specific form, and we have to find m + n + p where the distance is m√n / p.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, it seems like the tetrahedron has opposite edges that are equal. That probably means it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, maybe called isohedral or something? I'm not sure, but maybe that symmetry can help simplify the problem.

The point I is the incenter, so it's the point inside the tetrahedron where the distances to all four faces are equal. In a tetrahedron, the incenter can be found as the intersection of the bisectors, but I don't remember the exact method. Maybe it's similar to the inradius in a triangle, but in 3D.

To find the distance from I to each face, I think I need to find the inradius of the tetrahedron. The formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). 

So, my plan is to compute the volume V and the total surface area S. Then, I can compute r = 3V / S.

But first, I need to find the areas of the four triangular faces and the volume of the tetrahedron.

Hmm, so all the faces are triangles with sides given. Wait, each face is a triangle with sides of the same lengths as the edges given. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC, which are √41, √89, and √80. Similarly, the other faces will have the same or similar edge lengths.

Wait, actually, since opposite edges are equal, each face is congruent to another face. Let me check:

- Face ABC: AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80
- Face ABD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89
- Face ACD: AC=√80, CD=√41, AD=√89
- Face BCD: BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That's a big help because it means each face has the same area.

Let me compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC, and then multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

To find the area of triangle ABC, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, for triangle ABC, the sides are √41, √80, √89.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Wait, that might be a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way, perhaps using coordinates? Alternatively, if all edges
