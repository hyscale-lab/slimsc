Okay, so I've got this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I need to find p + q.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, and z. The problem gives me the surface area and the volume, so I can write those down as equations.

The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. The volume (V) is xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's diameter will be equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r is half of that diagonal. The space diagonal (d) of a box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r = d/2, which means r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So my goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23. Once I find the minimal value of x² + y² + z², I can divide it by 4 to get r².

This looks like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that Lagrange multipliers can be used for such problems, where you can optimize a function subject to some constraints.

Let me set up the problem. I need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

So, I have two constraints here. Hmm, using Lagrange multipliers for multiple constraints might be a bit tricky, but I think it's manageable.

I recall that when you have multiple constraints, you can use a linear combination of the gradients. So, the gradients of f, g, and h should be linearly dependent. That is, there exist λ and μ such that:

∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h

So, let's compute the gradients.

First, ∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

Next, ∇g. The partial derivatives of g with respect to x, y, z:

dg/dx = 2(y + z)
dg/dy = 2(x + z)
dg/dz = 2(x + y)

So, ∇g = (2(y + z), 2(x + z), 2(x + y))

Now, ∇h. The partial derivatives:

dh/dx = yz
dh/dy = xz
dh/dz = xy

So, ∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

Putting it all together:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz   ...(1)
2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz   ...(2)
2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy   ...(3)

Hmm, that's a system of equations. Let me see if I can find some symmetry or relations between x, y, z.

Looking at equations (1), (2), and (3), they seem symmetric. Maybe the minimal case occurs when x = y = z? But wait, if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if a cube with surface area 54 and volume 23 exists.

For a cube, surface area is 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then the volume would be 3³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here. Therefore, x, y, z can't all be equal.

But maybe two of them are equal? Let's assume that two variables are equal, say x = y. Then, perhaps I can reduce the problem.

Let me assume x = y. Then, the equations might simplify.

So, x = y. Then, let's rewrite the constraints:

Surface area: 2(x² + xz + zx) = 54 => 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 => x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x * x * z = x² z = 23.

So, from the volume equation, z = 23/(x²). Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27.

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation. Let's try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So x=2 is a root.

Thus, I can factor the cubic as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Set each factor to zero: x=2, or x² + 2x -23=0.

Solving the quadratic: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me compute that: sqrt(6) is about 2.45, so 2*2.45=4.90, minus 1 is 3.90. So x≈3.90.

So, the roots are x=2 and x≈3.90. Let me check if these x satisfy the original equations.

First, take x=2.

Then, z=23/(x²) = 23/4 = 5.75.

So, dimensions are x=y=2, z=5.75.

Let me check the surface area: 2*(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2*(4 + 11.5 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

Now, take x≈3.90.

Compute z=23/(x²) ≈ 23/(15.21) ≈1.51.

Then, dimensions x=y≈3.90, z≈1.51.

Surface area: 2*(3.90² + 3.90*1.51 + 3.90*1.51). Let me compute 3.90²=15.21. 3.90*1.51≈5.89. So, 15.21 + 5.89 +5.89≈27. So, 2*27=54. Correct.

Volume: 3.90² *1.51≈15.21 *1.51≈23. Correct.

So both solutions are possible. But let's see which one gives a smaller x² + y² + z².

If x=2, then x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625.

If x≈3.90, then x² + y² + z²≈15.21 +15.21 + (1.51)^2≈30.42 + 2.28≈32.7.

Wait, 32.7 is less than 41.06, so the minimal might be the other case. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, actually, I assumed x = y, but maybe the minimal occurs when all three variables are different. So maybe assuming x = y isn't leading me to the minimal x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but perhaps not necessarily x = y.

Hmm, maybe I should not assume x = y, and instead try to solve the Lagrange multiplier equations.

So, going back to the three equations:

2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz   ...(1)
2y = λ * 2(x + z) + μ * xz   ...(2)
2z = λ * 2(x + y) + μ * xy   ...(3)

Let me subtract equation (1) and (2):

2x - 2y = λ [2(y + z) - 2(x + z)] + μ [yz - xz]

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ [2(y + z - x - z)] + μ z(y - x)

Which becomes:

2(x - y) = λ [2(y - x)] + μ z (y - x)

Factor out (y - x):

2(x - y) = (y - x)[2λ + μ z]

Factor out (x - y):

2(x - y) = -(x - y)[2λ + μ z]

So, if x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = - (2λ + μ z)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) and (3):

2y - 2z = λ [2(x + z) - 2(x + y)] + μ [xz - xy]

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ [2(z - y)] + μ x(z - y)

Factor out (y - z):

2(y - z) = -2λ (y - z) + μ x (y - z)

Factor (y - z):

2(y - z) = (y - z)[ -2λ + μ x ]

If y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = -2λ + μ x

Similarly, subtract equation (1) and (3):

2x - 2z = λ [2(y + z) - 2(x + y)] + μ [yz - xy]

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ [2(z - x)] + μ y(z - x)

Factor:

2(x - z) = -2λ (x - z) + μ y (z - x)

Factor out (x - z):

2(x - z) = -2λ (x - z) - μ y (x - z)

If x ≠ z, divide both sides:

2 = -2λ - μ y

So now we have three equations:

From (1)-(2): 2 = - (2λ + μ z) => 2λ + μ z = -2 ...(a)

From (2)-(3): 2 = -2λ + μ x ...(b)

From (1)-(3): 2 = -2λ - μ y ...(c)

Now, let's write these equations:

Equation (a): 2λ + μ z = -2

Equation (b): -2λ + μ x = 2

Equation (c): -2λ - μ y = 2

Let me try to solve for λ and μ.

From equation (b): -2λ + μ x = 2 => Let's express this as equation (b): μ x - 2λ = 2.

From equation (c): -2λ - μ y = 2 => Let's express this as equation (c): - μ y -2λ = 2.

So, if I subtract equation (c) from equation (b):

(μ x -2λ) - (-μ y -2λ) = 2 - 2

Simplify:

μ x -2λ + μ y + 2λ = 0

Which becomes μ (x + y) = 0.

So, either μ =0 or x + y =0.

But x, y, z are lengths, so they must be positive. Therefore, x + y ≠0. So, μ=0.

Wait, but if μ=0, then from equation (a): 2λ + 0 = -2 => λ = -1.

From equation (b): -2*(-1) + 0 = 2 => 2 = 2, which is true.

From equation (c): -2*(-1) -0 =2 => 2=2, also true.

So, it seems that μ=0 and λ=-1 is a solution. Interesting.

So, if μ=0 and λ=-1, let's see what that implies for the original equations.

Going back to equation (1): 2x = λ * 2(y + z) + μ * yz

Since λ=-1, μ=0:

2x = -2(y + z)

But that would mean 2x = -2y -2z => x = -y - z.

But x, y, z are positive, so x = -y -z would be negative, which is impossible. Contradiction.

Hmm, so that suggests that our assumption that x ≠ y and x ≠ z is wrong? Or perhaps that the solution where μ=0 is not acceptable, meaning that another solution exists where x = y or x = z or y = z.

Wait, but when we subtracted equations (1)-(2), we assumed x ≠ y to divide by (x - y). If x = y, then that step wouldn't be valid, and we might have different relations.

So, perhaps in the case where x = y, which we considered earlier, we can have a valid solution. Let me go back.

Earlier, assuming x = y, we found two possible solutions: x=2, z=5.75 and x≈3.90, z≈1.51.

But when x=2, substituting into the Lagrange equations, let's see if μ=0 is possible.

Wait, but in that case, when x=y=2 and z=5.75, let's check if the equations hold.

Compute ∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z) = (4,4,11.5)

∇g = (2(y+z), 2(x+z), 2(x+y)) = (2*(2+5.75), 2*(2+5.75), 2*(2+2)) = (2*7.75, 2*7.75, 8) = (15.5, 15.5, 8)

∇h = (yz, xz, xy) = (2*5.75, 2*5.75, 2*2) = (11.5, 11.5, 4)

So, ∇f = (4,4,11.5)

Is this equal to λ ∇g + μ ∇h?

Compute λ*15.5 + μ*11.5 for the first component:

4 = 15.5 λ + 11.5 μ

Similarly, second component:

4 =15.5 λ +11.5 μ

Third component:

11.5 =8 λ +4 μ

So, equations:

15.5 λ +11.5 μ =4 ...(i)

8 λ +4 μ=11.5 ...(ii)

Let me solve these.

Let me write equation (i) and (ii):

From (i): 15.5 λ +11.5 μ =4

From (ii): 8 λ +4 μ=11.5

Let me multiply equation (ii) by (11.5/4) to make the coefficients of μ equal.

Wait, alternatively, let me express μ from (ii):

From (ii): 4 μ = 11.5 -8 λ => μ = (11.5 -8 λ)/4

Substitute into (i):

15.5 λ +11.5*( (11.5 -8 λ)/4 ) =4

Multiply through:

15.5 λ + (11.5 *11.5 - 11.5 *8 λ)/4 =4

Compute 11.5*11.5: 11.5^2=132.25

11.5*8=92

So,

15.5 λ + (132.25 -92 λ)/4 =4

Multiply everything by 4 to eliminate denominator:

62 λ +132.25 -92 λ =16

Combine like terms:

(62 λ -92 λ) +132.25 =16

-30 λ =16 -132.25= -116.25

Thus, λ= (-116.25)/(-30)=116.25/30=3.875

Which is 3.875=3 7/8=31/8.

So, λ=31/8.

Then, μ= (11.5 -8*(31/8))/4.

Compute 8*(31/8)=31.

So, μ=(11.5 -31)/4 = (-19.5)/4= -4.875= -39/8.

So, λ=31/8, μ=-39/8.

So, yes, it works. So, the case where x=y=2, z=5.75 is a valid solution with λ=31/8 and μ=-39/8.

But earlier, when I assumed x≠y, I got a contradiction unless μ=0, which isn't acceptable. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y≠z, but in that case, the minimal is when x=y=2, z=5.75.

But wait, earlier when I assumed x=y, I found another solution with x≈3.90, which gave a smaller x² + y² + z². So, maybe that's the minimal case.

Alternatively, perhaps when x, y, z are all different, the x² + y² + z² is even smaller.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use some inequality to find the minimal x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

I know that for positive numbers, x² + y² + z² is minimized when x, y, z are as close as possible, given the constraints. But in this case, the constraints are fixed surface area and volume, so maybe there's a way to relate them.

Wait, another approach: Using the method of Lagrange multipliers,
