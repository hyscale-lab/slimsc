Alright, so I've got this problem here, and I really need to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two functions defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \)

And we're asked to find the number of intersections of the graphs of:
1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

Hmm, okay. So, the problem involves these two functions, one expressed in terms of x on the left and y on the right, and we need to find where they intersect. An intersection would mean a point (a, b) such that when x = a, y = b, and vice versa, satisfying both equations.

Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me try to understand what the functions f and g look like. Both are absolute value functions, which usually create V-shaped graphs, but with multiple layers here.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me consider the inner part first: |x|. That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. So that would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, it becomes ||x| - 1/2|.

So, for f(x), when is |x| - 1/2 positive or negative?

- When |x| >= 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2.
- When |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a V-shape that first decreases from x=0 to x=1/2, reaching a minimum of 0 at x=±1/2, then increases again beyond that.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Same approach: |x| is a V-shape, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value.

So, for g(x):

- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, g(x) is a V-shape that goes down from x=0 to x=±1/4, reaches 0 there, then goes up beyond that.

Now, let's see how f and g are used inside the equations.

First equation: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

Second equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, both y and x are expressed in terms of the same composite function, but with different arguments and different variables.

I think the key is to realize that since these are functions of sine and cosine, their outputs are bounded. So, let me think about the ranges.

Sin and cos functions both have outputs between -1 and 1. So, sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) both yield values in [-1,1].

But inside f and g, we're dealing with |x| and |x| - 1/2, etc., but since we're plugging sin and cos into f and g, which are functions of |x|, the innermost functions will be non-negative due to the absolute value.

Wait, no. Let me correct that: f and g are functions that take any real number, but since their arguments are sine and cosine, which are between -1 and 1, but the functions f and g are defined for all real numbers.

Wait, no. So, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, when x is in [-1, 1], |x| is in [0,1], so |x| - 1/2 is in [-1/2, 1/2]. Then, taking absolute value again, so f(x) becomes ||x| - 1/2|, which is in [0, 1/2].

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So, when x is in [-1,1], |x| is in [0,1], so |x| - 1/4 is in [-1/4, 3/4]. Taking absolute value, so g(x) is in [0, 3/4].

So, f(sin(2πx)) would be || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Since sin(2πx) is in [-1,1], |sin(2πx)| is in [0,1], so | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | is in [0, 1/2].

Then, g of that is || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Wait, let me write it step by step.

Let me define some intermediate functions to make this clear:

Let’s denote:
- a(x) = sin(2πx)
- Then, b(x) = |a(x)| = |sin(2πx)|
- c(x) = b(x) - 1/2
- Then, d(x) = |c(x)| = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | = f(a(x)) = f(sin(2πx))
- Then, e(x) = g(d(x)) = ||d(x)| - 1/4|, but since d(x) is already an absolute value, e(x) = |d(x) - 1/4| = | | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Similarly, for the second equation:
x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

Let’s denote for the second equation:

- a(y) = cos(3πy)
- b(y) = |a(y)| = |cos(3πy)|
- c(y) = b(y) - 1/2
- d(y) = |c(y)| = | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | = f(a(y)) = f(cos(3πy))
- e(y) = g(d(y)) = ||d(y)| - 1/4| = | | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

So, y = 4e(x), and x = 4e(y).

Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the first equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

So, as per the above, y = 4e(x), where e(x) is 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), which is x = 4e(y).

So, the equations are:

1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

I think to solve for the intersections, we can set up a system where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

But since both x and y are expressed in terms of each other, it's a system of equations that might not be straightforward to solve algebraically. So, perhaps we can consider the periodicity and symmetry of the functions involved.

First, let me think about the periodicity of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy).

The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, because sin(2π(x+1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx).

Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, because cos(3π(y + 2/3)) = cos(3πy + 2π) = cos(3πy).

But since we're dealing with both x and y, which are variables in the equations, perhaps it's better to analyze the functions over their respective periods.

However, since we have both sine and cosine, and the equations are intertwined, perhaps a better approach is to find all possible (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize and find the number of solutions by considering the possible values of x and y.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the functions are periodic, perhaps we can consider the number of intersections within a single period, and then extend that.

But let me think about the range of the functions.

First, for the first equation: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

From earlier, we have f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |, which is in [0, 1/2].

Then, g of that is || | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

But let’s compute the range of g(f(sin(2πx))).

f(sin(2πx)) is in [0, 1/2]. So, the argument to g is in [0, 1/2].

So, for g(z) where z ∈ [0, 1/2], we have:

g(z) = | |z| - 1/4 | = |z - 1/4|, since z is non-negative.

So, when z is in [0, 1/4], |z - 1/4| = 1/4 - z.

When z is in [1/4, 1/2], |z - 1/4| = z - 1/4.

So, g(z) ranges from 0 (at z=1/4) up to 1/4 (at z=0 and z=1/2).

Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Then, y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) ∈ [0, 1].

Similarly, for the second equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Same reasoning: cos(3πy) ∈ [-1,1], so |cos(3πy)| ∈ [0,1].

Then, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| ∈ [0,1/2].

Then, g of that is | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, which again is ∈ [0, 1/4].

So, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) ∈ [0,1].

So, both x and y are in [0,1].

Therefore, we can limit our consideration to x and y in [0,1].

Hmm, okay, so both x and y are in [0,1]. That's a helpful constraint.

Now, let me think about the structure of the functions.

Let me consider the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

Breaking it down, sin(2πx) will oscillate between -1 and 1 as x varies from 0 to 1. But since it's inside absolute value, |sin(2πx)| is a wave that goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1/2, and then repeats.

So, |sin(2πx)| is a "V" shape with peaks at x=1/4, 3/4, etc., but actually, it's a series of humps.

Wait, no. The function |sin(2πx)| is a sine wave that's reflected above the x-axis, so it has a peak at x=1/4, x=3/4, etc., with maxima at 1 and minima at 0.

So, for x in [0, 1/2], sin(2πx) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=1/4, then back to 0 at x=1/2.

Similarly, for x in [1/2, 1], it goes from 0 down to -1 at x=3/4
