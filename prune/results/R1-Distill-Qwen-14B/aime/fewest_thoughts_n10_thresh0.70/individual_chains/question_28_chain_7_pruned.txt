Alright, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. This point is called the incenter, right? It's like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle, where all the distances from the point to the faces are equal. 

First, let me make sure I understand the given edge lengths. The problem says AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). Hmm, interesting. So each pair of opposite edges are equal. That probably means the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron?

I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron (which is when all opposite edges are equal), the inradius can be found using a formula similar to the inradius of a triangle. But wait, in a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. I wonder if there's a 3D analog for that with tetrahedrons.

Yes! For a tetrahedron, the inradius (r) can be found by dividing the volume (V) by the surface area (A) divided by 3. Or wait, actually, more precisely, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Let me double-check that. Yeah, because in a tetrahedron, the volume can also be thought of as (1/3)*base_area*height, and if the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each face, then for each face, the volume is (1/3)*face_area*r. Summing over all four faces, 4*(1/3)*face_area*r, but since all face_areas are different, we need another approach. Wait, actually, the total volume is the sum of the volumes of the four smaller tetrahedrons formed by the inradius and each face. So, V = (1/3)*(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4)*r, where A1, A2, A3, A4 are the areas of the faces. So, rearranging, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4). Yeah, that makes sense. So I'll need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

Alright, so the plan is:
1. Find the areas of each face.
2. Calculate the total surface area.
3. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.
4. Use the formula r = 3V / A to find the inradius.
5. Express r in the required form and compute m + n + p.

Let me start by computing the areas of each face. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps all the faces are congruent? Wait,
