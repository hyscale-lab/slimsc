Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n (up to 2024) allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: take 1 or 4 tokens. The goal is to take the last token, so the player who can force the opponent into a position where any move they make leaves the player in a winning position will win.

This sounds like a classic combinatorial game, and often these can be analyzed using the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I think I should model this using dynamic programming, where I determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. Let's define two arrays, say, win and lose, where win[n] is true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and lose[n] is false otherwise.

But wait, since the players can take 1 or 4 tokens, the current player can move the game to n-1 or n-4 tokens. So, if from the current n, the player can move to a losing position for the opponent, then n is a winning position. Conversely, if all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then n is a losing position.

Let me try to work out the initial conditions. For n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So, if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens left, you can't make a move, so you lose. Therefore, n=0 is a losing position.

Wait, but in our problem, the players are removing tokens until none are left, with the last person to remove a token winning. So, if there are 0 tokens before your turn, you lose because you can't make a move. So, for n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

Similarly, for n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who would then take it and win. Alternatively, the current player could also take 4 tokens, but wait, n=2 can't take 4, so only taking 1 is possible. Hmm, no, wait, n=2: you can only take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 would be a losing position if the current player can't make a move that leads to the opponent's loss.

Wait, let me think again. Let me start building this step by step.

Let's list n from 0 upwards and decide if each is a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n=0: No tokens, so the current player loses. So L.

n=1: Can take
