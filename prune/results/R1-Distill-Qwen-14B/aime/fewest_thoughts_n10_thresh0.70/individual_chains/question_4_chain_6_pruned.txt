Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 will allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.

Hmm, let me think about how this game works. Since Alice goes first, Bob wants to be in a position where whatever Alice does, he can respond in a way that leads him to victory. So, I guess I need to find the losing positions for Alice, which would be the winning positions for Bob.

Maybe I should model this using some kind of game theory approach, like determining the winning and losing positions. Let's define a position as a "winning position" if the current player can force a win, and a "losing position" if the current player cannot avoid losing, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

So, for n=0, well, there are no tokens left, so the game is over. But since you can't make a move, the player who is supposed to move loses. Wait, but in our case, the players take turns removing tokens, and the one who takes the last token wins. So, if it's your turn and there are no tokens left, you lose. So, n=0 is a losing position.

Let me consider small n first and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So, Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, then Bob is left with 1 token, which he can take and win. That can't be right. Wait, wait. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. But 4 is more than 2, so she can only take 1. Then Bob is faced with n=1. He can take 1 and win. So, n=2 is a winning position for Bob? Wait, no, because Alice goes first. Wait, no, if Alice leaves Bob with n=1, Bob can take that and win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice
