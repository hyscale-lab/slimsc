Okay, so I have this problem here: there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to log base y of x^{4y}, and both of these are equal to 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down what I know. So, log_x(y^x) = 10 and log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both x and y are greater than 1, which is probably important because logarithms with bases less than or equal to 1 are undefined or not real.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula, or maybe by expressing them in terms of exponents. Let me start by converting these logarithmic equations into exponential form because that might make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. By definition of logarithms, this means that x raised to the 10th power equals y^x. So, x^10 = y^x. Let me write that as equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, this means y raised to the 10th power equals x^{4y}. So, y^10 = x^{4y}. Let me write that as equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find x and y. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of the same base or relate x and y through substitution.

Looking at equation (1): x^10 = y^x. Let me take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to bring down the exponents.

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)
Which simplifies to 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). Let me write that as equation (1a): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y).

Similarly, taking equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking ln of both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})
Which gives 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x). Let me write this as equation (2a): 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x).

Now, I have two equations:
1a. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)
2a. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)

Hmm, perhaps I can solve these two equations for ln(x) and ln(y). Let me denote a = ln(x) and b = ln(y). Then the equations become:

1a. 10 a = x b
2a. 10 b = 4y a

But wait, x and y are related to a and b because x = e^a and y = e^b. So, substituting x and y in terms of a and b.

So, equation 1a becomes:
10 a = (e^a) * b

Equation 2a becomes:
10 b = 4 (e^b) * a

Hmm, so now I have two equations in terms of a and b:

1. 10 a = e^a * b
2. 10 b = 4 e^b * a

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate these equations to find a relationship between a and b.

Let me try to solve for b in the first equation and substitute into the second. From equation 1:

b = (10 a) / e^a

Substituting this into equation 2:

10 * (10 a / e^a) = 4 e^b * a

Simplify the left side: 100 a / e^a = 4 e^b a

I can cancel a from both sides (assuming a â‰  0, which makes sense because x > 1 implies a = ln(x) > 0).

So, 100 / e^a = 4 e^b

Divide both sides by 4:

25 / e^a = e^b

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(25) - a = b

So, b = ln(25) - a

Now, remember that b = ln(y) and a = ln(x). So, ln(y) = ln(25) - ln(x)

Wait, that can be rewritten as ln(y) = ln(25 / x). Because ln(25) - ln(x) = ln(25/x). Therefore, y = 25 / x.

So, y is equal to 25 divided by x. That's a useful relationship.

So, y = 25 / x. Let me note that as equation (3): y = 25/x.

Now, let's substitute y into one of the earlier equations. Let's pick equation (1a): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)

Since y =25/x, ln(y) = ln(25) - ln(x). So, substitute that into equation (1a):

10 ln(x) = x [ ln(25) - ln(x) ]

Let me write that out:

10 ln(x) = x ln(25) - x ln(x)

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln(x) + x ln(x) - x ln(25) = 0

Factor out ln(x):

ln(x) [10 + x] - x ln(25) = 0

Hmm, let me rearrange it a bit:

ln(x) (10 + x) = x ln(25)

So, ln(x) = [x ln(25)] / (10 + x)

That's an equation in terms of x. Let me write that as equation (4): ln(x) = (x ln(25)) / (10 + x)

Hmm, this seems challenging. Maybe I can use substitution or look for a clever way to solve this. Alternatively, since the problem is asking for xy, which is x*(25/x) = 25. Wait, is that
