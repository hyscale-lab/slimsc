Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because having all four numbers chosen means at least two are chosen. So, A is a subset of B, which means that A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A ∩ B) is equal to P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Then, I'll divide them to get the required probability.

Let's compute P(A) first. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), right? And the number of ways to choose all four numbers that Jen picked is just 1, because she has a specific set. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, that can happen in three scenarios: exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen. So, we can compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case and sum them up.

Alternatively, since it's "at least two," we can compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two numbers chosen, which is 1 - (probability of exactly 0 or exactly 1 number chosen). Hmm, maybe that's a simpler approach.

Let me try that. So, P(B) = 1 - [C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4). Wait, let me verify.

Wait, the total number of ways is C(10,4). The number of ways where exactly k of Jen's numbers are chosen is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k), because we choose k numbers from her 4 and the remaining (4 - k) from the other 6 numbers.

So, for k = 0: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

For k = 1: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the number of ways where fewer than two numbers are chosen is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways where at least two are chosen is total ways minus these, which is 210 - 95 = 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me check again. 210 total, 95 bad, so 115 good. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, I could compute the number of ways for exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4, and add them up.

Let's try that method to verify.

Exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Same as before. So, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify that fraction. 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, 115 divided by 5 is 23. 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

So, now, P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210). The 210s cancel out, giving 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Wait a second, let me think again.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210. P(B) is 115/210. So, 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115. So, the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and 115 share no common divisors besides 1. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Let me recompute P(B). So, number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is 210. The number of ways where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen is 115. So, 115/210 reduces to 23/42.

And P(A) is 1/210. So, the conditional probability is (1/210) divided by (115/210) is 1/115. So, 1/115 is the probability.

Wait, but let me think about it differently. If she has 4 numbers, the probability that all four are chosen is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210. The probability that at least two are chosen is 115/210. So, given that at least two are chosen, the probability all four are chosen is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again: is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize 1/115? That seems low, but considering how rare the grand prize is compared to just winning a prize, it might make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing P(B). Let me check the calculation again. So, the number of ways where at least two of her numbers are chosen is 115. How did I get 115? Let me recompute the number of favorable for at least two.

Number of ways with exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4: 1.

Total: 90 +24 +1 = 115. So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(B) is 115/210, and P(A) is 1/210.

So, 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115. So, yes, the probability is 1/115.

So, m is 1, n is 115. They are coprime, so m + n is 116.

Wait, but let me think again: is the grand prize considered as a prize? Because if she wins the grand prize, she has automatically won a prize. So, yes, the events are nested, so the probability is as computed. So, I think my answer is correct.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( A \) is the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) is the event of winning a prize.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(A) \)
The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Since there is only one way for all four of her numbers to be chosen, we have:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(B) \)
Winning a prize means at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. We can calculate this by subtracting the probability of having fewer than two numbers chosen from 1:
\[
P(B) = 1 - \left( \frac{\binom{4}{0}\binom{6}{4} + \binom{4}{1}\binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} \right)
\]
Calculating the terms:
- \( \binom{4}{0}\binom{6}{4} = 1 \times 15 = 15 \)
- \( \binom{4}{1}\binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \)
- Total ways with fewer than two numbers: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \)

Thus:
\[
P(B) = \frac{210 - 95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Conditional Probability
Using the conditional probability formula:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify and Find \( m + n \)
The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
