Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, covering a total length of 16 units. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner typically requires moving only right and up. In an 8x8 grid, that means moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, the problem adds a twist: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction mean? In grid paths, changing direction would be switching from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each time the path switches from one direction to the other, that's a direction change. For example, if the path starts by moving right for a few steps, then switches to up, that's one change. Then, if it switches back to right, that's another change, and so on.

Let me think about how the number of direction changes relates to the number of segments in each direction. Each time the path changes direction, it's starting a new segment. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five segments. Because the first segment is the initial direction, and each change adds a new segment. So, four changes lead to five segments.

For instance, if a path goes right, up, right, up, right, that's four changes, resulting in five segments: right, up, right, up, right. Similarly, it could start with up, then right, and so on. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments.

Now, each segment is a straight line either to the right or upwards. Each segment must consist of at least one step. So, if the path has five segments, we need to distribute the total right steps and up steps among these segments.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, moving from the bottom left to the top right requires 8 right steps and 8 up steps. So, the total number of right steps is 8, and the same for up steps.

If the path has five segments, we have to partition the 8 right steps into some number of right segments and the 8 up steps into the remaining segments. Since the path alternates between right and up segments, the number of right segments and up segments must differ by at most one.

Wait, let me clarify. If the path starts with a right segment, then the segments alternate: right, up, right, up, etc. So, if there are five segments, they can be either right-up-right-up-right or up-right-up-right-up. So, the number of right segments and up segments depends on the starting direction.

If the path starts with right, then the number of right segments is three and the number of up segments is two. Or wait, no
