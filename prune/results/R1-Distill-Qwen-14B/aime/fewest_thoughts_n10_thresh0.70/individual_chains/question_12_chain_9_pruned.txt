Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right in each row, their sum is 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom in each column, their sum is 99. 

Let me start by visualizing the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a single digit. Let me denote the grid like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first row forms the number abc, which is a three-digit number. Similarly, the second row forms def. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. 

The columns, on the other hand, each form a two-digit number: ad, be, and cf. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Wait, hold on. The problem says the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom. Since each column is two digits, that makes three two-digit numbers. So, ad + be + cf = 99.

Alright, so I need to write equations based on these two conditions.

First, let's handle the row sums. The first row is a three-digit number, which is 100a + 10b + c. The second row is def, which is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum is 999, so:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

I can rearrange this equation as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, and S3 = c + f. So, the equation becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Now, since S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits, each can range from 0 (if both digits are 0) to 18 (if both are 9). But given that the total is 999, which is a three-digit number, I can analyze the possible values of S1, S2, S3.

Looking at 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999, it's clear that S1 must be 9 because 100*9 = 900, which is the highest part of 999. If S1 were 10 or more, 100*10=1000 which is already more than 999. So, S1 =9.

Then, 100*9 =900, so 999 - 900 = 99. So, 10*S2 + S3 = 99.

Now, 10*S2 + S3 = 99. Let me think about possible values for S2 and S3. Since both S2 and S3 are sums of two digits, they can each range from 0 to 18.

So, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

Let me find possible S2 and S3 pairs:

If S2 is 9, then 10*9=90, so S3=9.

If S2 is 8, then 80 + S3=99 → S3=19, but S3 can't be more than 18. So, that doesn't work.

Similarly, S2=10 would give 100, which is over 99, so no. So, the only possible solution is S2=9 and S3=9.

Wait, wait. Let me check if there are other possibilities. Let's see, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

We can write this as S3 =99 -10*S2.

Since S3 must be ≥0 and ≤18, let's see for which S2 this is possible.

Let me set up inequalities:

0 ≤ 99 -10*S2 ≤18.

So, 99 -10*S2 ≥0 → 10*S2 ≤99 → S2 ≤9.9. Since S2 is an integer, S2 ≤9.

And 99 -10*S2 ≤18 → 99 -18 ≤10*S2 → 81 ≤10*S2 → S2 ≥8.1. Since S2 is integer, S2 ≥9.

So, the only possible S2 is 9, which gives S3=99-90=9.

So, from the row condition, we have:

S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, a + d =9, b + e=9, c + f=9.

This is the first condition. Now, moving on to the column condition.

Each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, the third is 10c + f. The sum of these is 99.

So:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) =99.

Let's rearrange this:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

Hmm, let's denote T1 = a + b + c and T2 = d + e + f. So, 10*T1 + T2 =99.

Again, T1 and T2 are sums of digits, so T1 can range from 0 to 27 (each of a, b, c is 0-9), and T2 can range from 0 to 27.

So, 10*T1 + T2 =99.

Let me find possible T1 and T2. Let's solve for T2:

T2 =99 -10*T1.

Since T2 must be ≥0 and ≤27, let's find T1:

99 -10*T1 ≥0 → 10*T1 ≤99 → T1 ≤9.9. So, T1 ≤9.

Also, 99 -10*T1 ≤27 → 99-27 ≤10*T1 →72 ≤10*T1 → T1 ≥7.2. So, T1≥8.

So, T1 can be 8 or 9.

So, let's consider T1=8: T2=99-80=19.

But T2 is d + e + f, which is the sum of three digits. Each digit can be up to 9, so maximum T2 is 27. 19 is acceptable.

If T1=9: T2=99-90=9. That's also acceptable.

So, possible cases are:

Case 1: T1=8, T2=19.

Case 2: T1=9, T2=9.

So, we have two possibilities for the column condition.

Now, let's recap:

From row conditions:

a + d =9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

From column conditions:

Either:

Case 1:

a + b + c =8,

d + e + f=19.

OR

Case 2:

a + b + c=9,

d + e + f=9.

So, now, I need to find the number of possible grids (i.e., the number of possible assignments of a,b,c,d,e,f) that satisfy the row conditions and either case 1 or case 2.

Therefore, the total number of grids is the sum of the number of grids satisfying case 1 and case 2.

So, I'll compute the number of solutions for each case and add them together.

Let's tackle each case separately.

First, let's consider Case 1:

Case 1:

Row conditions:

a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

Column conditions:

a + b + c=8,

d + e + f=19.

We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations, remembering that each variable is a digit (0-9). Wait, but a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, meaning each can be from 0 to 9.

So, let's denote:

From row conditions:

d=9 - a,

e=9 - b,

f=9 - c.

Substituting into column conditions:

a + b + c=8,

(9 - a) + (9 - b) + (9 - c)=19.

Let's compute the second equation:

27 - (a + b + c) =19.

So,
