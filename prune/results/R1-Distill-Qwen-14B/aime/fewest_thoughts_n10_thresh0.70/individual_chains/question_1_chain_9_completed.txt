Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Let me solve for y z:

y z = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24 - 12/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So, y z = 2^(-19/24)  -- equation (4)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z = 2^(8/24 - 7/24) * z = 2^(1/24) * z

So, y = 2^(1/24) z -- equation (5)

Now, substitute equation (5) into equation (4):

y z = [2^(1/24) z] * z = 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Thus,

2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root (since z is positive):

z = 2^(-5/12)

So, z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, from equation (5), y = 2^(1/24) * z = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 10/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So, y = 2^(-3/8)

So, now I have x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check these in equation (3) to make sure.

Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y

Compute RHS: 2^(1/4) * x * y

x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

So,

2^(1/4) * 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(6/24 -7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)

Which matches z. Good.

Now, with x, y, z known, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2).

Let me compute the exponents:

x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Adding the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-75/24) = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.


The given system of logarithmic equations can be converted to exponential form and solved for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). After finding the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\) and take its absolute value. The result is \(\frac{25}{8}\), so \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\boxed{33}
