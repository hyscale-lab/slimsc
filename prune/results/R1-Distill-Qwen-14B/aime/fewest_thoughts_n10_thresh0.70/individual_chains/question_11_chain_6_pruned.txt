Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The problem is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). 

Hmm, let me think. So, I remember that for complex numbers, when you have an expression like this, sometimes it's helpful to express \( z \) in its polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( z \) can be written as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier to handle.

So, let me rewrite the expression using this polar form. First, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), which means \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because the reciprocal of \( e^{i\theta} \) is \( e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}.
\]
Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4 \). Let's calculate that:
\( 75 \times 4 = 300 \),
\( 117i \times 4 = 468i \). So, that term becomes \( 300 + 468i \).

Now, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \). Dividing each part by 4:
\( 96 / 4 = 24 \),
\( 144i /4 = 36i \). So, that term simplifies to \( 24 + 36i \).

Putting it all together, the expression becomes:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]
Hmm, okay. Now, I need to compute the real part of this entire expression. So, I should probably expand each term using Euler's formula, which says \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me handle each term one by one.

Starting with the first term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).
Multiplying this out:
- \( 300 \cos\theta \)
- \( 300 i \sin\theta \)
- \( 468i \cos\theta \)
- \( 468i^2 \sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), the last term becomes \( -468 \sin\theta \).

So, combining like terms:
Real part: \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( 300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta \)

Similarly, for the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).
Multiplying this out:
- \( 24 \cos\theta \)
- \( 24 (-i \sin\theta) \)
- \( 36i \cos\theta \)
- \( 36i (-i \sin\theta) \)
Simplify each term:
- The third term: \( 36i \cos\theta \)
- The fourth term: \( -36i^2 \sin\theta = 36 \sin\theta \) because \( i^2 = -1 \).

So, combining like terms:
Real part: \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( -24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta \)

Now, the entire expression is the sum of these two terms. Let me add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together.

Real parts:
\( (300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta) + (24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta) \)
Combine like terms:
\( (300 + 24) \cos\theta + (-468 + 36) \sin\theta \)
Which is:
\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts:
\( (300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta) + (-24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta) \)
Combine like terms:
\( (300 - 24) \sin\theta + (468 + 36) \cos\theta \)
Which is:
\( 276 \sin\theta + 504 \cos\theta \)

But wait, the problem only asks for the real part of the entire expression. So, I can ignore the imaginary parts. So, the real part is \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \).

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies. So, this is an expression of the form \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \), where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

I remember that the maximum value of \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). So, the maximum real part would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):
324 × 324. Hmm, 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, and cross term is 2×300×24 = 14,400.
So, (300+24)^2 = 300² + 2×300×24 +24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Wait, no, wait. 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, 2×300×24 is 14,400. So adding 90,000 +14,400 gives 104,400, then +576 gives 104,976. So, 324² is 104,976.

Next, compute (-432)^2. That's 432². Let me compute that. 400² is 160,000. 32² is 1,024. The cross term is 2×400×32 = 25,600.

So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2×400×32 +32² = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024.

160,000 +25,600 = 185,600. Then +1,024 is 186,624.

So, (-432)^2 is 186,624.

Now, adding 324² and (-432)^2:
104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, the square root of 291,600 is the maximum real part.

What's sqrt(291600)? Hmm, let's see. I know that 500² is 250,000 and 600² is 360,000. So, 291,600 is between 500 and 600.

Let me see: 540² is (500+40)^2 = 500² + 2×500×40 +40² = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. Perfect!

So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, let me double-check if I did all computations correctly. Sometimes I might make arithmetic errors.

So, 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. The maximum value is indeed sqrt(324² +432²). Wait, no, because the formula is sqrt(A² + B²) for A cosθ + B sinθ. So, in our case, A=324, B=-432, so sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. That's correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Another way to check: perhaps factor out a common factor from 324 and 432. Let
