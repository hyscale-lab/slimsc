Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses ABCD. The rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, this means that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A and C are two opposite vertices, then B and D are the other two opposite vertices. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the midpoint is ( (x + (-x))/2, (y + (-y))/2 ) = (0, 0). Similarly for B and D.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then for any point A, the opposite point C must be diametrically opposite with respect to the origin. So, A = (x, y), C = (-x, -y). Similarly, B = (p, q), D = (-p, -q). 

So, the rhombus has vertices at (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q). Now, all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, each of these points must satisfy the equation. So:

For point A: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1

For point B: (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1

Point C is just -A, so it will satisfy the same equation as A, same with D.

Now, since the figure is a rhombus, the sides must all be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to use the properties of the rhombus.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and bisect each other, we can consider vectors. Let me think in terms of vectors.

Let me denote vectors OA = (x, y), OB = (p, q). Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

But in a rhombus, the adjacent sides are vectors that have the same magnitude. So,
