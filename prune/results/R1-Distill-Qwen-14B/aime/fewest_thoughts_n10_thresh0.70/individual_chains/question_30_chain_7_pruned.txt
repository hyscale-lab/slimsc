Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, it's a primitive root, right? So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, is that right? Or actually, Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ζ) where ζ are the primitive nth roots of unity. So, since 13 is prime, Φ₁₃(x) should be x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the product given is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me write it out for a specific k.

Let me consider a single term: (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, can I factor this? Maybe it's a quadratic in ω^k. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me check if that can be factored further. Maybe as a quadratic in ω^k.

But wait, can I write this as (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) for some a and b? Let's compute it. Suppose (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) = ω^{2k} - (a + b)ω^k + ab. Comparing coefficients, we have - (a + b) = -2, so a + b = 2, and ab = 2. So, we need two numbers a and b such that a + b = 2 and ab = 2. Hmm, solving this: the quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0, whose roots are [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i. Therefore, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the term factors as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

That simplifies to [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] × [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Hmm, but ω^k as k goes from 0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity. So, Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1, since the product of (x - ω^k) for all k is the minimal polynomial, which is x¹³ - 1. But wait, actually, for the roots, it's Φ
