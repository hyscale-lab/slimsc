Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron is named ABCD, and I'm given the lengths of its edges. The edges opposite each other are equal, which might mean it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Let me list out the given lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. That's interesting. I think such a tetrahedron is called isosceles or maybe something else. Anyway, the problem is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron that is equidistant from all four faces. That point is called the incenter, right? In 3D, the incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that touches each face.

The question is to find this distance, which is the inradius. The answer needs to be in a specific form: m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, add m + n + p.

Alright, so how do I find the inradius of a tetrahedron?

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, I need to find the volume V and the total surface area S of this tetrahedron.

First, let me think about how to compute the volume. Since all the edges are given, maybe I can use coordinates to model the tetrahedron and calculate the volume using the scalar triple product. Alternatively, since the edges have a symmetrical property, perhaps there's a formula for volume in terms of edge lengths.

Wait, but for a general tetrahedron, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me recall the formula.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = √[ CM / 288 ]

Where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, the determinant is of a 5x5 matrix, which might be a bit tedious, but maybe manageable with the given symmetry.

Given the edge lengths:

AB = √41, so a² = 41

AC = √80, so b² = 80

AD = √89, so c² = 89

BC = √89, so d² = 89

BD = √80, so e² = 80

CD = √41, so f² = 41

So, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:

The matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80,
