Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know.

First, some basics:
- The circumradius (R) is 13. So, for triangle ABC, R = 13.
- The inradius (r) is 6. So, r = 6.
- IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or some properties related to this condition.

I remember that in a triangle, the circumcenter (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter (I) is where the angle bisectors meet. Also, in some cases, O and I can be the same point, but that's only in an equilateral triangle, which is probably not the case here since R and r are different.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, I think I can model this with some coordinate system. Maybe placing point I at the origin might help, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps placing O at the origin could simplify things. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up a coordinate system where point I is at (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), the line IA is a vector from I to A. Let's denote O as some point (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero.

But wait, IA is the vector from I to A, which would be (A_x, A_y) since I is at (0,0). OI is the vector from I to O, which is (h, k). The condition IA · OI = 0 implies that (A_x)(h) + (A_y)(k) = 0.

Alternatively, maybe I should place O at the origin. Let me try that.

If O is at (0,0), then the circumradius is 13, so points A, B, C lie on the circle with radius 13 centered at O. The inradius is 6, so the inradius is the distance from I to each side.

Wait, but I is inside the triangle, so it's somewhere inside the circle. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, if O is at (0,0) and I is some point (h, k), then vector OI is (h, k). Vector IA is from I to A, which is (A_x - h, A_y - k). Their dot product is zero:

(A_x - h)h + (A_y - k)k = 0.

But since A is on the circumcircle, OA has
