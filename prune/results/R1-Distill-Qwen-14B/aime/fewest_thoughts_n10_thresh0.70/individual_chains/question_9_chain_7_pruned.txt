Okay, I have this problem here about logarithms. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. And I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some basic properties. Let me write down the given equations first.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, I know that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. That simplifies to log_x(y) = 10 / x.

Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. Yeah, because log_x(y^x) is x multiplied by log_x(y), so that equals 10. So, log_x(y) must be 10 divided by x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the same logarithm property, that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).

Hmm, so now I have two expressions involving log_x(y) and log_y(x). I remember that log_b(a) and log_a(b) are reciprocals of each other. Wait, yes! Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if log_x(y) = 10 / x, then log_y(x) should be x / 10. Is that correct?

Let me verify. If I have log_x(y) = some value, then log_y(x) is 1 divided by that value. So yes, log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = x / 10.

But from the second equation, I found that log_y(x) is 5 / (2y). So now I can set up an equation:

x / 10 = 5 / (2y)

So, cross-multiplying, I get x * 2y = 10 * 5. That is, 2xy = 50. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get xy = 25.

Wait, is that it? Did I solve it that quickly? Let me go back and make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting from the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting to exponent form, that would mean y^x = x^{10}, right? Because log_x(a) = b implies a = x^b. So, y^x = x^{10}.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 implies that x^{4y} = y^{10}.

So now I have two equations:

1. y^x = x^{10}
2. x^{4y} = y^{10}

Hmm, maybe I can take the first equation and express y in terms of x or vice versa.

From equation 1: y^x = x^{10}. Taking natural logarithm on both sides, I get x ln y = 10 ln x, so ln y = (10 / x) ln x. So, y = e^{(10/x) ln x} = x^{10/x}.

Okay, so y is x raised to the power of 10/x. Let me note that down.

Now, plug this expression for y into equation 2: x^{4y} = y^{10}.

Substituting y = x^{10/x}, we have:

x^{4 * x^{10/x}} = (x^{10/x})^{10}

Simplify the right side first: (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}.

So, the left side is x^{4 * x^{10/x}}, and the right side is x^{100/x}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, their exponents must be equal. Therefore:

4 * x^{10/x} = 100/x

Simplify this equation: 4 x^{10/x} = 100/x

Divide both sides by 4: x^{10/x} = 25/x

Hmm, now I have x^{10/x} = 25/x. Let's take natural logarithm on both sides to make this equation easier to handle.

Taking ln: (10/x) ln x = ln(25/x)

Simplify the right side: ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x. So:

(10/x) ln x = ln 25 - ln x

Let me bring all the ln x terms to one side. So:

(10/x) ln x + ln x = ln 25

Factor out ln x:

ln x (10/x + 1) = ln 25

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can let t = ln x. Then, the equation becomes:

t (10 / e^t + 1) = ln 25

Wait, because if t = ln x, then x = e
