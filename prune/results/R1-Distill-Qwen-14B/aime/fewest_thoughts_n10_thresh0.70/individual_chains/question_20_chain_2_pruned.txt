Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some white and black chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips are indistinguishable except for their color. The rules are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, if I try to place any more chips on the grid, it would break one of these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the constraints clearly. Each row must have all chips of the same color, right? So, for any given row, if I place a chip in that row, all the chips in that row must be either white or black. Similarly, each column must have all chips of the same color. So, if I place a chip in a column, all the chips in that column must be the same color.

Wait, but since the grid is 5x5, each row and column has exactly 5 cells. So, if I have a row that I decide to place chips in, I can choose either color for that entire row. Similarly for each column. But there's a catch here: the colors of the rows and columns must agree at their intersections. For example, if row 1 is all white and column 1 is all black, then the cell at (1,1) would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, that tells me that the color choices for rows and columns must be consistent where they intersect.

But wait, the problem also says that each cell can contain at most one chip. So, each cell is either occupied by a white or black chip, or it's empty. But the chips in a row or column must all be the same color if they are present.

Hmm, so perhaps the grid is divided into regions where each region is a set of contiguous rows and columns, all of the same color. But since each row and column must be uniform, the regions might be more like rectangles or something. Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Maybe another approach is to consider that each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But the colors of the
