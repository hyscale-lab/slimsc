Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. If all four of her numbers match, she gets the grand prize. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, with m and n being coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so first, this seems like a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. However, since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two correct numbers, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A) / P(B).

So I need to find P(A) and P(B), the probabilities of winning the grand prize and winning a prize, respectively.

Let me start by figuring out P(A). The grand prize is when all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers. How many possible ways are there for the lottery to pick four numbers? Since it's randomly choosing 4 distinct numbers from 10, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210. Only one of these combinations would match Jen's four numbers exactly. So the probability P(A) is 1 / 210.

Now, onto P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, she could have exactly two, three, or four correct numbers. I need to calculate the probability of each of these scenarios and sum them up.

Alternatively, it might be easier to calculate the probability of not winning a prize and then subtracting that from 1. Not winning a prize would mean that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one correct numbers.

So, let's compute the number of ways she can have 0 correct numbers and 1 correct number, and then divide by the total number of possible combinations (210) to get P(not B). Then, P(B) = 1 - P(not B).

First, the number of ways she can have 0 correct numbers. Jen has picked 4 numbers, and we need all 4 chosen numbers to be outside of her 4. Since the total set S is size 10, and she has 4 numbers, there are 6 numbers she didn't pick. So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4), which is 15.

Next, the number of ways she can have exactly 1 correct number. Here, we choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the 6 she didn't pick. The number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that: C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of ways she doesn't win a prize is 15 (for 0 correct) + 80 (for 1 correct) = 95.

Hence, P(not B) is 95 / 210. Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 95 ÷ 5 = 19, 210 ÷5=42. So 19/42.

Thus, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42 -19)/42 = 23/42.

Wait a second, let me verify that. 15 +80 is indeed 95, and 95/210 reduces to 19/42, so P(B) is 23/42. That seems correct.

Now, going back to P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B). P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42. So, plugging in:

P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 1/210 divided by 23/42 is same as multiplying by 42/23.

So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (42)/(210 *23) = 42/4830. Simplifying, 42 divides by 42 is 1, and 4830 ÷42 is 115. So 1/115. So the probability is 1/115. Then m =1, n=115, which are coprime. So m +n = 116.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me make sure I haven't made a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me recalculate the number of ways for exactly 0 and 1 correct numbers.

For 0 correct numbers: We have to choose all 4 numbers from the 6 that Jen didn't pick. C(6,4)=15. That's correct.

For exactly 1 correct number: C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80. Yes, that's correct.

Total non-winning combinations: 15+80=95. So 95/210 non-winning. Therefore, winning is 210-95=115. So 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. Hmm, wait, 115/210 can be simplified. 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So P(B)=23/42. That's correct.

So P(A|B)= (1/210)/(23/42)= (1/210)*(42/23)=42/(210*23)= (1/5)*(1/23)=1/115. So the probability is indeed 1/115.

Thus, m=1, n=115, so m +n=116.

Wait, but just to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in defining the events. The problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen four. So, that includes exactly 2,3,4 correct numbers. So the number of winning combinations is:

Number of ways with exactly 2 correct: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Because choose 2 correct from Jen's 4, and 2 incorrect from the remaining 6.

Similarly, exactly 3 correct: C(4,3)*C(6,1).

Exactly 4 correct: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1.

So let's compute each:

Exactly 2 correct: C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90.

Exactly 3 correct: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So 4*6=24.

Exactly 4 correct: 1.

So total winning combinations: 90+24+1=115. So 115/210, which is 23/42. That's the same as before. So that's correct.

Hence, P(A|B)=1/115, so m +n=116.

I think this is solid. So the final answer is 116.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( A \) is the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) is the event of winning a prize.

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**
   - The grand prize occurs if all four of Jen's numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers.
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
   - Only one combination matches Jen's numbers, so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**
   - Winning a prize means having at least two correct numbers. We calculate the probability of not winning a prize and subtract it from 1.
   - **No correct numbers (0 correct):** Choose all 4 numbers from the 6 Jen didn't pick. The number of ways is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).
   - **Exactly one correct number:** Choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6. The number of ways is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
   - Total non-winning combinations: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \).
   - Probability of not winning a prize: \( \frac{95}{210} = \frac{19}{42} \).
   - Therefore, \( P(B) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \).

3. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \):**
   - Using the conditional probability formula: \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \).

4. **Simplify and find \( m + n \):**
   - The probability \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).
   - Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \boxed{116}.
