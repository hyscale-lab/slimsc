Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is: I need to find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. There's an example given, which looks like this:

0 0 8
9 9 1

They explain that 0 + 991 = 991, which is 999. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that. The top row is 0, 0, 8, so that's the number 008, which is 8. The bottom row is 9, 9, 1, so that's 991. 8 + 991 is indeed 999. Then, reading top to bottom, the first column is 0 and 9, which is 9, the second column is 0 and 9, which is 9, and the third column is 8 and 1, which is 81. So 9 + 9 + 81 is 99. That makes sense.

So, okay, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. Each cell has a digit (0-9). When read left to right, each row becomes a number. So the top row is a 3-digit number, the bottom row is another 3-digit number. Their sum should be 999.

Additionally, when read top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number. So there are three columns, each giving a 2-digit number. Their sum should be 99.

I need to find how many such grids are possible.

Let me denote the grid cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is abc, which is 100a + 10b + c.

The bottom row is def, which is 100d + 10e + f.

The sum of these two numbers is 999. So:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Simplifying, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, for the columns:

The first column is ad, which is 10a + d.

The second column is be, which is 10b + e.

The third column is cf, which is 10c + f.

The sum of these is 99:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, let's write both equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Hmm, maybe I can express equation 2 in terms of the same variables as equation 1.

Equation 2 can be rewritten as:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Which is the same as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Wait, but in equation 1, I have:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Let me denote:

Let S1 = a + d

S2 = b + e

S3 = c + f

Then equation 1 becomes:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999

And equation 2 is:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But note that:

a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3

So equation 2 is:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But a + b + c = (a + d + b + e + c + f) - (d + e + f) = (S1 + S2 + S3) - (d + e + f)

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me write equation 2 as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let me denote T = a + b + c and U = d + e + f.

So equation 2 becomes: 10 T + U = 99.

Also, from equation 1, we have:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999

But S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

But T = a + b + c and U = d + e + f = (a + d) + (b
