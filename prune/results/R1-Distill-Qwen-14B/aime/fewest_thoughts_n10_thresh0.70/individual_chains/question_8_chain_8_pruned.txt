Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. We have three variables a, b, c which are nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a fixed number. Then, there's this expression involving squares and products: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. That's equal to 6,000,000.

I think maybe I can factor or simplify that expression somehow. Let me look at it again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Oh, I notice that each term has two variables multiplied together, with one of them squared. So maybe I can factor this expression.

Let me try to group terms. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c becomes b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express each of these (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 minus the third variable.

Specifically:
- (b + c) = 300 - a
- (a + c) = 300 - b
- (a + b) = 300 - c

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. So now, our equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can find some symmetry or maybe make a substitution to reduce the number of variables. Since a, b, c are symmetric in both the sum and the expression, maybe we can assume some order, like a ≤ b ≤ c, count the number of such triples, and then multiply by the number of permutations. But I'm not sure yet, let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of two variables. Since a + b + c = 300, I can write c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute c into the expression. But that might get complicated quickly.

Wait, let's try expanding the expression:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

So adding them together, the expression becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, so 300(a² + b² + c²) - (
