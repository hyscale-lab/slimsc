Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest base \( b \) (where \( b \geq 2 \)) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a \( b \)-eautiful number is first.

The problem says a positive integer \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When \( n \) is written in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

So, for example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since \( 6 \times 13 + 3 = 81 \)), and \( 6 + 3 = 9 \), which is \( \sqrt{81} \).

Alright, so I need to find the smallest base \( b \) where there are more than ten such numbers. Let me break down the problem.

First, if \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it can be expressed as \( n = a \times b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \). Since it's a two-digit number, \( a \) must be at least 1 and at most \( b-1 \) (since in base \( b \), digits go from 0 to \( b-1 \)), and \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b-1 \).

The second condition is that the sum of the digits \( a + c \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \). So, combining these, we have:
\[ a + c = \sqrt{a \times b + c} \]

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[ (a + c)^2 = a \times b + c \]

Expanding the left side:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a b + c \]

Hmm, let's rearrange this equation to group like terms:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \]

Maybe I can factor this or find some relation. Let me try to rearrange terms:
\[ a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). For each base \( b \), I can consider varying \( c \) and solving for \( a \). But since \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), they have constraints:
- \( 1 \leq a \leq b-1 \)
- \( 0 \leq c \leq b-1 \)

So, for each base \( b \), I can iterate over possible values of \( c \) and solve for \( a \), checking if \( a \) is an integer within the valid range.

Let me formalize this. For given \( b \) and \( c \), the equation is:
\[ a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0 \]

This quadratic in \( a \) can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c - b) \pm \sqrt{(2c - b)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (c^2 - c)}}{2} \]

Simplify the discriminant:
\[ D = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c) \]
Expanding \( (2c - b)^2 \):
\[ 4c^2 - 4b c + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c \]
Simplify:
\[ (4c^2 - 4c^2) + (-4b c) + (b^2) + 4c \]
Which becomes:
\[ -4b c + b^2 + 4c \]
Factor terms:
\[ b^2 - 4b c + 4c \]
Hmm, maybe factor differently:
\[ b^2 + 4c - 4b c = b^2 + 4c(1 - b) \]
Not sure if that helps. Let me write the discriminant as:
\[ D = b^2 - 4b c + 4c \]

So, the discriminant must be non-negative for real solutions:
\[ b^2 - 4b c + 4c \geq 0 \]

But since we need \( a \) to be a positive integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me denote \( D = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer.

So, we have:
\[ b^2 - 4b c + 4c = k^2 \]
Which can be rewritten as:
\[ b^2 - (4c) b + (4c - k^2) = 0 \]

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. For each base \( b \), I can iterate through all possible \( c \) values (from 0 to \( b-1 \)) and for each \( c \), compute the possible \( a \) values that satisfy the quadratic equation.

Let me try to express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) and \( c \). From the quadratic equation:
\[ a = \frac{-(2c - b) \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} \]
Where \( D = b^2 -4b c +4c \).

So, for each \( b \), and each \( c \) from 0 to \( b-1 \), compute \( D \) and check if it's a perfect square. If it is, then compute \( a \) and see if it's an integer within the valid range (1 to \( b-1 \)).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between \( a \) and \( c \) without considering \( b \). Let's see.

From the original equation:
\[ (a + c)^2 = a b + c \]
So,
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a b + c \]
Rearranged:
\[ a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \]
Factor terms:
Let me see if I can factor this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):
\[ a b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c \]
So,
\[ b = \frac{a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c}{a} \]
Simplify:
\[ b = a + 2c + \frac{c^2 - c}{a} \]

Since \( b \) must be an integer, \( a \) must divide \( c^2 - c \). So, \( a \) divides \( c(c - 1) \).

Given that \( a \) is between 1 and \( b-1 \), and \( c \) is between 0 and \( b-1 \), perhaps this can help in constraining possible \( a \) and \( c \) pairs for each \( b \).

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to fix \( b \) and iterate through possible \( c \) and \( a \) to see how many solutions exist for each \( b \).

So, my plan is:
1. For each base \( b \) starting from 2 upwards:
   a. For each \( c \) from 0 to \( b-1 \):
      i. Compute the discriminant \( D = b^2 -4b c +4c \)
      ii. If \( D \) is a perfect square, compute the possible \( a \) values.
      iii. Check if \( a \) is an integer and within 1 to \( b-1 \).
      iv. If so, count this \( n \) as a \( b \)-eautiful number.
2. Keep track of the count of \( b \)-eautiful numbers for each \( b \).
3. Find the smallest \( b \) where the count exceeds 10.

But this might take a while if I do it manually for each \( b \). Maybe I can find some patterns or derive a formula.

Alternatively, going back to the equation:
\[ (a + c)^2 = a b + c \]
We can write this as:
\[ (a + c)^2 = a b + c \]
Let me denote \( s = a + c \), so \(
