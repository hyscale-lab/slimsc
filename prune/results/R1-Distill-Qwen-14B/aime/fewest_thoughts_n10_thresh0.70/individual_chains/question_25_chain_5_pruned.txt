Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, so there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Additionally, some own other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades. The numbers are given as 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait, so everyone has at least the candy hearts, right? So the candy hearts are like a common item that all have. Then the other three items are optional. Hmm. But the problem mentions that some own exactly two or exactly three of these things. Oh, and the question is asking for the number of people who own all four, which would be candy hearts plus the other three.

Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. I think that's what I need to use here. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the total number of elements in the union of multiple sets. But in this case, we're given some specific numbers about how many own exactly two or exactly three items, so maybe I can use that to find the overlap for all four.

Wait, but in this case, the four items are: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Since everyone owns C, that means C is the universal set here. So, all residents are part of C.

But the problem is about how many own all four. So, the intersection of D, G, S, and C. Since C is everything, it's just the intersection of D, G, and S.

Wait, but the problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two of these things (excluding C, I assume?) and exactly three. Hmm, perhaps I need to model this with inclusion-exclusion on the four sets.

Wait, maybe let me write down all the given data:

Total residents, n = 900.

Number owning D: |D| = 195.

Number owning G: |G| = 367.

Number owning S: |S| = 562.

Number owning C: Well, since all own C, |C| = 900.

But in the problem, each resident owns C, so when considering the other items, we can think of C as the entire population.

Now, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things. And 234 own exactly three. So, these are counts of people who have exactly two or exactly three items, not counting the fourth.

Wait, but since C is mandatory, the other three items are optional, so when someone owns exactly two, that includes C and one other, or exactly two of D, G, S (and have C as well). Hmm, wait noâ€” since C is always there, if someone owns exactly two things, it's C plus one of the other three. Similarly, someone owning exactly three would have C plus two of the others. And someone owning all four would have C plus all three others.

So, the
