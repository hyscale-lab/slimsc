Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's given and what's being asked.

First, the problem says that Aya walks a 9-kilometer-long path every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. There are two scenarios given about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, again including the coffee shop time.

Let me break down the information provided.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours. This time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours.

In the second scenario, she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus t minutes equals 2 hours and 24 minutes.

I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes. So, perhaps I can find s and t first, and then compute the time for the new speed.

Let me convert all times into minutes to avoid confusion. Let's see:

First scenario: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Second scenario: 2 hours and 24 minutes = (2*60) +24 = 120 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, for both scenarios, the total time is 240 and 144 minutes respectively, which includes the walking time plus t minutes.

Let me denote the walking time as T1 and T2 for the two scenarios.

In the first case, T1 + t = 240 minutes.

In the second case, T2 + t = 144 minutes.

But I also know that the walking time is related to her speed and the distance. The distance is constant at 9 km.

So, walking time can be calculated as distance divided by speed.

For the first scenario: T1 = 9 / s hours.

But wait, T1 is in hours, but t is in minutes. Hmm, perhaps it's better to work in the same units. Let me convert everything to hours or everything to minutes.

Let me choose hours. So, t is t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking time: 9 / s hours.

Total time: 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario:

Walking time: 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Total time: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

Wait, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours, so yes, 2.4 hours.

So, now I have two equations:

1) (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4

2) (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve this system of equations to find s and t.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Equation 1: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4

Equation 2: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Now, let's compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2).

Find a common denominator, which is s(s + 2):

[9(s + 2) - 9s] / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Simplify the numerator:

9s + 18 -9s = 18

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So now, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s (s + 2)

So, 18 = 1.6 (s^2 + 2s)

Divide both sides by 1.6 to make it easier:

18 / 1.6 = s^2 + 2s

Compute 18 /1.6:

1.6 goes into 18: 1.6 *11=17.6, so 18 -17.6=0.4, so 11 + 0.4/1.6= 11.25

So, 11.25 = s^2 + 2s

So, s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solve for s using quadratic formula.

s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2

Because discriminant D = (2)^2 +4*1*11.25 =4 +45=49

sqrt(49)=7

So, s = [-2 ±7 ] /2

We can ignore the negative solution because speed can't be negative.

So, s = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5 km/h

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, plug s back into one of the equations to find t.

Let's take equation 1:

(9 / s) + (t /60 )=4

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + (t/60) =4

Subtract 3.6:

t/60=0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is: when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5=3 km/h. Find the total time, including t=24 minutes.

So, the walking time at 3 km/h is 9 /3 =3 hours.

So, the total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Wait, but 3 hours is 180 minutes. So 180 +24=204 minutes.

Alternatively, in hours, 3 hours + 24 minutes is 3 + 24/60=3.4 hours. But the problem asks for the number of minutes, including t.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes, so total 204 minutes.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly.

Wait, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5=3 km/h. So, walking time is 9 /3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then, including t=24 minutes, total time is 180 +24=204 minutes.

So, 204 minutes is the answer.

Let me just double-check my calculations.

First, solving for s: we had 18/[s(s+2)] =1.6, leading to s^2 +2s=11.25, which gave s=2.5 km/h. Then t was found to be 24 minutes. So, everything looks correct.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, time is 3 hours. 3 hours is 180 minutes plus 24 minutes coffee break, total 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we first convert the given times into minutes:

- First scenario: 4 hours = 240 minutes.
- Second scenario: 2 hours and 24 minutes = 144 minutes.

We denote the walking time as \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) for the two scenarios, and \( t \) as the coffee shop time in minutes. The equations based on the total time are:

1. \( T_1 + t = 240 \)
2. \( T_2 + t = 144 \)

The walking time can be calculated as \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours for the first scenario and \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours for the second scenario. Converting these into minutes:

1. \( \frac{9}{s} \times 60 + t = 240 \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s+2} \times 60 + t = 144 \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):

\[
\frac{9 \times 60}{s} - \frac{9 \times 60}{s+2} = 240 - 144
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s+2} = 96
\]

Finding a common denominator:

\[
\frac{540(s+2) - 540s}{s(s+2)} = 96
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
\frac{1080}{s(s+2)} = 96
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s(s+2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]

\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root:

\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):

\[
\frac{9}{2.5} \times 60 + t = 240
\]

\[
360 + t = 240 \implies t = -120
\]

This result is incorrect, so let's re-express the equations in hours:

1. \( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \)
2. \( \frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]

Finding a common denominator:

\[
\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s(s+2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]

\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root:

\[
s = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):

\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]

\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Now, when Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \, \text{km/h} \), the walking time is:

\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Including the coffee shop time:

\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

**Answer:** The total time is \boxed{204} minutes.
