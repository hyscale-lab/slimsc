Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I have that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes where p divides n² + 1 must be congruent to 1 mod 4 because of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. But wait, here we're dealing with n⁴ + 1. Let me think about how that affects the primes.

If p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n^8 ≡ 1 mod p² because squaring both sides gives n^8 ≡ 1 mod p². So, the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But the order modulo p² must also divide φ(p²) = p(p-1). Since p is an odd prime (except for p=2, but let's check that first).

Wait, let's check p=2. If p=2, then p²=4. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

n can be 1: 1 +1 = 2, which is not divisible by 4.

n=2: 16 +1 =17, which mod 4 is 1, so 17 mod 4 is 1, not 0.

Wait, maybe n=3: 81 +1 =82, which mod 4 is 2, not 0.

Wait, perhaps n=0: 0 +1=1, which mod 4 is 1. So 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p cannot be 2. Wait, but maybe n=1 mod 2? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for p=2, n is even. Let's see, n=2k. Then n⁴ = (2k)^4 = 16k^4, so n⁴ +1 =16k^4 +1. 16k^4 is 0 mod 4, so 16k^4 +1 is 1 mod 4, so not 0. So no solution for p=2. So p must be an odd prime.

So, moving on. The next primes are 5, 13, 17, etc. Wait, but wait, let me think. For p=5, does there exist an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25?

Let me check n=2: 16 mod 25 is 16. 16 +1 =17, which isn't 0 mod 25.

n=3: 81 mod25 is 6. 6+1=7, not 0.

n=4: 256 mod25 is 6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6). 6+1=7.

n=7: 7^4= (49)^2=2401. 2401 mod25: 2400 is 96*25, so 2401 is 1 mod25. 1+1=2, nope.

n=2: as above, 16 mod25 is 16.

n=1: 1 mod25=1, 1+1=2.

n=5: 0 +1=1 mod25.

Hmm, maybe p=5 isn't the prime we're looking for. Let me try p=13.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let's consider the conditions for p being an odd prime where p² divides n⁴ +1.

We have n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

First, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So, modulo p, the equation is n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p.

But for this to have a solution, the multiplicative order of n modulo p must divide 8 because n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. Also, the order must divide (p-1) by Fermat's little theorem.

So, 8 must divide (p-1), meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8. So possible primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. So the smallest primes here are 17, 41, etc.

Wait, but earlier I thought of 5 as a possibility. Wait, for p=5, 5 ≡ 1 mod4, but not necessarily 1 mod8. Let me check if p=5 works.

Wait, in the case of p=5, does n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25 have a solution?

Let me compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24.

n=1: 1 → 1

n=2: 16

n=3: 81 → 6

n=4: 256 → 6

n=5: 0

n=6: 6^4 = 1296 → 1296-51*25=1296-1275=21 → 21

n=7: 7^4=2401 → 2401-96*25=2401-2400=1 →1

n=8: 8^4=4096 → 4096 mod25: 4096/25=163.84, 163*25=4075, 4096-4075=21 →21

n=9: 9^4=6561 → 6561 - 262*25=6561-6550=11 →11

n=10: 0

n=11: 11^4=14641 →14641 mod25: 14641 - 585*25=14641-14625=16 →16

n=12: 12^4= 20736 →20736 mod25: 20736 - 829*25=20736-20725=11 →11

n=13: 13^4=28561 →28561 mod25: 28561 - 1142*25=28561-28550=11 →11

n=14:14^4=38416 →mod25: 38416/25=1536.64 →1536*25=38400 →38416-38400=16 →16

n=15:0

n=16:16^4=65536 →65536 mod25: 65536 - 2621*25=65536-65525=11 →11

n=17:17^4=83521 →83521 mod25: 83521-3340*25=83521-83500=21 →21

n=18:18^4=104976 →104976 mod25: 104976 - 4199*25=104976-104975=1 →1

n=19:19^4=130321 →130321 mod25: 130321-5212*25=130321-130300=21 →21

n=20:0

n=21:21^4=194481 →194481 mod25: 194481-7779*25=194481-194475=6 →6

n=22:22^4=234256 →234256 mod25: 234256 - 9370*25=234256-234250=6 →6

n=23:23^4=279841 →279841 mod25: 279841 -11193*25=279841-279825=16 →16

n=24:24^4=331776 →331776 mod25:331776 -13271*25=331776-331775=1 →1

Looking through these, I don't see any n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25 because -1 mod25 is 24. None of the residues I saw when computing n⁴ mod25 are 24. So p=5 doesn't work because there's no n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

So, the next prime that's 1 mod8 is 17. Let me check if p=17 works. So, does there exist an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17²=289?

Wait, but before checking mod289, maybe I should check mod17 first. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 doesn't have a solution, then mod289 won't either.

So, first, check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 has a solution.

Since 17 is 1 mod4, maybe there's a solution.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16.

n=1:1 →1

n=2:16 →16

n=3:81 mod17: 81-4*17=81-68=13 →13

n=4:256 mod17: 256/17=15*17=255 →256-255=1 →1

n=5:625 mod17: 625 -36*17=625-612=13 →13

n=6:6^4=1296 mod17: 1296 ÷17=76*17=1292 →1296-1292=4 →4

n=7:7^4=2401 mod17: 2401 ÷17=141*17=2397 →2401-2397=4 →4

n=8:8^4=4096 mod17: Let's compute 8 mod17=8, 8^2=64 mod17=13, 8^4=13²=169 mod17=16 →16

n=9:9 mod17=9, 9^2=81 mod17=13, 9^4=13²=169 mod17=16 →16

n=10:10^4=10000 mod17. Let's compute 10 mod17=10, 10^2=100 mod17=15, 10^4=15²=225 mod17. 225-13*17=225-221=4 →4.

n=11:11 mod17=11, 11^2=121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2 →2. Then 11^4=2²=4 mod17.

n=12:12 mod17=12, 12^2=144 mod17=144-8*17=144-136=8 →8. 12^4=8²=64 mod17=13.

n=13:13 mod17=13, 13^2=169 mod17=16 →16, 13^4=16²=256 mod17=1.

n=14:14 mod17=14, 14^2=196 mod17=196-11*17=196-187=9 →9, 14^4=9²=81 mod17=13.

n=15:15 mod17=15, 15^2=225 mod17=4, 15^4=4²=16.

n=16:16 mod17=16, 16^2=256 mod17=1, 16^4=1²=1.

So looking for n where n^4 ≡-1 mod17 is same as n^4≡16 mod17.

From the above, n=8,9
