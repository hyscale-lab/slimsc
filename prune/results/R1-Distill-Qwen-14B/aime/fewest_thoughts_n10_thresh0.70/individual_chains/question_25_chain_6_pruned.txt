Okay, so I've got this problem about Aimeville's residents and the things they own. Let me try to parse this step by step. 

First, the total number of residents is 900. That's the universal set we're dealing with. Now, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. So everyone has that. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers for these are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Wait, but the problem also mentions that some residents own exactly two of these things, and some own exactly three. And importantly, we're supposed to find out how many own all four things, including the candy hearts. 

Hmm, so this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. 

Let me recall the formula for three sets. The inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets A, B, and C is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But wait, in this problem, we have four things, but one of them (the candy hearts) is owned by everyone. So maybe I can model this as three sets plus the universal set. No, maybe not. Let me think.

Actually, since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, that's like being in the universal set. So the four things are candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S). 

Wait, no, the four things are: bag of candy hearts, diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. So the four 'things' are four different items. So each resident owns some combination of these four. 

The problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So the candy hearts are like a fourth item that everyone has. So, in terms of sets, the total is 900, and each resident is in the set H (candy hearts), plus any combination of D, G, S. 

But
