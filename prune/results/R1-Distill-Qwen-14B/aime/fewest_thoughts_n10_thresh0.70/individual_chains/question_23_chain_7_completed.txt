Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, I should recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, that's a square. Wait, no. Let me think. A rhombus is a parallelogram with all sides equal. The diagonals in a rhombus do bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. So, in a general rhombus, diagonals are not perpendicular. Hmm, but in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, right? So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Wait, so since A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means that the points are arranged such that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, the rhombus has vertices at A, B, C, D, with A and C being opposite, B and D being opposite.

So, let me denote the coordinates:

Let A = (x1, y1), C = (-x1, -y1)
Let B = (x2, y2), D = (-x2, -y2)

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for A: x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1
For B: x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the length of AB equals BC equals CD equals DA.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Since the rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

But wait, maybe another approach. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they bisect each other. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular if and only if it's a square, but in general, they aren't. But in this case, the rhombus is such that the diagonals intersect at the origin.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular if it's a square. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case, they are. So in this problem, since it's just a rhombus, the diagonals don't have to be perpendicular.

But wait, let me think again. Actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, that's a square. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me check.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do intersect at right angles. Oh, right, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. I think I was wrong before. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

So, given that, in this problem, diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, so their midpoints are at the origin. So, that's consistent with the points being A, C as (x, y) and (-x, -y), same with B and D.

Now, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

So, the slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1.

Similarly, the slope of BD is (y2 - (-y2))/(x2 - (-x2)) = (2y2)/(2x2) = y2/x2.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.

So, (y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1.

So, y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

That's one condition.

Now, since the sides of the rhombus are equal, let's compute the lengths of the sides.

The length AB should equal BC, etc. Let me compute AB² and BC².

Point A is (x1,y1), point B is (x2,y2).

AB² = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)².

Similarly, BC² = (x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)².

Wait, but that's the same as AB². So, in a rhombus, AB must equal BC, which is automatically satisfied? Hmm, no, that can't be.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, all four sides are equal, but I think the way the points are arranged is important.

Wait, in a rhombus, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA must have the same length.

Wait, but in our case, the four points are A, B, C, D, which are arranged in order, so A to B to C to D to A.

So, to compute AB, BC, CD, DA, each should have the same length.

So, AB² = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)².

BC² = (x3 - x2)² + (y3 - y2)².

But since the points are A, B, C, D, which are in order, we have that C is the opposite of A, so C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, D is (-x2, -y2).

So, then, point C is (-x1, -y1), so BC is from B (x2, y2) to C (-x1, -y1), so BC² = (-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)².

Similarly, CD is from C (-x1, -y1) to D (-x2, -y2), so CD² = (-x2 - (-x1))² + (-y2 - (-y1))² = (x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)².

DA is from D (-x2, -y2) to A (x1, y1), so DA² = (x1 - (-x2))² + (y1 - (-y2))² = (x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)².

Wait, but AB² is (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2.

BC² is (-x1 - x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

CD² is (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2.

DA² is (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

Wait, so AB² and CD² are equal, and BC² and DA² are equal.

So, for it to be a rhombus, AB² must equal BC².

So, (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (x2^2 - 2x1x2 + x1^2) + (y2^2 - 2y1y2 + y1^2).

Right side: (x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2) + (y1^2 + 2y1y2 + y2^2).

Subtract left side from right side:

[ (x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2) + (y1^2 + 2y1y2 + y2^2) ] - [ (x2^2 - 2x1x2 + x1^2) + (y2^2 - 2y1y2 + y1^2) ]

Simplify:

(x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 + y1^2 + 2y1y2 + y2^2) - (x2^2 - 2x1x2 + x1^2 + y2^2 - 2y1y2 + y1^2)

= [2x1x2 + 2y1y2] - [-2x1x2 -2y1y2]

= 2x1x2 + 2y1y2 + 2x1x2 + 2y1y2

= 4x1x2 + 4y1y2.

So, setting the difference equal to zero (since AB² = BC²):

4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, that's another condition.

Earlier, we had from the diagonals being perpendicular:

(y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1 => y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, let's write down both equations:

1. y1 y2 = -x1 x2. (from perpendicular diagonals)

2. x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0. (from equal sides)

Hmm, substituting equation 1 into equation 2:

x1x2 + (-x1x2) = 0 => 0 = 0.

Wait, so equation 2 is redundant? That's interesting.

So, the only condition we have is y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, moving on.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD.

We need to compute BD².

BD is the distance from B to D.

Point B is (x2, y2), point D is (-x2, -y2).

So, BD² = (-x2 - x2)^2 + (-y2 - y2)^2 = (-2x2)^2 + (-2y2)^2 = 4x2² + 4y2² = 4(x2² + y2²).

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. BD is from B (x2, y2) to D (-x2, -y2).

So, the vector is (-x2 - x2, -y2 - y2) = (-2x2, -2y2).

So, the distance is sqrt( (-2x2)^2 + (-2y2)^2 ) = sqrt(4x2² + 4y2²) = 2 sqrt(x2² + y2²).

So, BD² is [2 sqrt(x2² + y2²)]^2 = 4(x2² + y2²).

So, BD² = 4(x2² + y2²).

So, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, find the infimum of BD², or the minimum value that BD² can take, and then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimum.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD², because we need a number that is less than BD² for all rhombi, which would be the minimal BD².

Wait, but wait, is BD² bounded below? Let's think.

Since the points are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

So, x² + y² = 20 + (20 y²)/24 + y² = 20 + (5 y²)/6 + y² = 20 + (11 y²)/6.

So, x² + y² is at least 20, since y² is non-negative. So, BD² = 4(x2² + y2²) ≥ 4*20 = 80.

So, BD² is at least 80. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 80, because BD² can be as close to 80 as possible but not less than 80.

Wait, but is BD² exactly equal to 80 for some rhombus? Let me check.

If x2² + y2² = 20, then BD² would be 80. But since the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, x² must be at least 20, because x²/20 is at least 1.

Wait, no. For the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, the points are on both branches, so x can be positive or negative, but x² must be at least 20. So, x2² is at least 20, and y2² can be anything such that x2²/20 - y2²/24 = 1.

So, if x2² is 20, then y2² = 0, so point B would be (±√20, 0). But wait, is that possible?

Wait, if point B is (√20, 0), then point D is (-√20, 0). Then, what are points A and C?

From the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Here, y2 = 0, so y1*0 = -x1 x2 => 0 = -x1 x2.

But x2 = √20, so x1 must be zero. But point A is (0, y1). But plugging into the hyperbola equation: 0²/20 - y1²/24 = -y1²/24 = 1 => y1² = -24, which is impossible because y1 is real. So, point B cannot be (√20, 0) because that would require point A to be imaginary.

Hence, BD² cannot be 80, because that would require y2² = 0, leading to an impossible point A.

Therefore, BD² must be greater than 80.

So, the infimum of BD² is 80, but it's not achievable. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 80.

Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that number would be the infimum of BD², which is 80, because BD² is always greater than 80, but can get as close to 80 as desired.

But let me verify that. Is there a sequence of rhombi where BD² approaches 80?

Suppose we take points B approaching (√20, 0). Let's say B is (√20, ε), where ε is a very small positive number. Then, point D is (-√20, -ε).

Then, from the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Here, y2 = ε, x2 = √20.

So, y1 * ε = -x1 * √20.

We also have that point A is (x1, y1), which lies on the hyperbola: x1²/20 - y1²/24 = 1.

So, let me solve for y1 from the condition: y1 = (-x1 * √20)/ε.

Substitute into the hyperbola equation:

x1²/20 - [ (-x1 * √20 / ε )² ] /24 = 1.

Compute:

x1² / 20 - ( (x1² * 20) / ε² ) /24 = 1.

Simplify:

x1² / 20 - (x1² * 20) / (24 ε²) = 1.

Factor out x1²:

x1² [ 1/20 - (20)/(24 ε²) ] = 1.

Hmm, let's write this as:

x1² [ (1/20) - (5)/(6 ε²) ] = 1.

To make this manageable, let me pick ε approaching zero. So, as ε approaches zero, the term (5)/(6 ε²) becomes dominant and negative, making the coefficient of x1² negative.

So, x1² [ something negative ] = 1 => x1² = 1 / (negative number) => x1² is negative, which is impossible.

Wait, that suggests that as ε approaches zero, we can't find real x1 and y1. So, maybe approaching points B near (√20, 0) isn't feasible because it leads to imaginary points A.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.

Alternatively, suppose that we parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola in terms of some parameter.

Given that, perhaps we can parametrize point A as (√20 sec θ, √(24) tan θ), since the hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions or sec and tan.

Wait, for hyperbola, parametrization can be:

x = a sec θ = √20 sec θ,

y = b tan θ = √24 tan θ.

Alternatively, using hyperbola functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.

But perhaps the first approach is more manageable.

So, let me set A as (√20 sec θ, √24 tan θ).

Then, point C is (-√20 sec θ, -√24 tan θ).

Similarly, let me set point B as (√20 sec φ, √24 tan φ).

Then, point D is (-√20 sec φ, -√24 tan φ).

Now, from the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular: (y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1.

So, [√24 tan θ * √24 tan φ] / [√20 sec θ * √20 sec φ] = -1.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 24 tan θ tan φ.

Denominator: 20 sec θ sec φ.

So, (24 tan θ tan φ) / (20 sec θ sec φ) ) = -1.

Simplify the fraction:

(24/20) * (tan θ tan φ) / (sec θ sec φ) = -1.

24/20 = 6/5.

So, (6/5) * (tan θ tan φ) / (sec θ sec φ) = -1.

Note that tan θ / sec θ = sin θ, because tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, sec θ = 1 / cos θ, so tan θ / sec θ = sin θ.

Similarly, tan φ / sec φ = sin φ.

So, (6/5) * sin θ sin φ = -1.

So, 6/5 sin θ sin φ = -1 => sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

So, sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

Hmm, okay.

Now, we need to compute BD². Earlier, we found that BD² = 4(x2² + y2²). Here, x2 is √20 sec φ, y2 is √24 tan φ.

So, BD² = 4 [ (√20 sec φ)^2 + (√24 tan φ)^2 ].

Compute each term:

(√20 sec φ)^2 = 20 sec² φ.

(√24 tan φ)^2 = 24 tan² φ.

So, BD² = 4 [20 sec² φ + 24 tan² φ ].

Factor out 4:

= 4 * [20 sec² φ + 24 tan² φ ].

Simplify:

= 80 sec² φ + 96 tan² φ.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of sin and cos.

Recall that sec² φ = 1 + tan² φ.

So, let me substitute:

= 80 (1 + tan² φ) + 96 tan² φ.

= 80 + 80 tan² φ + 96 tan² φ.

= 80 + 176 tan² φ.

So, BD² = 80 + 176 tan² φ.

But from the earlier condition, sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

Hmm, but I also need to relate θ and φ.

Wait, perhaps we can write this as:

sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

Let me denote that equation as equation (1).

Now, our goal is to find the minimum value of BD², which is expressed as 80 + 176 tan² φ.

So, to minimize BD², we need to minimize tan² φ.

But tan² φ is non-negative, so the minimal BD² occurs when tan² φ is as small as possible.

But we have the constraint sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

So, we need to minimize tan² φ, given that sin θ sin φ = -5/6.

But how?

Hmm, perhaps express tan² φ in terms of sin φ.

tan² φ = (1 - cos² φ)/sin² φ.

But maybe it's better to find a relationship between θ and φ.

Alternatively, perhaps express sin θ in terms of φ.

From equation (1):

sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ).

But sin θ must be between -1 and 1, so | -5/(6 sin φ) | ≤ 1.

So, |5/(6 sin φ)| ≤ 1 => |5| ≤ |6 sin φ| => |sin φ| ≥ 5/6.

So, |sin φ| ≥ 5/6.

Therefore, sin φ is either ≥5/6 or ≤ -5/6.

So, that gives us a constraint on φ.

So, sin φ ≥ 5/6 or sin φ ≤ -5/6.

Therefore, the minimal value of |sin φ| is 5/6.

Given that, let's find tan² φ in terms of sin φ.

tan² φ = (1 - cos² φ)/sin² φ = (1/sin² φ) - 1.

So, tan² φ = (1/sin² φ) - 1.

Given that |sin φ| ≥5/6, so sin² φ ≥25/36.

So, 1/sin² φ ≤ 36/25.

Therefore, tan² φ = (1/sin² φ) - 1 ≤ (36/25) - 1 = 11/25.

So, tan² φ ≤11/25.

Wait, but we are trying to find the minimal BD², which is 80 +176 tan² φ.

Since tan² φ can be as small as... Wait, but wait, sin² φ is bounded below by 25/36, so tan² phi is bounded above by 11/25.

Wait, no, that's not the direction we need. We need to find the minimal value of BD², which is achieved when tan² phi is as small as possible.

Wait, but tan² phi is (1/sin² phi) -1, so as sin² phi increases, tan² phi decreases.

So, the minimal tan² phi occurs when sin² phi is maximal.

But wait, sin phi is bounded above by 1. So, when sin phi approaches 1, tan² phi approaches infinity. So, no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Wait, tan² phi = (1 - cos² phi)/sin² phi = (1/sin² phi) -1.

So, as sin² phi increases towards 1, tan² phi approaches zero.

Wait, no, as sin² phi approaches 1, tan² phi approaches (1/1) -1 = 0. So, tan² phi approaches zero.

Wait, but sin² phi can't be more than 1, so the minimal tan² phi would be when sin² phi is maximum.

But in our case, sin phi is constrained to be at least 5/6 in absolute value.

So, sin² phi is at least 25/36.

So, tan² phi is (1/sin² phi) -1, which is at least (36/25) -1 = 11/25.

So, tan² phi ≥11/25.

Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me compute that again.

If sin² phi ≥25/36, then 1/sin² phi ≤36/25.

So, tan² phi = (1/sin² phi) -1 ≤36/25 -1 = 11/25.

Wait, no, that's the upper bound.

Wait, actually, if sin² phi is at least 25/36, then 1/sin² phi is at most 36/25. So, tan² phi, which is (1/sin² phi) -1, is at most 36/25 -1 = 11/25.

But that gives the maximum of tan² phi, not the minimum.

Wait, but if sin² phi is as large as possible, which is 1, then tan² phi approaches zero.

But in our case, sin² phi is at least 25/36, so tan² phi is at least (1/(25/36)) -1 = 36/25 -1 = 11/25.

Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, tan² phi = (1 - cos² phi)/sin² phi = (1/sin² phi) -1.

So, if sin² phi is 25/36, then tan² phi = 36/25 -1 = 11/25.

If sin² phi increases, tan² phi decreases. So, the minimal value of tan² phi is when sin² phi is maximum.

But sin² phi can't be more than 1, so as sin² phi approaches 1, tan² phi approaches zero.

Therefore, tan² phi can be as small as approaching zero, but in our case, sin² phi is at least 25/36, so tan² phi is at least 11/25.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because when sin² phi is 25/36, tan² phi is 11/25. When sin² phi increases beyond 25/36 towards 1, tan² phi decreases towards zero. So, the minimal value of tan² phi is approached as sin² phi approaches 1, which makes tan² phi approach zero.

But wait, that contradicts earlier because when sin phi approaches 1, point B approaches (√20, 0), but as we saw earlier, that leads to point A being imaginary. So, perhaps in reality, sin phi can't be too close to 1 because of the constraints of the hyperbola.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can write BD² in terms of sin phi.

Wait, BD² = 80 + 176 tan² phi.

And we have from equation (1): sin theta sin phi = -5/6.

We can write sin theta = (-5)/(6 sin phi).

But since point A is on the hyperbola, which is parametrized as x = sqrt20 sec theta, y = sqrt24 tan theta.

So, for point A, x1 = sqrt20 sec theta, y1 = sqrt24 tan theta.

But since point A must lie on the hyperbola, substituting:

x1² /20 - y1² /24 = 1.

Which is satisfied by the parametrization, so that's okay.

But we can also think of the coordinates of point A as (sqrt20 sec theta, sqrt24 tan theta).

Similarly, point B is (sqrt20 sec phi, sqrt24 tan phi).

So, from the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Which is [sqrt24 tan theta][sqrt24 tan phi] = - [sqrt20 sec theta][sqrt20 sec phi].

So, 24 tan theta tan phi = -20 sec theta sec phi.

Divide both sides by 4:

6 tan theta tan phi = -5 sec theta sec phi.

Which is similar to the earlier result.

Expressed as:

6 (sin theta / cos theta)(sin phi / cos phi) = -5 (1 / cos theta)(1 / cos phi).

Multiply both sides by cos theta cos phi:

6 sin theta sin phi = -5.

Which brings us back to 6 sin theta sin phi = -5 => sin theta sin phi = -5/6.

So, we have that.

Now, to find BD², which is 80 +176 tan² phi.

We can write tan² phi = (1 - cos² phi)/sin² phi.

But perhaps it's better to express tan² phi in terms of sin phi.

Alternatively, express tan² phi as (1 - cos(2 phi))/(1 + cos(2 phi)).

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about BD² in terms of sin phi.

From BD² =80 +176 tan² phi.

But tan² phi = (1 - cos² phi)/sin² phi = (1/sin² phi) -1.

So, BD² =80 +176 (1/sin² phi -1) =80 +176/sin² phi -176.

Simplify:

= (80 -176) + 176 / sin² phi.

= -96 + 176 / sin² phi.

But from the condition sin theta sin phi = -5/6.

We can write sin theta = (-5)/(6 sin phi).

But since sin theta must be between -1 and 1, we have that | -5/(6 sin phi) | ≤1 => |5/(6 sin phi)| ≤1 => |sin phi| ≥5/6.

So, sin² phi ≥25/36.

Thus, 1/sin² phi ≤36/25.

So, BD² = -96 +176/sin² phi.

We want to find the minimal BD², which would be when 1/sin² phi is as small as possible.

But 1/sin² phi is minimized when sin² phi is maximized.

Wait, no, 1/sin² phi is minimized when sin² phi is maximized.

Because if sin² phi is larger, 1/sin² phi is smaller.

So, the minimal value of 1/sin² phi is 1/1=1.

But sin² phi can be as large as 1, so 1/sin² phi can be as small as 1.

But in our case, sin² phi is at least 25/36, so 1/sin² phi is at most 36/25.

So, the minimal BD² occurs when 1/sin² phi is as small as possible, which is when sin² phi is as large as possible, which is 1.

So, BD² would be -96 +176*(1) =80.

But as we saw earlier, when sin² phi approaches 1, point B approaches (sqrt20, 0), which makes point A imaginary.

So, BD² can approach 80, but can't actually reach it.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 80, but it's not attainable.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 80.

So, the answer is 80.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), and the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. 

### Key Steps:

1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**:
   - Points \(A\) and \(C\) are \((\sqrt{20} \sec \theta, \sqrt{24} \tan \theta)\) and \((- \sqrt{20} \sec \theta, - \sqrt{24} \tan \theta)\), respectively.
   - Points \(B\) and \(D\) are \((\sqrt{20} \sec \phi, \sqrt{24} \tan \phi)\) and \((- \sqrt{20} \sec \phi, - \sqrt{24} \tan \phi)\), respectively.

2. **Condition for Perpendicular Diagonals**:
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \(\sin \theta \sin \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\).

3. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**:
   - Using the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\), we find \(BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2)\).
   - Substituting \(x_2 = \sqrt{20} \sec \phi\) and \(y_2 = \sqrt{24} \tan \phi\), we get:
     \[
     BD^2 = 80 + 176 \tan^2 \phi
     \]

4. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**:
   - Using the condition \(\sin \theta \sin \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\), we find that \(\sin^2 \phi \geq \frac{25}{36}\).
   - This leads to \(\tan^2 \phi \geq \frac{11}{25}\).
   - However, as \(\sin^2 \phi\) approaches 1 (though not attainable due to the hyperbola constraint), \(\tan^2 \phi\) approaches 0, making \(BD^2\) approach 80.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The infimum of \(BD^2\) is 80, but it is not achievable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{80}\).
