Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down step by step.

First, let's think about the properties of a rectangular box. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, z. The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by the formula S = 2(xy + yz + zx). The volume V is given by V = xyz. So in this case, S = 54 and V = 23.

So, I have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, which simplifies to xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Hence, the radius r is d/2, so r squared is (d²)/4, which is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize (x² + y² + z²)/4. To do this, I need to find the minimal value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume. 

Let me write down the constraints again:

1. xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

And I need to minimize x² + y² + z².

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that in calculus, we can use Lagrange multipliers to handle such problems. So, maybe I can set up a Lagrangian with two constraints.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way without using calculus, perhaps using inequalities?

Let me recall that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds: (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So, from this, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). 

We know that xy + yz + zx = 27, so x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. So, if I can find (x + y + z), then I can find x² + y² + z².

But how can I relate x + y + z to the given volume and surface area?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers since there are two constraints. Let me try that.

Let me consider the function to minimize, f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

The constraints are:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27,

h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23).

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0,

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27,

xyz = 23.

So, now I have five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

Looking at the partial derivatives, I can set up ratios to find relations between x, y, z.

Let me write the first three equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz) ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz) ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy) ...(3)

Hmm, since the equations are symmetric, maybe the minimal occurs when x = y = z? Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z = a, then the surface area would be 2(3a²) = 6a² = 54 → a² = 9 → a=3. Then, volume would be 3a³ = 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box can't be a cube. Hence, x, y, z are not all equal. So the symmetry isn't holding, so perhaps two variables are equal, and the third is different?

Let me assume that two variables are equal, say x = y, and z is different. Let me see if that's possible.

Set x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, the surface area:

xy + yz + zx = a² + 2ab = 27.

The volume:

a² b = 23.

I can express a² from the volume: a² = 23 / b.

Substitute into the surface area equation:

(23 / b) + 2ab = 27
