Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form of r squared, which is a fraction p/q, and then I have to find p + q.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I know that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's call them x, y, and z. So, the surface area (SA) of such a box is given by the formula 2(xy + xz + yz), and the volume (V) is xyz. The problem says that SA = 54 and V = 23.

So, we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54
2. xyz = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will depend on the dimensions of the box because the sphere has to contain the entire box. The sphere's center should be at the center of the box for the minimal case, I think. So, the radius would be half of the box's space diagonal.

Wait, the space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r squared is (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, our goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Hmm, so I need to minimize x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This looks like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some inequalities.

Let me think about the method of Lagrange multipliers. I need to set up the function to minimize, which is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², and the constraints are g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + xz + yz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, I need to solve the system where the gradients of f, g, and h are linearly dependent. That is, the gradient of f is equal to λ times the gradient of g plus μ times the gradient of h, for some λ and μ.

Let's compute the gradients.

Gradient of f: (2x, 2y, 2z)
Gradient of g: 2*(y + z, x + z, x + y)
Gradient of h: (yz, xz, xy)

So, the equations become:

2x = λ*2(y + z) + μ*yz
2y = λ*2(x + z) + μ*xz
2z = λ*2(x + y) + μ*xy

And the constraints:

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54
xyz = 23

Hmm, that's four equations with four variables: x, y, z, λ, μ. Wait, no, actually five variables but four equations. Wait, but we have the constraints as well, so maybe it's manageable.

Let me see if I can find some symmetry or ratio between x, y, z.

Suppose that x = y = z. Wait, but if all sides are equal, it's a cube. Let's check what that would imply.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, which is bigger than 23. So, it's not a cube. So, the minimal case is when two variables are equal or something? Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps x, y, z are in some proportion.

Another approach: Let me consider using the method of AM ≥ GM or other inequalities to relate the variables. Since we have two constraints, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx, and Q = xyz. So, from the problem, P = 54/2 = 27, and Q =23.

We need to find x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

So, our problem reduces to finding the minimal S², where S = x + y + z, given that P = 27 and Q = 23.

Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2P. So, since P is fixed at 27, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

So, the problem becomes: given that xy + yz + zx =27 and xyz=23, find the minimal possible value of (x + y + z)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can use some inequality here. Maybe the inequality between arithmetic mean and geometric mean, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I recall that for three variables, given their product and sum of products, the minimal sum can be found, but it's a bit tricky.

Let me consider that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds:

(x + y + z)^3 ≥ 27xyz

But here, xyz =23, so (x + y + z)^3 ≥ 27 * 23 = 621. So, x + y + z ≥ cube root of 621, which is approximately 8.5. But this is a lower bound, but I'm not sure if it's achievable given the other constraint P=27.

Wait, but the minimal S may not necessarily be the cube root of 27xyz, because P is fixed.

Alternatively, I can think of using Lagrange multipliers again, but maybe with more manageable variables.

Wait, let's think of this as a problem in symmetric variables. Maybe if I let x = y, then perhaps it'll reduce the problem to two variables.

Suppose x = y. Then, let's see. Then, surface area equation becomes 2(x² + 2xz) =54. So, x² + 2xz =27.

Volume is x² z =23.

So, from the volume, z = 23/(x²). Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27.

So, x² + (46)/x =27.

Multiply both sides by x: x^3 +46 =27x.

So, x^3 -27x +46=0.

Hmm, let's try to solve this cubic equation.

Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, that works. So, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (x-2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² +2x -23=0, which are x=(-2 ± sqrt(4 +92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4√6)/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since x is positive, x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898.

So, possible x when x=y are 2 or -1 +2√6.

Wait, so x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the dimensions would be 2,2,5.75.

Alternatively, when x= -1 +2√6, then z=23/(x²). Let me compute x squared.

x= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898.

x squared is ( -1 +2√6 )² =1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23 and 529: 529 is 23², so 23/529 =1/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, in this case, x=y= (-1 +2√6), z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, but is this the minimal S?

Wait, when x=y=2, z=5.75, S=2 +2 +5.75=9.75.

When x=y= (-1 +2√6)≈3.898, z≈(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, S≈3.898 +3.898 +1.513≈9.309.

So, this is smaller than 9.75. So, perhaps this is a lower S.

But wait, is this the minimal? Or is there a case when all three variables are distinct that gives a lower S? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for three variables.

So, going back to the Lagrange multiplier method, I have the system:

2x = λ*2(y + z) + μ*yz ...(1)

2y = λ*2(x + z) + μ*xz ...(2)

2z = λ*2(x + y) + μ*xy ...(3)

And constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx)=54 => xy + yz + zx=27 ...(4)

xyz=23 ...(5)

So, from equation (1): 2x = 2λ(y + z) + μ yz

Similarly, equations (2) and (3).

I can subtract equation (1) and (2) to eliminate λ and μ.

Equation (1) - equation (2):

2x - 2y = 2λ(y + z -x -z) + μ(yz -xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = 2λ(y - x) + μ z (y -x )

Factor out (x - y):

2(x - y) = (x - y)(-2λ + μ z )

If x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -2λ + μ z ...(6)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) - equation (3):

2y - 2z = 2λ(x + z -x -y) + μ(xz - xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z) = 2λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y)

Factor out (y - z):

2(y - z) = (z - y)(2λ - μ x )

Which is:

2(y - z) = -(y - z)(2λ - μ x )

If y ≠ z, divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = - (2λ - μ x )

So,

2 = -2λ + μ x ...(7)

So now, from equation (6): 2 = -2λ + μ z

From equation (7): 2= -2λ + μ x

Subtracting (6) - (7):

0= ( -2λ + μ z ) - ( -2λ + μ x )= μ(z -x )

So, either μ=0 or z=x.

Case 1: μ=0.

If μ=0, then from equation (6): 2= -2λ.

So, λ= -1.

Plugging into equation (1): 2x =2*(-1)*(y + z) +0

So, 2x = -2(y + z)

=> x = -(y + z)

But x, y, z are positive real numbers, so x = -(y + z) is impossible. Therefore, μ cannot be zero.

Case 2: z =x.

If z =x, then from equation (6): 2= -2λ + μ z. Similarly, equation (7): 2= -2λ + μ x. But x=z, so both equations are same.

So, now, with z=x, let's go back to the constraints.

So, from constraint (4): xy + xz + yz=27.

Since z =x, this becomes xy +x² + yx=27 => 2xy +x²=27.

From constraint (5): xyz=23 => x * y * x =x² y=23 => y=23/(x²).

Substitute into the surface area equation:

2*(23/(x²))*x +x²=27.

Simplify:

2*(23/x) +x²=27.

Which is 46/x +x²=27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x² x +46=27x =>x^3 -27x +46=0.

Wait, this is the same cubic equation as before when we assumed x=y. So, as before, x=2 is a root.

So, when x=2, z=2, y=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

Therefore, the minimal S in this case is S=2+2+5.75=9.75=39/4.

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed x=y= -1 +2√6 and z=(25+4√6)/23, the sum S≈9.309, which is less than 9.75. So, perhaps this is the minimal?

Wait, but in that case, we had x=y≈3.898, which is greater than z≈1.513. So, in this case, z is different from x and y.

But in the Lagrange multiplier method, we arrived at a case where z=x.

So, perhaps that is a critical point, but maybe not the minimal one. Because when I assumed x=y, we got another critical point with lower S.

Wait, but if in the Lagrange multiplier method, I assumed that x ≠ y, then I found that z=x.

So, perhaps when x=z, but y is different.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but the third is different.

Wait, but when I assumed x=y, I found another critical point.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities: either two variables are equal, or all three are different.

So, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, so x=y, so that's why when I did that, I got a lower S.

So, perhaps the minimal S is when x=y, which gives S≈9.309, which is less than 9.75.

But how do I know that's the minimal?

Alternatively, perhaps I should explore both cases.

Case 1: x=y. Then, as above, we get x=2, z=5.75, S=9.75.

Case 2: x=y= a, z= b.

Wait, when I set x=y, I found that in that case, the minimal S is around 9.309.

Wait, but perhaps this is the minimal. So, perhaps this is the minimal S. So, then x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = (x + y + z)^2 -54.

So, if S is minimal, then x² + y² + z² is minimal.

So, if I can find S minimal, then I can find r^2.

Wait, but in the case where x=y= -1 +2√6, which is approximately 3.898, and z=(25 +4√6)/23≈1.513, the sum S≈9.309.

Is this the minimal?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find S in terms of variables.

Wait, another approach: since we have P=27 and Q=23, and looking for minimal S.

I can model this as a cubic equation whose roots are x, y, z.

Let me suppose that x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t^3 - St^2 + Pt - Q=0 => t^3 - S t^2 +27 t -23=0.

In order for the roots to be real and positive, the cubic must have three positive real roots.

So, for this to happen, the cubic must satisfy certain conditions.

But perhaps this is not the easiest path.

Alternatively, I can use the inequality that relates S, P, Q.

I know that for positive real numbers,

(x + y + z)^3 >= 27xyz,

which gives S^3 >=27*23=621,

so S >= cube_root(621)≈8.53.

But our S in case 2 is approximately 9.309, which is bigger than 8.53, so the lower bound is not tight.

Wait, but maybe another inequality.

Alternatively, I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the inequality between quadratic mean and arithmetic mean.

Wait, the quadratic mean (root mean square) of x, y, z is sqrt((x² + y² + z²)/3).

The arithmetic mean is S/3.

We know that quadratic mean >= arithmetic mean, so sqrt((x² + y² + z²)/3) >= S/3.

But x² + y² + z² = S² -54, so sqrt( (S² -54)/3 ) >= S/3.

Square both sides:

(S² -54)/3 >= S² /9

Multiply both sides by 9:

3(S² -54) >= S²

3S² -162 >= S²

2S² >=162

S² >=81

So, S >=9.

So, from this, S^2 >=81.

So, the minimal S^2 is 81, hence minimal x² + y² + z² is 81 -54=27.

Wait, but wait, 81-54=27? That would mean x² + y² + z²=27, which is minimal.

But does this hold?

Wait, if S^2 >=81, then S >=9, which would mean that x + y + z >=9.

But when I calculated in case 2, x + y + z≈9.309>9, so that's consistent.

So, the minimal S^2 is 81, which gives x² + y² + z²=27.

Wait, but is that achievable? Because when S=9, what is x² + y² + z²?

If S=9, then x² + y² + z²=81 - 54=27.

So, is there a box with x + y + z=9, xy + yz + zx=27, and xyz=23?

Wait, let's see, if x + y + z=9, xy + yz + zx=27, then x, y, z are the roots of the equation t^3 -9 t^2 +27 t -k=0, where k=xyz=23.

So, the equation is t^3 -9 t^2 +27 t -23=0.

We can check if this cubic has three positive real roots.

Compute the discriminant of the cubic: For a cubic t^3 + a t^2 + b t + c=0, the discriminant D=18abc -4a^3 c +a² b² -4b^3 -27c².

Wait, in our case, a= -9, b=27, c= -23.

So,

D=18*(-9)(27)(-23) -4*(-9)^3*(-23) + (-9)^2*(27)^2 -4*(27)^3 -27*(-23)^2.

Let me compute each term:

First term: 18*(-9)(27)(-23)=18*9*27*23.

Compute 18*9=162; 162*27=4374; 4374*23= 4374*20=87480 +4374*3=13122 → total 87480+13122=100602.

Second term: -4*(-9)^3*(-23)= -4*(-729)*(-23)= -4*729*23.

Compute 4*729=2916; 2916*23= 2916*20=58320 +2916*3=8748 → total 58320+8748=67068.

So, second term is -67068.

Third term: (-9)^2*(27)^2=81*729=59049.

Fourth term: -4*(27)^3= -4*19683= -78732.

Fifth term: -27*(-23)^2= -27*529= -14283.

So, adding all terms:

100602 (first) -67068 (second) +59049 (third) -78732 (fourth) -14283 (fifth).

Compute step by step:

100602 -67068 =33534

33534 +59049=92583

92583 -78732=13851

13851 -14283= -432.

So, D= -432.

The discriminant D is negative, which implies that the cubic has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

But we need all roots to be real and positive, so this is not possible. Therefore, minimal S^2=81 is not achievable because the cubic would not have three real roots.

So, the minimal S must be greater than 9.

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² would be greater than 27.

So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as in the earlier case where x=y= -1 +2√6≈3.898, z=(25 +4√6)/23≈1.513.

So, x² + y² + z²≈ (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.513)^2≈ (15.19) + (15.19) + (2.29)≈32.67.

Wait, so r^2=(x² + y² + z²)/4≈32.67/4≈8.168.

But let's compute it exactly.

x= -1 +2√6, so x²= (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + z².

But z=(25 +4√6)/23, so z²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2.

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, z²=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Compute 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, add 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

To add these, convert 50 and -8√6 into fractions with denominator 529.

50 =50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So,

x² + y² + z²=26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine like terms:

(26450 +721)/529 + (-4232√6 +200√6)/529.

Compute:

26450 +721=27171.

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6).

So,

x² + y² + z²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

Factor out 1/529:

(27171 -4032√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Then, r^2=(x² + y² + z²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I can compute this fraction more simply.

Let me compute numerator:

27171 -4032√6.

But let me think, can I factor numerator and denominator?

Wait, let me compute:

27171 divided by 529.

Wait, 529 is 23². 23*23=529.

27171 ÷23: Let's compute 23*1181=23*(1200-19)=23*1200=27600; 27600 -23*19=27600 -437=27163.

Wait, 23*1181=27163, which is 8 less than 27171.

So, 27171=23*1181 +8.

Similarly, 4032 ÷23: 23*175=4025, so 4032=23*175 +7.

So, 27171 -4032√6=23*(1181) +8 -23*(175√6) -7√6.

Hmm, perhaps it's not helpful.

Wait, could there be a simpler expression?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, when x=y= (-1 + 2√6), which is approximately 3.898, then z=(25 +4√6)/23≈1.513.

So, let me compute x² + y² + z² exactly.

x²= (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

z²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²=2x² + z²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert to same denominator:

50 =50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So,

x² + y² + z²=26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine the fractions:

(26450 +721)=27171.

(-4232√6 +200√6)= (-4032√6).

So,

x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Now, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, is that reducible? Let's see.

Check if numerator and denominator have a common factor.

Denominator is 2116=4*529=4*23².

Numerator: 27171 -4032√6.

Is there a common factor?

Let me compute GCD of 27171 and 4032.

Compute GCD(27171, 4032).

Compute 27171 ÷4032=6, remainder 27171-6*4032=27171-24192=2979.

Now, GCD(4032,2979).

4032 ÷2979=1, remainder 4032-2979=1053.

GCD(2979,1053).

2979 ÷1053=2, remainder 2979-2106=873.

GCD(1053,873).

1053 ÷873=1, remainder 180.

GCD(873,180).

873 ÷180=4, remainder 873 -720=153.

GCD(180,153).

180 ÷153=1, remainder 27.

GCD(153,27)=27.

So, GCD is 27.

So, 27171 and 4032 have a GCD of 27.

Wait, but the numerator is 27171 -4032√6, which is not an integer, so perhaps we can't reduce the fraction.

Wait, but in the expression (27171 -4032√6)/2116, both numerator terms have a factor of 27?

Compute 27171 ÷27= 27171/27=1006.333... nope, 27*1006=27162, 27171-27162=9, so 1006 +9/27=1006.333. Not integer.

Similarly, 4032 ÷27=149.333... So, perhaps it doesn't help.

Thus, the fraction (27171 -4032√6)/2116 is in simplest terms.

But wait, the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers. But in this case, r² is (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which is not a rational number because of the √6 term.

Wait, that can't be. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, going back, perhaps the minimal occurs when x, y, z are all equal?

But when x=y=z, the volume is x³=23, so x=∛23≈2.84, and surface area is6x²=6*(∛23)^2≈6*(8.07)=48.42, which is less than 54. So, not satisfying the surface area condition.

Wait, so we can't have a cube in this case.

Wait, so perhaps I have to go back to the Lagrange multipliers.

Earlier, I considered that either two variables are equal or variables are all different.

In the case when two variables are equal, I got a feasible solution with S≈9.309, but when I tried to assume all variables are different, it leads to the cubic with one real root, meaning it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different, as we found earlier.

Therefore, in that case, r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4=(25 -4√6)*2 + z², where z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

x= -1 + 2√6, so x²=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

z=(25 +4√6)/23, so z²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2=(625 + 200√6 + 96)/529=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this as fractions:

2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Convert -8√6 to -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So,

x² + y² + z²=26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine like terms:

(26450 +721) =27171.

(-4232√6 +200√6)= (-4032√6).

So,

x² + y² + z²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

This seems correct. But then, r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this is not a rational number because of the √6 term. So, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the minimal sphere is when the box is axis-aligned, but the minimal enclosing sphere may not necessarily be centered at the box's center? Or is it?

Wait, the minimal enclosing sphere for a box should be centered at the box's center, because any other center would require a larger radius to reach the farthest corners.

So, that's correct. Therefore, the radius is half the space diagonal.

So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4 is correct, but in this case, it's (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this is not a rational number, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says "the value of r² can be written as p/q where p and q are relatively prime positive integers."

So, r² must be a rational number.

Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong.

Hmm, so where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Lagrange multiplier approach. Let me try another method.

Let me consider that for a given surface area and volume, the minimal enclosing sphere is determined by the space diagonal.

So, our goal is to minimize the space diagonal sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given the constraints.

So, to minimize sqrt(x² + y² + z²), we need to minimize x² + y² + z².

We can set up the problem using Lagrange multipliers, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach.

Let me consider using the method of substitution.

We have:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) =54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx=27.

2. xyz=23.

We can express one variable in terms of the others.

Let me solve for z from equation 2: z=23/(xy).

Plug into equation 1:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))=27.

Simplify:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y)=27.

Let me set u =x + y, v=xy.

Then, equation becomes:

v +23/x +23/y =27.

But 23/x +23/y=23*(x + y)/(xy)=23u/v.

So, equation becomes:

v +23u/v=27.

Multiply both sides by v:

v² +23u=27v.

Rearranged:

v² -27v +23u=0.

But we have another relation between u and v: u² =x² + 2xy + y² ⇒ x² + y² =u² -2v.

And x² + y² + z²= u² -2v + z².

But z=23/(xy)=23/v.

So, z²= (23)^2 /v²=529/v².

Thus, x² + y² + z²= u² -2v +529/v².

So, our function to minimize is f(u, v)= u² -2v +529/v², subject to the constraint v² -27v +23u=0.

From the constraint, we can express u in terms of v:

v² -27v +23u=0 ⇒23u=27v -v² ⇒u=(27v -v²)/23.

So, substitute u into f(u, v):

f(v)= [(27v -v²)/23]^2 -2v +529/v².

Let me compute this.

First, compute [(27v -v²)/23]^2:

= (27v -v²)^2 / (23)^2
= (729v² -54v^3 +v^4)/529.

Then, -2v.

Then, +529/v².

So,

f(v)= (v^4 -54v^3 +729v²)/529 -2v +529/v².

Combine terms:

f(v)= (v^4 -54v^3 +729v²)/529 -2v +529/v².

To find the minimum, take derivative of f(v) with respect to v and set to zero.

This seems quite involved, but let's proceed.

Compute f'(v):

f'(v)= [4v^3 -162v² +1458v]/529 -2 - (2*529)/(v^3).

Set f'(v)=0:

[4v^3 -162v² +1458v]/529 -2 - (1058)/v^3=0.

Multiply both sides by 529 v^3 to eliminate denominators:

v^3*(4v^3 -162v² +1458v) -2*529 v^3 -1058*529=0.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach is not the best.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x=y=z, but earlier that didn't satisfy the surface area condition.

Wait, perhaps another approach: I can use the inequality that for positive real numbers,

x² + y² + z² >= (xy + yz + zx).

Which in this case, x² + y² + z² >=27.

But we know that the minimal x² + y² + z² is 27 when x=y=z, but that doesn't satisfy the surface area condition, which would require x=y=z=3, but volume would be 27, not 23.

So, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² is greater than 27.

Wait, but in the case where x=y=2 and z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=4+4+33.0625=41.0625. So, 41.0625>27.

In the other case, x=y≈3.898, z≈1.513, so x²+y²+z²≈15.19+15.19+2.29≈32.67>27.

But both are greater than 27. So, perhaps the minimal is 32.67, but let's see.

Wait, but how do we know that 32.67 is indeed the minimal?

Wait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution again.

Let me consider that when x=y, we derived a cubic equation for x, which gave us x=2 and x= -1 +2√6.

But x=2 gives a higher S, so the minimal is when x=y= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, perhaps this is indeed the minimal.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the cubic equation t^3 -9 t^2 +27 t -23=0, which would have given S=9, but it had only one real root, so perhaps the minimal S occurs at x=y= -1 +2√6, giving S≈9.309.

So, perhaps that is the minimal, and thus, r²=(x² + y² + z²)/4≈32.67/4≈8.168.

But since the problem says r² can be written as p/q, which is a rational number, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong because I assumed two variables are equal, but perhaps the minimal is when all variables are different, leading to a rational r².

Wait, perhaps I should try setting t = x + y + z, and find minimal t.

But I don't see an easy way.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the minimal occurs when the box is a cube, but as we saw earlier, that's not possible because the surface area would be 6x²=54 =>x=3, but the volume would be 27≠23.

So, it's not a cube.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different, as we've already considered.

But then, we get r²=(27171 -4032√6)/2116≈8.168, which is not rational.

Hmm, but the problem states that r² is a rational number, so perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is such that x² + y² + z² is rational.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, when I set x=y, I got x=2 and x=-1 +2√6.

So, for x=2, z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(4) + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625= 41.0625=657/16.

So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, 657/64 can be reduced?

657 divided by 64: 64*10=640, so 657-640=17. So, 657=64*10 +17.

17 and 64 are coprime, so 657/64 is reduced.

So, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x=y= -1 +2√6, I thought x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529≈32.67, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, but when x=2, z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

Wait, that's a rational number. So, perhaps this is the minimal.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when x=y= -1 +2√6, I get a lower x² + y² + z², but that must have been a mistake.

Wait, because when I set x=y, I get two solutions: x=2 and x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

But when x=2, the x² + y² + z²=41.0625=657/16, and when x= -1 +2√6, then x² + y² + z²≈32.67.

But when I tried to compute the cubic equation with S=9, it didn't have three real roots. So, perhaps the minimal S is 9.309, but maybe it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when x=y=2, and thus r²=657/64, which is 657/64.

So, p=657, q=64, which are coprime, so p+q=657+64=721.

But I need to confirm whether x=y=2 gives the minimal x² + y² + z².

Wait, because when I computed with x=y= -1 +2√6, I get a lower x² + y² + z², but that leads to an irrational r².

But the problem states that r² is rational, so perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y=2, leading to r²=657/64.

Alternatively, perhaps my earlier assumption that x=y= -1 +2√6 gives a lower x² + y² + z² is incorrect because it doesn't satisfy the sphere condition.

Wait, but why would that be? I think the problem is that when I considered x=y= -1 +2√6, the sphere's radius is indeed that value, but the problem states that the sphere must contain all boxes in set B, so perhaps the minimal r is the maximum of all possible r for boxes in B, not the minimal.

Wait, wait, no. The problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B."

So, it's the minimal r such that every box in B can fit inside a sphere of radius r.

So, we need the maximal minimal r over all boxes in B.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because for each box, the minimal enclosing sphere has a certain radius, and we need the smallest r that is larger than or equal to all those radii.

So, r is the supremum of all minimal enclosing sphere radii for boxes in B.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal r is achieved when x² + y² + z² is maximized, given the constraints.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for each box, the enclosing sphere's radius depends on its space diagonal. So, to find the minimal r that can contain all boxes, we need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then r is half of that.

Therefore, our goal is to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²), given the constraints 2(xy + xz + yz)=54 and xyz=23.

So, we need to maximize x² + y² + z², not minimize it.

Wait, that changes everything.

Oh no! I think I misunderstood the problem.

So, the sphere must contain every box in B, so the radius must be at least as large as the maximal space diagonal of any box in B. So, r is half of the maximal space diagonal.

Therefore, to find r, we need to find the maximum of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in B, then r is that value divided by 2.

So, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + xz + yz)=54 and xyz=23.

So, my earlier approach was incorrect because I was trying to minimize x² + y² + z², but actually, I need to maximize it.

Therefore, let's correct that.

So, now, to find the maximum of x² + y² + z², given that 2(xy + xz + yz)=54 and xyz=23.

Again, we can use Lagrange multipliers.

We need to maximize f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z², subject to g(x,y,z)=2(xy + xz + yz) -54=0 and h(x,y,z)=xyz -23=0.

So, the gradients:

∇f=(2x, 2y, 2z)

∇g=2(y + z, x + z, x + y)

∇h=(yz, xz, xy)

So, Lagrange conditions:

∇f=λ∇g + μ∇h

Which gives:

2x=λ*2(y + z) + μ*yz ...(1)

2y=λ*2(x + z) + μ*xz ...(2)

2z=λ*2(x + y) + μ*xy ...(3)

Plus the constraints:

2(xy + xz + yz)=54 ...(4)

xyz=23 ...(5)

So, similar to before.

Let me subtract equation (1) - equation (2):

2x -2y=2λ(y + z -x -z) + μ(yz -xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y)=2λ(y -x) + μ z (y -x )

Factor:

2(x - y)=(x - y)(-2λ + μ z )

If x ≠ y, divide both sides:

2= -2λ + μ z ...(6)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) - equation (3):

2y -2z=2λ(x + z -x -y) + μ(xz -xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z)=2λ(z - y) + μ x (z - y )

Factor:

2(y - z)= (z - y)(2λ - μ x )

Which is:

2(y - z)= -(y - z)(2λ - μ x )

If y≠z, divide both sides:

2= - (2λ - μ x )

So,

2= -2λ + μ x ...(7)

Now, from equation (6): 2= -2λ + μ z

From equation (7):2= -2λ + μ x

Subtract (6)-(7):

0= μ(z -x )

So, either μ=0 or z=x.

Case 1: μ=0.

If μ=0, then from equation (6):2= -2λ. So, λ= -1.

Plugging into equation (1):2x=2*(-1)*(y + z) +0 → 2x= -2(y + z) →x= -(y + z).

But x, y, z are positive, so x= -(y +z) is impossible. So, μ≠0.

Case 2: z=x.

So, z=x.

Now, with z=x, let's use the constraints.

From equation (4):2(xy + xz + yz)=54 →2(x y +x² + y x)=54 →2(2x y +x²)=54 →2x y +x²=27.

From equation (5):x y z=23 →x y x= x² y=23 → y=23/(x²).

Substitute into 2x y +x²=27:

2x*(23/(x²)) +x²=27 →46/x +x²=27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x² x +46=27x →x³ -27x +46=0.

We saw this equation earlier. The roots are x=2, and x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 + 92))/2=(-2 ±sqrt(96))/2=(-2 ±4√6)/2=-1 ±2√6.

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, x= -1 +2√6, z=x, y=23/x².

Compute y:

x= -1 +2√6, x²=25 -4√6.

So, y=23/(25 -4√6).

Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

y=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify:

23/529=1/23, so y=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, the dimensions are x= -1 +2√6, y=(25 +4√6)/23, z= -1 +2√6.

Now, compute x² + y² + z²:

x²=25 -4√6,

z²=25 -4√6,

y²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2=(625 +200√6 +96)/529=(721 +200√6)/529.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert to same denominator:

2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6=50*529/529 -8√6*529/529=26450/529 -4232√6/529.

So,

x² + y² + z²=26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529.

Combine like terms:

(26450 +721)=27171,

(-4232√6 +200√6)= -4032√6.

Thus,

x² + y² + z²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

But this is the same result as before. So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

But this is an irrational number, which can't be expressed as p/q. But the problem states that r² is rational. Therefore, this suggests that the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs at another point where r² is rational.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs when x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

In that case, x² + y² + z²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Which is a rational number.

So, perhaps this is the maximum.

Wait, but why would that be the case?

Because when x=2, y=2, z=23/4=5.75, these are integer-like values, leading to a rational x² + y² + z².

But when x= -1 +2√6, which is irrational, the x² + y² + z² is irrational, which doesn't fit the problem's requirement.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, achieved when x=y=2, z=23/4.

So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Thus, p=657, q=64, which are coprime because 657=3*219=3*3*73, and 64=2^6, so no common factors.

Therefore, p+q=657+64=721.

Thus, the answer is 721.


To find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23, we need to determine the maximum space diagonal of such boxes. The radius \( r \) is half of this maximum space diagonal, and \( r^2 \) will be the square of this value.

Given a rectangular box with dimensions \( x, y, z \), the constraints are:
1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 \) ⟹ \( xy + xz + yz = 27 \)
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \)

The space diagonal of the box is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \), so \( r = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2} \).

To maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), we consider different cases. When \( x = y = 2 \) and \( z = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \), we find:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \).

Since 657 and 64 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form. Therefore, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
