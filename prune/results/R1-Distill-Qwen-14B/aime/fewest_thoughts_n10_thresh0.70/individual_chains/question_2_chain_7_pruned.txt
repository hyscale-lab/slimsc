Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The points A and B form a segment AB, and we're supposed to find a point C on AB that isn't covered by any other segment from this family F except for AB itself. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. 

First, I should probably find the equation for all such segments PQ in family F. Since PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) and has length 1, we can write the equation of this line. Also, since the length is 1, we can relate p and q.

The length of PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So, for any segment in F, the point (p,0) and (0,q) satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Now, the equation of the line PQ. The line connecting (p,0) to (0,q) can be written in intercept form as x/p + y/q = 1. Alternatively, the standard linear equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So, for any p and q with p² + q² = 1, we have a line in F. 

The problem says that point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is a segment in F? Let me check: points A are (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB.

Length AB = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F since it has length 1.

So, the family F includes all such segments, each from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1. The point C is on AB such that it isn't covered by any other segment in F except AB. So, to find such a point, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F? Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe C is the point where AB touches the envelope of all the other segments in F. Because the envelope would represent the boundary of all these segments, and the point where AB is tangent to this envelope would be the unique point not covered by other segments.

Hmm, I think the envelope approach is the way to go. So, how do I find the envelope of the family of lines F?

Each line in F is given by x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

The envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by F(p,q) = 0 and dF/dλ = 0, where λ is a parameter. But here, the lines are parameterized by p and q, which are related by p² + q² = 1.

Alternatively, I can write the line equation in terms of a single parameter. Let me consider using an angle parameter since p² + q² = 1 suggests a unit circle.

Let me set p = cosθ and q = sinθ, where θ is between 0 and π/2 because we're in the first quadrant. Then, the equation of the line becomes x
