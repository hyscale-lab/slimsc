Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

In triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. The circumradius R is given as 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, so the radius of the inscribed circle is 6.

The problem mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI. That seems important. I think this might relate some lengths in the triangle, perhaps using coordinates or vector methods, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the properties of the incenter and circumcenter. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and it's equidistant from all sides. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's equidistant from all vertices, which is the circumradius R.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Yes, I think that's the formula. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). So plugging in R=13 and r=6:

OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13

So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.

But how does IA being perpendicular to OI help? Let's see. Maybe I can use coordinates or some other relationships.

Let me try to visualize the triangle. Let's place point I somewhere inside the triangle, and O another point. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the line from I to A is at a right angle to the line from O to I
