Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stops. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, let me parse the problem. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The problem gives me the total time for each walking speed, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including the t minutes.

Alright, let's break it down. The key information is:

1. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at speed s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including t minutes.

I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Hmm, so first, I can set up equations for each scenario. Since both scenarios include the same coffee shop time t, but the walking time will be different because her speed changes.

Wait, but waitâ€”the total time includes the walking time plus t minutes. So I can write equations for both cases.

Let me denote:
- Walking time as T_w
- Total time as T_total = T_w + t

But wait, the problem states that when she walks at speed s, T_total is 4 hours, and when she walks at s+2, T_total is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

So, for the first case:
Walking speed = s km/h
Distance = 9 km
Walking time = T_w1 = 9 / s hours
Total time T_total1 = T_w1 + t = 4 hours

Second case:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Walking time = T_w2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours
Total time T_total2 = T_w2 + t = 2 hours 24 minutes

Wait, I should convert the times into the same units. Let's convert everything into hours because her speed is in km per hour.

So, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24
