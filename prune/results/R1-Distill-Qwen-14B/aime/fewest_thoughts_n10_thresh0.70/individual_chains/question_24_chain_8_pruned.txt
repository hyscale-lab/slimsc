Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a list of positive integers with certain properties, and we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's list out the given conditions:

1. The sum of all items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each condition and how it affects the structure of the list.

Starting with the mode. The mode is the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

Next, the sum is 30. So, the average is 30 divided by the number of elements in the list. Wait, but we don't know how many elements there are. That's something we'll need to figure out. Let's denote the number of elements as n. So, n must be such that the average is 30/n, but we don't know n yet.

The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting. The median depends on whether n is odd or even. If n is odd, the median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is an integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, for the median to be an integer and not appear in the list, n must be even. Because if n were odd, the median would be one of the numbers in the list, right? So, n must be even. Let me confirm that: yes, because for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. So, to have a median not in the list, n must be even. Thus, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, and that average is an integer not present in the list.

So, n is even. Let's denote n as 2k, where k is an integer. So, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers in the ordered list. And that median is an integer, say m, which is not in the list.

So, m is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, where a_k and a_{k+1} are the two middle numbers. Since m is an integer, a_k + a_{k+1} must be even, meaning a_k and a_{k+1} are both even or both odd. Also, m is not in the list.

Now, let's think about the mode. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, other numbers can
