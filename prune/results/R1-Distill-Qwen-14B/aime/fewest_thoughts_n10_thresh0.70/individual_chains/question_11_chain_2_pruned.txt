Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First off, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write z as a + bi, but since it's on the circle of radius 4, maybe using polar form might be more convenient here.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since |z|=4 implies 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting into the expression, we have:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}
= 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}
= [4*75 + 4*117i] * e^{iθ}
= (300 + 468i) * e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}
= (96/4 + 144/4 i) * e^{-iθ}
= (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}

So, the entire expression becomes:
(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.

So, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}

I remember that for a complex number X = x + yi, X e^{iθ} + Y e^{-iθ} can be expressed in terms of real and imaginary parts. Maybe I can expand each term using Euler's formula.

Let me write e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding A e^{iθ}:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ
Because i^2 = -1.

Similarly, expanding B e^{-iθ}:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (36 cosθ -24 sinθ)i + 36 sinθ
Again, since i^2 = -1.

Now, let's combine both expansions.

First, the real parts:
From A e^{iθ}: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
From B e^{-iθ}: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Total real part: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
From A e^{iθ}: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ
From B e^{-iθ}: 36 cosθ -24 sinθ
Total imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (36 cosθ -24 sinθ)
= (300 sinθ -24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ +36 cosθ)
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can focus on the real part, which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. So, we need to maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that an expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and tanφ = b/a or something like that. Wait, actually, let me think.

Alternatively, the maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, in this case, the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. The maximum of a cosθ + b sinθ is indeed sqrt(a² + b²). So, yes, that's the case here.

So, compute sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324^2: Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000. 24^2 is 576. Then, 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's see. 400^2 is 160,000. 32^2 is 1,024. 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2= 400² + 2*400*32 +32²=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, 324² + 432²=104,976 +186,624=291,600.

sqrt(291,600)= Let's compute that. 540^2=291,600 because 500²=250,000, 50²=2,500, 40²=1,600. 540^2 = (500 +40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So, sqrt(291,600)=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the squares.

324^2: 324 *324. Let me compute 300*300=90,000, 300*24=7,200, 24*300=7,200, 24*24=576. So, (300+24)^2=300² + 2*300*24 +24²=90,000+14,400+576=104,976
