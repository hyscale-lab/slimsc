Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. I need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The key conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, the placement is maximal in the sense that you can't add any more chips without breaking the first two rules.

I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this. So, each row and each column must be uniform in color if there are any chips in them. But wait, no, actually, the condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, not necessarily that if a row has chips, they must all be of the same color. Wait, no, actually, the first condition says all chips in the same row have the same color. So, for any row, if there are any chips, they must all be the same color—either all white or all black. Similarly for each column.

So, for each row, either it's completely empty, or all its chips are white, or all are black. The same goes for each column.

Moreover, the placement is maximal, so you can't add any more chips without violating the first two conditions. That means that for every empty cell, adding a chip there would force either a row or a column to have mixed colors or exceed one chip per cell.

Wait, but since each cell can have at most one chip, the only constraint for the maximal condition is that you can't add a chip to a cell without violating the uniformity of its row or column.

So, for example, if a cell is in an all-white row and an all-white column, but the cell is empty, then you could place a black or white chip there without violating the row or column conditions. But since the placement is maximal, that cell must already be filled—because otherwise, you could add a chip, which would violate the maximal condition.

Wait, no. If the row is all
