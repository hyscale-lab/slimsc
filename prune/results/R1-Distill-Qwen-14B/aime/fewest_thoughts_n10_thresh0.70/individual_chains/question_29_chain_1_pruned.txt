Okay, so I’ve got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, rectangles have all right angles, and opposite sides equal. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. That makes CD = AB = 107, and DA = BC = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF is 184, FG is 17, so GH = EF = 184, and FG = 17.

Wait, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So if I imagine these points lying on a straight line, in the order D-E-C-F or maybe another order? Hmm, let me think. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are at right angles.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be useful because cyclic quadrilaterals have properties like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or the power of a point, etc.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let's say rectangle ABCD is placed such that AB is the base, horizontal, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, D is the top left corner. Then, rectangle EFGH could be adjacent or connected in some way.

But since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps E is somewhere along DC extended, and F is another extension? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C?

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points to make it more concrete. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let’s place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16, then points:

- D is at (0,0)
- C is at (107,0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107.
- B is at (107,16)
- A is at (0,16)

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is the length from A to B, which should be 107, and BC is from B to C, 16. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then B would be at (107,0), C at (1
