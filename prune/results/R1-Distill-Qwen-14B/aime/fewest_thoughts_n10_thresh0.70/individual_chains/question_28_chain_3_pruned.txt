Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in a symmetric way: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m√n / p, and then sum m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume given these edge lengths? I think I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant for that. The formula for the volume V is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

CM = determinant of the matrix:
[ 0   1      1      1      1     ]
[ 1   0    AB²   AC²   AD²  ]
[ 1  AB²   0     BC²   BD²  ]
[ 1  AC²  BC²   0     CD²  ]
[ 1  AD²  BD²   CD²   0     ]

But wait, the given edge lengths are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. Let me square them: AB²=41, CD²=41; AC²=80, BD²=80; BC²=89, AD²=89.

So the CM matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that right? Let me check:

For the Cayley-Menger matrix, it's a 5x5 matrix. The first row and first column are 0,1,1,1,1, and then the other entries are the squares of the edges. So for the (1,2) entry, it's AB², which is 41.

But wait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the rows
