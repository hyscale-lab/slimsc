Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m for which m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some number of the form n^4 + 1. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m that satisfies m^4 ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes p, if p divides n^4 +1, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8. Since p is prime, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1, so 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but that's just for primes where p divides n^4 +1. But here, we need p² dividing n^4 +1. So, it's a bit more involved.

I think primes for which -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². But maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, let's consider small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that p² divides some n^4 +1.

Let me list primes and check:

Start with p=2. Let's see, check if 2² divides n^4 +1 for some n. Let's compute n^4 +1 mod 4.

n can be 0,1,2,3 mod4.

0^4=0, 0+1=1 mod4 → 1 mod4 which isn't 0.

1^4=1, 1+1=2 mod4 → 2 mod4, not 0.

2^4=16, 16+1=17 → 1 mod4, not 0.

3^4=81, 81+1=82 → 2 mod4, not 0.

So 2² doesn't divide any n^4 +1. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is 3.

Check if 3² divides any n^4 +1.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=0,1,2,...,8.

n=0: 0+1=1 mod9

n=1: 1+1=2 mod9

n=2: 16+1=17 mod9 is 8

n=3: 81+1=82 mod9: 82/9=9*9=81, 82-81=1 →1

n=4: 4^4=256, 256 mod9: 256 /9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4+1=5 mod9

n=5: 5^4=625, 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4 →4+1=5 mod9

n=6: 6^4=1296, 1296 mod9 is 0, so 0+1=1 mod9

n=7: 7^4=2401, 2401 mod9: Let's see 2+4+0+1=7, which is congruent to 7 mod9. So 7+1=8 mod9.

n=8: 8^4=4096, 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10→1, so 1+1=2 mod9.

So all residues: 1,2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2. None are 0 mod9. So 3² doesn't divide any n^4 +1. So p=3 is out.

Next prime is 5.

Check if 5²=25 divides any n^4 +1.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n from 0 to 24.

But that's a lot, maybe find a pattern or properties.

Alternatively, n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

So we can look for n such that n^8 ≡1 mod25, since
