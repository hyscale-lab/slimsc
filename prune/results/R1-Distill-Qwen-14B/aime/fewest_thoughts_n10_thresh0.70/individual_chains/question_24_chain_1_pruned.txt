Okay, so I have this math problem here about a list of positive integers. Let me try to parse through the requirements step by step. 

First, the sum of all the items in the list is 30. Got that. So whatever numbers are in there, when I add them all up, it should equal 30. 

Next, the unique mode is 9. Hmm, mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. And it's unique, meaning no other number shares that highest frequency. So other numbers can appear, but not as much as 9. 

The third point is that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Wait, the median is a number that's actually not in the list? That's interesting. So the median would be the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order, but that value isn't present in the list itself. 

Okay, so let's break this down. I'll need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all three conditions. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably figure out how many numbers are in the list. The problem doesn't specify, so the length of the list could vary. But given that the median is a positive integer not in the list, the number of elements must be even or odd? Let's think.

Wait, the median depends on whether the number of elements is odd or even. If there's an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So if the number of elements is even, the median is the average of two middle numbers. For it to be an integer, those two middle numbers must add up to an even number. Or wait, actually, the median could be a non-integer if they don't add up to even, but since the problem states it's a positive integer, that implies that either the list has an odd number of elements, making the median an existing element, or the list has an even number of elements but the two middle numbers add up to an even number, making the median an integer. But the median doesn't appear in the list. 

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements
