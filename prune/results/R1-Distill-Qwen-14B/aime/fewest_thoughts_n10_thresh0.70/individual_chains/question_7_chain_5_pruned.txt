Alright, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. The problem says that each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability, and we want to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each of its eight vertices is colored either red or blue, each color having a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's some rotation (i.e., a rotation by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) such that after rotating, every blue vertex is now where a red vertex was before the rotation. So, essentially, we're looking for colorings where the set of blue vertices can be mapped exactly onto the set of red vertices via some rotation.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think of it this way: if I have a coloring where the blue vertices can be rotated to the red vertices, then the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, rotations can permute the vertices in different ways.

But wait, each vertex is either red or blue. So, the total number of red and blue vertices could vary from 0 to 8. But in our case, since the octagon is being rotated, the number of blue and red vertices must be the same. Because if you have, say, 3 blue vertices, rotating them would still give 3 blue vertices, so the number of reds would have to be 3 as well. So, the number of blue and red vertices must be equal. Therefore, the total number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, which is 4 each. So, the problem reduces to colorings where exactly 4 vertices are red and 4 are blue, and the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If the number of blue and red vertices must be equal because of the rotation, that is, if we can rotate the blue set to coincide with the red set, then yes, the count must be equal. So, the problem is actually only considering colorings where exactly 4 are red and 4 are blue. So, the total number of such colorings is C(8,4) = 70. So, our sample space is 70 colorings, each with equal probability.

But wait, the problem states that each vertex is colored independently with equal probability. So, the total number of colorings is 256, but the number of colorings that have exactly 4 red and 4 blue is 70. So, maybe our favorable cases are within these 70 colorings. But no, actually, the problem is asking for the probability over all colorings, but only those colorings where the condition holds. So, in the total of 256 colorings, how many satisfy that there exists a rotation such that blue moves to red. So, maybe the count is more than just colorings with 4 red and 4 blue.

Wait, no. Because if the number of blue and red vertices is unequal, say 5 red and 3 blue, then you cannot rotate blue to red because you can't have 3 blue mapping to 5 red. So, only colorings where the number of blue and red vertices are equal can satisfy the condition. Therefore, the probability we are to calculate is equal to (number of such colorings with 4 blue and 4 red, where the blue set is a rotation of the red set) divided by total colorings (256). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier; the problem is not restricted to colorings with exactly 4 red and 4 blue. But wait, perhaps it's only possible if the number of blue and red vertices are equal. So, maybe the answer is 0 for colorings where the number of blue and red are unequal. Let me think.

Suppose we have k blue vertices. Then, after rotation, the same number of vertices (k) must be red. So, if the number of blue vertices is k, then the number of red must also be k. Therefore, only colorings where the number of blue equals the number of red can satisfy the condition. Therefore, the probability is 0 for colorings where k ≠ 4. Thus, the probability is (number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red, satisfying the condition) divided by 256.

So, the total number of colorings is 256. The total number of colorings with 4 blue and 4 red is C(8,4)=70. So, perhaps the numerator is a subset of these 70.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of 4-colorings (4 blue, 4 red) such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But how do we count the number of such colorings?

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of group actions. Since we're dealing with rotations, which form a cyclic group of order 8. Maybe Burnside's lemma can be applied here.

Wait, Burnside's lemma is used to count orbits, but perhaps here we need to count the number of colorings fixed by some group action.

Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating.
