Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

First, I should recall what roots of unity are. ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. That also means the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Hmm, that might come in handy later.

The expression I need to compute is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out as:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I wonder if I can simplify this expression somehow. Maybe factor it or find a pattern.

Looking at each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me rearrange it:

2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor out something else. Let me see if I can write it as a quadratic in ω^k.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten as:

ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2

Which looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote z = ω^k for a moment. Then each term is z² - 2z + 2.

So, each term is z² - 2z + 2, where z is a 13th root of unity.

Now, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z² - 2z + 2), where z = ω^k.

But since ω^k cycles through all 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, the product is actually the product of (z² - 2z + 2) as z runs through all 13th roots of unity.

Wait a second! That sounds like evaluating a polynomial at specific points. I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - z) for all z being roots of unity is related to the cyclotomic polynomial.

But in this case, we have a quadratic in z. So, maybe the product can be related to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Let me think: if I have a polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product ∏_{z^13=1} P(z) would be the product of P(z) over all 13th roots of unity z.

I remember that the product of (x - z) over all z being roots of unity is x^{n} - 1, but that's when the roots are of the equation x^n = 1. But here, we have a different polynomial.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that if f(z) is a polynomial, then the product of f(z) over all roots z of unity is related to the resultant or something else? Or maybe using complex conjugates?

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the product over all roots z of P(z) is equal to the resultant of P(z) and z^{13} - 1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express this product in terms of the values of a certain polynomial evaluated at specific points.

Wait, another approach: since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including z=1, but in our case, ω ≠ 1, but k goes from 0 to 12, so when k=0, ω^0=1, so z=1 is included.

Wait, but in our problem, ω ≠ 1 is given, but the product is from k=0 to 12, so does that mean that when k=0, ω^0=1, which is excluded? Wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, so perhaps the product is over k=1 to 12, not 0 to 12. Wait, let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12. So, when k=0, ω^0=1, so that term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^{2} = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So maybe I can factor out the k=0 term, but it's 1, so it doesn't change the product. So the product is from k=0 to 12, but the k=0 term is 1, so the product is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the product over all z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2). Including z=1.

So, if I let P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product would be the product of P(z) as z ranges over all 13th roots of unity.

But I remember that for a polynomial f(z), the product of f(z) over all roots z of unity is equal to the resultant of f(z) and z^n -1, or something along those lines.

Alternatively, I can use logarithms to turn the product into a sum, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another idea: Since P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, which factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), because the roots are 1 ± i.

So, P(z) = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Therefore, the product over all 13th roots of unity z of P(z) is the product over z of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to the product over z of (z - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over z of (z - (1 - i)).

But the product over all z of (z - a) is equal to Φ_n(a), where Φ_n is the nth cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a, but wait, actually, it's equal to (a^{13} - 1)/(a - 1), but that's when a is not a root of unity.

Wait, no, hold on. Let me think. For a primitive nth root of unity ω, the minimal polynomial is Φ_n(x). So, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^{13} - 1.

Wait, actually, the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x - z) is x^{13} - 1 because each z satisfies z^{13}=1.

But in our case, for each term, it's (z - a), where a is a constant. So, the product over all z (13th roots of unity) of (z - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial x^{13} - 1 evaluated at x = a? No, wait. Wait, the product over z (13th roots of unity) of (z - a) is equal to (a^{13} - 1), but only if we include z=1. Wait, let me check.

Actually, the polynomial x^{13} - 1 factors as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k), where ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. So, if I plug in x = a, then we get a^{13} - 1 = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k).

So, the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z - a) is equal to a^{13} - 1. Wait, no, more precisely, ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1.

Wait, that seems correct because when you expand ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) you get the polynomial z^{13} - a^{13} evaluated at z=1? No, wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, actually, the product ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) is equal to the resultant of z^{13} - 1 and z - a, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's use the formula:

If f(z) = z^n - 1, then the product over all roots z of f(z) of (z - a) is equal to f(a), because f(z) = ∏_{z^n=1} (z - 1), but that's not correct. Wait, f(z) = ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (z - ω^k), where ω is a primitive nth root. So, f(a) = ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (a - ω^k). So, f(a) = a^n - 1.

Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (a - ω^k) = a^n - 1.

So in our case, n=13, so ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1.

But in our case, the product is ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) * ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) ) = ( (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^{13} - 1 )

Therefore, the original product is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let's compute (1 + i)^13.

We know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, compute the angles.

For (1 + i)^13: angle is 13 * π/4. Let's reduce this modulo 2π.

13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since 3π is π + 2π, which is equivalent to π in terms of angle (since angles are modulo 2π). So, 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4, but wait, 13 * π/4 = (12 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4. 3π is π more than 2π, so subtract 2π to get it within 0 to 2π: 3π + π/4 - 2π = π + π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, for (1 - i)^13: angle is -13π/4. Which is the same as 13π/4 in the positive direction, but since e^{-iθ} = e^{i(-θ)}, so adding multiples of 2π:

-13π/4 = -3π - π/4. Adding 4π (which is 2*2π) gives us -3π - π/4 + 4π = π - π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, no, let me do it properly.

Compute -13π/4:

-13π/4 = -3π - π/4.

To bring it into the range [0, 2π), add 4π:

-3π - π/4 + 4π = π - π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:

-13π/4 = -(12π/4 + π/4) = -3π - π/4.

Adding 2π repeatedly until positive:

-3π - π/4 + 4π = π - π/4 = 3π/4.

So, the angle for (1 - i)^13 is 3π/4.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i 5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) ]

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i 3π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) [ cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) ]

Compute these:

cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

So,

(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) (1 + i)

Simplify sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2, so:

= 64 * (-2)/2 (1 + i) = 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i)

Similarly,

(1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i)

Again, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2:

= 64 * (-2)/2 (1 - i) = 64*(-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i)

Now, compute (1 + i)^13 - 1:

= (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1:

= (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i

Now, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i). That's a product of conjugates, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute that:

(-65)^2 = 4225

64^2 = 4096

Sum: 4225 + 4096 = 8321

Wait, wait. So the product is 8321.

But wait, hold on. The product we computed was [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = 8321.

But earlier, we had that the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2) equals this. But wait, in our problem, the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product of (2 - 2z + z²) as z runs over all 13th roots of unity.

But in my earlier substitution, I set z = ω^k, so each term is 2 - 2z + z² = z² - 2z + 2. So, the product is indeed ∏_{z} (z² - 2z + 2) = [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ] = 8321.

Wait, but wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12. But when k=0, z=1.

So, let's check the term when k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 +1 = 1. So, the product includes 1, but in our computation above, when we did the product over all z of (z² - 2z +2), that included z=1, so that gives 1*(z² - 2z +2) evaluated at z=1: which is 1.

So, our calculation gives the product as 8321, which includes the k=0 term. So, that's the answer.

But wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, but the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes ω^0=1. So, maybe it's correct.

Wait, but the problem says "Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity". That might be just defining ω as a primitive root, but the product is still over k=0 to 12, which includes 1. So, perhaps that's correct.

So, the product is 8321.

But wait, 8321 mod 1000 is 321, because 8000 is 8*1000, so 8321 - 8*1000 = 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 8321 seems a bit big, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, let me go back.

We have:

Each term is (z² - 2z +2), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity.

We factored it as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Thus, the product over all z is ∏ (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

Which is equal to [ (1 + i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 -1 ].

Wait, no, earlier I thought that ∏_{z} (z - a) = a^{13} -1.

Wait, no, actually, the product over all z (13th roots of unity) of (z - a) is equal to a^{13} -1, because ∏_{z}(z - a) = (a^{13} -1).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because if f(z) = z^{13} -1, then f(a) = a^{13} -1, and f(z) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k). So, substituting z = a, we get f(a) = a^{13} -1 = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k). So, the product ∏ (a - ω^k) = a^{13} -1.

Therefore, ∏ (z - a) when z are the 13th roots of unity is equal to a^{13} -1.

Wait, no, wait: if f(z) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k) = z^{13} -1.

So, if I evaluate f(a), it's equal to (a^{13} -1) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k).

So, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} -1.

Wait, so if I have ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - a) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - a) = ?

Wait, no, wait, no, in the previous step, f(z) = z^{13} -1 = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - ω^k). So, f(a) = a^{13} -1 = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k).

So, the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} -1.

But in our problem, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z² -2z +2) where z = ω^k.

But we rewrote each term as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), so the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = [ ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - (1 + i)) ] * [ ∏_{k=0}^{12} (z - (1 - i)) ]

But each of these products is equal to (1 + i)^{13} -1 and (1 - i)^{13} -1, respectively.

Wait, no, wait: in the formula, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^{13} -1.

So, if a = (1 + i), then ∏ (1 + i - ω^k) = (1 + i)^{13} -1.

Similarly, for a = (1 - i), ∏ (1 - i - ω^k) = (1 - i)^{13} -1.

But in our case, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = (-1)^{13} ∏_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} [ (1 + i)^{13} -1 ].

Because ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} [ a^{13} -1 ]

So, since 13 is odd, (-1)^{13} = -1.

Therefore, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = - [ (1 + i)^{13} -1 ]

Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^{13} -1 ]

So, the overall product is [ - ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^{13} -1 ) ] = ( (1 + i)^{13} -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^{13} -1 )

Which is exactly what we computed earlier, giving 8321.

So, the product is indeed 8321.

But wait, let me confirm the calculations of (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 again.

Earlier, I said that (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Then, 13π/4 is 3π + π/4. Since 3π is equivalent to π in terms of angle (since 3π = π + 2π), so e^{i13π/4} = e^{i(π + π/4)} = e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * ( (-2)/2 - i (-2)/2 ) ?

Wait, no, let's do it step by step.

Multiply 64 * sqrt(2) by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):

= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2)

= 64 * (- (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 ) + 64 * (-i (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 )

= 64 * (-2 / 2 ) + 64 * (-i * 2 / 2 )

= 64*(-1) + 64*(-i * 1 )

= -64 -64i

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i13π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i13π/4}

But -13π/4 is the same as 3π/4 in positive terms because:

-13π/4 + 4π = -13π/4 + 16π/4 = 3π/4.

So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{i3π/4} = cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Thus, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * [ (-2/2) + i (2/2) ] = 64*(-1 + i )

Wait, no, let's compute it properly.

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64 * [ (-sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 ) + i (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 ) ]

= 64 * [ (-2/2) + i (2/2) ]

= 64*(-1 + i )

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i

Wait, no, that would be 64*(-1 + i ). Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so:

= 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) + 64 * sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 )

= 64*(-2/2) + 64*(i*2/2 )

= 64*(-1) + 64*(i*1 )

= -64 +64i

Yes, that's correct.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i

(1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i

So, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i

(1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i

So, the product is (-65 -64i)*(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So the product is 8321.

Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

Wait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.

Therefore, the answer is 321.

But just to make sure, let me verify the steps once more.

1. Expressed each term as quadratic in ω^k: correct.

2. Recognized that the product can be expressed as product over all 13th roots of unity: correct.

3. Factored quadratic as product of (z - (1±i)): correct.

4. Applied the formula that product over all roots of unity of (z - a) = a^{13} -1: correct.

5. Calculated (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 correctly: yes, they both came out as -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i), which when subtracting 1 gave -65 -64i and -65 +64i.

6. Multiplied these conjugates to get 8321: correct.

7. Computed 8321 mod 1000: 321.

So, all steps seem correct.


To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity.

1. **Express Each Term as a Quadratic**:  
   Each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten as \(\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2\), which is a quadratic in \(\omega^k\).

2. **Product Over All 13th Roots of Unity**:  
   The product becomes \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\), where \(z = \omega^k\). This product can be factored as \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\).

3. **Evaluate Using Roots of Unity**:  
   Using the property that \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1\), we find:
   \[
   \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1
   \]
   \[
   \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
   \]

4. **Compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\)**:  
   Expressing \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\) in polar form:
   \[
   1 + i = \sqrt{2}e^{i\pi/4}, \quad 1 - i = \sqrt{2}e^{-i\pi/4}
   \]
   Raising to the 13th power:
   \[
   (1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13}e^{i13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2}e^{i5\pi/4} = -64 - 64i
   \]
   \[
   (1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13}e^{-i13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2}e^{i3\pi/4} = -64 + 64i
   \]

5. **Subtract 1 and Multiply**:  
   Compute:
   \[
   (1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i, \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
   \]
   Their product:
   \[
   (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
   \]

6. **Find the Remainder**:  
   The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:
   \[
   8321 \mod 1000 = 321
   \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{321}\).
