Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves: take 1 or 4 tokens. The player who takes the last token wins. So, it's similar to other impartial games like Nim, but with limited move options.

I think the key is to determine for each n whether the first player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can. So, we can model this using the concept of winning and losing positions.

A position is a losing position if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position is one where there is at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Let's try to figure out for small n whether it's a winning or losing position.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n = 2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Or she can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. So, Alice can't force a win from n=2 because whatever she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can't win. So n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, maybe I should formalize this as a function. Let’s define a function f(n) which is true if the current player can force a win from n tokens.

So, f(n) = true if either f(n-1) is false or f(n-4) is false. Because the current player can take 1 or 4 tokens, leading to the next state. If any of those next states is a losing position for the opponent, then the current player can win.

Wait, actually, the function is:

f(n) is true if the current player can make a move to a position where f(n') is false, meaning the opponent can't win from n'.

So, for n=1: f(1) = true (take 1 and win)
n=2: Can take 1, leading to n=1, where opponent can win. So f(2) = false (since all moves lead to opponent's win)
n=3: Can take 1, leading to n=2, where opponent can't win. So f(3) = true (take 1, opponent loses)
n=4: Can take 1 (leading to n=3, which
