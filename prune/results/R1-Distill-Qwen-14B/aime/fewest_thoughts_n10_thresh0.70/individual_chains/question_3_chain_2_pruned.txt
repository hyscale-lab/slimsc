Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes these probability problems can get a bit tricky, but taking it one piece at a time should help.

First, the problem says that Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, probability of grand prize given prize. That's a conditional probability. I remember that conditional probability is defined as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. Because the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, A is the event that she wins the grand prize, and B is the event that she wins a prize. So, the intersection of A and B is just A. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

Let me start by understanding the setup.

Total numbers in S: 10.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from S. So, the number of ways she can pick her numbers is C(10,4), which is 210. That's the total number of possible combinations she could have.

Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. So, the lottery is selecting 4 numbers out of 10, and Jen has also selected 4. The probability of various overlaps between her numbers and the lottery numbers is what we need.

First, let me compute P(B), which is the probability that she wins a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen.

Alternatively, the complementary probability is that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen.

So, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - P(no prize) = 1 - [P(0 correct) + P(1 correct)].

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

- C(10,4) is the total number of possible lottery outcomes.

- C(4,k) * C(6,4−k) is the number of ways to choose k numbers from Jen's 4 and 4−k from the remaining 6 numbers.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Therefore, the probability P(k correct) is [C(4,k) * C(6,4−k)] / C(10,4).

So, P(0 correct) = [C(4,0)*C(6,4)] / C(10,4) = [1 * 15] / 210 = 15/210 = 1/14.

Similarly, P(1 correct) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4) = [4 * 20] / 210 = 80/210 = 8/21.

So, P(no prize) = P(0 correct) + P(1 correct) = (1/14) + (8/21). Let me compute that.

First, find a common denominator. 14 and 21 have LCM 42. So, 1/14 is 3/42, 8/21 is 16/42. So, adding them gives 19/42. Therefore, P(no prize) = 19/42.

Hence, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 1/14 is 3/42, and 8/21 is 16/42. 3 + 16 is 19. So, 19/42 is correct for P(no prize). So, P(B) is 1 - 19/42 = 23/42.

Now, P(A) is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. So, how many favorable outcomes? Only one combination: all four of her numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because when you compute probabilities, it's based on the possible lottery outcomes. So, the grand prize is when all four of her numbers are selected, which is only 1 possible combination. So, yes, P(A) = 1/210.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again. The probability that all four numbers match
