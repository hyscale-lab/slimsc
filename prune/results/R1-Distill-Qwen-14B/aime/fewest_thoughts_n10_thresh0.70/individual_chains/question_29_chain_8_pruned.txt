Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let's try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. We have rectangle ABCD. Let me denote the points in order: A, B, C, D. So, AB is one side, BC is another, CD is opposite to AB, and DA is opposite to BC.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH: points E, F, G, H. So, EF is one side, FG is another, GH is opposite to EF, and HE is opposite to FG.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all these four points lie on a straight line. So, this line must pass through points D and C of rectangle ABCD, and points E and F of rectangle EFGH.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

Given lengths: BC=16, which would be the same as AD in rectangle ABCD because opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. AB=107, so that's the length of the other side of rectangle ABCD. Similarly, FG=17, which is one side of rectangle EFGH, and EF=184, which is the other side.

So, rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16. Rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

I think it might help to assign coordinates to these points to get a better grasp of their positions.

Let me place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Letâ€™s assume point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's assign coordinates as follows:

- Point D: (0, 0)
- Point C: (16, 0) because DC = BC = 16
- Point B: (16, 107) because AB = 107
- Point A: (0, 107)

Wait, no. Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is adjacent to BC. So, if AB is length 107, and BC is 16, then the sides AB and CD are 107, and sides BC and AD are 16.

Wait, I might be mixing up the sides. Let me think again.

In rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths.

So, AB=107, BC=16, so CD=107, DA=16.

So, if D is at (0,0), then:

- Point D: (0, 0)
- Point C: (107, 0) because CD=107
- Point B: (107, 16) because BC=16
- Point A: (0, 16)

Wait, that makes more sense. Because from D(0,0), moving along DC which is length 107 to point C(107,0). Then from C, moving up to B(107,16). From B, moving left to A(0,16), and then down to D(0,0).

Yes, that seems correct. So, ABC
