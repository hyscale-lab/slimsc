Okay, so I've got this math problem about finding the number of rectangles in a regular dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? And the rectangles are formed such that their sides lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. The diagram shows three examples, but I can't see it, so I need to visualize or maybe sketch it out.

First, I should recall that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The problem is about rectangles. So, in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of parallel sides. Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can vary in length. So, some diagonals are longer than others. For a rectangle, both pairs of opposite sides must be equal and parallel.

So, to form a rectangle, I need to choose four points such that they form two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are spaced appropriately. For a regular dodecagon, the sides are spaced every 30 degrees because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. So, each side is 30 degrees apart.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides are each 30 degrees apart, but the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. So, diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 5 vertices because beyond that, they start repeating on the other side.

So, for example, a diagonal that skips one vertex is shorter, and the one that skips five vertices is the longest, right? So, in total, there are different types of diagonals: skipping 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.

Now, for rectangles, the sides must be parallel. So, in a regular dodecagon, two sides are parallel if the number of vertices they skip is the same. So, for example, if I pick two sides that each skip 1 vertex, they are parallel. Similarly, two diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are parallel.

So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines. Each pair must have the same spacing between the vertices they connect. So, for instance, one pair might be sides that each skip 2 vertices, and the other pair might skip 3 vertices.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, the number of sides is even, so the opposite sides are parallel. But for diagonals, it's similarâ€”each diagonal has a parallel counterpart on the other side of the polygon.

So, the key is to find all possible pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) and then find how they can intersect to form rectangles.

Each rectangle is determined by two distinct pairs of parallel lines: one pair for the length and another for the width. So, I need to count how many such pairs exist, and then
