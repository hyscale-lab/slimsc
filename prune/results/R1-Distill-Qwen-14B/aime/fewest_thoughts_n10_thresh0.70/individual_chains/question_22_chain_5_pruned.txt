Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this hexagon. Since it's equilateral, all its sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. That probably means it's a type of hexagon similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in some directions. But it's definitely not regular since the triangle formed by the extensions has sides of different lengths.

So, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. I should probably draw a diagram to understand how this triangle is positioned relative to the hexagon. Let me imagine the hexagon ABCDEF, with each side equal, opposite sides parallel. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet to form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions should meet in a way that forms a triangle outside the hexagon.

Wait, I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. Maybe it's related to the concept of similar triangles or something like that. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the extensions might form a triangle with sides proportional to the hexagon's sides but scaled up.

I remember something about equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel being related to affine transformations of regular hexagons. So maybe I can consider the hexagon as a transformed version of a regular one, scaled differently in different directions.

Let me think about the triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. That doesn't look like a right triangle. Let me check: 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, while 300² is 90000. Nope, not a right triangle. Maybe it's a 3-4-5 triangle scaled? 200:240:300 simplifies to 10:12:15, which is 5:6:7.5... Not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe the triangle is similar to some smaller triangle inside the hexagon. Or perhaps the side length of the hexagon can be found using the concept of intercept theorms or similar triangles.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, when we extend each side, the lines will meet at certain points forming the triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I recall that in such a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides can be thought of as being translated versions of each
