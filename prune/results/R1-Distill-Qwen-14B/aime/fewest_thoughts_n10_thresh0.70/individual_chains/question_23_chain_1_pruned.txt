Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular. So yes, they intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So if points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, then the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.

So, let's denote that points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v). So, all four points are determined by two points A and B, with C and D being their reflections across the origin.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal in length. So AB = BC = CD = DA. Let me write down the coordinates:

A = (x, y)
B = (u, v)
C = (-x, -y)
D = (-u, -v)

I need to find the lengths of the sides and set them equal.

The distance between A and B is sqrt[(u - x)² + (v - y)²]
Similarly, the distance between B and C is sqrt[(-x - u
