Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the radius of the original circle is 3, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) of 6 and a minor radius of 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside this sphere and also outside of it. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out the positions of the torus relative to the sphere in both the internal and external tangent cases.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching along another circle. I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in each case because that distance will affect where the tangency occurs.

Let me recall that the torus can be described in terms of two radii: R (the major radius, which is 6) and r (the minor radius, which is 3). The sphere has a radius of 11.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their centers must be aligned. So, the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus is such that the sphere's surface just touches the outer part of the torus.

Wait, no, actually, the torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's surface is outside the torus. When they are tangent internally, the torus is touching the sphere at a single circle. Similarly, externally tangent would mean the torus is outside the sphere, touching it at another single circle.

I think the correct approach is to model the torus and sphere as surfaces in 3D space and find the points where they are tangent. 

Let me consider the equations of both surfaces.

The equation of a torus can be written in the Cartesian coordinate system as:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius (6) and r is the minor radius (3). So, plugging in those values:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9

The equation of the sphere with radius 11 centered at the origin is:

x² + y² + z² = 121

Now, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, their centers are aligned along the z-axis. Let me assume the torus is centered at some point along the z-axis, say (0, 0, d), where d is the distance from the origin (the center of the sphere) to the center of the torus.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution around the z-axis, right? Because the original circle is revolved around an axis in its plane, which we can take as the z-axis for simplicity. So, the center of the torus's generating circle is at (0, 0, 0), but when it's placed inside the sphere, perhaps the center is shifted along the z-axis.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the position so that the torus is inside the sphere. Let me clarify.

In the internal tangent case, the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. So, the sphere's center is at (0,0,0),
