Alright, I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand the problem step by step. Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B where each B has the property that its maximum element is in A. The count of such sets B is 2024, and from that, I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

So, first, let's think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, Bob can construct sets B where a is the maximum. Since B is a finite nonempty set, for each a, the number of possible sets B with max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because for each such subset, we can add a to it to make B, ensuring that a is the maximum.

Wait, so for each a in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can either be in the set or not, so 2^{a-1} subsets.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, if we denote A as {a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ}, then the total number of sets is Σ_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i - 1}.

Given that this sum is 2024, we have Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So now, the problem reduces to finding a set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is equal to 2024. Then, once we find such a set A, we need to compute the sum of its elements.

Wait, but how do we find such a set A? Since 2^{a-1} are powers of two, each term is a distinct power of two. But the sum could be a combination of different powers. Hmm, but 2024 is a specific number, so we need to express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two, possibly multiplied by the number of times each power is used.

Wait, no, actually, each a in A contributes exactly one term, which is 2^{a-1}. So the sum is the sum of distinct terms, each of which is a power of two. But wait, if A has multiple elements, each with different a's, then each term in the sum is a unique power of two. So the sum is essentially a sum of distinct powers of two, but not necessarily all in a consecutive manner.

But wait, 2024 is equal to the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A. So A can be thought of as the set of exponents plus one. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of it in terms of binary representation.

Let me think: 2024 in binary. Let me calculate that.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0

1012 / 2 = 506, rem 0

506 /2=253, rem 0

253/2=126, rem 1

126/2=63, rem 0

63/2=31, rem 1

31/2=15, rem 1

15/2=7, rem 1

7/2=3, rem 1

3/2=1, rem 1

1/2=0, rem 1.

So writing the remainders from
