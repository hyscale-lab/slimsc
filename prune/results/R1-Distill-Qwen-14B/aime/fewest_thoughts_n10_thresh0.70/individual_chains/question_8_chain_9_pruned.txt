Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out.

First, let's write down what's given. We have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to these equations.

Hmm, the second equation seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a more manageable form. Let me look at it:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I can factor this expression. Let me see:

Each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, for example, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c), similarly for the others.

So, let's try that:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Wait, that's better. So, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, then (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So, substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be rearranged as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums or something.

I remember that for any three variables a, b, c, we have the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).

Maybe that can be helpful here. Let me see.

But first, I have 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote Q = a² + b² + c².

And let me denote P = ab + bc + ac.

We know from algebra that Q = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = S² - 2P.

So, Q = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Also, in the equation I have:

300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

But I also know that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

So, substituting S, P, and abc:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3abc.

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

300Q - (S³ - 3SP + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let's plug in the known values. S is 300, so S³ is 300^3 = 27,000,000.

We have:

300Q - (27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let's simplify this:

300Q - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Bring the 300Q and other terms to the right:

-27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000 - 300Q.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = -6,000,000 + 300Q.

Simplify the right side:

27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = 300Q - 6,000,000.

Move all terms to one side:

27,000,000 + 6,000,000 - 900P + 3abc - 300Q = 0.

Which simplifies to:

33,000,000 - 900P + 3abc - 300Q = 0.

Hmm, but I know that Q = 90,000 - 2P. So, substitute Q into this equation:

33,000,000 - 900P + 3abc - 300(90,000 - 2P) = 0.

Let's compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2P) = -600P.

So, the equation becomes:

33,000,000 - 900P + 3abc - (27,000,000 - 600P) = 0.

Distribute the negative sign:

33,000,000 - 900P + 3abc - 27,000,000 + 600P = 0.

Combine like terms:

(33,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-900P + 600P) + 3abc = 0.

Which simplifies to:

6,000,000 - 300P + 3abc = 0.

Divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify:

2,000,000 - 100P + abc = 0.

So, abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, interesting. Now, I have abc expressed in terms of P.

But let's recall that Q = 90,000 - 2P, and I also have another expression for Q from the equation.

Wait, earlier we had 300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

But maybe we can find another equation involving P and abc.

Alternatively, let's use the equation we just derived: abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Let me see if I can find another equation involving P.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identities I know.

We have S = 300, Q = 90,000 - 2P, and we have abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Is there another identity that relates S, P, and abc?

Well, the problem is now reduced to finding nonnegative integers a, b, c such that S = 300, and these other equations hold. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of P.

So, from abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

We can write abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, abc + 2,000,000 = 100P.

So, P = (abc + 2,000,000)/100.

But P is the sum of the pairwise products, which is ab + bc + ac. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P must also be a nonnegative integer.

So, (
