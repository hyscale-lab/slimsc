Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I need to find the length of AP, given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let's start by recalling some properties of circles, tangents, and power of a point. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, D must lie on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, actually, the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-symmedian point? Or maybe it's related to the symmedian. I remember that the tangents from a point to a circle are equal, so DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω.

Right, so DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Now, since AD intersects the circle ω again at P, I can probably use some power of point theorem here. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB², because D lies outside the circle and DB is the tangent. So, Power of a Point says that DB² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant that passes through A and P, so DA * DP is the power of D.

So, DB² = DA * DP. That gives me an equation relating DA and DP. But I don't know DA or DP yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus' theorem or something else with triangle ABC and the transversal ADP. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. I can place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me try that.

Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0) to simplify things. Then, point A can be at (10, 0) because AC is 10. Point B is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB is 5 and BC is 9.

So, coordinates: A(10,0), C(0,0). Let me find the coordinates of B. Let B = (x, y). Then, the distances are:

Distance AB: sqrt[(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 5. So, (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Distance BC: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] = 9. So, x^2 + y^2 = 81.

So, I have two equations:

1. (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25
2. x^2 + y^2 = 81

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(x - 10)^2 - x^2 = 25 - 81
Expand (x -10)^2: x² -20x +100 -x² = -56
Simplify: -20x +100 = -56
-20x = -156
x = 156 / 20 = 39 / 5 = 7.8.

So, x = 39/5. Now plug back into equation 2 to find y.

x² + y² = 81

(39/5)^2 + y² = 81

(1521/25) + y² = 81

y² = 81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = (504/2
