Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. I'm given the lengths BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, we have two rectangles. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: so AB is one side, BC is another. Since AB is 107 and BC is 16, that makes ABCD a rectangle with sides 107 and 16. Rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points D and C are from the first rectangle, and E and F are from the second. So, if I imagine both rectangles, E and F are somewhere along the line that connects D and C.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Let me try to figure out the coordinates of the points. Maybe coordinate geometry can help. Let's assign coordinates to each point.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) to make things simpler. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0), because BC is 16 units. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point B would be at (16,107), and point A would be at (0,107). Wait, no, that can't be right. If AB is 107, and BC is 16, then AB is the length, BC is the height. So, actually, ABCD should be arranged such that AB is horizontal. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (16,0). So, AB is 107, so from A to B, moving along the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I should rethink the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps setting point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107,0). BC is 16, so point C would be at (107,16), and point D would be at (0,16). That seems better. So, rectangle ABCD has coordinates: A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Now, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, with points E, F on the line DC, which is from D(0,16) to C(107,16). So, points E and F are somewhere along the line y=16.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear, so they must lie on a straight line. Since D is at (0,16) and C is at (107,16), the line DC is horizontal at y=16. So, points E and F must lie somewhere along this horizontal line.

But EFGH is a rectangle, so E and F are adjacent vertices, I think. Let me think. Rectangle EFGH: so EFGH is a rectangle, so EF is one side, FG is another. Given that EF=184 and FG=17.

Wait, so EF is
