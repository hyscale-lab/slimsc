Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but let me take it step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula. Maybe that will help here since the logs are in different bases. The change of base formula is log_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b), where c can be any positive number. So, perhaps I can convert these logarithms to a common base, like base 10 or base e, to make them easier to compare.

Let me write down the two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). I know that log_b(a^k) is equal to k * log_b(a). So, applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, that's straightforward. So, x * log_x(y) equals 10.

But log_x(y) is the exponent to which I have to raise x to get y. Let me write that as log_x(y) = k, which implies that x^k = y. That seems useful. So, if I let k = log_x(y), then y = x^k.

Now, substituting that into the first equation, which is x * k = 10. So, xk = 10. That gives me equation (1): xk = 10.

Now moving to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/k. So, substituting that in, the second equation becomes 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So, 4y/k = 10. That gives me equation (2): 4y/k = 10.

Now, I have two equations:

1. xk = 10   --> equation (1)
2. 4y/k = 10 --> equation (2)

I can try to express x and y in terms of k and then relate them.

From equation (1): x = 10/k.

From equation (2): 4y/k =10 --> y = (10 * k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k:

x = 10/k  
y = (5k)/2

But earlier, I expressed y in terms of x as y = x^k. So, let me substitute the expression for x and y from equations (1) and (2) into this equation.

So, substituting y = (5k)/2 and x = 10/k into y = x^k:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k.

Hmm, that's an equation involving k. Let me write that down:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle exponents. Taking ln:

ln[(5k)/2] = ln[(10/k)^k]

Using the logarithm power rule on the right side: ln(a^b) = b ln(a). So,

ln[(5k)/2] = k * ln(10/k)

Simplify the right side:

k * ln(10/k) = k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = k ln(10) - k ln(k)

So, the equation becomes:

ln(5k/2) = k ln(10) - k ln(k)

Hmm, this seems tricky because it's a transcendental equation (involving both algebraic and transcendental functions). I might need to find a value of k that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution or a way to express this equation that can be solved without getting into too complicated functions. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can make an intelligent guess for k. Let me think about possible integer or simple fractional values of k that might satisfy the equation.

Let me try k=2. Let's test that.

If k=2:

Left side: ln(5*2/2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.6094

Right side: 2 ln(10) - 2 ln(2) ≈ 2*2.3026 - 2*0.6931 ≈ 4.6052 - 1.3862 ≈ 3.2190

Not equal. So, 1.6094 ≠ 3.2190. So, k=2 is not a solution.

What about k=1?

k=1:

Left side: ln(5*1/2) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163

Right side: 1* ln(10) - 1* ln(1) ≈ 2.3026 - 0 ≈ 2.3026.

Not equal. So, nope.

k=3:

Left side: ln(5*3/2) = ln(7.5) ≈ 2.015

Right side: 3 ln(10) - 3 ln(3) ≈ 3*2.3026 - 3*1.0986 ≈ 6.9078 - 3.2958 ≈ 3.612

Not equal. Hmm.

k=4:

Left side: ln(5*4/2)=ln(10)=2.3026

Right side:4 ln(10) -4 ln(4)=4*2.3026 -4*1.3863≈9.2104 -5.5452≈3.6652

Nope, not equal.

k=5:

Left side: ln(5*5/2)=ln(12.5)≈2.5257

Right side:5 ln(10) -5 ln(5)=5*2.3026 -5*1.6094≈11.513 -8.047≈3.466

Still not equal.

Hmm, maybe k is a fractional value. Let's try k=3/2, which is 1.5.

k=1.5:

Left side: ln(5*(1.5)/2)=ln(3.75)≈1.3218

Right side:1.
