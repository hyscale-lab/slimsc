Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, the first condition is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second condition is a bit trickier. Let me write that out again to see if I can factor it or find a pattern.

The second equation is: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at this, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see.

I can factor out a common term from each pair. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c is b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b is c²(a + b). So putting it all together, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Substituting these into the equation, it becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term to see if that helps. For a²(300 - a), that's 300a² - a³. Similarly, the other terms become 300b² - b³ and 300c² - c³. So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. Let's combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, the equation simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c. Let me recall some algebraic identities that connect sums of variables with sums of their squares and cubes.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). Since a + b + c is 300, squaring both sides gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).

But I don't know ab + ac + bc yet. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc. Maybe I can express the equation in terms of S, Q, and P.

Wait, the expression I have is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³). Let me try to express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

First, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q. Since S is 300, that's 90,000 - 2Q.

Next, for a³ + b³ + c³, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. So that's S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

Plugging these into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 300(90,000 - 2Q) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2Q):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000

300 * (-2Q) = -600 Q

So that part is 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

Next, compute (S³ - 3SQ + 3P):

S³ is 300³ = 27,000,000.

-3SQ is -3*300*Q = -900 Q.

+3P remains as is.

So, S³ - 3SQ + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

Putting it all together into the main equation:

[27,000,000 - 600 Q] - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600 Q + 900 Q = 300 Q.

So we're left with:

300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Let me write that as:

300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have an equation relating Q and P: P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But I also know from the problem that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So perhaps I can find possible values for Q and P that satisfy this equation and also satisfy the original conditions.

Wait, but what do I know about Q and P? Q is ab + ac + bc, and P is abc. These are the standard symmetric sums for a cubic equation with roots a, b, c.

So, if I consider a cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0, which would have roots a, b, c. Since S, Q, P are known in terms of a, b, c, perhaps I can find integer roots.

But before that, maybe I can express Q in terms of P or vice versa.

From P = 100 Q - 2,000,000, I can write Q = (P + 2,000,000)/100.

But Q must be an integer because a, b, c are integers. So P must be such that (P + 2,000,000) is divisible by 100. Since P is abc, which is a product of integers, P is an integer. So, 2,000,000 is divisible by 100, so P must also be divisible by 100. Therefore, P is a multiple of 100.

So, P = 100k, where k is an integer. Then, substituting into P = 100 Q - 2,000,000:

100k = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

k = Q - 20,000.

So, Q = k + 20,000.

Therefore, Q is 20,000 + k, and P is 100k.

So, the problem reduces to finding nonnegative integers a, b, c such that:

a + b + c = 300,

ab + ac + bc = 20,000 + k,

abc = 100k,

where k is a nonnegative integer.

But k must also be such that abc = 100k. Since abc is nonnegative, k is nonnegative as well.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of k as a parameter and find for which k there exist nonnegative integers a, b, c satisfying these conditions.

But maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the variables a, b, c.

Another approach: Maybe the equation a + b + c = 300 and the condition on the symmetric sums can help us find possible triples.

Wait, but let me consider the equation P = 100 Q - 2,000,000. So, abc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange
