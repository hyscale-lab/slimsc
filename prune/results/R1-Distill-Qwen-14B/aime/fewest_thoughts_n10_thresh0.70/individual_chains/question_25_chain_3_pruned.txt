Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the other items are like additional things they might own. Now, they also mention that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. Maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, so let me recall.

Inclusion-exclusion for four sets would usually account for all possible overlaps, but since we already have some information about exactly two and exactly three, maybe we can approach it differently. Let me think.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- Let D be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let G be the set of people who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let S be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let C be the set of people who own a bag of candy hearts, so C is the universal set here because everyone owns it.

But wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So C includes everyone. So, the problem is about the intersection of D, G, S, and C. But since C is everyone, the intersection of all four is just the intersection of D, G, and S.

Wait, no. Because C is the set of all residents, so any intersection involving C is just the other set. For example, D ∩ C is just D, since everyone is in C. So, when considering the number of people who own all four things, it's the same as the number of people who own all three: D, G,
