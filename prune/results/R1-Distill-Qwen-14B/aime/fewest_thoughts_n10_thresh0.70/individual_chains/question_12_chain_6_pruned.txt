Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, forming two 3-digit numbers, their sum should be 999. Also, when I read the grid top to bottom, forming three 2-digit numbers, their sum should be 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid first. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first number when reading left to right is the top row: abc, which is actually 100a + 10b + c. The second number is the bottom row: def, which is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, the three numbers are ad, be, and cf. Wait, no, actually, each column is read as a 2-digit number. So the first column is ad, which is 10a + d. The second column is be, which is 10b + e. The third column is cf, which is 10c + f. The sum of these three should be 99.

So, summarizing the conditions:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Hmm. Let me write these equations more clearly.

First equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Second equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

I can perhaps simplify these equations.

Let me denote the first equation as:

Equation 1: 100a + 100d + 10b + 10e + c + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99.

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that helps.

But before that, let me try to reorganize the terms. Let's write equation 1 as:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Similarly, equation 2 can be written as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Ah, that's interesting. Let me denote:

From equation 1:

100(A) + 10(B) + (C) = 999, where A = a + d, B = b + e, C = c + f.

From equation 2:

10(D) + (E) = 99, where D = a + b + c, E = d + e + f.

So, equation 1 becomes:

100A + 10B + C = 999.

Equation 2 becomes:

10D + E = 99.

Hmm, so equation 1 is about the sums of each column (since A is a + d, the first column sum, etc.), and equation 2 is about the sum of the top row and the sum of the bottom row. Wait, because D is a + b + c, which is the top row, and E is d + e + f, which is the bottom row. So equation 2 is the sum of the top row and bottom row: D + E = something. Wait, no, equation 2 is 10D + E = 99.

But from equation 1, 100A + 10B + C = 999, which is similar to a 3-digit number where A is the hundreds digit, B the tens, and C the units. So, 100A + 10B + C = 999 implies that A=9, B=9, C=9. Because 999 is 9*100 + 9*10 +9. So, that means A=9, B=9, C=9.

So, A = a + d = 9.

B = b + e = 9.

C = c + f = 9.

Therefore, from equation 2: 10D + E = 99.

But D is the sum of the top row: a + b + c.

E is the sum of the bottom row: d + e + f.

So, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But since A = a + d =9, B = b + e=9, C= c + f=9, so:

a + d =9 --> d=9 -a.

Similarly, e=9 - b.

f=9 - c.

So, E = d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c).

But D = a + b + c.

So, substituting in equation 2:

10D + E = 99

10D + (27 - D) = 99.

Simplify:

10D +27 - D = 99

9D +27 =99

9D=72

D=8.

So, D = a + b + c =8.

And E=27 - D=27-8=19.

So, E=19.

Wait, so E is the sum of the bottom row: d + e + f =19.

But since d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c,

d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c) = 27 - D =27 -8=19, which matches.

So, all right. So, now, the variables are connected.

So, to recap, we have:

a + d =9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9,

and a + b + c=8,

d + e + f=19.

So, the problem
