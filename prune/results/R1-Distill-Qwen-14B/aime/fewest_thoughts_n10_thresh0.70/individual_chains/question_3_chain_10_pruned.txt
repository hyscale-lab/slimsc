Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it correctly.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (because if you win the grand prize, you definitely have at least two numbers matching), P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we need is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A), the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen, and P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Then, I'll divide them and simplify the fraction to get m/n.

Let me start by figuring out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10, 4), where C(n, k) is the combination formula, n! / (k!(n - k)!).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible ways the lottery numbers can be chosen.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 combination where all four are chosen. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, so P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Hmm, sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement probability and then subtract from 1. The complement of "at least two" is "zero or one" numbers matching. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) first. This is the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen. So, all four numbers chosen are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and Jen has 4). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4).

Calculating C(6,4): 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So, there are 15 ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's numbers. Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210.

Now, P(one match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's four numbers is chosen, and the remaining three are from the other six numbers. The number of ways to choose exactly one of her numbers is C(4,1) * C(6,3). 

Calculating C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 20 = 80. Thus, P(one match) = 80 / 210.

Adding these probabilities together: P(zero matches) + P(one match) = (15 + 80) / 210 = 95 / 210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify 115/210. Let's see, both are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Therefore, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, 115 divided by 5 is 23, yes, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake here.

Wait, 4 choose 1 is 4, 6 choose 3 is 20, so 4*20 is 80. That's correct. 6 choose 4 is 15, correct. So, 15+80=95. 210-95=115. So, 115/210 is correct. Then, 115 and 210 share a GCD. Let's find GCD(115,210). 115 factors are 5*23. 210 factors are 2*3*5*7. So, the GCD is 5. So, 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. Correct.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, I found P(A) = 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, write it as (1/210) * (42/23). Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5.

Therefore, (1/210)*(42/23) = (1/5)*(1/23) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23). 42 divided by 210 is indeed 1/5. So, 1/210 * 42 is 1/5, so 1/5 divided by 23 is 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Then, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1. So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me think again. The total number of possible 4-number combinations is 210, correct. The number of ways to choose all four of Jen's numbers is 1, correct.

For P(B), the probability of at least two matches, we subtracted the probabilities of 0 and 1 matches. Wait, but another way to compute P(B) is to calculate the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

But since we know that P(B) = 1 - P(0) - P(1), and we
