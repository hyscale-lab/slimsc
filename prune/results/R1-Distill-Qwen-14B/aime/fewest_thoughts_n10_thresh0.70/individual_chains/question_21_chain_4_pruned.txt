Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

So, the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63, meaning 6 and 3. Adding those digits gives 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense.

Now, the task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we're looking for the smallest base where there are more than ten numbers that satisfy these conditions.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like "ab" where a and b are digits in that base. But wait, in base b, the digits can only go from 0 to b-1. So, the first digit (the 'a' in "ab") can't be zero because then it wouldn't be a two-digit number. So, the first digit must be at least 1, and the second digit can be from 0 up to b-1.

So, in mathematical terms, a two-digit number in base b can be written as n = a * b + c, where a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.

Then, the sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) = a + c.

But since n is also equal to a*b + c, we can set up the equation:

sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.

Let me write that down:

sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Expanding the right side, (a + c)^2 is a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

So, the equation becomes:

a*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

Let me rearrange this to group like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. But maybe I can rearrange it more strategically. Let's see:

Bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Looking at this, I can try to group terms differently. Let's see:

a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor out a from the first two terms and c from the next two:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c -1) = 0.

Not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let me consider the original equation again:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rewrite that as:

a*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

Then, let's move all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Alternatively, group terms with a:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

So, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1, maybe I can find integer solutions for a and c for each base b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for b in terms of a and c.

From the equation:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me solve for b:

a*b = (a + c)^2 - c.

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c.

So,

b = (a^2 + 2
