Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the given equations. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a pattern. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Looking at this, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see:

I can factor out ab from the first two terms: ab(a) + ac(a). Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping. Let me group the terms as follows:

(a²b + b²a) + (a²c + c²a) + (b²c + c²b).

Each pair now is symmetric in two variables. For example, the first pair is a²b + b²a, which can be written as ab(a + b). Similarly, the second pair is a²c + c²a = ac(a + c), and the third pair is b²c + c²b = bc(b + c).

So, the entire expression becomes:

ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c).

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, I also know that a + b + c = 300, so maybe I can express (a + b), (a + c), and (b + c) in terms of 300 - c, 300 - b, and 300 - a respectively.

Let me write that down:

ab(a + b) = ab(300 - c)
ac(a + c) = ac(300 - b)
bc(b + c) = bc(300 - a)

So, substituting back into the expression:

ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the terms:

300ab - abc + 300ac - abc + 300bc - abc = 6,000,000.

Combining like terms:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So, now I have:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3 from all terms:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, now I have:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write this as:

100(ab + ac + bc) = abc + 2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let me think about symmetric functions. Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps I can express it in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let P = ab + ac + bc.

Let Q = abc.

So, from the equation above, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000. Let me write that as:

Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, the problem now is to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that S = 300, P = (sum of products), and Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x^3 - Sx^2 + Px - Q = 0.

So, the polynomial would be x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - Q = 0.

And since Q = 100P - 2,000,000, substituting that in, the polynomial becomes:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor this equation. Let me group terms:

(x^3 - 300x^2) + (Px - 100P) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor out x^2 from the first group and P from the second:

x^2(x - 300) + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So,

x^2(x - 300) + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps me directly. Maybe I can express P in terms of x or something else. Alternatively, since P is a symmetric sum, perhaps I can express it in terms of S and other known quantities.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the original equation again:

a + b + c = 300.

Let me think about the possible values of a, b, c.

Since they are nonnegative integers, each can range from 0 to 300. But considering the second equation, which is 6,000,000, which is quite a large number, perhaps a, b, c are not too small.

But maybe I can make an inequality. Let me see, the second equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Each term is nonnegative, so each term contributes positively.

Wait, maybe I can use AM-GM inequality or some other inequality to find bounds on a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the variables in terms of two variables, since the sum is 300. Let me set c = 300 - a - b, then substitute into the second equation.

But that might make the equation complicated. Let me see.

Wait, let me first try to manipulate the equation 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

We have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

But in the symmetric polynomial, we have the equation:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - Q = 0.

Substituting Q:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Which is:

x^3 - 300x^2 + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor this as:

x^3 - 300x^2 + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find P in terms of x.

Wait, maybe try to think about specific cases where a, b, c are equal or have some symmetry. For example, maybe two variables are equal, or one is zero.

Let me consider the case where one variable is zero. Suppose c = 0.

Then, a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a²b + b²a = 6,000,000.

Which is ab(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b = 300, then ab * 300 = 6,000,000.

So, ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.

So, ab = 20,000, and a + b = 300.

We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

Let me solve for a and b.

We have a + b = 300.

and ab = 20,000.

This is a system of equations. Let me set up the quadratic equation:

x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

The discriminant is 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100.

So, the solutions are [300 ± 100]/2.

Which gives (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200, and (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100.

So, the solutions are a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.

So, when c=0, we have two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since the variables are ordered triples, each permutation counts separately. Wait, no, in this case, since c=0, and a and b can be swapped, so the number of such triples would be 2: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But wait, actually, in the case where c=0, we can permute a, b, c, but since c is fixed at 0, so for each solution (a,b,0), swapping a and b gives a different triple.
