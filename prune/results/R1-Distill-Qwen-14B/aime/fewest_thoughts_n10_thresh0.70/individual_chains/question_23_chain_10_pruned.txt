Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi ABCD. ABCD is a rhombus on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's correct. So, they are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if the rhombus has vertices A, B, C, D, then the midpoint of AC is the origin, and the same for BD.

So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then C must be the diametrically opposite point, right? Because the midpoint is the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). So, the four points are (x, y), (p, q), (-x,
