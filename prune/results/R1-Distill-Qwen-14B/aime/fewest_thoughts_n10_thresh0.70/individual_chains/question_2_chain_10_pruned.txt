Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at the origin (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. I need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't covered by any other segment from F except AB itself. Then, I need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and compute p + q.

First, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB connects these two points. The family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So each PQ is like a line segment from some point (p, 0) to (0, q), and the distance between them is 1.

I remember that the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²). So for PQ to be of length 1, we have p² + q² = 1. That gives me a relationship between p and q for each PQ in F.

Since each PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1. That's the intercept form of a line.

Now, the point C is on AB, so I need to parameterize AB first. Let me find the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Any point C on AB can be represented as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. When t=0, we get B, and when t=1/2, we get A.

Now, the key is that C is on AB and not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, we need to find such a C that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F besides AB.

Wait, but AB is also a segment in F? Let me think. AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is a segment of length 1, so it's in F. So AB is one of the PQ segments in F. So C is on AB, and it's on AB, but we need C not to be on any other PQ in F.

So, I need to find a point C on AB such that there's no other PQ in F (i.e., another segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² =1) that passes through C.

So, for such a point C, the only PQ in F that contains it is AB itself.

So, how do I find such a point C?

Perhaps, the point C is such that it's the only intersection point of AB with all possible PQs in F. But since AB is already a PQ in F, it intersects itself at every point. But for other PQs, they should not intersect AB at any other point except maybe at C.

Wait, but PQs are all of length 1. So, each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² =1.

So, the family F is the set of all such lines. So, perhaps for each PQ in F, we can find where it intersects AB, and then find a point C that is not on any of these other PQs.

But that seems a bit vague. Maybe a better approach is to parametrize C as a point on AB and then find conditions where C doesn't lie on any other PQ.

So, let's parametrize C as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), as I did earlier.

Now, suppose that C is on some other PQ in F besides AB. Then there exists p and q such that p² + q² =1, and C lies on the line x/p + y/q =1.

So, substituting C into that equation: t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.

So, for each t, if I can solve for p and q such that t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1, and p² + q² =1, then C is on that PQ.

But we want C not to lie on any other PQ except AB. So, for the given C, the only solution to t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1 with p² + q²=1 is when p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, which corresponds to AB.

Therefore, the system:

t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1,

p² + q² =1,

has only the solution p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2 when C is (t, ...). So, for our t, this equation should have only the trivial solution.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1,

with p² + q² =1.

Let me consider that for a given C, which is (t, y), we need the system to have only one solution (p, q). But since p and q are related by p² + q²=1, perhaps we can solve for them.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the equation of the line PQ as x/p + y/q =1, and since C lies on it, substitute x=t and y= -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.

So,

t/p + (-sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.

Multiply both sides by pq:

t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

So,

t q + (-sqrt(3) t) p + (sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

Let me rearrange:

t q - sqrt(3) t p + (sqrt(3)/2) p - pq = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor terms:

q(t - p) + p(-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) =0.

Wait, that might not help directly. Let me think.

We have p² + q²=1 and the above equation. Maybe I can express q from the first equation in terms of p, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the equation t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p - pq =0.

Factor p and q:

p [ (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) - q ] + q t =0.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express q from the equation.

Wait, perhaps express q in terms of p.

From the equation:

t q + (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p = pq.

Bring terms with q to one side:

t q - p q = - (-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2) p.

Factor q:

q (t - p) = (sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ) p.

So,

q = [ (sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ) p ] / (t - p ).

Hmm, that's an expression for q in terms of p.

But we also have p² + q² =1.

So, substitute q into p² + q²=1.

So,

p² + [ (sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 ) p / (t - p) ]² =1.

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can set it up as an equation in p.

Let me denote numerator as N = sqrt(3) t - sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)(t - 1/2).

So,

q = N p / (t - p).

So,

q = [ sqrt(3)(t - 1/2) p ] / (t - p).

Then, plug into p² + q²=1:

p² + [ sqrt(3)(t - 1/2) p / (t - p) ]² =1.

Let me compute each term.

First, let's compute the second term squared:

[ sqrt(3)(t - 1/2) p / (t - p) ]² = 3 (t - 1/2)^2 p² / (t - p)^2.

So, the equation becomes:

p² + [3 (t - 1/2)^2 p² ] / (t - p)^2 =1.

Let me factor p²:

p² [ 1 + 3 (t - 1/2)^2 / (t - p)^2 ] =1.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can set u = t - p.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me set s = t - p, so that p = t - s. Then, the equation becomes:

(t - s)^2 [1 + 3(t - 1/2)^2 / s^2 ] =1.
