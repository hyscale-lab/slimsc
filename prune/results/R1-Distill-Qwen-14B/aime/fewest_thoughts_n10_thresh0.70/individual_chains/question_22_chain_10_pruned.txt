Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's start by visualizing this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, that means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, since it's equilateral, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the side length as 's'.

Now, when they say the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. So, these sides are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF, which are opposite sides of the hexagon. Since AB is parallel to DE, CD is parallel to FA, EF is parallel to BC, so when we extend them, they form a triangle.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. Maybe similar triangles are involved here. Because the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled differently in certain directions.

Wait, no, a regular hexagon has all sides equal and all angles equal, but here it just says it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So, it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe called a "parallelogon" but only a hexagon.

I remember that when you have a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of every other side is related to the hexagon's sides. I think the lengths of the triangle's sides can be connected to the hexagon's sides and the distances between the parallel sides.

Wait, perhaps similar triangles can help here. Let me think: if AB, CD, EF are extended to form a triangle, then each of these sides is a side of the hexagon, so their extensions will meet at some points forming the triangle. The triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300. So, maybe these correspond to some scaled version of the hex
