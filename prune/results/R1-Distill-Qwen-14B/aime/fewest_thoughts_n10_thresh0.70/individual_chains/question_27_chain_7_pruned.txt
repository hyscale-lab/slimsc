Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what's going on here. 

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to this axis is 6. So, imagine taking a circle with radius 3 and spinning it around a line that's 6 units away from its center. That forms a donut shape, which is the torus.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o respectively. The difference between them is what we're after.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, they must touch at exactly one point along a curve, which in this case is a circle. The radii of these circles of tangency must be related to the geometry of the torus and the sphere.

First, let me recall the properties of a torus. A torus can be defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Now, considering the sphere with radius 11, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some distance from the torus's center. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus. Wait, no, the sphere is fixed, and the torus is moving inside and outside of it. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent. So, the torus is inside the sphere, touching it from the inside. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent, meaning the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch from the outside.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, it's a smaller structure. But in the case of external tangency, the torus must enclose the sphere. Hmm, but the sphere has radius 11, and the torus's major radius is 6. So, the torus is smaller than the sphere. Therefore, when the torus is on the outside of the sphere, the sphere can't fit inside the torus because the torus's major radius is 6, so the distance from the center to the farthest point on the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9. But the sphere has radius 11, which is bigger than 9. So, the sphere can't be inside the torus. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe in the external case, the torus is outside the sphere, but the sphere is just touching the torus from the inside. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the torus can be placed such that it's outside the sphere, so the sphere is inside the torus. But if the torus's major radius is 6 and minor radius is 3, then the maximum distance from the torus's center to any point on the torus is 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than the sphere's radius of 11. So, the sphere can't fit inside the torus. So, perhaps the torus is always inside the sphere, and the external tangency is when the torus is outside relative to the sphere, but the sphere is outside the torus? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this mathematically. Let me recall that when two surfaces are tangent, their normals at the point of tangency are the same. For a sphere and a torus, the points of tangency will lie along a circle. So, the radius of this circle will depend on the relative positions of the sphere and the torus.

Let me consider the internal tangency first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is outside the torus. The distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus's center is important here.

Wait, the torus's center is a point
