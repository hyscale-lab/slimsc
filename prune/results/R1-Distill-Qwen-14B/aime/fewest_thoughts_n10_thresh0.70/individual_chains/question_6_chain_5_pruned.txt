Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, so I need to break them down step by step. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, the functions f(x) and g(x) are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, these are absolute value functions that have been transformed. I remember that absolute value graphs are V-shaped, so applying these transformations will shift and maybe flip them.

The first function, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), involves a composition of functions. Let me parse that: inside out, it's sin(2πx), then f applied to that, then g applied to the result, and then multiplied by 4. Similarly, the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, same structure but with cosine and different variable.

To find the number of intersections between these two graphs, I need to solve for (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied. That is, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, effectively, I'm looking for pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Maybe the way to approach this is to analyze each function separately first, understand their periods and ranges, then see how they interact.

Let me start by understanding f(x) and g(x):

1. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|: So the inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so that shifts it down by 1/2. But since it's within absolute value, it becomes a V-shape again, but now the vertex is at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, subtracting inside the absolute value affects the position. Let me think.

Actually, |x| - 1/2 is a V-shape shifted down by 1/2. But then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts above the x-axis. So, the graph of f(x) would have a W-shape? Let me plot it mentally.

At x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
At x = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.
Similarly, at x = -1/2: same as above.
At x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
So between x = -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) is zero, and it goes up to 1/2 at x=0. Then from 1/2 to 1, it goes back down to 1/2. So, actually, f(x) is a W-shaped graph with minima at x = ±1/2 and x = 0, and peaks at x = ±1, etc. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the function f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, which is a transformation of |x|.

Wait, maybe it's better to sketch this step by step. Let's consider different intervals.

For x >=0:

f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

So for x >= 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2, which is a line with slope 1 starting at (1/2, 0). For 0 <= x <= 1/2, f(x) = -(x - 1/2) = 1/2 - x, which is a line with slope -1 starting at (0, 1/2). Then, since the original function is f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, for x negative, it's the same as for positive x because of the absolute value. So the graph is a V shape that's been shifted and reflected. So yes, f(x) is a V shape with its vertex at (0, 1/2), but it's actually a V that's been moved down to touch the x-axis at x = ±1/2, and then goes back up. So, it's like a diamond shape. Wait, no, that's not right. Because |x| is a V, subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, then taking the absolute value reflects any part that's below the x-axis back up.

Hmm, maybe I should plot some points.

For x = 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

x = 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

x = -1/2: same as 1/2, so 0.

x = -1: same as 1, so 1/2.

So the graph of f(x) is a V shape that peaks at (0, 1/2), goes down to (1/2, 0), then back up to (1, 1/2), and mirrored on the left side. So, it's like a diamond or a triangle between x=-1 and x=1.

Wait, but that's only for |x| <=1? No, because |x| can be any real number, but the function f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|, which for |x| >=1/2, it's | |x| - 1/2 |, which equals |x| -1/2, so it's linear beyond |x|=1/2, but in the middle, between |x|=0 and |x|=1/2, the function is 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph is a V shape peaking at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2,0), then up again. So, yes, it's a diamond shape.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So same idea, but shifted less. Let me think.

For x >=0, |x| is x, so g(x) = |x - 1/4|.

At x=0: |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

x=1/4: 0.

x=1/2: |1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

x=1: |1 -1/4|=3/4.

Wait, so for x between 0 and 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - x, which is a line with slope -1 from (0,1/4) to (1/4,0). Then, from x=1/4 to x=3/4, it's x -1/4, slope +1, from 0 to 1/2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when x >=1/4, g(x) = |x -1/4| = x -1/4. So, at x=1/2, it's 1/2 -1/4=1/4. At x=3/4, it's 3/4 -1/4=1/2. So the graph of g(x) is a V-shape with vertex at (1/4, 0), going up on both sides to (0,1/4) and (1/2,1/4), etc. Wait, no, for x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 -x, so it's decreasing, and for x >=1/4, it's x -1/4, increasing. So, the graph looks like a V with the vertex at (1/4, 0), and it goes up to (0,1/4) and (1/2, 1/4), then continues up to higher values as x increases beyond 1/2. Wait, but x beyond 1/2 would be x=1, which is 3/4, as I saw before. Hmm, okay.

So, f(x) and g(x) are both piecewise linear functions with V shapes.

Now, the functions y and x in the problem involve compositions of these functions with sine and cosine terms.

First, let's consider y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me see what this function looks like.

Breaking it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, because 2πx completes a cycle every x=1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with period 1.

2. Apply f to sin(2πx): f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

3. Then apply g to that result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = || || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

4. Then multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))).

Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's parse that.

1. cos(3πy): cosine function with period 2/3, because 3πy completes a cycle every y=2/3. So, it's oscillating between -1 and 1, with a period of 2/3.

2. Apply f to cos(3πy): f(cos(3πy)) = || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |.

3. Apply g to that: g(f(cos(3πy))) = || || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

4. Multiply by 4: x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, both y and x are functions of each other, involving these transformations.

Since both equations are functions where y is expressed in terms of x, and x in terms of y, the problem is to find all points (x, y) where both equations hold.

This seems like a system of equations, and the solutions are the intersections.

But solving this algebraically seems complicated because of the nested functions and trigonometric functions.

Perhaps a better approach is to analyze the ranges and periods, and then see how many times the functions can intersect within their periods.

Let me think about the range of each function.

First, let's find the range of g(f(sin(2πx))).

Start with sin(2πx) which ranges from -1 to 1.

Then, f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

What's the range of that?

The inner |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then, g is applied to this. So g(z) where z is between 0 and 1/2.

g(z) = | |z| - 1/4 |. Since z is non-negative, this is |z - 1/4|.

So, for z between 0 and 1/2:

- When z < 1/4, |z - 1/4| = 1/4 - z. So, this ranges from 1/4 (when z=0) down to 0 (when z=1/4).

- When z >=1/4, |z -1/4| = z - 1/4. So, this ranges from 0 (at z=1/4) up to 1/4 (when z=1/2).

So, overall, g(z) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Then, multiplying by 4: 4 * g(z) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1. So, the possible y values are between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for x =
