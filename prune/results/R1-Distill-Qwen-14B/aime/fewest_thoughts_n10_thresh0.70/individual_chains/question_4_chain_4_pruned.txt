Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. These problems usually involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, Alice starts first. If n is 1, Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Similarly, if n is 4, Alice can take all 4 and win. So n=4 is also a winning position for Alice.

Wait, but Bob wants to have a winning strategy. So Bob needs to find positions where, regardless of Alice's move, he can always respond in a way that eventually leads him to take the last token.

Let me think about small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's list n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The player whose turn it is wants to make moves that leave the opponent in an L position.

n=0: This is an invalid state because there are no tokens to take. But if a player is forced to move when n=0, they lose. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: Current player can take 1 and win. So W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So taking 1 is bad. Alternatively, can they take 4? No, because 2 <4. So only option is 1, which loses. Wait, no, if n=2, the current player takes 1, opponent is left with n=1. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So if current player takes 1, opponent wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Because the only move leads to opponent winning. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait no, the current player's move leads to opponent's winning position, so the current player is in a losing position. So n=2: L.

Wait, let's think again. If n=2 is your turn, you have to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So yes, n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is an L position for the opponent. So if you leave opponent in L, you win. So n=3 is a W position.

n=4: Current player can take all 4 tokens and win. So W.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is a W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is also a W for the opponent. So all possible moves lead to opponent being able to win. So n=5 is L.

n=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L), so opponent is in losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (W), or 4, leaving 3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W, so n=7 is L.

Wait, no. Let me check: If n=7, you can take 1, leaving 6 for opponent. 6 is a W position, meaning opponent can win from there. Or take 4, leaving 3, which is a W position as well. So no matter what you do, the opponent can win, so n=7 is L.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L). So opponent is in losing position. Therefore, n=8 is W.

n=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W); or take 4, leaving 5 (L). So if you take 4, opponent is left with 5 (L), so you can force a win. So n=9 is W.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, if I'm at n=9, I can take 4 and leave 5, which is L for the opponent. So n=9 is W.

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, n=5 is L, so if from n=9, you take 4, leaving 5 (L), so opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=9 is W.

n=10: Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W); or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So both options leave opponent in W positions
