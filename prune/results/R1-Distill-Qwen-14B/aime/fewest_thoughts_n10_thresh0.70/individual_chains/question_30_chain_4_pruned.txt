Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. That seems a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity since ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 1 to 12 are all distinct roots. So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually, cyclotomic polynomials are minimal polynomials for primitive roots. So Φ₁₃(x) is indeed x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime.

But I'm not sure yet how that relates to the product I have. The product is over k=0 to 12, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, right? So let's compute the term when k=0. Plugging in k=0, we get 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term for k=0 is 1. That means the product is just 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So maybe I can focus on the product from k=1 to 12.

Now, let's look at the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I can factor out a 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite the term as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, perhaps that's a quadratic in ω^k?

Let me think. Let me set z = ω^k. So for each k, z is a primitive 13th root of unity because k is from 1 to 12. So z^13 = 1, and z ≠ 1.

So the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². Let's write that as z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in z. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

Wait, let me compute the discriminant: D = ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± i√4]/2 = [2 ±
