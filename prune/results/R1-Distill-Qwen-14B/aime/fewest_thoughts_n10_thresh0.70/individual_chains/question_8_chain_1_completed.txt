Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given. The first equation is straightforward—it's a linear equation in three variables. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a way to express it in terms of the first equation.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Wait, let's see: a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems right because a²b + a²c is a²(b + c), and similarly for the others. So, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Simplify each term: 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, if I factor out the 300, it becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, that gives me:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc. Then, from the above, a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

Now, back to the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can express a³ + b³ + c³ using the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc
Which is S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3.

Plugging in S1=300, this becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.

So, substituting back into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600S2.

Next, 300³ is 27,000,000. So, the expression becomes:

27,000,000 - 600S2 - [27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000.

Let's distribute the negative sign inside the brackets:

27,000,000 - 600S2 -27,000,000 + 900S2 - 3S3 = 6,000,000.

Simplify the terms:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600S2 + 900S2) -3S3 = 6,000,000.

So, 0 + 300S2 -3S3 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, the equation simplifies to S2 = (S3 + 2,000,000)/100.

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, 100S2 = S3 + 2,000,000 → S2 = (S3 + 2,000,000)/100.

Hmm. So, now I have two variables, S2 and S3, with this relationship.

But I need another equation to relate S2 and S3. Well, perhaps I can use the fact that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, which might mean that the variables are constrained in some way.

Wait, but maybe I can express everything in terms of S2 and S3, but maybe it's better to consider the original variables.

Alternatively, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, perhaps I can think about the possible values of a, b, c that would make the second equation hold.

But that seems too vague. Maybe another approach is to consider symmetric functions or to assume that two variables are equal, which could reduce the problem.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the problem in terms of symmetric variables, but perhaps it's more manageable to consider specific cases where one of the variables is zero, or two are equal, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so maybe the variables can be zero, but when some variables are zero, the equation may simplify.

Let me see. Suppose one of the variables is zero, say c = 0.

Then, a + b = 300 and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0 + 0 = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So, a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

We can solve for a and b. Let me see: the quadratic equation is x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Calculate discriminant: 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100, so x = [300 ± 100]/2 → x = 200 or x = 100.

So, a and b can be 200 and 100 in some order. So, when c=0, the possible triples are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and permutations where c=0, but wait, since c is zero, the other two variables can be arranged in two ways. So, 2 triples where c=0. Similarly, if a=0 or b=0, we would get similar cases. So, let's compute how many cases where one variable is zero.

Wait, but wait a second: if a=0, then the equation becomes 0 + 0 + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + 0 + c²b = b²c + bc² = bc(b + c).

But a=0, so b + c = 300. So, equation becomes bc*300 = 6,000,000 → bc = 20,000.

Same as before, so b and c satisfy b + c = 300 and bc=20,000. Which gives solutions b=200, c=100 and b=100, c=200.

So, when a=0, we get two triples: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200).

Similarly, when b=0, we get two triples: (200,0,100) and (100,0,200).

So, for each variable being zero, we have two triples, and there are three variables, so 3*2=6 triples where one variable is zero.

Wait, but wait a minute: earlier, when c=0, we had (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly for the others. So, that's 6 distinct triples where one variable is zero.

So, 6 solutions come from the cases where one variable is zero.

Now, what about the cases where all variables are positive integers, i.e., a, b, c ≥ 1.

In that case, perhaps I can find a way to model the problem.

Wait, let me go back to the equation I had: 100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, S2 is ab + bc + ca, and S3 is abc.

So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm. Let me rearrange this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this equation.

Wait, let's see: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me factor out ab: ab(100 - c) + bc(100) + ca(100) = 2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

ab(c - 100) + bc(c - 100) + ca(c -100) = ?

Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe consider symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that a, b, c are positive integers, and a + b + c = 300, so maybe each of them is at least 1, up to 297, depending on the others.

Wait, perhaps I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, and x, y, z ≥ 1, x + y + z = 300, and xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) = -2,000,000.

Wait, but that might not be helpful either.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider substituting variables to make the equation more manageable.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Let me divide both sides by abc:

1 = 100(1/c + 1/a + 1/b) - 2,000,000/(abc).

Hmm, not sure if that helps either.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can let a, b, c be variables such that a ≤ b ≤ c, and find possible triples, then account for permutations.

But with a + b + c = 300, and the other equation, perhaps it's better to find possible a, b, c such that 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = something.

Wait, let me check: (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000.

Wait, but from our equation, abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

So, substituting, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = (abc - 100(ab + bc + ca)) + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000.

Which is (-2,000,000) + 10,000*(300) - 1,000,000.

Calculating that: -2,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

So, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the product (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) equals zero. Which means that at least one of the terms (a - 100), (b - 100), or (c - 100) must be zero.

So, that implies that at least one of a, b, c is equal to 100.

Hmm, that's a crucial observation. So, if (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0, then either a=100, b=100, or c=100.

So, that gives us three cases to consider:

1. a = 100
2. b = 100
3. c = 100

But we need to remember that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and a + b + c = 300.

Wait, but in the case where one variable is 100, we can express the other two variables in terms of the remaining sum.

For example, if a = 100, then b + c = 200.

And the second equation, when a=100, let's see:

The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Substituting a=100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b.

Compute each term:

100²b = 10,000b
100²c = 10,000c
b²*100 = 100b²
b²c = b²c
c²*100 = 100c²
c²b = c²b

So, summing all terms:

10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b.

Let me factor where possible:

10,000(b + c) + 100(b² + c²) + bc(b + c).

Since b + c = 200, as a=100, so substituting:

10,000*200 + 100(b² + c²) + bc*200.

Which is 2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200bc.

So, the equation becomes:

2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200bc = 6,000,000.

Subtract 2,000,000 from both sides:

100(b² + c²) + 200bc = 4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

b² + c² + 2bc = 40,000.

Note that b² + c² + 2bc = (b + c)^2, so:

(b + c)^2 = 40,000.

Taking square root:

b + c = 200, which is consistent with a=100.

So, (b + c)^2 = 40,000 → 200² = 40,000. So, that checks out.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to give any new information since b + c is already 200. So, perhaps this approach isn't helpful. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since a=100, and b + c = 200, then the equation reduces to:

100*(b² + c²) + 200bc = 4,000,000.

Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, after substituting a=100 and b + c = 200, the equation becomes:

10,000(b + c) + 100(b² + c²) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.

Which is 2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200bc = 6,000,000.

So, 100(b² + c²) + 200 bc = 4,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

b² + c² + 2bc = 40,000.

Which is (b + c)^2 = 40,000 → 200^2 = 40,000. So, this is always true when b + c = 200. So, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy this condition when a=100.

Wait, so that suggests that when a=100, any pair (b, c) with b + c=200 will satisfy both equations. So, the number of solutions in this case is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + c = 200.

Which is 201, since b can range from 0 to 200, and c=200 - b.

But wait, earlier when I considered the case where a=100, what about the second equation? It seems that any b and c adding to 200 will satisfy the second equation when a=100. So, does that mean that all these triples are valid?

Wait, but earlier, when I considered when a=0, I found specific solutions, but here, when a=100, it's a different case.

Wait, but when a=100, the second equation is satisfied for any b and c such that b + c=200. So, the number of solutions when a=100 is 201, since b can be 0 to 200, and c=200 - b.

Similarly, when b=100, the same logic applies: a + c = 200, and the second equation is satisfied for any a and c that sum to 200. So, the number of solutions is 201.

Similarly, when c=100, a + b = 200, and the second equation is satisfied for any a and b summing to 200. So, 201 solutions.

But wait, wait a second. Wait, these cases might overlap. For example, when a=100, b=100, and c=100, that would be a solution where a=100, but also b=100 and c=100. So, I need to make sure I'm not overcounting.

Wait, but when a=100, b=100 is allowed, and c=100. But let me check if that satisfies the second equation.

Wait, when a=100, b=100, c=100, a + b + c=300, which is correct. Then, the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term would be 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 + 100²*100 = 6*(100^3) = 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000, which matches the condition. So, (100,100,100) is a valid solution.

But now, when I count the number of solutions where a=100, I include the case where b=100 and c=100, right? Similarly for the other cases.

So, if I just add up the cases where a=100, b=100, and c=100, each giving 201 solutions, I would get 3*201=603 solutions. But this counts the cases where two variables are 100 multiple times. For example, (100,100,100) is counted three times—once in each case.

Similarly, cases where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 (but that's the same as all three being 100). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to count all solutions where at least one variable is 100, using inclusion-exclusion.

Number of solutions where a=100: 201 (as found earlier).

Similarly, number where b=100:201, and c=100:201.

Now, the intersections: when a=100 and b=100, then c=300 - 100 -100=100. So, that's only one solution: (100,100,100).

Similarly, when a=100 and c=100, b=100. And when b=100 and c=100, a=100. So, each pair of variables being 100 leads to the same solution.

So, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 is:

Total = (3 * 201) - (3 * 1) + (0), since all three being 100 is already counted in the pairwise overlaps.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Here, |A| is the number of solutions where a=100: 201.

Similarly, |B|=201, |C|=201.

The intersections |A ∩ B| is the number of solutions where a=100 and b=100: which is 1, since c=100.

Similarly, |A ∩ C|=1 and |B ∩ C|=1.

And |A ∩ B ∩ C|=1, the solution where a=b=c=100.

So, putting it all together:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 - 3 +1 = 601.

Wait, let me compute that again:

201*3 = 603.

Subtract 3 intersections each of size 1: 603 -3 = 600.

Add back the triple intersection: 600 +1=601.

So, 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100.

Wait, but earlier we found that when a variable is zero, we have 6 solutions. Wait, but are those overlapping with the cases where a variable is 100?

No, because when a variable is zero, another variable is 200, which isn't 100. So, these are separate cases.

Wait, but wait: when a=0, then we have solutions where a=0, b=200, c=100. But a=0 is not 100, so no overlap.

So, the total number of solutions would be the 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100, plus the 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

Wait, but hold on: when a variable is zero, it's possible that another variable is 100, but in our earlier case, when a=0, b=200, c=100, then c=100, which is included in the 601.

So, that would mean that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are already included in the 601.

Wait, let me check: when a=0, b=200, c=100. So, c=100. So, this solution is counted in the cases where c=100. Similarly, a=0, b=100, c=200 is counted in the cases where b=100.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when a=0, the other variables are 200 and 100, but the cases where a variable is 100 include all possibilities where a=100, regardless of the other variables. So, when a=0, and c=100, that's included in the c=100 case, which is part of the 601.

So, this suggests that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are already included in the 601.

But wait, that can't be, because when a=0, the variables are 0, 200, 100, which doesn't have any variable being 100 except c=100. So, that solution is included in the c=100 case, which is part of the 601.

Wait, but that would mean that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are already included in the 601, so I shouldn't count them separately. Hence, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, earlier I thought that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are separate, but perhaps they are included in the 601.

Wait, let's take an example: (0, 200, 100). Here, c=100, so this is included in the cases where c=100. The number of solutions where c=100 is 201, which includes all (a, b, 100) where a + b = 200. So, in this case, when a=0, b=200, it's one of those 201 solutions.

Similarly, when a=100, b=0, c=200, this is included in the a=100 case, which is part of the 601.

So, the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are already included in the 601.

Wait, but wait, let me think. When a=100, b can range from 0 to 200, with c=200 - b. So, when b=0, c=200, giving the solution (100, 0, 200). Similarly, when b=200, c=0, giving (100, 200, 0). So, these are part of the 201 solutions when a=100.

Similarly, when b=100, a can range from 0 to 200, leading to solutions like (0, 100, 200) and (200,100,0), which are part of the 201 solutions when b=100.

Similarly, when c=100, a can range from 0 to 200, leading to solutions like (0,200,100) and (200,0,100), which are part of the 201 solutions when c=100.

So, the 6 solutions where a variable is zero are included in the 601 count. Therefore, when I add the 601, I already include those 6 solutions.

Wait, but wait, let me check: When a=100, and b=0, then c=200, which is one solution. Similarly, when a=100, b=200, c=0, another solution. So, each of these is included in the a=100 case. So, the 2 solutions where a=100 and another variable is zero are included.

Similarly, for b=100 and c=100 cases, each has two solutions where another variable is zero. So, in total, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero are included within the 601.

So, I don't need to add them again. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero were separate, but now I see that they are included in the 601.

Wait, but when I calculated the 601, I included all solutions where at least one variable is 100, which includes those where another variable is zero. So, perhaps the correct total is 601.

But wait, let me check with a specific example: the solution (100,100,100) is included in all three cases, but it's only one solution. So, the inclusion-exclusion correctly counts it once.

Another example: (100, 0, 200) is included in the a=100 case, as b=0, c=200.

Similarly, (100, 200, 0) is included in the a=100 case, as b=200, c=0.

Similarly, (0, 100, 200) is included in the b=100 case, as a=0, c=200.

And so on.

So, all the 6 solutions where one variable is zero are included in the 601.

Thus, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case where a variable is zero, I found 6 solutions, but now I'm seeing that those are included in the 601. So, the total is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure that when a variable is 100, we don't have any other constraints beyond a + b + c=300 and the second equation.

Wait, because when a=100, the second equation is satisfied for any b and c adding to 200, as we saw earlier. So, any triple where a=100, and b + c=200 is a solution. Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

So, the count for a=100 is 201 solutions, as b can be from 0 to 200. So, that includes cases where b is 0, which gives us (100, 0, 200), which is one of the 6 solutions I initially found.

So, the conclusion is that all the solutions where at least one variable is 100 (including those where another variable is zero) are included in the 601 count. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach.

Another approach: since (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100)=0, that implies that at least one of the variables is 100. So, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, or one variable is zero? Wait no, in the earlier analysis, we saw that if one variable is zero, another variable is 100, but that's because when (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100)=0, it's because at least one is 100, but variables can be zero as long as another is 100 to satisfy the equation.

Wait, no. Wait, when a=0, (a -100) = -100, so the product becomes (-100)(b-100)(c-100). For this product to be zero, either (b-100)=0 or (c-100)=0. So, in the case when a=0, either b=100 or c=100.

Which is exactly what we saw earlier, that when a=0, b and c must be 200 and 100, so either b=100 or c=100.

Therefore, the only solutions are those where at least one variable is 100, which is exactly the 601 cases we calculated.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the 6 solutions where a variable is zero were separate, but now I see that they are included in the 601.

So, the final answer is 601.

Wait, but let me just make sure there are no other solutions. Because when (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100)=0, it's necessary that at least one variable is 100. So, any solution must have at least one variable equal to 100. Therefore, all solutions are accounted for in the 601 cases.

Hence, the number of triples is 601.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

First, we rewrite the second equation as:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000.
\]
Using \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\), leading to:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.
\]
Expressing \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) using the identity \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\), we substitute \(a + b + c = 300\) and simplify to find:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.
\]
Factoring, we find \((a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0\), implying at least one of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) must be 100.

We then count the number of solutions where at least one variable is 100. For each variable set to 100, the other two variables sum to 200, yielding 201 solutions per case. Using inclusion-exclusion, we account for overlaps:
- Each variable being 100 contributes 201 solutions.
- Subtracting overlaps where two variables are 100 (each overlap counted once in two cases), we subtract 3 overlaps.
- Adding back the case where all three are 100, we get:
\[
3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 601.
\]
Thus, the total number of triples is \(\boxed{601}\).
