Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, rectangular boxes... so they have length, width, and height, which I can denote as x, y, z. The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. The volume (V) is xyz = 23. I remember that the surface area and volume are related to each other, so maybe I can find some relationship between x, y, z.

Now, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So I need to find the minimum possible value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²), which would give me the minimum radius, and then square it.

But wait, to minimize r², I need to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints of surface area and volume. So the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This sounds like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I should use Lagrange multipliers or maybe some inequalities like AM ≥ GM or something else. Let me think.

I recall that for positive numbers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM-QM (Arithmetic Mean - Quadratic Mean) inequality might be useful here, but I'm not sure how to apply them directly. Alternatively, maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume.

Let me write down the given:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27
2. xyz = 23

I need to minimize x² + y² + z². Hmm, I remember that x² + y² + z² can be related to (x + y + z)², but that involves another variable. Let me express (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So (x + y + z)^2 = (x² + y² + z²) + 2*27 = x² + y² + z² + 54. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So if I can find the minimum value of (x + y + z)^2, then I can find the minimum of x² + y² + z². Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to minimize (x + y + z), but I'm not certain.

Wait, but since I have two constraints, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0
h(x, y,
