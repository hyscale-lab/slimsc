Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula. Maybe that can help me relate x and y. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can simplify these equations using logarithm properties. For the first equation, log_x(y^x), I know that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So applying that here, it becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait, so now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other, right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k. That might help me simplify.

Let me define k as log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

So now I have two equations:

1. xk = 10 --> x = 10 / k
2. (4y)/k = 10 --> 4y = 10k --> y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2

So I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. Maybe I can find k by using the relationship between x and y.

Wait, another property of logarithms: Since k = log_x(y), that means y = x^k. Because if log_x(y) = k, then x^k = y.

So now, from y = x^k, and I also have y = (5k)/2 from the second equation. So I can set them equal:

x^k = (5k)/2

But I also know that x = 10 / k from the first equation. So substitute x here:

(10 / k)^k = (5k)/2

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking natural log on both sides:

ln[(10 / k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2]

Simplify the left side:

k * ln(10 / k) = ln(5k / 2)

Let me
