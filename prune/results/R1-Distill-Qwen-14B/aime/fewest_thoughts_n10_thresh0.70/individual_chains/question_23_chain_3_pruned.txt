Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus inscribed on it. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the supremum of BD², the square of the length of one of the diagonals, and then the greatest number less than that.

First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² = 1 has two asymptotes y = ±(b/a)x. For this hyperbola, a² is 20, so a is √20, and b² is 24, so b is √24. The asymptotes are therefore y = ±(√24/√20)x. Simplifying that, √24 is 2√6 and √20 is 2√5, so the asymptotes are y = ±(√6/√5)x. Okay, that's useful.

Now, a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and whose diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, hold on, I think I might be confusing with a kite. Let me check: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only bisectors but they are also perpendicular. So yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that means that the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees and each diagonal is cut into two equal parts by the other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

So, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, if I denote the coordinates of points as A, B, C, D, then because the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of A and C would be negatives of each other, same with B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily along the axes, so maybe that's not the case. Hmm, wait, no. The diagonals intersect at the origin, but they might not be aligned with the axes. So, points A, C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B, D are endpoints of the other diagonal. But since the diagonals bisect each other, the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD.

Therefore, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). So, the four points are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v). Now, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distances between consecutive points should be equal.

So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which should equal the distance between C and D, which equals the distance between D and A. So, |AB|
