Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to figure out how many ways I can place some of them on the grid following certain rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says each cell can have at most one chip. That makes sense, so no two chips in the same cell. Then, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for any row, if there are any chips in that row, they must all be either white or black. Similarly, for any column, if there are any chips in that column, they must all be the same color.

Wait, but the chips in a row and the chips in a column must each have uniform color, but the rows and columns can have different colors, right? So, for example, one row could be all white, and the column intersecting that row could be all black. But that might cause a conflict at the intersection cell. Wait, but each cell can only have one chip, so if a cell is part of a row and a column, both of which have chips, the color of that cell's chip must satisfy both the row's color and the column's color. So, in other words, if a row is colored white and a column is colored black, their intersection cell must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, that cell can't have a chip at all. So, that means that the only way this works is if the rows and columns that have chips agree on the color at their intersections.

Wait, so maybe the entire grid's colored regions must be rectangles where the color is consistent both row-wise and column-wise. Hmm, that's a bit abstract. Let me think about this.

Suppose I decide that certain rows are white and others are black, and similarly for columns. Then, for a cell to have a chip, the row's color and the column's color must be the same. Otherwise, that cell cannot have a chip. So, the grid is divided into regions where the rows and columns that have chips are all the same color.

Wait, another way to think about this is that the set of rows with chips and the set of columns
