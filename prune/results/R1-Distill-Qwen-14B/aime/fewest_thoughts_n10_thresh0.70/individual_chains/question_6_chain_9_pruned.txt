Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions f(x) and g(x). The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both of these are absolute value functions with some transformations. Absolute value functions are V-shaped, and when you have nested absolute values, it can create more complex V-shapes or even piecewise linear functions.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) mentally. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

- The inner absolute value |x| makes a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting 1/2 shifts this V down by 1/2, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, any negative part will flip up.
- So, where does |x| - 1/2 become negative? When |x| < 1/2. So for x between -1/2 and 1/2, the expression inside the outer absolute value is negative. Taking the absolute value of that will reflect it above the x-axis, making a V that peaks at (0, 1/2) and has vertices at x = ±1/2, y=0. So f(x) is a "W" shape between -1/2 and 1/2, and V-shaped outside that.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:

- The inner |x| is the same V-shape, vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting 1/4 shifts it down to (0, -1/4).
- The outer absolute value will flip the part where |x| < 1/4. So between x = -1/4 and 1/4, the graph is V-shaped with vertex at (0, 1/4), and outside that range, it's a V-shape starting from x=±1/4, y=0.

Okay, so both f and g are piecewise linear with different turning points.

Now, the problem involves compositions of these functions: f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(...)), so it's going to get a bit nested. Let's parse the functions:

The first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

The second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

We need to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs. That is, points (a,b) where a=4g(f(cos(3πb))) and b=4g(f(sin(2πa))).

This seems quite involved, so maybe I can tackle each function step by step.

Let me first understand the range of the inner functions.

First, considering sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Both sin and cos functions have outputs between -1 and 1. So sin(2πx) ∈ [-1,1], and cos(3πy) ∈ [-1,1].

But since both f and g take absolute values, their inputs are non-negative.

Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, so f takes any real x, but since the inner |x| is non-negative, the next absolute value will also be non-negative.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, which is always non-negative.

So when we have f(sin(2πx)), sin(2πx) can be negative, but the absolute value inside f will make it positive. So f(sin(2πx)) is f applied to a value between 0 and 1.

Wait, sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. So the input to f is between 0 and 1.

Similarly, f(cos(3πy)) is ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, and since |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, the input to f is between 0 and 1.

So let's analyze f(t) where t is between 0 and 1.

f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|, but since t is non-negative, it's |t - 1/2|.

So f(t) is |t - 1/2|. Since t is between 0 and 1, this is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and it increases linearly to f(0)=1/2 and f(1)=1/2.

So f(t) for t ∈ [0,1] is 1/2 - |t - 1/2|.

Wait, no, |t - 1/2|. So when t < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - t; when t ≥ 1/2, f(t) = t - 1/2.

So f(t) is a V with the minimum at t=1/2, f(t)=0, and maximums at t=0 and t=1, f(t)=1/2.

Similarly, g(t) for t ∈ [0,1]:

g(t) = ||t| - 1/4| = |t - 1/4| because t is non-negative.

So g(t) is |t - 1/4|, which is a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0, and increasing on either side. So at t=0, g(t)=1/4; at t=1/4, g(t)=0; at t=1, g(t)=3/4.

Wait, no, wait a second: |t - 1/4|. So for t < 1/4, it's 1/4 - t; for t ≥ 1/4, it's t - 1/4.

So yeah, it's a V-shape with vertex at t=1/4, g(t)=0, and points at t=0: g(t)=1/4; t=1/4: g(t)=0; t=1: g(t)=3/4.

So now, let's think about the composition 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

First, let's compute f(sin(2πx)):

As established, sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, but since we're taking absolute value, it's 0 to 1. So f(sin(2πx)) is | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |, which as we saw is |t - 1/2| where t is between 0 and 1
