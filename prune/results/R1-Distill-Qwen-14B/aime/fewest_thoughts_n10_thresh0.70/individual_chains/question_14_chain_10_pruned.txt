Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I'm looking for a four-digit number, so N is between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N, and for each digit position, replace it with 1, the resulting number should be a multiple of 7.

So, N has four digits: let's say N is represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Then, replacing A with 1 gives 1BCD, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. Since it's the greatest four-digit number, I probably want to maximize N as much as possible. So, I should start by considering the largest four-digit numbers and check whether they satisfy the given condition. But that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the divisibility rule for 7. Divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as some other rules, but one method involves taking the last digit, doubling it, subtracting it from the rest of the number, and seeing if the result is divisible by 7. However, applying this rule repeatedly for each modified number might be tedious, especially since we have four modified numbers to check each time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem using modular arithmetic. If changing each digit to 1 leads to a multiple of 7, then each of these modified numbers is congruent to 0 modulo 7. So, for each digit replacement, (N with digit i replaced by 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me express this more formally. Let’s denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 because it's a four-digit number.

Then, replacing the thousands digit (a) with 1 gives 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7, so:

1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, replacing the hundreds digit (b) with 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must also be divisible by 7:

1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Replacing the tens digit (c) with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. So,

1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Replacing the units digit (d) with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Thus,

1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So now we have four congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

And N itself is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, which is not necessarily divisible by 7, but each of these modified numbers is.

Let me compute the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7 to simplify these equations.

Calculating:

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 ÷ 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 - 98 = 2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7 is 1 with remainder 3, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

And 1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, substituting these into the four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So now, I have four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

So, the four equations are:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7

3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7

4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

Hmm, that's a system of four congruences with four variables: a, b, c, d. But since a, b, c, d are digits, they can be from 0 to 9, with a ≥ 1.

I need to solve this system to find a, b, c, d.

Let me try to express these equations to relate them.

First, let me note Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1.

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5.

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4.

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation 1: (6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7

Simplify: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

So, 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7. Let me write this as:

6a - 2b = 4 + 7k, where k is some integer.

Similarly, Equation 3 is 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4.

From Equation 1, I have 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1, so d ≡ 1 - 2b - 3c mod 7.

I can substitute d into Equation 3.

Substituting d into Equation 3:

6a + 2b + (1 - 2b - 3c) ≡ 4 mod 7.

Simplify: 6a + 2b + 1 - 2b - 3c ≡ 4 → 6a - 3c + 1 ≡ 4 → 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, 6a - 3c ≡ 3 mod 7. Let me note this as Equation 5.

Also, Equation 4 is 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7.

From Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6.

Let me see if I can combine this with Equation 5, which is 6a - 3c ≡ 3.

If I subtract Equation 5 from Equation 4:

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (6a - 3c) ≡ 6 - 3 mod 7

Simplify: 6a - 6a + 2b + 3c + 3c ≡ 3 mod 7 → 2b + 6c ≡ 3 mod 7.

So, 2b + 6c ≡ 3 mod 7.

I can factor this as 2(b + 3c) ≡ 3 mod 7.

Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 7. The inverse of 2 mod 7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides by 4: (b + 3c) ≡ 3*4 mod7 → b + 3c ≡12 mod7 → 12 mod7 is 5. So, b + 3c ≡5 mod7.

Let me note this as Equation 6: b + 3c ≡5 mod7.

Earlier, from Equation 5, I had 6a -3c ≡3 mod7. Let me write this as 6a ≡3c +3 mod7.

Which is equivalent to 6a ≡3(c +1) mod7.

Since 6 and 7 are coprime, I can multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, because 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides by 6: a ≡6*3(c +1) mod7→ 18(c +1) mod7.

But 18 mod7 is 4, since 2*7=14, 18-14=4. So, a ≡4*(c +1) mod7.

Therefore, a ≡4c +4 mod7. Let me write this as a ≡4c +4 mod7. Equation 7.

So, from Equation 7, a is congruent to 4c +4 mod7. Since a is a digit from 1 to 9, let's think about possible c values and what a could be.

Similarly, from Equation 6: b ≡5 -3c mod7.

So, b is congruent to 5 -3c mod7. Since b is a digit from 0 to9, we can find possible b for each c.

Additionally, from Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

And from Equation 3, we had d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

From Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 → d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

So, d is determined once we know b and c.

But d must be a digit (0-9), so d ≡ (1 -2b -3c) mod7.

But since d is a digit, its value is between 0 and9, so we can compute d as (1 -2b -3c +7k) where k is chosen so that d is in 0-9.

Alternatively, since d ≡ (1 -2b -3c) mod7, and d must be between 0 and9, d is equal to (1 -2b -3c) +7m for some integer m such that 0 ≤d ≤9.

But perhaps I can express d in terms of b and c: d = (1 -2b -3c) mod7, but considering the possible range.

Alternatively, perhaps we can just express d
