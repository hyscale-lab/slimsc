Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, there are 900 residents total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that means everyone owns at least one thing. Interesting.

Now, the other items are diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. So, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own garden spades. Plus, everyone owns the candy hearts.

The problem also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four. Oh right, because each person owns at least the candy hearts, so the four items include that.

Wait, I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall the formula for four sets. But wait, in this case, everyone owns the candy hearts, which is like a fourth set. So maybe it's four sets, but let's think about it.

Let me denote the sets. Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring, B those with golf clubs, C those with garden spades, and D those with candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, D is the universal set here. So, all 900 are in D.

Now, the problem gives the numbers: |A|=195, |B|=367, |C|=562, and |D|=900. Also, the number of people who own exactly two things is 437, and exactly three things is 234. I need to find the number who own all four, which is |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

Wait, but since D is everyone, the intersections like A ∩ D are just A. So, maybe I can think of this as three sets A, B, C, within the universal set D.

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B|
