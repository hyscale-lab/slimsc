Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is this special point on segment AB. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the setup. We have points O at the origin (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points. 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. Because it's a unit length, the distance formula must satisfy sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, right? So, p² + q² = 1. That makes sense.

So, F is all such segments PQ in the first quadrant that are of unit length. Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is part of F, right? Because let me check: the distance from O to A is 1/2, and from O to B is sqrt(3)/2. Wait, but the distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with A on the x-axis and B on the y-axis. So AB is part of the family F. So, C is a point on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F.

Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q.

So, how do I approach this? Hmm.

I think the key is that point C is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, C shouldn't be on it. So, perhaps C is where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F, or something like that.

Wait, so if I think about all these segments PQ, each of length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis, they form a kind of envelope. The point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if AB is tangent, then C is the only point of intersection between AB and the envelope, so it won't lie on any other PQ in F.

So, maybe I need to find the envelope of the family F. Then find where AB is tangent to that envelope, and that tangent point is C.

To find the envelope, I can use calculus. The envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by the family and the derivative with respect to the parameter.

But wait, in this case, the family is parametrized by the position of P and Q on the axes, with the condition that PQ has length 1. So, each PQ can be represented as x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1. Because the segment from (p,0) to (0,q) has equation x/p + y/q = 1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. For a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), the equation is indeed x/p + y/q = 1. So, the family F can be represented by the equation x/p + y/q = 1, with the constraint that p² + q² = 1.

So, the envelope is found by solving for p and q in the system:

1. x/p + y/q = 1
2. p² + q² = 1

And also, the derivative condition:

d/dp (x/p + y/q - 1) = 0, since the envelope is where the derivative with respect to the parameter (here, p) is zero.

Wait, actually, in the standard method for finding an envelope, for a family of curves defined by F(x,y,p)=0, the envelope is found by solving F(x,y,p)=0 and dF/dp = 0.

So, in this case, F(x,y,p) = x/p + y/q - 1, but q is dependent on p through p² + q² =1, so q = sqrt(1 - p²). Hmm, maybe I can express everything in terms of p.

So, let me write F(x,y,p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 = 0.

Then, the derivative dF/dp should be zero.

Let's compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( (1/2)(-2p)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) ) / (sqrt(1 - p²)) )

Wait, no, let me compute it more carefully.

F(x,y,p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1.

So, dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( derivative of (1 - p²)^(-1/2) w.r. to p )

The derivative of (1 - p²)^(-1/2) with respect to p is (-1/2)(-2p)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) ) = p/(1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, dF/dp = -x/p² + y * [ p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ].

So, setting dF/dp = 0:

-x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So, rearranged:

y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p².

Hmm. So, now we have two equations:

1. x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1
2. y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p²

We can try to solve these equations for x and y in terms of p.

Let me denote q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, then equation 1 becomes x/p + y/q = 1.

Equation 2: y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = x/p².

But 1 - p² = q², so equation 2 becomes y p / q³ = x/p².

So, equation 2: y p / q³ = x / p².

Let me solve equation 1 for y:

y = (1 - x/p) * q.

Substitute this into equation 2:

[ (1 - x/p) * q ] * p / q³ = x / p².

Simplify:

(1 - x/p) * p / q² = x / p².

Multiply both sides by q²:

(1 - x/p) * p = x q² / p².

Simplify left side: (p - x) = x q² / p².

Multiply both sides by p²:

p³ - p² x = x q².

But q² = 1 - p², so:

p³ - p² x = x (1 - p²).

Bring all terms to one side:

p³ - p² x - x + p² x = 0.

Wait, that simplifies to:

p³ - x = 0.

So, x = p³.

Hmm, interesting. So, from this, we have x = p³.

Then, from equation 1:

x/p + y/q = 1.

Since x = p³, this becomes p³/p + y/q = 1 => p² + y/q = 1.

So, y/q = 1 - p².

But q = sqrt(1 - p²), so y = q (1 - p²) = sqrt(1 - p²) * (1 - p²) = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, the envelope is parametrized by x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, that's the parametric equation for the envelope of the family F.

Therefore, the envelope is the curve traced by (p³, (1 - p²)^(3/2)) for p in (0,1).

Hmm, that's interesting. So, the envelope is a curve, and AB is a line that is tangent to this envelope at point C.

So, point C lies on AB and is the point where AB touches the envelope. So, to find C, I need to find the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equation of AB and then find the point of tangency with the envelope.

First, let me find the equation of AB.

Points A and B are given. Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the line AB can be found using two-point form.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the slope is -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2).

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, our aim is to find point C on AB such that C is also on the envelope of F, and it's the only such point (other than A and B, but those are endpoints). Wait, but we already know that AB is part of F, so maybe the envelope is tangent to AB at point C, which is not A or B.

Wait, perhaps
