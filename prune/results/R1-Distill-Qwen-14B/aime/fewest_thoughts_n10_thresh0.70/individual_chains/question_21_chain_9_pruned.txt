Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what this means and how to approach solving it.

The problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

Our goal is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the minimal b for which the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.

Alright, let's break down what it means for a number to be two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number would be of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals sqrt(n). So, a + c = sqrt(n). Since n is a positive integer, sqrt(n) must also be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Let me denote k = sqrt(n). So, n = k^2, and a + c = k.

So, from n = a*b + c, substituting n = k^2 and c = k - a, we get:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Let me rearrange this:

k^2 = a*b + k - a

Let's bring all terms to one side:

a*b - a + (k^2 - k) = 0

Factor a out of the first two terms:

a*(b - 1) + (k^2 - k) = 0

Wait, that might not help much. Alternatively, let's solve for a:

k^2 = a*b + k - a

Let me group terms with a:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)

But since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer a in [1, b-1].

So, for each b, we can find the number of k's such that a is an integer in the required range.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of k and b. Let's consider the equation:

k^2 = a*b + c

But since c = k - a, we can substitute:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Which simplifies to:

k^2 = a*(b - 1) + k

So,

a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k

So,

a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)

Since a must be a positive integer (as it's a digit in base b, a ≥ 1), (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1). So, (b -1) must be a divisor of (k^2 -k).

Moreover, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1.

Therefore, for each base b, the possible k's are such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and when divided, a is between 1 and b-1.

Alternatively, for a given b, we can find all k such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and a = (k^2 -k)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.

Our task is, for each b starting from 2 upwards, compute how many k's satisfy these conditions, and find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can think about it another way. Let's suppose that b is fixed. Then for each possible two-digit number in base b, which is n = a*b + c, the condition is a + c = sqrt(n). So, n must be a perfect square, and the sum of its digits in base b must equal its square root.

So, n must satisfy:

n = k^2, and

a + c = k.

But n is also equal to a*b + c.

So,

k^2 = a*b + c.

But since c = k - a, substitution gives:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

Which simplifies to:

k^2 = a*(b -1) + k

So,

a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)

As before, a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the
