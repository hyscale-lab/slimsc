Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))  
and  
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

Where f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Both are absolute value functions, so their graphs will have V-shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, this will create another V-shape. 

Let me think about the critical points. The expression inside the absolute value, |x| - 1/2, will be zero when |x| = 1/2. So at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2, the function f(x) will have points where it changes direction.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, the inner expression |x| - 1/4 will be zero at x = 1/4 and x = -1/4. Taking the absolute value of that gives g(x), another V-shape.

So, f(x) has vertices at x = ±1/2, and g(x) has vertices at x = ±1/4.

Next, let's consider how these functions are composed in the equations given.

The first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). So, starting from x, we take sin(2πx), then apply f, then g, and multiply by 4.

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Starting from y, take cos(3πy), apply f, then g, multiply by 4, and set that equal to x.

Since both equations involve compositions of these functions, I think it's essential to analyze the range and periodicity of the trigonometric functions involved.

Let me note that sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) are both periodic functions. The periods are:

For sin(2πx): the period is 2π / (2π) = 1. So it's a sine wave with period 1.

For cos(3πy): the period is 2π / (3π) = 2/3. So it's a cosine wave with period 2/3.

So, the functions inside f and g are periodic with different periods. This might lead to a lot of oscillations, which could result in multiple intersections.

But before I get into that, maybe I should figure out the possible ranges of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)).

First, let's analyze f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The inner |x| ranges from 0 to infinity, but since we're applying it to sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), those trigonometric functions will have outputs between -1 and 1.

Wait, but since f is applied to sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), the inputs to f will be between -1 and 1. So let's see what f does to values in [-1,1].

Let me consider f(z) where z is in [-1,1]. Since z can be negative or positive, but inside f(z) is ||z| - 1/2|.

So, for z in [0,1], |z| is z, so f(z) = |z - 1/2|.

Similarly, for z in [-1,0], |z| is -z, so f(z) = |-z - 1/2| = |z + 1/2|.

So, f(z) is a piecewise function:

f(z) = |z - 1/2| for z ≥ 0  
f(z) = |z + 1/2| for z < 0

But since z is in [-1,1], let's figure out the range of f(z).

For z in [0,1]:

f(z) = |z - 1/2|. The minimum value is 0 (at z = 1/2), and the maximum is the maximum of |0 - 1/2| = 1/2 and |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. So f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

For z in [-1,0):

f(z) = |z + 1/2|. The minimum is 0 (at z = -1/2), and the maximum is | -1 + 1/2 | = 1/2 and |0 + 1/2| = 1/2. So again, f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, regardless of z in [-1,1], f(z) is in [0, 1/2].

Now, moving on to g(f(z)). Since f(z) is in [0, 1/2], let's see what g does to that.

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Since x here is f(z) which is in [0,1/2], let's see.

For x in [0,1/2], |x| is x, so g(x) = |x - 1/4|.

So, g(x) is |x - 1/4| for x in [0,1/2].

What's the range of g(f(z))?

f(z) is in [0,1/2], so g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.

The minimum of |f(z) - 1/4| occurs at f(z)=1/4, giving 0. The maximum is the maximum of |0 - 1/4| = 1/4 and |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4. So the range of g(f(z)) is [0, 1/4].

Thus, 4*g(f(z)) will have a range of [0,1].

Therefore, both expressions 4*g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4*g(f(cos(3πy))) will have outputs in [0,1].

So, the first equation is y = something between 0 and 1, and the second equation is x = something between 0 and 1. So, the graphs are confined to the square [0,1] x [0,1].

That's helpful because it limits the area where intersections can occur.

Now, to find the number of intersections between the two curves, I need to
