Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to place some of them on a 5x5 grid. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. 

Hmm, let me parse this carefully. So, each row and each column must be entirely one color, either all white or all black. But wait, the chips are indistinct except for color. So, if I have a row, all the chips in that row must be the same color, and similarly for the columns. But wait, hold on, that's a bit tricky because the same applies to columns as well. So, for example, if I have a row that's all white, then for each column that this row intersects, the entire column must also be all white? Or can the column have a different color?

Wait a second, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, and all chips in the same column have the same color. So, for each row, if it has any chips, all of them must be the same color. Similarly, for each column, if it has any chips, all of them must be the same color. But a row or column can have zero chips as well, right? Because the condition is on the chips that are placed.

Wait, no. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, it's possible that some cells have chips, others don't. But for the rows and columns that do have chips, all their chips must be the same color. So, for example, a row can have some number of white chips, but if any chip is placed in that row, all must be white. Similarly for columns.

But now, each column that has any chips must all be the same color, but different columns can have different colors. Same with rows. So, this seems like it's imposing that the entire grid must have a certain structure where rows and columns are either all white, all black, or empty. But, wait, that can't be the case because, for instance, if a row is all white, then any column that has a chip
