Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks and coffee shop stops. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, her entire trip, including the time she spends in the coffee shop, takes 4 hours. But when she increases her walking speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes the same 't' minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm, okay, so the key points are:

1. Distance walked is always 9 km.
2. Time taken at speed 's' is 4 hours, including coffee time 't'.
3. Time taken at speed 's + 2' is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including same coffee time 't'.
4. We need to find the time when speed is 's + 1/2', including 't'.

Wait, so both times include the coffee shop time. So, the total time is walking time plus coffee time. Let me denote:

Total time at speed s: 4 hours = walking time at s + coffee time t.

Total time at speed (s + 2): 2 hours 24 minutes = walking time at (s + 2) + coffee time t.

So, the time spent walking is different at each speed. Let me denote the walking time as T1 and T2 for the two speeds respectively.

So,

For speed s:
Distance = speed × time → 9 = s × T1 → T1 = 9 / s hours.

Total time including coffee: T1 + t = 4 hours.

For speed (s + 2):
Distance = 9 = (s + 2) × T2 → T2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Total time including coffee: T2 + t = 2 hours 24 minutes.

Wait, 2 hours 24 minutes is equal to 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Or, maybe it's easier to convert all times into minutes. Let's see.

Wait, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes. Similarly, 4 hours is 240 minutes. Hmm, maybe working in minutes might be less error-prone.

But perhaps working in hours is fine, since the equations are in hours. Let me try that.

So, I can set up two equations based on the given data.

Equation 1: (9 / s) + t = 4.

Equation 2: (9 / (s + 2)) + t = 2.4.

Because 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve for s and t.

Let me write them again:

1. (9/s) + t = 4. → Equation (1)
2. (9/(s + 2)) + t = 2.4. → Equation (2)

Let me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate t.

(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) + (t - t) = 4 - 2.4.

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

= 9*( (s + 2) - s ) / [s(s + 2)] )

= 9*(2) / [s(s + 2)] = 18 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6.

So,

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2).

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s.

So,

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0.

Wait, this is a quadratic equation in s. Let me write it as:

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's perhaps multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals.

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0.

Wait, 1.6 *10=16, 3.2 *10=32, 18*10=180. So, correct.

Now, simplifying this quadratic equation:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0.

I can perhaps divide all terms by 4 to make it simpler.

(16/4)s² + (32/4)s - (180/4) = 0 → 4 s² + 8 s - 45 = 0.

So, now the equation is 4 s² + 8 s - 45 = 0.

Let me use the quadratic formula to solve for s.

Quadratic formula: s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4 a c) ] / (2 a )

Here, a =4, b=8, c= -45.

So,

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (8)^2 - 4 *4*(-45)= 64 + 720= 784.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(784)=28.

So,

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2 *4) → [ -8 ±28 ] /8.

So, two solutions:

1. [ -8 +28 ] /8 = 20/8 = 2.5.

2. [ -8 -28 ] /8 = -36/8 = -4.5.

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

Wait, that's 2.5 km/h. Hmm, that seems a bit slow for a walk, but okay, maybe she walks slowly.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Use Equation (1):

(9/s) + t =4.

So, s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + t =4 → t= 0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours to minutes: 0.4 *60=24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Let me double-check with Equation (2):

9/(s +2) + t = 2.4.

s +2=4.5 km/h.

9/4.5 = 2 hours.

So, 2 + t =2.4 → t=0.4 hours=24 minutes. Correct.

Okay, so now we have s=2.5 km/h, t=24 min.

Now, the question asks: What is the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t.

s +1/2=2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, speed is 3 km/h. Distance is 9 km.

Walking time T = distance / speed= 9/3=3 hours.

So, walking time is 3 hours.

Including coffee time t=24 minutes.

Total time=3 hours +24 minutes=3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the problem asks for the number of minutes, including t.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

So, 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, s is 2.5, so s +1/2 is 3. So, walking time is 9 /3=3 hours, correct.

t is 24 minutes, so total time is 3h24m.

Converting that to minutes: 3*60=180 +24=204 minutes. Yep, that's correct.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

1. When Aya walks at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time (walking + coffee shop) is 4 hours:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + t = 4
   \]
2. When she walks at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + t = 2.4
   \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s + 2)
\]
\[
1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0
\]
Multiplying through by 10 to clear decimals:
\[
16s^2 + 32s - 180 = 0
\]
Dividing by 4:
\[
4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4(4)(-45)}}{2(4)} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
Taking the positive solution:
\[
s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]
Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + t = 4 \implies 3.6 + t = 4 \implies t = 0.4 \, \text{hours} = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]
Including the coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

The total time, including coffee shop time, is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
