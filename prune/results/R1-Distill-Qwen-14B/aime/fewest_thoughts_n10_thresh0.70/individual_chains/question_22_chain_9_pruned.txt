Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the terms.

We have a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, that means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA, right?

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The triangle has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this triangle is formed by extending those three sides until they meet and form a triangle. Since the sides are being extended, the triangle is likely larger than the hexagon itself. I imagine the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon might be similar to the triangle but scaled down. Maybe the triangle is a larger version, and the hexagon is inside it. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Let me visualize this. In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, it's like a stretched octagon, but with six sides. Or perhaps it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular since it's only equilateral and not necessarily equiangular.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and equal, but here it's only equilateral. So the angles might not all be equal. But because opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon might have some symmetry.

I think this kind of hexagon is called a "centrosymmetric" hexagon. That means it has a center of symmetry, so each vertex has a corresponding opposite vertex, and the sides are equal and parallel in pairs.

Now, considering the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how these sides would extend. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, each of these extensions should meet at three points forming a triangle.

Let me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, where XY is 200, YZ is 240, and ZX is 300. So, the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. I wonder if this is a right triangle. Let me check: 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000. So, no, it's not a right triangle. Okay, so that's something to note.

Now, how do the sides AB, CD, EF relate to this triangle? Each of
