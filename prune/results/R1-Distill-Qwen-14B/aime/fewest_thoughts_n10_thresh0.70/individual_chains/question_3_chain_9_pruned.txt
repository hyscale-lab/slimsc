Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

So, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She gets the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) which is the probability of A happening given that B has happened.

Wait, but in this case, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. Because if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, right? So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since A is a subset of B. So, that simplifies things a bit.

So, the formula becomes P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, let's figure out what P(A) is, the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. Then, P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, which is winning at least two numbers.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4).

2. P(A) is 1 divided by C(10,4), since there's only one winning combination.

3. For P(B), we need the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. This can be calculated by considering the cases where she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Then, divide by the total number of possible combinations C(10,4).

Wait, let me think about that.

So, the total number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers is C(10,4). Jen has chosen 4 specific numbers. The number of ways that exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen is C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because we choose 2 from her 4, and the remaining 2 from the other 6 numbers in the set.

Similarly, for exactly 3 numbers: C(4,3)*C(6,1).

And for exactly 4 numbers: C(4,4)*C(6,0), which is 1.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for event B is the sum of these three terms. So, the numerator for P(B) is [C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)].

Let me compute these values step by step.

First, compute C(4,2) which is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.

Then, C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115. Since the total possible is C(10,4), which is 210.

Wait, let me compute C(10,4). 10*9*8*7/(4*3*2*1) = 210. Yeah, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 115/210.

But before I proceed, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of favorable outcomes. So, the number of ways that exactly 2,3,4 of her numbers are chosen. So, 90 +
