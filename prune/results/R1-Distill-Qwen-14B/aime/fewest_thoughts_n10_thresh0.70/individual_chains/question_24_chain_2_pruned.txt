Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

- The sum of the items in the list is 30.
- The unique mode of the list is 9.
- The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

Hmm, alright. Let me break this down. I need to find a list of positive integers that meets these three conditions. Once I figure out what the list is, I can calculate the sum of the squares of each number.

First, let's list out the given properties:

1. Sum of the list is 30.
2. Unique mode is 9. So, 9 appears more frequently than any other number, and no other number shares this frequency.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Since the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, that tells me something about the structure of the list. Also, the mode being 9 gives me information about the frequency of 9 in the list.

Let me think about the mode first. The mode is the number that appears most often. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, my list should have multiple 9s, more than any other number.

Next, the median. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from least to greatest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because the median is usually one of the numbers in the list when the count is odd. So, perhaps the list has an even number of elements, making the median the average of two middle numbers, which isn't in the list. Alternatively, if it's odd, the median is a number not in the list, which would be impossible because the median is one of the elements when the count is odd. Wait, unless the list has an even number of elements. Let me clarify.

If the number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For it to be a positive integer not in the list, the average must be an integer, and neither of the two middle numbers can be equal to that average. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9, which isn't in the list. That could work. Alternatively, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, the median is 9, which again isn't in the list. So, that seems a possible scenario.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which must appear in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements because only in that case can the median be an integer not present in the list. So, the list length is even.

So, the list has an even number of elements, let's say n elements, where n is even. So, n could be 2, 4, 6, etc., but given the sum is 30, it can't be too large. Let's figure out possible values for n.

The sum is 30, so if all elements were 1, there would be 30 elements, but since mode is 9, which is a larger number, the list must have a reasonable number of elements. Let's see, if the list had 4 elements, each 9 would sum to 36, which is more than 30, so we can't have 4 elements with 9 being the mode. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the sum is 30. So, if the list has more elements, the numbers can be smaller. But since 9 is the mode, it must appear more often than any other number. So, for example, if n=6, and 9 appears 3 times, others appear at most 2 times. Let's see:

Wait, n could be 6: if 9 appears 3 times, the remaining 3 numbers can add up to 30 - (9*3) = 3
