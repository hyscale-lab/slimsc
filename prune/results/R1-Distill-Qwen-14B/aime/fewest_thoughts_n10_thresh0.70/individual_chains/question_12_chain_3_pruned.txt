Okay, so I have this problem about filling a 2x3 grid with digits, and it has to satisfy two conditions. First, when you read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999. Second, when you read the numbers top to bottom, their sum should be 99. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

Let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Let me denote the cells as variables:

a b c  
d e f  

So, the top row is a, b, c, and the bottom row is d, e, f. Each of these a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9, right?

Now, the first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. So, the top row forms a three-digit number, which is 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row forms another three-digit number, 100d + 10e + f. Their sum is 999, so:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

The second condition is that when we read the numbers top to bottom, their sum is 99. So, for each column, we form a two-digit number. There are three columns, so three two-digit numbers:

10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f.

Their sum is 99:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999  
2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99  

Let me try to simplify these equations. Maybe I can subtract the second equation from the first or something like that.

Let me write both equations:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999  
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99  

If I subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1, I get:

(100a - 10a) + (10b -10b) + (c -10c) + (100d - d) + (10e - e) + (f - f) = 999 - 99  
Which simplifies to:  
90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900  
Divide both sides by 9:  
10a - c + 11d + e = 100  

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me note that as Equation 3:  
10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Okay, now I need to find digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both Equation 3 and Equation 2.

Let me think about the constraints on the digits. Each digit is 0-9, so I can set up some ranges.

First, let's look at Equation 2:  
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99  

Which can be rewritten as:  
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99  

So, 10*(sum of a, b, c) + (sum of d, e, f) = 99. Let me denote S1 = a + b + c and S2 = d + e + f. Then, Equation 2 becomes:  
10*S1 + S2 = 99.

So, S2 = 99 - 10*S1.

But S1 and S2 are sums of digits, so S1 can range from 0 to 27 (since a, b, c are digits, max 9 each, so 9*3=27), and similarly S2 ranges from 0 to 27.

But since S2 = 99 -10*S1, let's see what possible S1 and S2 can be.

Let me write S2 = 99 -10*S1. Since S2 must be >=0 and <=27, let's find possible S1.

So, 99 -10*S1 >= 0  
=> 10*S1 <=99  
=> S1 <=9.9, so S1 <=9.

Also, 99 -10*S1 <=27  
=> 99 -27 <=10*S1  
=>72 <=10*S1  
=> S1 >=7.2, so since S1 is integer, S1 >=8.

So S1 can be 8 or 9.

Case 1: S1 =8  
Then S2 =99 -10*8=99-80=19.

Case 2: S1=9  
Then S2=99-90=9.

So, two possibilities: S1=8, S2=19 or S1=9, S2=9.

Let me consider each case.

Case 1: S1=8, S2=19.

So, a + b + c =8, and d + e + f=19.

Case 2: S1=9, S2=9.

So, a + b + c=9, and d + e + f=9.

Now, let's see Equation 3: 10a -c +11d + e = 100.

So, 10a -c +11d + e =100.

Let me rearrange it as:

10a +11d + e = c +100.

But since c is a digit (0-9), c +100 is 100 to 109. So, 10a +11d + e must be between 100 and 109.

Hmm, 10a +11d + e is between 100 and 109.

So, 10a +11d + e = 100 + something, where something is 0 to 9.

Wait, but 10a +11d + e is equal to c +100. So, c = (10a +11d +e ) -100.

But c must be a digit (0-9), so (10a +11d +e ) must be between 100 and 109, inclusive.

So, 100 <=10a +11d +e <=109.

Now, let me analyze both cases.

Case 1: S1=8, S2=19.

So, a + b + c=8,

d + e + f=19.

And in Equation 3: 10a +11d +e = c +100.

But c =8 -a -b.

Wait, maybe it's better to combine all equations.

But this might get complicated. Let me think of possible values for a, d, e, c.

Because 10a +11d + e is between 100 and 109.

So, 10a +11d +e >=100.

Let me think of possible a and d values.

a is a digit from 0-9, but in this case, since S1=8, and a is part of a + b + c=8, a can't be more than 8.

Similarly, d is part of d + e + f=19, so d can be up to 19, but since d is a digit, d can be up to 9.

So, let's try to find a and d such that 10a +11d is close to 100.

Let me denote X =10a +11d.

We need X +e = c +100.

But X must be between 100 -9=91 and 100 +9=109, but since X =10a +11d, and a and d are digits, let's find possible (a, d) pairs such that 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

But since 10a +11d must be at least 100 - e, which could be as low as 100 -9=91, but since e is a digit (0-9), maybe 91 is possible.

Wait, but let's think of 10a +
