Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. Then, express that probability as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem.

We have a regular octagon, so it's an 8-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, each vertex has two possibilities, red or blue, and the color of each vertex doesn't affect the others. 

The question is about the probability that there exists a rotation such that when we rotate the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blues end up where reds were before the rotation. 

So, to rephrase, after some rotation, the set of blue vertices is exactly the set of positions that were red before the rotation. That means that the blue vertices are a permutation of the red vertices under rotation.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so its symmetries include rotations by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45). So, the rotation can be by 0, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees, which correspond to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (each step being one vertex position).

So, for each possible rotation (including the identity rotation, which does nothing), we can check if the set of blue vertices maps exactly to the set of red vertices.

But wait, the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, it's not that the coloring is preserved under rotation, but that after some rotation, every blue vertex is now where a red vertex was before the rotation.

So, let me think: suppose the original coloring has some red and blue vertices. After rotating by k steps, all the blue vertices (in the original coloring) are now at positions that were red. So, the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. That is, the blue set is the red set shifted by k positions.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be equal to the set of red vertices rotated by k steps for some k.

So, the problem is asking for the probability that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, the blue set must be a cyclic shift of the red set. So, the question is: what is the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices?

But wait, another way to think about this is that the coloring is such that the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. So, the coloring is a union of red and blue vertices, where the blue ones are a rotation of the red ones.

Wait, but each vertex is either red or blue. So, the red and blue sets must be rotations of each other. That is, the red set must be a rotation of the blue set. So, the red and blue sets are the same up to rotation.

Given that, the number of red and blue vertices must be equal, because if you rotate a set, the size doesn't change. So, the number of red and blue vertices must be equal. Therefore, the number of red vertices must equal the number of blue vertices.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices. So, for the number of red and blue to be equal, each must be 4. So, the first observation is that in order for such a rotation to exist, the number of red and blue vertices must be equal. Therefore, the number of reds must be 4, and blues must be 4.

So, the probability we're looking for is conditional on the number of reds being 4. But wait, no. Because if the number of reds isn't 4, then such a rotation cannot exist. Therefore, the total probability is the probability that there are 4 reds and 4 blues, times the probability that, given that, the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because even if the number of reds and blues are equal, it's not guaranteed that one is a rotation of the other.

So, the process is:

1. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

2. We need to count the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But perhaps it's better to model it as:

The number of such colorings is equal to the number of pairs (R, B) where R is the set of red vertices, B is the set of blue vertices, R and B are rotations of each other, and R ∪ B is the entire set of vertices with no overlap.

Wait, but if B is a rotation of R, then R and B must be the same size, as rotations preserve set size. So, as before, |R| = |B|, so in an 8-vertex octagon, each must have size 4. So, the total number of such colorings is the number of subsets R of size 4 such that some rotation of R equals B, where B is the complement of R.

Wait, but if B is a rotation of R, then R must be a rotation of B, so R and B are rotations of each other. Therefore, each such coloring is determined by choosing a subset R of size 4, and then B is R rotated by some k.

But wait, actually, since R and B are complements, because R is red and B is blue, so B = V \ R, where V is the entire vertex set.

So, the question is: how many subsets R of size 4 are such that V \ R is a rotation of R.

Which is equivalent to: How many subsets R of size 4 are such that R is equal to a rotation of (V \ R).

But since V is the entire set, rotating R by k steps gives another subset. So, for R to equal a rotation of its complement, R must be a rotation of its complement.

So, the problem reduces to counting how many subsets R of size 4 are equal to some rotation of their complement.

Alternatively, R is a rotation of B, where B is V \ R.

So, how to count that?

Hmm. I think that the subsets R that are rotationally symmetric in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I should think about necklaces. Because a regular octagon can be thought of as a necklace with 8 beads, each either red or blue.

The problem is similar to counting binary necklaces with certain properties.

Wait, but the problem is not about counting distinct necklaces under rotation, but about colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

So, for each coloring, check whether the blue set is equal to a rotation of the red set. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets R of size 4 such that R is equal to a rotation of its complement.

So, how many such subsets R are there?

I think that the number is equal to the number of orbits under rotation of the group action on subsets of size 4.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model it as each coloring where the blue set is a rotation of the red set must be such that the entire coloring is a balanced set under some rotation.

Wait, actually, perhaps I should model this problem using group theory, specifically Burnside's lemma, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's useful to model the octagon as the cyclic group C8 acting on the set of vertices. Then, the question is about colorings where the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotation) of the set of red vertices.

So, for each coloring, the blue set is a translate of the red set.

Wait, but in that case, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets R such that R = s + (V \ R) for some rotation s.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of group actions.

Wait, let's think about the number of such subsets R.

Each such subset R must satisfy R = (V \ R) + s for some s in C8.

Which is equivalent to R + s = V \ R.

But since V is the entire set, V = R ∪ (V \ R), and R and V \ R are disjoint.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that R is equal to the complement of R shifted by some s.

So, R = (V \ R) + s.

Which implies that R = s + (V \ R).

But since (V \ R) is the complement of R, which is another subset of size 4.

So, the question is, how many subsets R of size 4 satisfy R = s + (V \ R) for some s.

Alternatively, R is equal to the complement of R shifted by s.

Hmm.

Alternatively, R is equal to a rotation of its complement.

So, for each subset R of size 4, check if R is a rotation of V \ R.

How many such subsets R are there?

This seems tricky, but perhaps we can think about the possible symmetries.

Wait, let me consider the group of rotations of the octagon, which is cyclic of order 8.

We can think of each rotation as a permutation of the vertices.

So, the question is: for each R, is there a rotation g such that g(R) = V \ R?

So, the number of such R is equal to the number of subsets R where R is the complement of its image under some rotation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of such R being equal to the number of orbits under the action of the rotation group on the set of pairs (R, V \ R) where R is size 4.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: for each possible rotation s, count the number of subsets R such that s(R) = V \ R. Then, sum over all s, but we have to be careful not to overcount.

Wait, but for each rotation s, the number of R such that s(R) = V \ R is equal to the number of R where R is equal to the complement of R shifted by s.

So, for each s, the number of R with R = s + (V \ R). So, for each s, how many R satisfy R = s + (V \ R).

Let me consider a specific rotation s. Let me fix s to be a rotation by k steps.

So, for each s (i.e., each k), how many R of size 4 satisfy R = s(R^c), where R^c is the complement of R.

So, R = s(R^c). So, R union s(R^c) = R, but since R and R^c are complements, perhaps we can find some structure.

Wait, let's write this equation: R = s(R^c). Then, applying s^{-1} to both sides, we get s^{-1}(R) = R^c.

So, the complement of R is equal to s^{-1}(R). So, R^c = s^{-1}(R).

Then, R = (s^{-1}(R))^c.

But (s^{-1}(R))^c is equal to s^{-1}(R^c) because applying a group element to a set and then taking the complement is the same as taking the complement first and then applying the inverse group element.

Wait, let me think: for any set A, s^{-1}(A^c) = (s(A))^c. Because applying s^{-1} to A^c is the same as taking the complement of s(A).

So, if R^c = s^{-1}(R), then R = (s^{-1}(R))^c = s(A)^c where A is R.

Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me try to make it more concrete.

Suppose R is a subset such that R = s(R^c). So, applying s to R^c gives R.

Then, R^c = s^{-1}(R), as above.

But then, substituting back, R = s(R^c) = s(s^{-1}(R)) = R. So, that just gives R=R, which is always true, but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of R as a subset that is equal to its complement shifted by s. So, R = s(R^c).

So, R is a subset of size 4, s(R^c) is also a subset of size 4, so R must equal s(R^c).

But how does this constrain R?

Wait, maybe we can consider the union of R and s(R^c). Since R = s(R^c), then R union R is R, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, since R and R^c are disjoint, perhaps s(R^c) is a shift of R^c.

Wait, perhaps another way: Let me consider that both R and R^c have size 4, so if R is a rotation of R^c, then R must be a self-complementary subset under some rotation.

Alternatively, the subset R is a rotation of its complement.

How many such subsets are there?

I think that for cyclic groups, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of necklaces with certain properties.

Wait, wait. Maybe I can model this using group theory and Burnside's lemma.

Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points.

But in this case, the group is C8, the cyclic group of order 8. The set we're looking at is the set of subsets R of size 4 where R is a rotation of its complement.

So, for each group element g (rotation), we can count the number of subsets R such that g(R) = R^c.

Wait, that might be a way to model it.

So, the number of such subsets R is equal to the number of fixed points of the group action where each g acts as mapping R to g(R), and we want g(R) = R^c.

Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the number of pairs (R, g) where g(R) = R^c.

Wait, but we need to count the number of R such that there exists a g where g(R) = R^c.

So, the total number of such R is equal to the union over all g of the number of R fixed by g in the sense that g(R) = R^c.

But inclusion-exclusion might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the number of solutions.

Wait, let me think. For each rotation g (including identity), how many R satisfy g(R) = R^c.

So, for each g, the number of R such that g(R) = R^c.

Then, the total number of such R across all g is equal to the sum over g of N_g, where N_g is the number of R with g(R) = R^c.

But since each R can be fixed by multiple g's, we have to be careful not to overcount.

Wait, but perhaps using Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct R that are fixed by some g is equal to (1/|G|) * sum_{g} Fix(g), where Fix(g) is the number of R fixed by g, i.e., R such that g(R) = R^c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, the group G is C8, the cyclic group of order 8, generated by a rotation of 45 degrees.

Each element of G can be represented as rotation by k*45 degrees, where k=0,1,2,...,7.

For each rotation g_k (k=0 to 7), we need to compute the number of subsets R of size 4 such that g_k(R) = R^c.

So, for each k, compute Fix(g_k) = number of R where g_k(R) = R^c.

Then, the total number of such R is equal to the sum over k of Fix(g_k), but this counts R multiple times if it satisfies g_k(R) = R^c for multiple k.

But since we want the number of R that satisfy this for at least one k, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps using Burnside's lemma, the number of such R is (1/8) * sum_{k=0}^7 Fix(g_k), but I'm not sure if that applies here because Burnside's lemma is usually for counting orbits, but in this case, we're looking for fixed points under a condition.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each R, the number of g such that g(R) = R^c is equal to the number of symmetries that map R to its complement.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find for each rotation k, how many R satisfy g_k(R) = R^c, and then sum those up, but that would count each R as many times as it satisfies the condition for different k's.

But our goal is to find the number of R where there exists at least one k such that g_k(R) = R^c. So, it's the union over k of Fix(g_k).

But computing the size of a union is tricky because of overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of binary necklaces.

Wait, another angle: Let's think of the octagon as having vertices labeled 0 to 7. Each rotation by k steps corresponds to shifting the labels by k positions.

So, for a given R, we can check if there exists a k such that R shifted by k positions equals the complement of R.

Alternatively, R is a subset of size 4, and R shifted by k is equal to V \ R.

So, R shifted by k is equal to the complement of R.

So, R is a subset where shifting it by k gives its complement.

So, in other words, R is a subset where the complement of R is a shift of R.

In that case, R is called a "complementary shift" set or something like that.

I think that in combinatorics, such sets are studied, perhaps in the context of difference sets or something else.

Wait, but maybe for each possible k, we can find the number of R such that R shifted by k is equal to V \ R.

So, for each k, the number of R where R +k = V \ R.

Now, since V is the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, and V \ R is the complement of R.

So, for each k, how many R of size 4 satisfy R +k = V \ R, where R +k is the set { (r + k) mod 8 | r in R }.

So, for each k, the equation is R +k = V \ R.

Let me think about it. So, for a given k, the number of R where R +k is the complement of R.

So, R ∪ (R +k) = V, since R and R +k are subsets, and their union is V.

But wait, R +k is the complement of R, so R and R +k are disjoint and their union is V.

So, R and R +k are complementary subsets.

So, for a given k, R must be a subset of size 4 such that R and R +k are complementary.

So, the size of R is 4, so R +k must also be size 4, which it is because shifting doesn't change the size.

So, for each k, the number of such R is equal to the number of subsets R of size 4 such that R +k = V \ R.

Now, let's compute for a fixed k, the number of R satisfying this.

So, R +k = V \ R.

Which implies that R +k is exactly the complement of R.

So, let's consider that for each element x in V, x is in R if and only if x -k is not in R.

So, for each x, x ∈ R ⇨ x -k ∉ R.

Which is equivalent to saying that R is a subset where no two elements are k apart, because if x is in R, then x -k cannot be in R.

Wait, but in this case, it's more that R is a subset where R shifted by k is exactly its complement.

So, for each x, x ∈ R ⇨ x -k ∉ R.

Which implies that R is an independent set with respect to the shift by k, but perhaps more than that.

Alternatively, this is similar to a concept in combinatorics called a "difference set," but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for each k, the number of R is equal to the number of subsets R where R and R +k are complements.

So, R ∩ (R +k) = empty set, and R ∪ (R +k) = V.

Which is another way of saying that R is a subset and R +k is its complement.

So, the number of such R is equal to the number of ways to partition V into two subsets R and R +k, each of size 4.

So, for each k, how many such R exist?

I think that for each k, either the number of such R is 0 or 2^{gcd(k,8)}}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure.

If k and 8 are coprime, then the shift by k is a single cycle of length 8. So, for k coprime to 8, the shift by k permutes all the elements in a single cycle.

In that case, can R and R +k be complementary subsets?

Well, let's see. If k is coprime to 8, then the shift by k is a permutation consisting of a single 8-cycle. So, for R and R +k to be complementary, the elements of R must be spaced in such a way that shifting them by k gives all the elements not in R.

But in an 8-cycle, if R is a subset of size 4, then R +k would have to be the other 4 elements. So, does such a subset R exist?

Well, let's consider k=1, which is coprime to 8.

Is there a subset R of size 4 such that R +1 is its complement?

So, R +1 would be {r+1 mod 8 | r ∈ R}.

So, R ∪ (R +1) = V, and R ∩ (R +1) = empty.

So, for example, if R is {0,2,4,6}, then R +1 is {1,3,5,7}, which is the complement. So, indeed, R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +1 = V \ R.

Similarly, R could be {1,3,5,7}, which would also satisfy R +1 = V \ R.

So, for k=1, there are exactly two such subsets R: {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}.

Similarly, for any k coprime to 8, like k=3,5,7, etc., we can find such subsets.

Wait, let's test k=3.

Is there a subset R such that R +3 = V \ R?

Let me try R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +3 = {3,4,7,0}.

But then R ∪ (R +3) = {0,1,3,4,5,7}, which is not all of V, so that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe R = {0,2,4,6} as before.

R +3 = {3,5,7,1}.

So, R +3 = {1,3,5,7}, which is the complement of R.

So yes, R = {0,2,4,6} works for k=3 as well.

Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} would also satisfy R +3 = {4,6,0,2}, which is the complement of R.

Wait, no. Let's compute R +3 when R = {1,3,5,7}.

R +3 would be {4,6,0,2}, which is indeed the complement of R.

So, for k=3, the same two subsets R work.

Similarly, for any k coprime to 8, there are exactly two subsets R satisfying R +k = V \ R.

So, for k=1,3,5,7 (all coprime to 8), each contributes two subsets R.

Now, what about k that are not coprime to 8?

For example, k=2. Let's see if any R satisfies R +2 = V \ R.

So, for k=2, we need R such that R +2 is the complement of R.

So, R and R +2 are complementary, each of size 4.

Let me try to find such an R.

Suppose R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +2 = {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement. So, yes, that works.

Similarly, R = {2,3,6,7} would also satisfy R +2 = {4,5,0,1}, which is the complement.

So, for k=2, there are also two subsets R satisfying R +2 = V \ R.

Wait, but what about k=4?

k=4 is equivalent to shifting by half the octagon, so each element is mapped to the element opposite to it.

So, R +4 would be the set {r +4 mod 8 | r ∈ R}.

So, if R is a subset of size 4, R +4 is another subset of size 4. For R +4 to be the complement of R, then R and R +4 must be complements.

So, for example, let R be {0,1,2,3}. Then R +4 is {4,5,6,7}, which is the complement of R. So, that works.

Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7} would satisfy R +4 = {0,1,2,3}, which is the complement.

But wait, any R that is a union of two pairs of opposite elements would satisfy R +4 = V \ R.

Wait, for example, R = {0,4,1,5}. Then R +4 = {4,0,5,1}, which is the same as R, so R +4 = R, which would imply that R is equal to its complement only if R is of size 4, which it is, but only if R is equal to its complement, which would require that R is equal to R^c, which is possible only if R is a set where every element is its own complement, which in this case would require that for every r in R, r +4 is also in R. So, R is a union of orbits under the rotation by 4 steps.

Wait, but in this case, R = {0,4,1,5}, which is two orbits {0,4} and {1,5}. Then, R +4 = {4,0,5,1} = R, so R +4 = R, which is not equal to R^c unless R is equal to R^c, which would require that R is a subset of size 4 and R = R^c, which is impossible because the size would have to be 4 and 4, but the entire set is 8.

Wait, no, that's not possible because R and R^c have sizes adding up to 8, so if R is size 4, R^c is size 4. So, R cannot be equal to R^c unless 4=4 and R is equal to R^c, which would require that every element is in both R and R^c, which is impossible unless the set is empty.

So, R cannot be equal to R^c unless R is empty or the entire set, which are not the case here.

Wait, so perhaps for k=4, there are no R such that R +4 = R^c?

Wait, earlier I thought R = {0,1,2,3} would satisfy R +4 = R^c, but let me check.

R = {0,1,2,3}, R +4 = {4,5,6,7}, which is indeed R^c. So, yes, that works.

Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7} would satisfy R +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R^c.

But wait, what about R = {0,2,4,6}? Then R +4 = {4,6,0,2} = R, which is not equal to R^c unless R is equal to R^c, which it's not. So, that doesn't work.

So, for k=4, the only subsets R that satisfy R +4 = R^c are R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7}.

So, that's two subsets again.

Wait, so for k=4, there are two subsets R such that R +4 = R^c.

Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I took R = {0,1,4,5}, and k=2, that worked because R +2 = {2,3,6,7} = R^c.

So, for k=2, which is not coprime to 8, we still have two subsets R satisfying R +k = R^c.

So, perhaps for each k, whether coprime to 8 or not, the number of such R is two.

Wait, but let me check for k=0.

k=0 is the identity rotation. So, R +0 = R. So, R = R^c, which implies that R is equal to its complement. But as discussed, this is impossible unless R is empty or the entire set, which are size 0 and 8, neither of which is size 4. So, for k=0, the number of R is zero.

So, for k=0, Fix(g_0) = 0.

For k=1,3,5,7 (coprimes to 8), each contributes 2 subsets R.

For k=2,4,6 (not coprimes to 8), perhaps each contributes 2 subsets R.

Wait, let's test k=6.

k=6 is equivalent to shifting by -2, since 6 ≡ -2 mod 8.

So, for k=6, does R +6 = R^c have solutions?

Let me try R = {0,1,4,5}. Then R +6 = {6,7,2,3}, which is the complement of R. So yes, that works.

Similarly, R = {2,3,6,7} would satisfy R +6 = {8,9, 12,13} mod 8, which is {0,1,4,5}, which is the complement.

So, yes, for k=6, there are two subsets R satisfying R +6 = R^c.

Similarly, for k=4, we saw that R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7} satisfy R +4 = R^c.

So, for each k from 1 to 7, except k=0, there are two subsets R satisfying R +k = R^c.

Wait, but earlier for k=2,4,6, I thought they are not coprime to 8, but they still have two subsets each.

So, that would mean that for each k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7, there are two subsets R such that R +k = R^c.

Thus, the total number of such R across all k would be 7 * 2 = 14.

But wait, but each R is being counted multiple times because a single R can satisfy R +k = R^c for multiple k's.

Wait, for example, the subset R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +1 = R^c, as we saw earlier.

Does it also satisfy R +k = R^c for any other k?

Let's check for k=3.

R +3 = {3,5,7,1}, which is the complement of R, which is {1,3,5,7}, so yes, R +3 = R^c.

Similarly, R +5 would be {5,7,1,3}, which is the same as R +3, which is R^c. So, does R +5 equal R^c? Well, R +5 = {5,7,1,3} which is the same as R +3, which is R^c. So, yes, R +5 = R^c as well.

Wait, so R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +k = R^c for k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} would satisfy R +k = R^c for k=1,3,5,7.

So, each of these R's is being counted four times, once for each k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, for R = {0,1,2,3}, it satisfies R +4 = R^c, and R +8= R, but 8 ≡0 mod8, which is the identity, so no.

Wait, R = {0,1,2,3} satisfies R +4 = R^c, as R +4 is {4,5,6,7}, which is R^c.

Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7} satisfies R +4 = R^c.

What about other R's like {0,1,4,5}? Let's see if they satisfy any other shifts.

R = {0,1,4,5}, R +2 = {2,3,6,7} = R^c.

Does R +6 = {6,7,2,3} = R^c?

Yes, because R +6 = {6,7,2,3} which is the same as R +2, which is R^c.

So, for R = {0,1,4,5}, k=2 and k=6 both satisfy R +k = R^c.

Similarly, for R = {2,3,6,7}, k=2 and k=6 would satisfy R +k = R^c.

Similarly, R = {0,3,6,1} (wait, that's the same as {0,1,3,6}), but I'm not sure if that's a valid example.

Alternatively, perhaps each R is counted twice: once for k and once for k'= 8 -k.

Wait, for example, R = {0,2,4,6} is counted for k=1 and k=7, because shifting by 1 or 7 (which is -1 mod8) both would map R to R^c.

Wait, let's check. R = {0,2,4,6}.

Shifting by 1: {1,3,5,7} = R^c.

Shifting by 7: same as shifting by -1. So, R +7 = {7,6,5,4} = {4,5,6,7} = R^c.

Wait, no, {7,6,5,4} is the same as {4,5,6,7}, which is R^c.

So, yes, R +7 = R^c.

Similarly, R +1 = R^c.

So, for R = {0,2,4,6}, it's counted for both k=1 and k=7.

Similarly, for R = {1,3,5,7}, it's counted for k=1 and k=7.

Similarly, for R = {0,1,2,3}, it's only counted for k=4, because shifting by 4 gives R^c.

Wait, R = {0,1,2,3}, shifting by 4 gives R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c.

Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7}, shifting by 4 gives R +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R^c.

So, these two R's are each counted once, for k=4.

Similarly, R = {0,1,4,5} is counted for k=2 and k=6, because shifting by 2 and 6 both give R^c.

Similarly, R = {2,3,6,7} is counted for k=2 and k=6.

So, each of these R's is counted twice.

So, putting this together:

- The R's that are four-element subsets where R and R +k are complements for some k.

- The subsets that are fixed under shifts by k=1,3,5,7 are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}, each counted four times (for k=1,3,5,7).

Wait, no, earlier I saw that each of these subsets is counted twice, for k=1 and k=7, and similarly for k=3 and k=5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as each R is counted as many times as the number of k's for which R +k = R^c.

So, for some R's, they might satisfy the condition for multiple k's.

For example, R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +1 = R^c, R +3 = R^c, R +5 = R^c, R +7 = R^c. So, four different k's.

Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3} only satisfies R +4 = R^c, so only one k.

Similarly, R = {0,1,4,5} satisfies R +2 = R^c and R +6 = R^c, so two k's.

So, each R is counted once for each k that satisfies R +k = R^c.

So, the total count across all k's is equal to the sum over all R of the number of k's such that R +k = R^c.

Which is equal to the number of pairs (R, k) where R +k = R^c.

So, the total number of such pairs is equal to 7*2 = 14, as earlier.

But our goal is to find the number of R's such that there exists at least one k where R +k = R^c.

So, the number of R's is equal to the number of R where this condition is met at least once.

But each R can be counted multiple times in this sum.

So, to find the total number of R's, we can use inclusion-exclusion, but perhaps it's easier to note that the R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k are exactly those R's that are equal to their own complement under some rotation.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: Since for each non-zero k, there are two R's that satisfy R +k = R^c, and for k=0, there are none.

But wait, earlier we saw that for k=4, there are two R's, so that would be 7 non-zero k's, each contributing two R's, totaling 14 R's.

But wait, that can't be correct because the total number of R's is C(8,4) = 70, so 14 is a subset of that.

But wait, let me count how many R's satisfy R +k = R^c for some k.

From the examples above, we have:

- R = {0,2,4,6}, which works for k=1,3,5,7.

- R = {1,3,5,7}, same as above.

- R = {0,1,2,3}, works for k=4.

- R = {4,5,6,7}, same as above.

- R = {0,1,4,5}, works for k=2,6.

- R = {2,3,6,7}, same as above.

Wait, that's six R's so far.

Wait, but earlier I thought for each non-zero k, there are two R's, but some R's are counted multiple times.

Wait, perhaps the total number of distinct R's is 6, each contributing multiple k's.

Wait, but let me see:

1. R = {0,2,4,6}: works for k=1,3,5,7.

2. R = {1,3,5,7}: same as above.

3. R = {0,1,2,3}: works for k=4.

4. R = {4,5,6,7}: same as above.

5. R = {0,1,4,5}: works for k=2,6.

6. R = {2,3,6,7}: same as above.

Are there any more R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k?

Let me think. What about R = {0,3,4,7}?

Shifting by k=1: {1,4,5,0} → which is {0,1,4,5}, which is not the complement of R.

Shifting by k=2: {2,5,6,1} → which is {1,2,5,6}, not R^c.

Shifting by k=3: {3,6,7,2} → which is {2,3,6,7}, which is R^c only if R is {0,3,4,7}, but {2,3,6,7} is not the complement of R.

Wait, R is {0,3,4,7}, so R^c is {1,2,5,6}. So, shifting R by k=3 gives {3,6,7,2}, which is {2,3,6,7}, which is not equal to R^c.

So, that R doesn't satisfy any k.

Similarly, what about R = {0,2,5,7}?

Shifting by k=1: {1,3,6,0} → {0,1,3,6}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=2: {2,4,7,1} → {1,2,4,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=3: {3,5,0,4} → {0,3,4,5}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=4: {4,6,1,3} → {1,3,4,6}, which is not R^c.

So, this R doesn't work for any k.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the only R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k are the six I listed earlier.

Wait, but let me check another R: R = {0,2,5,7}.

Wait, shifting by k=5: R +5 = {5,7,10,12} mod8 → {5,7,2,4} → {2,4,5,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=6: R +6 = {6,8,11,13} mod8 → {6,0,3,5} → {0,3,5,6}, which is not R^c.

So, no luck there.

Wait, perhaps it's possible that there are only six R's that satisfy the condition for some k.

So, the total number of such R's is 6.

Wait, but earlier I thought for each k=1,3,5,7, there are two R's, but some R's are counted multiple times.

So, perhaps the total number of distinct R's is 6.

Wait, let's count:

1. {0,2,4,6}

2. {1,3,5,7}

3. {0,1,2,3}

4. {4,5,6,7}

5. {0,1,4,5}

6. {2,3,6,7}

Are there any others?

Wait, let's see. What about R = {0,3,5,7}?

Shifting by k=2: {2,5,7,1} → {1,2,5,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=4: {4,7,1,3} → {1,3,4,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=6: {6,1,3,5} → {1,3,5,6}, which is not R^c.

Hmm, no.

Alternatively, R = {0,1,3,4}.

Shifting by k=2: {2,3,5,6} → which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=3: {3,4,6,7} → which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=5: {5,6,8,9} mod8 → {5,6,0,1} → which is not R^c.

So, no.

I think perhaps the only R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k are the six I listed earlier.

Thus, the total number of such R's is 6.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for each non-zero k, there are two R's, which would be 14 R's, but that's not possible because some R's are counted multiple times.

So, perhaps the correct number is 6 R's.

Wait, let me check another R: R = {0,4,5,7}.

Shifting by k=2: {2,6,7,1} → {1,2,6,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=4: {4,8,9,11} mod8 → {4,0,1,3} → {0,1,3,4}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=6: {6,10,11,13} mod8 → {6,2,3,5} → {2,3,5,6}, which is not R^c.

So, no.

Hmm, I think it's safe to assume that there are only six R's that satisfy the condition.

So, the total number of such R's is 6.

Wait, but earlier I thought for each non-zero k, there are two R's, but that seems to lead to 14, which is more than the number of possible R's.

But C(8,4) is 70, so 6 is much smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the group action.

The group C8 acts on the set of subsets of size 4.

For each element g in C8, we can compute the number of subsets R such that g(R) = R^c.

We can then use Burnside's lemma to compute the number of orbits, but perhaps that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of R's such that R +k = R^c is equal to 2 if k is even, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit with earlier examples.

Wait, when k is even, for example, k=2, we have R = {0,1,4,5} and R = {2,3,6,7}.

When k is odd, coprime to 8, like k=1,3,5,7, we have R = {0,2,4,6} and R = {1,3,5,7}.

When k=4, which is even, we have R = {0,1,2,3} and R = {4,5,6,7}.

So, for each k, whether even or odd, there are two R's.

So, for each k=1,2,3,4,5,6,7, there are two R's such that R +k = R^c.

Thus, the total number of pairs (R, k) is 7*2 =14.

But each R can be associated with multiple k's.

Now, to find the number of distinct R's, we can note that each R is counted as many times as the number of k's for which R +k = R^c.

So, for example, R = {0,2,4,6} is counted for k=1,3,5,7, so four times.

Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} is counted four times.

R = {0,1,2,3} is counted once for k=4.

R = {4,5,6,7} is counted once for k=4.

R = {0,1,4,5} is counted twice for k=2 and k=6.

R = {2,3,6,7} is counted twice for k=2 and k=6.

So, the total count is:

- R1: {0,2,4,6} → 4 counts.

- R2: {1,3,5,7} → 4 counts.

- R3: {0,1,2,3} → 1 count.

- R4: {4,5,6,7} → 1 count.

- R5: {0,1,4,5} → 2 counts.

- R6: {2,3,6,7} → 2 counts.

Total counts: 4+4+1+1+2+2 = 14, which matches our earlier calculation.

So, the number of distinct R's is 6.

Thus, the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set is 6.

Wait, but each R corresponds to a unique coloring where the red vertices are R and blue are R^c.

So, the number of colorings is 6.

Wait, but the total number of colorings is 256, and the number of such colorings is 6, so the probability would be 6/256 = 3/128.

But that seems low. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because each R is a subset of size 4, and each such R corresponds to exactly one coloring where R is red and R^c is blue.

So, the number of colorings is equal to the number of such R's, which is 6.

So, the probability is 6 / 256 = 3/128.

But wait, when I thought about it earlier, I thought there were more R's, but now I'm getting 6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of such R's as the number of orbits under rotation.

Wait, another approach: For each rotation, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, there are 6 R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k.

So, the number of such colorings is 6.

So, the probability is 6 / 256 = 3/128.

But 3 and 128 are coprime, so m=3, n=128, m+n=131.

Wait, but I'm not sure because earlier I thought there were more R's.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed some R's.

Wait, let me try to find more R's.

For example, R = {0,3,5,7}.

Shifting by k=4: R +4 = {4,7,1,3} → {1,3,4,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=2: {2,5,7,1} → {1,2,5,7}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=6: {6,9,11,13} mod8 → {6,1,3,5} → {1,3,5,6}, which is not R^c.

Hmm, no.

What about R = {0,2,5,7}.

Shifting by k=3: {3,5,8,10} mod8 → {3,5,0,2} → {0,2,3,5}, which is not R^c.

Shifting by k=5: {5,7,10,12} mod8 → {5,7,2,4} → {2,4,5,7}, which is not R^c.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's consider that for each R, the number of k's where R +k = R^c is equal to the number of rotational symmetries that map R to its complement.

So, for R to be a rotation of its complement, there must exist a rotation k such that R +k = R^c.

Thus, the number of such R's is equal to the number of R's where R is a rotation of its complement.

Which, according to our earlier analysis, is 6.

So, the number of colorings is 6, each corresponding to a unique R.

Thus, the probability is 6 / 256 = 3 / 128.

Wait, but 3 + 128 is 131.

But I'm not entirely confident because earlier I thought there might be more R's, but perhaps I was mistaken.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such R's is 8, corresponding to the number of rotational symmetries, but I can't think of more R's.

Wait, another way: Let me consider that each such R corresponds to a pair of complementary subsets that are rotations of each other.

In the case of the octagon, when the blue set is a rotation of the red set, the coloring is such that the blue and red sets form a "rotational complement" pair.

So, for example, R = {0,2,4,6} and R^c = {1,3,5,7}, which are rotations of each other.

Similarly, R = {0,1,2,3} and R^c = {4,5,6,7}, which are rotations by 4 steps.

R = {0,1,4,5} and R^c = {2,3,6,7}, which are rotations by 2 steps.

So, these are the three distinct types of rotational complement pairs.

Each type has two R's, one and its complement, so 3 types × 2 = 6 R's.

So, the total number is 6.

Therefore, the number of such colorings is 6.

So, the probability is 6 / 256 = 3 / 128.

Thus, m=3, n=128, m+n=131.

I think that's the answer.


The problem involves a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. 

To solve this, we consider the octagon's rotational symmetries and the conditions under which the blue set (B) is a rotation of the red set (R). Since the octagon has 8 vertices, the number of red and blue vertices must each be 4. We are looking for subsets R of size 4 such that there exists a rotation k where R shifted by k positions equals the complement of R (B).

Through detailed analysis, we identify six distinct subsets R of size 4 that satisfy this condition for some rotation k. Each of these subsets corresponds to a unique coloring where the blue vertices are the complement of the red vertices after some rotation.

Thus, there are 6 valid colorings out of a total of \(2^8 = 256\) possible colorings. The probability is therefore:

\[
\frac{6}{256} = \frac{3}{128}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{3}{128}\) is in its simplest form, so \(m = 3\) and \(n = 128\). Therefore, \(m + n = 131\).

\boxed{131}
