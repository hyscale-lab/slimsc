Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD squared for all possible such rhombuses.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties of rhombuses and hyperbolas. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the opposite angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, if ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, I can assume that if (x, y) is a point on the hyperbola, then (-x, -y) is also on the hyperbola.

So, let's denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, let's say A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), and similarly, B is (u, v) and D is (-u, -v). Now, since it's a rhombus, all sides should be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.

But wait, in a rhombus, the sides are equal, but the diagonals can have different lengths. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. The lengths of the diagonals can vary, but their intersection is at the origin.

Wait, but in this case, the diagonals are AC and BD, so AC is from A(x, y) to C(-x, -y), so its length is 2 times the distance from the origin to A, which is 2√(x² + y²). Similarly, BD is from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so its length is 2√(u² + v²). So, the lengths of the diagonals are 2√(x² + y²) and 2√(u² + v²).

But since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are (2x, 2y) and (2u, 2v), respectively. For them to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. So:

(2x)(2u) + (2y)(2v) = 0 ⇒ 4xu + 4yv = 0 ⇒ xu + yv = 0.

So, xu + yv = 0 is a condition that must be satisfied.

Now, points A, B, C, D lie on
