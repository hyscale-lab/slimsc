Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ +1. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. This is because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p must divide 8. But the order can't be 1 because n ≡ 1 mod p would imply 1 +1 ≡ 0 mod p, which would mean p=2, but I'll have to check that later.

Wait, p=2: Let me test small primes first. Let's see, n⁴ +1. For p=2, n⁴ is 0 or 1 mod 2. If n is even, n⁴ is 0, so n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 2, which isn't 0. If n is odd, n⁴ is 1 mod 2, so n⁴+1 is 0 mod 2. So p=2 divides n⁴ +1 for any odd n. But we need p² to divide n⁴ +1. Let's check for p=2: Is there an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n odd.

n is odd: n can be 1 or 3 mod 4. Let's compute 1⁴=1 mod4, 3⁴=(81)=1 mod4. So n⁴ is 1 mod4, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod4, which is not divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is only divisible by 2, not 4. So p can't be 2.

Next prime is p=5? Wait, wait, let me think about primes in order. After 2 is 3, then 5, 7, 11, etc.

Let's try p=5 first. Let me see if 5² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So we need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 25. Let's check possible residues mod 5 first. The multiplicative group mod5 has order 4, so 5th roots of unity, etc. Wait, but n must satisfy n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5. Let's check n mod5.

n can be 1,2,3,4 mod5. Compute n⁴ mod5:

1⁴=1

2⁴=16≡1 mod5

3⁴=81≡1 mod5

4⁴=256≡1 mod5

So n⁴ mod5 is always 1, so n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5. So 5 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=5 isn't a candidate.

Wait, that's interesting. So for p=5, n⁴ ≡1 mod5, so n⁴ +1≡2 mod5, which isn't 0. So 5 can't divide n⁴ +1, meaning p=5 is out.

Next prime is p=13? Or maybe p=17? Wait, perhaps I need to think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. Because n⁴ ≡ -
