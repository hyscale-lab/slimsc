Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. When any single digit is replaced by 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then replacing A with 1 gives 1BCD, which should be divisible by 7; same with replacing B, C, or D with 1.

I need to find the largest such N. Once I have N, I can compute Q and R by dividing N by 1000. For example, if N is 5678, then Q would be 5 and R would be 678, so Q + R would be 5 + 678 = 683. But of course, N is not 5678 here.

So, how to approach finding N? Let's think about the conditions.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are its digits. W is from 1 to 9, and X, Y, Z are from 0 to 9.

The problem states that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So:

1. Changing W to 1: 1XYZ must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing X to 1: W1YZ must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing Y to 1: WX1Z must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing Z to 1: WXY1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

I think the way to approach this is to find constraints on each digit based on these conditions. Let me think about each condition.

First, let me handle each case separately.

Case 1: Changing W to 1. So, 1XYZ is divisible by 7.

Since W is the thousands digit, when we change it to 1, the number becomes 1XYZ. So, 1000 + X*100 + Y*10 + Z must be divisible by 7. Let me write that as:

1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for the other cases.

Case 2: Changing X to 1. So, W1YZ must be divisible by 7. So, 1000W + 100*1 + 10Y + Z must be divisible by 7.

Case 3: Changing Y to 1: WX1Z must be divisible by 7. So, 1000W + 100X + 10*1 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Case 4: Changing Z to 1: WXY1 must be divisible by 7. So, 1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these four numbers must satisfy the divisibility condition.

Hmm, maybe I can write these as modular equations.

Let me compute each case modulo 7.

First, for 1XYZ:

1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, for W1YZ:

1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

For WX1Z:

1000W + 100X + 10 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

For WXY1:

1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me compute the coefficients of each digit modulo 7, because that could simplify the equations.

Compute 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let me rewrite each condition using these:

Case 1: 1XYZ:

1000 + 100X + 10Y + Z ≡ 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7. So,

6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.   ...(1)

Case 2: W1YZ:

1000W + 100 + 10Y + Z ≡ 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7. So,

6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.   ...(2)

Case 3: WX1Z:

1000W + 100X + 10 + Z ≡ 6W + 2X + 3 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7. So,

6W + 2X + 3 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.   ...(3)

Case 4: WXY1:

1000W + 100X + 10Y + 1 ≡ 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. So,

6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.   ...(4)

So, now I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 6W + 2X + 3 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 6W + 2X + 3Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, I can try to subtract some of these equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see what's possible.

First, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) minus equation (1):

(6W + 2 + 3Y + Z) - (6 + 2X + 3Y + Z) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6W + 2 + 3Y + Z -6 -2X -3Y -Z = 6W -6 -2X + 2.

So, 6(W -1) -2X + 2 ≡ 0 mod7.

Hmm, maybe factor this differently.

Alternatively, let's compute:

6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7,

minus,

6 + 2X + 3Y + Z ≡ 0 mod7,

Gives 6W -6 -2X +2 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, 6(W -1) -2X +2 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 2:

2*(3(W-1) -X +1) ≡0 mod7.

Since 2 and 7 are coprime, this implies:

3(W -1) -X +1 ≡0 mod7.

So,

3W -3 -X +1 ≡0 mod7,

Simplify:

3W - X -2 ≡0 mod7.

So,

3W - X ≡2 mod7.   ...(A)

That's one equation.

Now, let's subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

Equation (2) minus equation (3):

(6W + 2 + 3Y + Z) - (6W + 2X + 3 + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6W +2 +3Y +Z -6W -2X -3 -Z = (2 -3) + (3Y) + (-2X).

So,

-1 + 3Y - 2X ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as:

-2X + 3Y ≡1 mod7.

Alternatively,

3Y -2X ≡1 mod7.   ...(B)

Another equation.

Similarly, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

Equation (4) minus equation (3):

(6W + 2X + 3Y +1) - (6W + 2X + 3 + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6W +2X +3Y +1 -6W -2X -3 -Z = (3Y - Z) + (1 -3).

So,

3Y - Z -2 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as:

3Y - Z ≡2 mod7.   ...(C)

So, that's another equation.

Also, subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

Equation (4) minus equation (
