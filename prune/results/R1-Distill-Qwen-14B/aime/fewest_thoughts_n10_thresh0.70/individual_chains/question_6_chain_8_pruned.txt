Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, so I should take it step by step.

First, let me write down the functions clearly:

The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). The second function is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations.

Hmm, so both equations involve the composition of functions f and g, applied to sine and cosine functions with different arguments. It might help to first understand what f and g look like, then work on the compositions, and finally figure out how they relate to each other in the equations.

Let me start by defining f(x) and g(x):

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

So both f and g are absolute value functions, each subtracting a constant from another absolute value. These are likely to be piecewise linear functions with corners at certain points.

Let me plot f(x) first.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's break it down:

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we have absolute value again, it's going to reflect any negative parts back up.

So |x| - 1/2 will have a V-shape with vertex at (0, -1/2). Taking the absolute value of that will reflect the parts below the x-axis. So the points where |x| - 1/2 = 0 are at |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. For x outside that interval, f(x) = |x| - 1/2.

So f(x) is a V-shape that goes from 0 at x = ±1/2, down to 1/2 at x = 0, and then up again for |x| > 1/2. Wait, no. Let me correct that. Wait, |x| is always non-negative, so |x| - 1/2 is negative between -1/2 and 1/2. So f(x) = | |x| -1/2 |.

So, for |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape starting at x=1/2, y=0, going up with slope 1, and the same on the negative side.

But wait, for |x| <1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a V-shape pointing downward, with vertex at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So f(x) looks like a W, but actually, it's a diamond shape. Because from -1/2 to 1/2, it's a downward V, and beyond that, it's upward Vs.

Wait, no, actually, f(x) is a V shape in each interval. So overall, f(x) is a piecewise function with different slopes in each interval.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Same approach: start with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value.

So |x| -1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So for |x| <1/4, g(x)=1/4 - |x|, which is a downward V with vertex at (0,1/4), going down to (1/4,0) and (-1/4, 0). For |x| >=1/4, it's |x| -1/4, which is upward Vs starting at (1/4,0) and going up.

So both f and g are similar functions, just scaled differently.

Now, let's think about the composition f(sin(2πx)).

First, the inner function is sin(2πx). Let me note that sin(2πx) has a period of 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k; here k=2π, so period is 2π/(2π)=1.

So
