Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that z is a complex number, and since its magnitude is 4, that means |z| = 4. So z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That's because the magnitude is 4, and the angle θ can vary from 0 to 2π radians.

So, maybe I can express z in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, using polar form might simplify things because the magnitude is fixed. Let me try the polar form approach.

Let me denote z = 4e^{iθ} = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/(e^{iθ}) = e^{-iθ}, right? So, 1/z = (1/4)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Now, the expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me compute each part separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i)z. Substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, this becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Similarly, compute (96 + 144i)/z. Since 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, this becomes (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can combine these terms or find a way to express them in terms that can be simplified. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the expression as:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z = A z + B / z,

where A = 75 + 117i and B = 96 + 144i.

Hmm, another approach: since |z| = 4, then z and 1/z are related. Wait, perhaps I can write this expression as A z + B / z, and maybe factor something out or find a common term. Alternatively, maybe I can write this expression in terms of z + 1/z, but that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as a function of θ, where z = 4e^{iθ}. Let me express A and B in terms of their polar forms too. Maybe that would help.

Wait, let's compute A and B first.

A = 75 + 117i. Let's compute its magnitude and angle. The magnitude would be sqrt(75^2 + 117^2). Let me calculate that: 75^2 is 5625, 117^2 is 13689. Sum is 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So |A| = sqrt(19314). Hmm, sqrt(19314) is approximately let's see, 139^2 is 19321, which is 19314 + 7, so sqrt(19314) is about 139 - a bit. Hmm, maybe not necessary to compute it numerically, perhaps I can compute it symbolically.

Similarly, B = 96 + 144i. Its magnitude would be sqrt(96^2 + 144^2). 96^2 is 9216, 144^2 is 20736. Sum is 9216 + 20736 = 30000. So |B| = sqrt(30000) = 100*sqrt(3) ≈ 173.205.

Wait, maybe I can write both A and B in polar form, which might make the expression easier to handle.

So, let me denote A as |A| e^{iα}, where α is the angle of A. Similarly, B as |B| e^{iβ}, where β is the angle of B.

Then, the expression becomes:

A z + B / z = |A| e^{iα} z + |B| e^{iβ} / z.

But z is 4 e^{iθ}, so substituting in:

|A| e^{iα} * 4 e^{iθ} + |B| e^{iβ} / (4 e^{iθ}) = 4 |A| e^{i(α + θ)} + (|B| / 4) e^{-iθ} e^{iβ}.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me re-express it properly.

Wait, z is 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So, A z = (75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ}.

Similarly, B / z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

(75 + 117i) * 4 e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out 4 from the first term and 1/4 from the second term. Wait, perhaps it's better to write 4*(75 + 117i) as a separate complex number, say C, and (96 + 144i)/4 as another complex number, say D.

So, C = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

D = (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So, the expression is C e^{iθ} + D e^{-iθ}.

Now, since C and D are complex numbers, I can write this as:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can expand these terms using Euler's formula.

e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ.

e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, substituting, the expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each part separately.

First, expand (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiplying out:

300 * cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, for (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes:

24 cosθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i + 36 sinθ.

Now, let's combine these two parts.

First part:
300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i.

Second part:
24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

Now, adding them together:

Real parts:
300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

Simplify real parts:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

[300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i

Which is [ (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ ] i

So that's 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)i.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and the imaginary part is 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the entire expression. So, we're interested in maximizing Re[ (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z ].

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ.

Wait, that seems manageable. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, so this is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, which can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is some phase shift.

Wait, but in this case, it's A cosθ + B sinθ, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Hmm, so that's equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, the maximum value of this expression is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105,  let me check: 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000; 32^2=1,024; 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2= 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 160,000+25,600=185,600+1,024=186,624. But since B is negative, (-432)^2 is 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

Hmm, sqrt(291,600) is 540, because 540^2 is 291,600.

Wait, 500^2 is 250,000, 540^2 is (500 +40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Yes, that's correct. So R=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540. So the maximum possible real part of the expression is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps.

Wait, when I expanded (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ), let me double-check that.

300 * cosθ is 300 cosθ.

300i * sinθ is 300i sinθ.

468i * cosθ is 468i cosθ.

468i^2 sinθ is 468*(-1) sinθ= -468 sinθ.

So combining, 300 cosθ -468 sinθ + (300 sinθ +468 cosθ)i. That's correct.

Similarly, for (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ):

24 cosθ is 24 cosθ.

24*(-i) sinθ is -24i sinθ.

36i * cosθ is 36i cosθ.

36i*(-i) sinθ = -36i^2 sinθ = 36 sinθ.

So combining, 24 cosθ +36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)i. Correct.

Adding the two parts:

Real parts: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

That's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Correct.

Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ +468 cosθ -24 sinθ +36 cosθ.

Which is 276 sinθ +504 cosθ. Correct.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, whose maximum is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)=540.

So that's the maximum possible real part. So the answer should be 540.

Wait, but let me just think again: the expression is a real part of a complex function, and the maximum value is 540. That seems correct.

So, yeah, I think the answer is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\).

Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we compute each term separately:

1. \((75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\).
2. \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{24 + 36i}{e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\).

Thus, the entire expression becomes:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

Expressing \(e^{i\theta}\) and \(e^{-i\theta}\) using Euler's formula (\(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\)), we expand and simplify the expression. After combining like terms, the real part of the expression is found to be:
\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

To find the maximum value of this real part, we recognize it as a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be rewritten in the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\). The maximum value of such an expression is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\), where \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\). Calculating this:
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540.
\]

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\(\boxed{540}\)
