Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Alright, so let me start by drawing a rough sketch of the situation. I'll try to visualize the two rectangles.

First, rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me label the rectangle with points A, B, C, D. Let's say A is the bottom-left corner, B is the top-left, C is the top-right, and D is the bottom-right. So AB is the left side, BC is the top, CD is the right side, and DA is the bottom.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH. Let me assume E is the bottom-left, F is the top-left, G is the top-right, H is the bottom-right. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line. So that line is probably the base or one of the sides of the rectangles? Hmm, maybe not necessarily the base, but a straight line that connects these four points.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means those four points are concyclic. So the circle passes through A, D, H, G.

Given lengths: BC is 16, so BC is the top side of rectangle ABCD. So BC is 16 units. AB is 107, so AB is the left side of ABCD, which is 107 units. Then, in rectangle EFGH, FG is 17. FG is the top side, so that would be 17 units. EF is 184, so EF is the left side of EFGH, which is 184 units.

We need to find CE, which is the distance between points C and E.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign point D as the origin (0,0) because it's often easier.

Wait, but if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (x, 0) where BC is 16. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, let's assign coordinates such that point D is at (0,0). Then
