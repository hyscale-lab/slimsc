Okay, so I have this problem about finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by the formula: SA = 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is V = lwh.

Given that SA = 54 and V = 23, I can write these equations:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
lwh = 23

I think I can simplify the surface area equation by dividing both sides by 2: lw + lh + wh = 27.

Now, I need to relate this to the sphere that can contain the box. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal (d) can be found using the formula: d = sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that: r = d/2, so r² = (d²)/4 = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, the key is to find l² + w² + h² for the boxes in B, then compute r² as (l² + w² + h²)/4.

But how do I find l² + w² + h² given that I know lw + lh + wh and lwh?

I remember that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). So, if I can find (l + w + h)², I can subtract 2(lw + lh + wh) to get l² + w² + h².

But wait, I don't know l + w + h. Hmm. Maybe I can express l² + w² + h² in terms of the known quantities.

Let me denote S = l + w + h, P = lw + lh + wh = 27, and V = lwh = 23.

So, S² = l² + w² + h² + 2P. Therefore, l² + w² + h² = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, r² would be (S² - 54)/4.

Now, the problem is that I don't know S. But maybe I can find the minimum possible value of S² - 54, which would minimize r². Wait, but I'm looking for the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes. So, the sphere must be big enough to contain any box from B. Therefore, the sphere's radius must accommodate the box with the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for the minimal sphere that can contain all boxes in B, the radius must be equal to the maximum space diagonal divided by 2, where the maximum is taken over all boxes in B.

But that seems a bit conflicting with my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps all boxes in B have the same space diagonal? No, that can't be. Because with fixed surface area and volume, the dimensions can vary, leading to different space diagonals.

Wait, so perhaps I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, the sphere's radius will
