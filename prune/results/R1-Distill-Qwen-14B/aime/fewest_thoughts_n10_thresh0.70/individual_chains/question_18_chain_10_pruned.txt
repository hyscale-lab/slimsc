Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. 

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, right? So, each vertex is spaced 30 degrees apart because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. That might be useful later.

Now, the question is about rectangles. In a regular polygon, especially one with an even number of sides, I think rectangles can be formed by connecting certain vertices. But wait, it's a dodecagon with 12 sides. So, maybe the rectangles are formed by selecting four vertices that form a rectangle, meaning the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, not all sides are aligned in the same way as a rectangle. Oh, but the sides can be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are not necessarily the edges of the polygon but could be diagonals as well.

I think a key point here is that a rectangle is defined by having two pairs of parallel sides. In the case of a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by the same number of steps around the polygon. For example, in a regular hexagon, the opposite sides are parallel, and certain diagonals are also parallel.

Wait, so in a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by 6 edges, right? Because 12/2 = 6. Similarly, diagonals can be parallel if they skip the same number of vertices. So, for any given edge, the edges that are parallel to it are those that are 6 steps away around the polygon.

But for a rectangle, we need two pairs of such parallel lines. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are two different sets of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) in the dodecagon.

I think the way to approach this is to
