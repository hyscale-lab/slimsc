Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, and each internal angle is the same. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which probably means it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe similar to a regular one but not necessarily with equal angles.

Since opposite sides are parallel, this might be a type of hexagon called a "truncated triangle" or something similar. I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's a hexagon that can be thought of as being formed by extending the sides of a triangle until they meet, forming a larger triangle.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a larger triangle. So AB, CD, and EF are each sides of this larger triangle, but probably the original hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

Wait, actually, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these sides is a side of the triangle, but perhaps the hexagon is sitting inside this triangle, touching each side.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. Let's denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Now, the triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. Maybe these are the lengths of the sides of the larger triangle, and the hexagon is somehow related to this triangle.

I remember that in such hexagons, each side of the larger triangle can be expressed in terms of the hexagon's side and the distances from the hexagon to the vertices of the triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the sides of the triangle are proportionally related to the hexagon's sides.

Let me think about similar triangles here. If the hexagon is inside the larger triangle, then each side of the triangle is divided by the hexagon into segments. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, the lengths of these segments should be proportional.

Wait, here's an idea. In a triangle, if lines are drawn parallel to the sides, they cut off smaller similar triangles from the original. Maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

But the hexagon is equilateral, not necessarily similar. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of intercepts. Each side of the triangle is being intercepted by two sides
