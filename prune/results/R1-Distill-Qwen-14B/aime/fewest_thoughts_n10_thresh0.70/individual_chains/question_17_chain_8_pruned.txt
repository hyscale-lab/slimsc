Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p + q. Hmm, okay.

First, let me remember that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume V is abc. So in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. So, 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. And abc = 23.

Now, the problem is about the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(a² + b² + c²), so the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So I need to find the maximum value of a² + b² + c², given that ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23. Wait, no, actually, wait. The sphere must contain any box from set B, so the maximum possible space diagonal among all such boxes in B will determine the minimal sphere radius needed. So r² is (max a² + b² + c²)/4.

So I need to maximize a² + b² + c² given ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

How can I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers or some inequality.

I recall that for positive real numbers a, b, c, we can use the identity that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So since ab + bc + ac is 27, we can write a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2*27 = (a + b + c)² - 54.

So if I can find the maximum of (a + b + c)², then subtract 54 and divide by 4 to get r². Wait, but actually, since a² + b² + c² is (a + b + c)^2 - 54, to maximize a² + b² + c², we need to maximize (a + b + c)^2, which is equivalent to maximizing a + b + c.

Wait, but does the maximum of a + b + c occur under these constraints? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider symmetric conditions or use inequalities like AM ≥ GM or something else.

Wait, but since the problem is about maximizing a² + b² + c² given fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, perhaps we can consider cases where two variables are equal, or perhaps one variable approaches zero.

Wait, but if one variable approaches zero, then the volume abc would approach zero, but in our case, abc is fixed at 23, which is positive. So none of the variables can be zero. So all a, b, c are positive real numbers.

Alternatively, maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers would be the way to go. Let me set up the function to maximize.

Let me define f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

We have the constraints:

g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac = 27,

h(a, b, c) = abc = 23.

So we can set up the Lagrangian with two constraints. The Lagrangian L would be:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂a = 2a - λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂b = 2b - λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0

∂L/∂c = 2c - λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0

And the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27,

abc = 23.

So now we have a system of equations:

1) 2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc

2) 2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac

3) 2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab

And,

4) ab + bc + ac = 27,

5) abc = 23.

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can find a relationship between a, b, c.

Subtracting equation 1 and equation 2:

2a - 2b = λ(b + c - a - c) + μ(bc - ac)

Simplify:

2(a - b) = λ(b - a) + μ c (b - a)

Factor out (a - b):

2(a - b) = (λ + μ c)(b - a)

Which is:

2(a - b) = -(λ + μ c)(a - b)

If a ≠ b, we can divide both sides by (a - b):

2 = -(λ + μ c)

Similarly, if a ≠ b, then 2 = -(λ + μ c) --> λ + μ c = -2.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 - equation 3:

2b - 2c = λ(a + c - a - b) + μ(ac - ab)

Simplify:

2(b - c) = λ(c - b) + μ a (c - b)

Factor out (b - c):

2(b - c) = -(λ + μ a)(b - c)

If b ≠ c, then:

2 = -(λ + μ a)

So, from the first subtraction, λ + μ c = -2,

From the second subtraction, λ + μ a = -2.

Thus,

λ + μ c = λ + μ a --> μ c = μ a.

If μ ≠ 0, then c = a.

Wait, so if a ≠ b and b ≠ c, then we get that c = a.

So, let's assume that a = c. Then, let's see if this holds.

So, if a = c, let's see what the equations become.

Let me denote a = c.

So, from equation 1:

2a = λ(b + a) + μ b a

Similarly, equation 2:

2b = λ(a + a) + μ a a

Equation 3:

2a = λ(a + b) + μ a b

Wait, equation 1 and equation 3 become the same since a = c.

So, equation 2: 2b = 2 λ a + μ a².

Equation 1: 2a = λ (b + a) + μ a b.

So, let's write these:

From equation 2:

2b = 2 λ a + μ a² --> equation (i)

From equation 1:

2a = λ (b + a) + μ a b --> equation (ii)

So, from equation (i): we can express λ from equation (ii) perhaps.

Wait, equation (i): 2b = 2 λ a + μ a² --> Let's solve for λ:

2 λ a = 2b - μ a² --> λ = (2b - μ a²)/(2a)

Plugging into equation (ii):

2a = [ (2b - μ a²)/(2a) ] * (b + a) + μ a b

Simplify:

2a = [ (2b - μ a²)(b + a) ] / (2a) + μ a b

Multiply both sides by 2a:

4a² = (2b - μ a²)(b + a) + 2a * μ a b

Expand the first term:

(2b)(b) + (2b)(a) - μ a
