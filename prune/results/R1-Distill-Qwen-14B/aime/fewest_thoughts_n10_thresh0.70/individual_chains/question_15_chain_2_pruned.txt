Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right usually involves moving right and up. In an 8x8 grid, to get from one corner to the other, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, that makes sense why the path length is 16.

Now, the problem is about the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. I think changing direction refers to switching from moving right to up or vice versa. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change.

Wait, but how does this relate to the number of direction changes? Let's consider a simple example. If I have a path that goes all the way right first and then all the way up, that's only one direction change. Similarly, if I go all the way up first and then all the way right, that's also one change. So, in those cases, the number of direction changes is 1.

What if the path changes direction more times? For example, if I go right, then up, then right, then up, that's three direction changes. Wait, no, let's see: starting right, then up (1 change), then right again (2nd change), then up again (3rd change). So, each time it switches, it's another change.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, you have to make 8 rights and 8 ups. So, how many direction changes can there be? Well, the maximum number of direction changes would be when you alternate directions as much as possible. For example, right, up, right, up, etc., which would result in 15 direction changes because you have 16 steps and each switch is a direction change. But that's the maximum, which is probably not needed here.

But the problem is about exactly four direction changes. So, how can that happen?

Let me think. Each direction change is a switch between right and up. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, that means it switches direction four times. So, how many segments does that divide the path into?

Each time you change direction, you create a new segment. So, starting with the first direction, each change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would split the path into five segments.

Wait, let me think: starting direction, then each change adds a segment. So, if you have four changes, that's five segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up.

So, for example, one segment right, then up, then right, then up, then right. That's four changes and five segments.

So, okay, with four direction changes, the path is made up of five straight segments, alternating between right and up.

Now, since
