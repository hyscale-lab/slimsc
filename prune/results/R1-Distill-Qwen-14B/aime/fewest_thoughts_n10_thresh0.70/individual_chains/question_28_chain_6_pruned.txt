Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD, and the edges are given in a way that opposite edges are equal. AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. All these edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89) respectively. The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. They want it in the form mâˆšn/p where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then find m + n + p.

First, I need to recall what an incenter in a tetrahedron is. It's the point that's equidistant from all four faces, kind of like the 3D version of the incenter in a triangle. That distance is called the inradius. To find it, I think I need the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of the faces, but wait, no, in 3D, for the inradius, it's Volume divided by the sum of the areas of the faces, but each area is weighted by some factor? Or maybe it's Volume divided by the total surface area? Hmm, in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces. Is that right? Let me think. In a triangle, it's area divided by semiperimeter, but in 3D, the formula might be similar but scaled. Yes, I think r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. So I need to compute V and S.

But to compute V, I need to know the volume of this tetrahedron. Since all opposite edges are equal, this is a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe it's called an isosceles tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where all opposite edges are equal, which sometimes is called a disphenoid. So yes, it's a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, I remember that the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edges. Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in coordinate space in such a way that the calculations are easier. Let me try that.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that the midpoints are at the origin or something symmetric. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to the origin. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2
