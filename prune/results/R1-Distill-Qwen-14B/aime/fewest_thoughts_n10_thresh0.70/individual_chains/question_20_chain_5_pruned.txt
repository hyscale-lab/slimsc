Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips. I need to place some of them in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip I try to place would break one or more of the previous conditions.

So, essentially, I have to arrange some chips in the grid such that each row is uniformly one color and each column is uniformly another color, and the arrangement is maximalâ€”meaning I can't add any more chips without violating the uniformity in rows or columns.

Hmm. Let's try to parse this.

First, each row must be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly for each column. But wait, no, the condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, a row can have multiple chips, but they all must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

I think that means that in any row, if there's at least one chip, all the chips in that row must be the same color. Same for columns. So, if a row has some chips, they must be all white or all black.

Wait, but the chips are placed in the grid, so each cell can have at most one chip. So, each cell is either white, black, or empty.

But the condition is about all chips in the same row or column having the same color. So, if a row has chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly for columns.

So, for example, if a row has both white and black chips, that's not allowed. So each row can have all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly for each column.

Wait, but that's a bit more restrictive. Because if a column has, say, two white chips and three black chips, that would violate the condition. So, each column must be all white, all black, or empty.

Wait, but the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So that means each row is monochromatic
