Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read the problem again and try to visualize it.

So, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. Got it.

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's assume rectangle ABCD is placed such that AB is the base, BC is the height. So, points A, B, C, D would be arranged clockwise. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle; since D, E, C, F are collinear, E must lie somewhere on the line DC. Wait, but since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line must pass through D, E, C, and F in order. So, the line is DC extended beyond C to include E and F.

Wait, but if EFGH is a rectangle, then EF is one side, FG is another. So, EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So, EF is the base, FG is the height. So, the rectangle EFGH must be adjacent to point E and F, but since E is on the line DC, perhaps F is also on the same line?

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D-E-C-F along the line. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, the line DC is extended beyond C to F. So, E is on DC, and F is beyond C on that same line.

Now, rectangle EFGH has E and F as two consecutive vertices, so EF is a side of length 184. Then FG is another side of length 17. So, EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17, but arranged such that E-F is the longer side, since 184 is longer than 17. So, EFGH is a tall, narrow rectangle.

Now, considering the other rectangle ABCD, which has sides AB=107 and BC=16. So, AB is the base, BC is the height. So, ABCD is a taller rectangle than it is wide. Wait, AB is longer than BC, so ABCD is a longer rectangle, wider than it is tall.

Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, ADHG is cyclic. Hmm, cyclic quadrilaterals have properties where the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. Also, Ptolemy's theorem applies here, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of opposite sides.

But before getting into that, maybe I should assign coordinates to each point to make things clearer. Let's assign a coordinate system to make calculations easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, AB=107. So, point D is at (0, 0). Then, point C is at (107, 0), because AB is 107, so from D to C is the length of AB, which is 107. Wait no, in a rectangle, AB and DC are the lengths. So, if AB is 107, then DC is also 107. So, if D is at
