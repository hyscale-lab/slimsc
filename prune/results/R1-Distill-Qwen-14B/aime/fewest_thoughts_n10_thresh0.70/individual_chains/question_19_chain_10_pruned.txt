Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I, with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has some specific properties. Let me note down the given information:

1. Circumradius (R) = 13
2. Inradius (r) = 6
3. IA is perpendicular to OI.

We need to find AB·AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the inradius and circumradius are related to other properties like the area, semiperimeter, and side lengths. Let me recall some formulas.

First, the area (Δ) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter (s) as Δ = r·s.

Also, the area can be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides as Δ = (a·b·c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the side lengths.

But wait, we have IA perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key geometric condition. I need to figure out what that implies about the triangle.

I remember that the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) are both important centers in a triangle. The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors.

For some triangles, these centers coincide, but that's only in equilateral triangles. In other triangles, they are different points. The fact that IA is perpendicular to OI must give us some special properties.

Let me try to visualize this. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the line from the incenter to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter.

I think I can use coordinate geometry to model this. Maybe place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can find some relations using vectors or trigonometric identities.

Wait, perhaps there's a theorem or property related to this condition. Let me think. I recall that in some triangles, the Euler line connects the incenter and circumcenter, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vector approaches. Let me consider vectors for points O and I.

Wait, another approach: since IA is perpendicular to OI, the dot product of vectors IA and OI should be zero.

Let me try that.

First, let's denote vectors. Let me place the incenter I at the origin to simplify calculations. Wait, if I place I at the origin, then vector I is (0,0). Then, vector IA would be vector A, since IA goes from I to A.

Vector OI would be vector O, since I is at (0,0). So, the condition IA · OI = 0 translates to vector A · vector O = 0
