Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. The numbers are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

It also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. I need to find how many own all four: the ring, clubs, spade, and the candy hearts. Wait, but the candy hearts are mentioned separately as something everyone owns. So, the four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But the candy hearts are already owned by everyone, so when it's talking about owning exactly two or three things, does that include the candy hearts?

Hmm, maybe. Because the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are a given for everyone. So, when it's talking about owning exactly two or three, those are in addition to the candy hearts. So, for example, if someone owns exactly two of the other three items, they must own the candy hearts as well. So, the total number of things someone owns is either three (if they own exactly two of the three plus the candy hearts) or four (if they own all three plus the candy hearts).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of residents who own all four. So, that would be the ones who own the ring, clubs, spade, and candy hearts. But since candy hearts are already owned by everyone, the key is to find the number of people who own all three of the other items.

So, maybe I can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how inclusion-exclusion works for four sets, but since the candy hearts are mandatory, perhaps it's a bit different.

Wait, but actually, in the problem, the four items are: diamond ring (D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Since everyone has C, maybe we can think of the
