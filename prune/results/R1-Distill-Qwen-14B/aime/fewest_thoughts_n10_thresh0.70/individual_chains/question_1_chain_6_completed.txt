Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So substituting y into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which simplifies to:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent.

Wait, 2^(-2/3) is 2^(-8/12). Then 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). So when you multiply, exponents add: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12). So x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Therefore, x = sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24).

So x = 2^(-7/24). Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plug in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8).

So y = 2^(-3/8).

And from equation (z), z = 2^(-5/12).

So now I have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2. Let me write them clearly:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, I need to compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me first compute x^4 y^3 z^2.

Since x = 2^(-7/24), x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-7/24 * 4) = 2^(-7/6).

Similarly, y = 2^(-3/8), so y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8).

z = 2^(-5/12), so z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-5/6).

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

When multiplying with the same base, add exponents:

Total exponent = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

First, let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = (-28)/24

-9/8 = (-27)/24

-5/6 = (-20)/24

So adding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: (-75)/24. 75 and 24 can both be divided by 3.

75 ÷ 3 = 25; 24 ÷3=8. So it's (-25)/8.

Thus, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8).

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

The absolute value of that is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So m =25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5^2 and 8 is 2^3, no common factors.

Thus, m + n =25 +8=33.


The given system of logarithmic equations can be converted into exponential form to express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2. After substituting and simplifying, we find:

\[
x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

We then compute the expression \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Thus,

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value gives \(\frac{25}{8}\). Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
