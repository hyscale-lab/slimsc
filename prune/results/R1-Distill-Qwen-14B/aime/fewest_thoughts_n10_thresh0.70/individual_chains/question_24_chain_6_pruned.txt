Okay, let's see. I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. The list has some specific properties, so I need to break them down one by one and see how they fit together.

First, the problem says the sum of all the items is 30. That's straightforward. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, they should total 30.

Next, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so no other number can appear as many times as 9 does. That means 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.

Then, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For the median not to be in the list, the list must have an even number of elements because in an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Wait, no, actually, the median is the average, which may not be an integer. But the problem says the median is a positive integer. So, for the median to be an integer, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. But importantly, this median is not present in the list itself. So, the median is some integer that's not in the list.

Alright, let's try to structure this.

First, let's think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least twice. But actually, it has to appear more times than any other number. So, for example, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear three times, and so on.

Let's also think about the median. The median is not in the list, so that tells me that the list has an even number of elements because, for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which would be present in the list. But wait, no. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the exact middle number, which is in the list. Therefore, if the median isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because then the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be an integer only if the two middle numbers are not the same. Wait, but the problem says the median is a positive integer, so the average must be an integer. So, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. But the median itself is not present in the list.

Wait, let's clarify that. Suppose the list has n elements. If n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term, which is in the list. So the median would be present, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, n must be even. So
