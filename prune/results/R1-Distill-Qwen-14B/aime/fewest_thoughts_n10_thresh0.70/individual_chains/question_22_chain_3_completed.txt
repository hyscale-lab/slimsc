Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that seems important. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. The question is asking for the side length of the hexagon.

Wait, the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal in length, right? But it's not necessarily regular because the angles could be different. But since all opposite sides are parallel, maybe that imposes some symmetry.

I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "zonogon." But I'm not too sure. Anyway, let me try to visualize this.

So, the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Opposite sides are AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. Because it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Hmm, so if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet to form a triangle. Let me think about how that works.

Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. Let's see, if I have the hexagon, and then extend AB, CD, and EF. Since AB and CD are opposite sides and are parallel, their extensions should be parallel. Wait, but if AB and CD are extended, they would be parallel lines, so they can't meet to form a triangle. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, actually, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, perhaps each pair of sides is extended until they meet. Since AB and CD are parallel, their extensions won't meet. But maybe each side is extended in both directions? Or perhaps each of AB, CD, EF is extended in one direction until they meet.

Wait, maybe it's the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me think: if you extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, then those extensions might meet at certain points forming a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions should meet at points outside the hexagon.

So, imagine AB is extended beyond A, and CD is extended beyond C. Since AB and CD are parallel, their extensions beyond A and C won't meet. But perhaps if we extend AB in the opposite direction beyond B and CD beyond D. Wait, but AB and CD are parallel, so their extensions beyond B and D would also be parallel, so they won't meet. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Perhaps it's each of the lines AB, CD, EF that are extended until they meet the other two lines. So, line AB is extended past A and B, CD is extended past C and D, and EF is extended past E and F. Then, the three extended lines AB, CD, EF might intersect each other in three points, forming a triangle. Since AB, CD, and EF are all extended, their intersections would form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300.

But AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, so they are all of length 's' which is the side length we need to find.

Wait, but AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, but when extended, their extensions form a triangle. Maybe the lengths of the sides of this triangle are related to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

I think I need to recall some properties of such hexagons and the triangles formed by their side extensions.

I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by extending three alternate sides has some relation to the side length of the hexagon. Maybe the sides of this triangle are proportional to the side length of the hexagon.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is similar to some triangle formed by the hexagon's sides, scaled by some factor.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of similar triangles or intercept theorems.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle's sides are the result of the hexagon's sides being translated in some way.

Wait, another approach: maybe the hexagon can be considered as a central section of the triangle, and the side length of the hexagon relates to how much of the triangle is left after removing two smaller similar triangles from the corners.

Wait, that might make sense. So, if I have a large triangle, and inside it, near each corner, I remove a smaller triangle, the remaining figure might be the hexagon.

But wait, the hexagon has six sides, so maybe each corner of the large triangle is cut off by a small triangle, creating a hexagon.

But in this case, the original triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if that's a right triangle. Let me compute 200² + 240²: 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000. So no, 200,240,300 isn't a right triangle because 200² + 240² ≠ 300².

Wait, actually, 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000, so it's 7600 less. So it's not a right triangle.

Hmm, okay, so it's some scalene triangle.

If I think of the hexagon as being formed by cutting off three small triangles from the original large triangle, each cut being parallel to one side.

But wait, in the problem, the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel. So perhaps each side of the hexagon is a segment between two such cuts.

Wait, maybe the hexagon is actually similar in a way to the triangle, but scaled down.

But I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, it's a special case. So, perhaps it's a translationally symmetric hexagon, where each pair of opposite sides are not only parallel but also equidistant from the center? Or maybe not the center, but just parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as a truncated triangle, where each side of the triangle is truncated by a segment of length 's', resulting in a hexagon.

Wait, yes, that might be it.

Imagine starting with a large triangle, and on each side, we remove a smaller segment of length 's', but in such a way that the remaining figure is a hexagon with opposite sides parallel.

Wait, but the problem says the triangle is formed by extensions of AB, CD, EF. So perhaps the original triangle is larger, and the hexagon is inside it, and the sides of the triangle are formed by extending the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe the triangle is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, and the hexagon's sides are each a part of lines that extend to form the triangle's sides.

So, if the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, then the hexagon is formed by cutting off smaller triangles from each corner of the large triangle.

Wait, that might be a better approach.

In such a case, the hexagon would have sides that are parallel to the sides of the large triangle, but shorter.

But in our problem, the hexagon is equilateral and all opposite sides are parallel. So, if the original triangle is the large one with sides 200, 240, 300, then the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from the corners of the large triangle, each cut parallel to a side.

In such a scenario, the hexagon's sides would be between these cuts.

But let's think about how the side lengths of the hexagon relate to the sides of the triangle.

If each corner is cut by a line parallel to the opposite side, the resulting figure is a hexagon. And since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides must be equal in length. But the cuts are made by lines parallel to the triangle's sides, so each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the hexagon has all opposite sides parallel. So if the hexagon is formed by cutting off the corners of the triangle, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon would be parallel to the same side of the triangle.

Wait, that would mean that opposite sides of the hexagon are not only parallel but also have the same length? But the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are the same length.

Hmm, maybe that approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside, with all its sides being extensions from the triangle's sides?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about similar triangles.

Let me denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me compute some properties of this triangle, maybe its area or heights, which might help.

First, let's compute the semi-perimeter, s = (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = (740)/2 = 370.

Then, using Heron's formula, area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[370*(370 - 200)*(370 - 240)*(370 - 300)].

Calculating each term:
370 - 200 = 170
370 - 240 = 130
370 - 300 = 70

So area = sqrt[370 * 170 * 130 * 70]

But this seems like a big number. Let me compute it step by step.

First, 370 * 170 = 62,900
130 * 70 = 9,100
Then, 62,900 * 9,100 = Hmm, that's a huge number: 62,900 * 9,100 = 573, 190,000? Wait, 62,900 * 9,100 = 62,900 * 9.1 * 1000.

Wait, 62,900 * 9.1 = let's compute 62,900 * 9 = 566,100, and 62,900 * 0.1 = 6,290. So total is 566,100 + 6,290 = 572,390. Then multiply by 1000: 572,390,000.

So area = sqrt(572,390,000). Let me see:

What's sqrt(572,390,000). Let's approximate.

Note that 23,923^2 = approx 572,390,000? Wait, 23,923 squared is about (24,000)^2 = 576,000,000, which is a bit higher. So maybe 23,923^2 is less than that.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 23,920^2:

23,920^2 = (24,000 - 80)^2 = 24,000^2 - 2*24,000*80 + 80^2 = 576,000,000 - 3,840,000 + 6,400 = 572,166,400.

Hmm, so 23,920^2 = 572,166,400.

The area is sqrt(572,390,000), which is a bit more than 23,920.

Compute 23,920^2 = 572,166,400.

Difference: 572,390,000 - 572,166,400 = 223,600.

So, approximately, sqrt(572,390,000) ≈ 23,920 + (223,600)/(2*23,920) ) ≈ 23,920 + 223,600 / 47,840 ≈ 23,920 + 4.68 ≈ 23,924.68.

So area is approximately 23,924.68.

But maybe we don't need the exact area. Alternatively, perhaps the area can be expressed as 23,924.68 ≈ 23,925.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF, which are sides of the hexagon, which is equilateral with side length 's'.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle's sides are proportional to the hexagon's side length.

Wait, another thought: in such a setup, perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon's sides, scaled by a factor.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, maybe I can think of the triangle as a larger version of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps the sides of the triangle are equal to 2s multiplied by some trigonometric function.

Alternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides is separated by some distance, which is related to the triangle's heights.

Wait, perhaps the heights of the triangle correspond to the distances between the opposite sides of the hexagon.

But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry could help. Let me try to model the hexagon in a coordinate system.

Let me place the triangle ABC with sides 200, 240, 300 in a coordinate system.

Wait, but which side corresponds to which? Let's assume the triangle is labeled such that side AB is 200, BC is 240, and CA is 300. But I think the orientation might not matter.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to place the triangle in such a way that one vertex is at the origin, another on the x-axis, and the third somewhere in the plane.

Let me try that.

Let me place vertex A at (0, 0), vertex B at (200, 0), and vertex C somewhere in the plane.

Then, the lengths are AB = 200, BC = 240, and AC = 300.

Wait, but if AB is 200, BC is 240, and AC is 300, then triangle ABC has sides 200, 240, 300.

Wait, let's compute the coordinates of point C.

From point A(0,0), point C is somewhere with distance 300 from A, and from point B(200,0), point C is at distance 240.

So, let me set up equations:

Let C = (x, y). Then,

From A: x² + y² = 300² = 90,000

From B: (x - 200)^2 + y² = 240² = 57,600

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(x² + y²) - [(x - 200)^2 + y²] = 90,000 - 57,600

Expanding:

x² + y² - (x² - 400x + 40,000 + y²) = 32,400

Simplify:

x² + y² - x² + 400x - 40,000 - y² = 32,400

So,

400x - 40,000 = 32,400

400x = 72,400

x = 72,400 / 400 = 181.

So x = 181.

Then, from point A's equation: x² + y² = 90,000

So,

181² + y² = 90,000

181^2 = 32,761

So,

y² = 90,000 - 32,761 = 57,239

So y = sqrt(57,239). Let's compute that.

sqrt(57,239) ≈ 239.247, as 239^2 is 57,121, and 240^2 is 57,600.

So y ≈ 239.247.

So, point C is at (181, 239.247).

So, now, we have triangle ABC with coordinates A(0,0), B(200,0), C(181, 239.247).

Now, the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, all of length 's'.

But wait, the hexagon is inside the triangle? Or is it formed by extending the sides?

Wait, in the problem, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which are extended to form the triangle.

So, AB is a side of the hexagon, and when extended, it becomes a side of the triangle.

Similarly, CD and EF are extended to form the other sides.

Wait, so the triangle's sides are the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

Thus, the triangle is larger than the hexagon, and the hexagon is inside it.

So, perhaps each side of the triangle is formed by extending a side of the hexagon.

So, if I imagine the triangle as the outer boundary, and the hexagon as a figure inside it, with each of its sides being a part of the triangle's sides.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, so each side of the triangle is extended beyond the hexagon.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is formed by two extensions of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe the triangle is such that each of its sides is formed by the extensions of two non-adjacent sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon has three pairs of opposite sides, each pair is parallel.

So, for example, AB and DE are opposite and parallel, BC and EF are opposite and parallel, CD and FA are opposite and parallel.

If I extend AB beyond A and B, it will not meet DE since they are parallel. Similarly, extending CD beyond C and D won't meet FA.

But perhaps the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF in a way that their extensions meet to form the triangle.

Wait, perhaps each extension is in one direction only.

Wait, maybe when you extend AB beyond A, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these lines meet at a point, forming the triangle.

But since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, their extensions beyond certain vertices will meet to form a triangle.

Wait, let's try to model this.

Let me consider the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA as sides.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, we can perhaps model it as a centrally symmetric hexagon, but not necessarily regular.

Wait, but in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "parallelogon," but in two dimensions, the only convex parallelogons are parallelograms (with four sides). So perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I can model the hexagon as a translation of a smaller hexagon within the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Since the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by points along these sides.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into three segments: two of length 's' (the hexagon's sides) and a middle segment.

Wait, no, because the hexagon is equilateral, so each side is the same length.

Wait, maybe the hexagon is such that each side is a portion of the triangle's sides, and the extensions beyond the hexagon's sides form the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles, with the hexagon being the inner part.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

Wait, but the hexagon is a hexagon, not a triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is divided into the hexagon and three smaller triangles at each corner.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, if I have the large triangle, and from each corner, I cut off a smaller triangle, and what's left is a hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, perhaps the cuts are made in such a way that each side of the hexagon is equal.

But then, the three smaller triangles would each have sides of length 't', say, and the remaining hexagon would have sides 's'.

Wait, but how would that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is such that each side is parallel to a side of the triangle, and the hexagon is similar to the triangle in some way.

Wait, but the hexagon isn't a triangle, so that might not work.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon has sides that are midlines of the triangle, but that would make it smaller, but in our case, the triangle is formed by extending the hexagon's sides, so the hexagon is inside the triangle.

Wait, another approach: use the concept of similar triangles and ratios.

If the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to these sides, then the hexagon's sides would be a certain ratio smaller.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the triangle can be divided into smaller sections, each corresponding to the hexagon's sides.

Wait, maybe using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) to relate the lengths.

Wait, let me think: if I have a large triangle, and I draw a line parallel to one side, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, if I draw a line DE parallel to AB in triangle ABC, then DE divides sides AC and BC proportionally.

But in our case, the hexagon is more complex, with multiple sides.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as the intersection of three such parallel lines, each parallel to a side of the triangle.

Wait, so if I draw a line parallel to AB, another parallel to BC, and another parallel to AC, their intersection forms a smaller triangle inside, but since we need a hexagon, perhaps it's a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair cutting off a side of the triangle.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to model the hexagon as follows: the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.

But since it's convex and opposite sides are parallel, sides AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

So, if I consider the direction vectors of these sides, they must be the same for opposite sides.

Since the hexagon is convex, the order of the sides is such that each consecutive side turns in the same direction.

Wait, maybe using vectors could help.

Let me assign vectors to each side. Let AB be vector **a**, BC be vector **b**, CD be vector **c**, DE be vector **d**, EF be vector **e**, and FA be vector **f**.

Since the hexagon is closed, the sum of vectors is zero:

**a** + **b** + **c** + **d** + **e** + **f** = 0.

Also, since opposite sides are parallel, **a** is parallel to **d**, **b** is parallel to **e**, and **c** is parallel to **f**.

Let me denote **a** = k**d**, **b** = m**e**, and **c** = n**f**, where k, m, n are scalars.

But since all sides are equal in length, the magnitudes |**a**| = |**b**| = |**c**| = |**d**| = |**e**| = |**f**| = s.

But since opposite vectors are scalar multiples, and the hexagon is convex, the scalars k, m, n must be positive, but less than 1? Or maybe negative, because they could be in opposite directions.

Wait, if **a** is parallel to **d**, then **d** is a scalar multiple of **a**, but since the hexagon is convex, the direction might be opposite. So perhaps **d** = -k**a**, where k is positive.

Similarly, **e** = -m**b**, and **f** = -n**c**.

So, substituting into the closure equation:

**a** + **b** + **c** + **d** + **e** + **f** = 0

=> **a** + **b** + **c** - k**a** - m**b** - n**c** = 0

Grouping like terms:

(1 - k)**a** + (1 - m)**b** + (1 - n)**c** = 0

Since **a**, **b**, **c** are vectors, and the hexagon is non-degenerate, the coefficients must satisfy:

1 - k = 0, 1 - m = 0, 1 - n = 0.

Wait, that would imply k = m = n = 1, which would mean **d** = -**a**, **e** = -**b**, **f** = -**c**.

But then, the hexagon would be such that each pair of opposite sides are in exactly opposite directions and equal in length, which would make it a centrally symmetric hexagon, meaning it's a parallelogram if it's convex. But a hexagon with central symmetry is a more complex figure.

Wait, but if 1 - k = 0, then k=1, so **d** = -**a**, meaning DE is equal and opposite to AB.

Similarly, **e** = -**b**, so EF is equal and opposite to BC.

But in that case, the hexagon would be a centrally symmetric hexagon, which is not necessarily a parallelogram but a more complex figure.

Wait, but for a convex hexagon with opposite sides equal and parallel, it's called a parallelogon. In 2D, the only convex parallelogons are parallelograms, but in 3D, they can be more complex. So maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps k, m, n are not 1.

Wait, but from the equation above, (1 - k)**a** + (1 - m)**b** + (1 - n)**c** = 0.

Since **a**, **b**, **c** are vectors, they are linearly independent unless they are colinear, which they are not because the hexagon is convex and non-degenerate.

Wait, but in a triangle, the vectors would be related, but in a hexagon, maybe not.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, going back to the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, the triangle has sides formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

So, each of these lines (AB extended, CD extended, EF extended) form the sides of the triangle.

Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is equilateral with side length 's', and the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300.

So, perhaps the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon but scaled by some factor.

Wait, if I denote the triangle's sides as T_ab, T_cd, T_ef corresponding to the extensions of AB, CD, EF, then T_ab = 200, T_cd = 240, T_ef = 300.

But how are these related to 's'?

Wait, maybe the triangle's sides are each equal to the hexagon's sides plus some multiple of the distances between the sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle's sides are equal to the sum of two sides of the hexagon and the distance between their extensions.

Wait, maybe using similar triangles, if the triangle is formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, the ratio between the triangle's sides and the hexagon's sides is the same.

So, if the triangle is similar to the hexagon's "shadow," but that's vague.

Wait, perhaps using coordinate geometry again.

Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon.

But given that the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, let me model it as triangle ABC with coordinates A(0,0), B(200,0), C(181, 239.247) as I found earlier.

Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with sides AB, CD, EF extended to form the triangle ABC.

Wait, but AB is a side of the triangle and the hexagon.

So, in the hexagon, AB is a side, but in the triangle, AB is a side as well. So, the hexagon must share side AB with the triangle.

Wait, but the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF, so perhaps AB is part of the triangle, and the hexagon is attached to the triangle along AB.

Wait, that might make sense.

So, if AB is a side of both the triangle and the hexagon, then the hexagon is attached to the triangle along AB.

Similarly, CD and EF are sides of the hexagon, which when extended, form the other sides of the triangle.

Wait, so the triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, CA. But in our problem, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF.

So, perhaps the triangle has sides that are extensions of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

Thus, the triangle is larger than the hexagon, with AB, CD, EF as sides, each extended beyond the hexagon to form the triangle.

So, in this case, the triangle ABC would have sides formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon's vertices.

Wait, perhaps the triangle ABC is such that AB is a side, and the extensions of CD and EF meet at points C and A, forming the triangle.

Wait, I'm getting tangled up here.

Alternatively, let me think of the hexagon as part of the triangle, with three of its sides lying on the triangle's sides, and the other three sides being extensions that meet to form the triangle.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is such that each of its sides lies on a line that is a side of the triangle, but offset inward.

Wait, but the problem states that the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF, which are sides of the hexagon.

So, the triangle's sides are formed by extending AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

So, if I imagine the hexagon inside the triangle, with AB, CD, EF as three of its sides, which when extended, form the triangle's sides.

Wait, but in that case, the triangle would have sides that are extensions of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

So, perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon in some way.

Wait, perhaps the triangle's sides can be expressed as a sum of the hexagon's sides and some other segments.

Wait, but each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of a side of the hexagon.

So, if I denote the triangle's side opposite to A as being formed by extending AB beyond A and beyond B, but since AB is a side of the hexagon, which is convex, the extension beyond A would form part of the triangle's side.

Wait, but since AB is a side of the triangle, perhaps the triangle's side is just AB itself.

Wait, that can't be, because the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, which are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm misidentifying which sides correspond. Maybe AB, CD, EF are not the sides of the triangle, but their extensions form the triangle's sides.

So, for example, if AB is a side of the hexagon, and when extended beyond A, it forms a part of the triangle's side. Similarly, CD extended beyond C forms another part, and EF extended beyond E forms the third.

Wait, but then the triangle would have three sides, each formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF beyond the hexagon.

So, the triangle's sides are the extensions of AB, CD, EF, meaning that each side of the triangle is a line that includes AB, CD, or EF extended beyond the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, with each side of the hexagon lying on a line that also contains a side of the triangle.

So, AB is part of the triangle's side, and when extended, forms the triangle's side. Similarly, CD and EF are extended to form the other sides.

Wait, but then the triangle would have sides that are the same as AB, CD, EF extended, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300.

So, if AB is a side of the triangle and the hexagon, with length 's', then 's' must be less than 200, 240, 300.

Wait, but the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300, which are longer than the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is formed by two extensions of the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is the combination of two sides of the hexagon. For example, side AB of the hexagon is part of the triangle's side, but extended beyond B to point D, making the triangle's side AB + BD = 200.

Wait, but this is getting too vague.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of ratios.

Suppose that the hexagon's sides are each a certain ratio of the triangle's sides.

Let me denote the ratio as 'r', so that s = r * t, where t is the triangle's side.

But the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300.

Wait, but the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are equal, so all ratios would have to be consistent across the triangle's sides.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles, each corresponding to the hexagon's sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon's sides are each a portion of the triangle's sides, and the remaining parts form a smaller similar triangle.

Wait, that might be a better approach.

Suppose that the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from the corners of the original triangle, each with side lengths proportional to the original.

In this case, the original triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off smaller triangles from each corner, leaving a central hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides must be equal, and the cuts must be such that the remaining lengths on each side of the triangle are equal.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, imagine each side of the triangle is divided into three segments: two segments of length 's' (the hexagon's sides) and one segment in the middle.

Wait, but the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300, so if each side is divided into two segments of length 's' and one remaining segment, that might not be consistent.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into a segment of length 'a' and the remaining part. The hexagon's sides would then be these 'a's, with the remaining parts forming a smaller triangle.

Wait, let me formalize this.

Let the original triangle have sides of lengths 200, 240, 300.

We cut off a small triangle from each corner, each cut being parallel to the opposite side.

Each cut removes a small triangle, and the remaining figure is the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of its sides must be equal in length. Therefore, the lengths cut off from each side of the triangle must be equal.

So, if we denote the length cut off from each side as 'x', then the remaining segment on each side of the triangle is (original length - x).

But wait, the hexagon has six sides, so each side of the triangle is divided into two segments: one of length 'x' (which becomes a side of the hexagon) and the remaining (original - x). But since the hexagon is formed by three such cuts, each from a corner, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into three segments.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is divided into three parts, two of which are sides of the hexagon, and one is a remaining segment.

Wait, no, that might not add up.

Alternatively, each side of the triangle is divided into one segment of length 'x' (which is a side of the hexagon) and the remaining segment is (original length - x). But since we have three sides, each divided once, leading to three sides of the hexagon. But the hexagon has six sides, so perhaps each original side is divided into two segments, giving rise to two sides of the hexagon per original side.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So, if each side of the triangle is divided into two segments, each of length 's', then the original side length would be 2s plus something? Wait, no, because each side of the triangle is divided into two segments by the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into a segment of length 's' and the remaining length.

So, for example, the side of length 200 is divided into 's' and (200 - s), the side of length 240 into 's' and (240 - s), and the side of length 300 into 's' and (300 - s).

But then, the hexagon would have sides of length 's' and the remaining segments, but since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides must be 's'.

Wait, that suggests that the remaining segments should also be length 's', but that would only be possible if each original side is 2s, which isn't the case because the original sides are different.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon's triangle.

Wait, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the original triangle, scaled by some factor.

Wait, but the problem states that the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, which is the outer triangle. So, perhaps the hexagon is inside this triangle, and the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of this triangle.

Thus, the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, and the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the scaling factor would be consistent across all sides.

Wait, but the triangle is scalene, so scaling would affect each side differently, but the hexagon has all sides equal.

Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is divided into smaller triangles, each similar to the original, and the hexagon is formed by connecting points along the sides.

Wait, but since the hexagon is equilateral, each segment between these points must be equal.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles, each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle and scaled by a factor 'k'.

So, if the original triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, the hexagon's sides would be k*200, k*240, k*300. But since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides must be equal, which would only be possible if k*200 = k*240 = k*300, which implies k=0, which doesn't make sense.

Therefore, this approach might not work.

Wait, maybe the sides of the hexagon are not directly proportional but instead form a system where each side of the hexagon is a portion of the triangle's sides.

Wait, perhaps the triangle's sides are each divided into three equal parts, with two parts being sides of the hexagon.

Wait, but the triangle's sides are of different lengths, so each would be divided into different numbers of parts.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is divided into a grid of smaller triangles, each of side length 's', forming the hexagon as a central figure.

Wait, but without more information, it's hard to visualize.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles and the ratio of areas.

If the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off smaller triangles from each corner, each similar to the original.

Let me denote the ratio of similarity as 'r', so the sides of the small triangles are r*200, r*240, r*300.

The remaining part of each original side would then be (1 - r)*200, (1 - r)*240, (1 - r)*300.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths removed from each side must be equal to the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, but the hexagon's sides are formed by the cuts, which are the sides of the small triangles.

Wait, each small triangle has sides proportional to the original, so the sides of the small triangles are r*200, r*240, r*300.

But since the hexagon is formed by three such triangles, each of their hypotenuses (if right-angled) or sides (if not) would form the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon's sides are the difference between the original sides and twice the small triangles' sides.

Wait, let me think.

Each side of the original triangle is equal to the side of the hexagon plus twice the side of the small triangle.

But since the triangle is scalene, each side would have a different relation.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe each side of the original triangle is divided into three segments: two segments of length 's' (the hexagon's sides) and one segment of length 't', which is the side of the small triangle.

But then, 200 = s + s + t => t = 200 - 2s,

240 = s + s + t => t = 240 - 2s,

300 = s + s + t => t = 300 - 2s.

But this would imply 200 - 2s = 240 - 2s = 300 - 2s, which is impossible unless s is such that 200 = 240 = 300, which they are not.

So that approach doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into two segments: one of length 's' (the hexagon's side) and the other being part of the small triangle.

But then, for each side, the remaining segment would be (200 - s), (240 - s), (300 - s). These remaining segments would form the sides of the inner triangle.

But since the inner triangle is similar to the original, the ratios of the sides should be consistent.

So, let me denote the inner triangle as having sides (200 - s), (240 - s), (300 - s).

But for similarity, the ratios between the sides must be the same as the original triangle.

Original triangle sides: 200, 240, 300.

Inner triangle sides: (200 - s), (240 - s), (300 - s).

So, the ratios should satisfy:

(200 - s)/200 = (240 - s)/240 = (300 - s)/300.

Let me compute:

Let (200 - s)/200 = (240 - s)/240.

Cross-multiplying:

(200 - s)*240 = (240 - s)*200

Expanding:

200*240 - 240s = 240*200 - 200s

Simplify:

48,000 - 240s = 48,000 - 200s

Subtract 48,000 from both sides:

-240s = -200s

=> -240s + 200s = 0

=> -40s = 0

=> s = 0

Which is impossible because s is the side length of the hexagon and must be positive.

Therefore, this approach doesn't work either.

Hmm, maybe the triangle is divided into three smaller triangles and the hexagon, but the inner triangle isn't similar to the original.

Wait, perhaps the inner figure is a hexagon, so the inner triangle isn't necessarily similar.

Wait, but without similarity, it's hard to relate the lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of intercepts.

If I consider each side of the original triangle, and the hexagon cuts off a segment of length 's' from each side, then the remaining part is (original - s).

But since the hexagon has six sides, each original side is cut twice, leading to two segments of length 's' and one remaining segment.

Wait, that might make sense. So, each side of the original triangle is divided into two segments of length 's' and one remaining segment.

So, for side 200: 200 = s + s + t => t = 200 - 2s

Similarly, for side 240: 240 = s + s + u => u = 240 - 2s

And for side 300: 300 = s + s + v => v = 300 - 2s

Now, the inner figure is a triangle with sides t, u, v.

But for the hexagon to be equilateral and convex, the inner triangle must be such that the hexagon can be formed.

But I don't know if the inner triangle is related to the original triangle in any specific way.

Wait, but perhaps the inner triangle is similar to the original triangle.

So, the ratios of the sides should be the same.

Thus,

t / 200 = u / 240 = v / 300

Substituting t = 200 - 2s, u = 240 - 2s, v = 300 - 2s.

So,

(200 - 2s)/200 = (240 - 2s)/240 = (300 - 2s)/300

Let me compute the first two ratios:

(200 - 2s)/200 = 1 - (2s)/200 = 1 - s/100

(240 - 2s)/240 = 1 - (2s)/240 = 1 - s/120

Setting them equal:

1 - s/100 = 1 - s/120

Subtract 1 from both sides:

-s/100 = -s/120

Multiply both sides by -1:

s/100 = s/120

Multiply both sides by 100*120 to eliminate denominators:

120s = 100s

=> 20s = 0

=> s=0

Again, impossible. So, this approach also fails.

Hmm, maybe the inner triangle isn't similar. Then, how else can I relate the lengths?

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a combination of three parallelograms attached to the original triangle.

Wait, if each side of the triangle is extended into a parallelogram, the hexagon would be formed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the area approach.

The area of the original triangle is approximately 23,925 as calculated earlier.

The area of the hexagon would then be the area of the triangle minus the areas of the three smaller triangles cut off.

If we denote the areas of the three small triangles as A1, A2, A3, then:

Area of hexagon = Area of triangle - (A1 + A2 + A3)

But since the hexagon is equilateral, perhaps the areas A1, A2, A3 are equal, but the original triangle is scalene, so this might not hold.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the Routh's theorem.

Wait, Routh's theorem relates the ratio of areas when each side of a triangle is divided proportionally.

But in this case, the hexagon is formed by points along the sides, and Routh's theorem might be applicable.

Routh's theorem states that if on each side of triangle ABC, points are chosen such that the ratios of the segments are r, s, t respectively, then the ratio of the area of the inner figure to the original triangle is given by a formula involving r, s, t.

But in our case, the hexagon is equilateral, so each ratio might be the same.

Wait, let me recall Routh's theorem.

Routh's theorem formula is:

If on each side of triangle ABC, points are taken which divide the sides in the ratios λ, μ, ν, then the ratio of the area of the inner triangle to the original triangle is:

(λμν - 1)^2 / ( (λμ + λ + 1)(μν + μ + 1)(νλ + ν + 1) )

But in our case, the inner figure is a hexagon, not a triangle, so Routh's theorem might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles on each side.

Wait, another idea: since the hexagon is equilateral and all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of a smaller hexagon within the triangle.

But without more specific information, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, perhaps using the intercept theorem on each side.

Wait, considering that each side of the triangle is divided into segments by the hexagon's sides.

Let me denote the division ratios.

On side AB of the triangle (length 200), the hexagon cuts off a segment of length 's' from A, and another 's' from B, leaving a middle segment of length 200 - 2s.

Similarly, on side BC (length 240), the hexagon cuts off 's' from B and 's' from C, leaving 240 - 2s.

On side CA (length 300), the hexagon cuts off 's' from C and 's' from A, leaving 300 - 2s.

Now, the remaining figure is a hexagon with sides 's', but it's also bounded by the middle segments (200-2s), (240-2s), (300-2s).

But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the middle segments must form another triangle inside, but the hexagon is between the original triangle and this inner triangle.

But how are the lengths of the middle segments related?

Wait, perhaps the inner triangle's sides are proportional to the original triangle's sides.

But without knowing the exact relation, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps using the law of cosines on the original triangle to find the angles, then relating them to the hexagon.

But that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300, so let me compute the angles using the law of cosines.

Compute angle at A: between sides AB=200 and AC=300, opposite side BC=240.

Using the law of cosines:

cos(angle A) = (AB² + AC² - BC²)/(2*AB*AC)

= (200² + 300² - 240²)/(2*200*300)

Compute numerator:

200² = 40,000

300² = 90,000

240² = 57,600

So,

40,000 + 90,000 - 57,600 = 72,400

Denominator: 2*200*300 = 120,000

So,

cos(angle A) = 72,400 / 120,000 ≈ 0.603333...

So angle A ≈ arccos(0.603333) ≈ 53.13 degrees.

Wait, that's familiar, as it's close to 45 degrees but a bit more.

Similarly, compute angle B.

Using the law of cosines on angle B:

cos(angle B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²)/(2*AB*BC)

= (200² + 240² - 300²)/(2*200*240)

Compute numerator:

40,000 + 57,600 - 90,000 = 7,600

Denominator: 2*200*240 = 96,000

So,

cos(angle B) = 7,600 / 96,000 ≈ 0.079166...

So angle B ≈ arccos(0.079166) ≈ 85.59 degrees.

Angle C can be found since the sum of angles is 180.

So angle C ≈ 180 - 53.13 - 85.59 ≈ 41.28 degrees.

So angles are approximately 53.13°, 85.59°, 41.28°.

Now, if the hexagon is inside the triangle, each of its sides is parallel to a side of the triangle, and the hexagon's sides are length 's'.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is such that each side is a translation inward by a distance 'd' from each side of the triangle.

But the problem is that the triangle is scalene, so the distances would vary.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is formed by moving each side inward by a certain ratio, maintaining parallelism.

In that case, the side length 's' of the hexagon would be proportional to the original triangle's sides.

Wait, in a regular hexagon inscribed in a triangle, the side length can be found using the formula s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles for each side.

Wait, if each side of the triangle is reduced by a factor 'k', then the inner triangle would have sides 200k, 240k, 300k, and the hexagon would be the area between the original triangle and the inner triangle.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides must be equal, which would require that the reduction factor 'k' is such that the segments cut off from each side of the triangle are equal.

Wait, but the triangle's sides are different, so cutting off equal lengths 's' from each side would not result in similar triangles.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: the triangle is formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF, which are sides of the hexagon.

So, the triangle's sides are formed by extending AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

So, each side of the triangle is an extension of a side of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions beyond each side would form the triangle.

So, for example, extending AB beyond A and beyond B, CD beyond C and D, EF beyond E and F.

But since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, their extensions beyond the hexagon would meet at points forming the triangle.

Wait, so the triangle is formed by these three extensions.

Therefore, each side of the triangle is a line that includes AB, CD, or EF extended beyond the hexagon.

So, the triangle's sides are colinear with AB, CD, EF, but extended.

So, the length of each side of the triangle is equal to the length of the extension beyond the hexagon plus the length of the hexagon's side.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, for example, the triangle's side corresponding to AB would be AB extended beyond A and beyond B, with the total length being the sum of AB and the extensions beyond A and B.

But since AB is a side of the hexagon, which is part of the triangle's side, the total length of the triangle's side would be AB + extension beyond A + extension beyond B.

Wait, but in reality, each side of the triangle is formed by a single extension of AB, CD, or EF beyond the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the triangle's side is the extension of AB beyond A and beyond B, which are two separate extensions.

Wait, maybe each side of the triangle is formed by two extensions from two different sides of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps the triangle's side is formed by the extension of AB beyond A and the extension of CD beyond D, meeting at a point.

Similarly, the other sides are formed by other extensions.

So, each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon.

Given that, the triangle's sides are formed by the intersection of AB extended with CD extended, CD extended with EF extended, and EF extended with AB extended.

Wait, but AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, so their extensions would meet at points outside the hexagon, forming the triangle.

Thus, the triangle's sides are the distances between these intersection points.

So, the triangle's sides are formed by the lines AB extended, CD extended, EF extended, meeting at three points.

Therefore, the triangle is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, with AB, CD, EF being sides of the hexagon, and their extensions forming the triangle's sides.

Now, to find the side length 's' of the hexagon, we need to relate it to the triangle's sides 200, 240, 300.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of AB, CD, EF will form a triangle similar to the original triangle but scaled by a factor.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon's triangle, scaled by a factor.

Wait, but the hexagon is inside the triangle, so the scaling factor would be less than 1.

Wait, let me denote the scaling factor as 'k', so that the triangle's sides are k times the hexagon's triangle sides.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry again, modeling the hexagon within the triangle.

Let me try again.

Let me place the triangle ABC with A at (0,0), B at (200, 0), and C at (181, 239.247) as before.

The hexagon is inside this triangle, with sides AB, CD, EF.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF.

So, the triangle is outside the hexagon.

Therefore, in this coordinate system, the hexagon is somewhere inside the triangle, and its sides AB, CD, EF are extended to meet at the triangle's vertices.

Wait, so the triangle has vertices at the intersections of these extensions.

So, the triangle's vertices are formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

Therefore, if I can find the coordinates where AB extended meets CD extended, CD extended meets EF extended, and EF extended meets AB extended, those would be the triangle's vertices.

But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, perhaps these extensions form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300.

This seems like a promising approach.

So, let me model the hexagon as ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA as sides.

Each pair of opposite sides are parallel: AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

So, in coordinate terms, vectors AB and DE are equal, vectors BC and EF are equal, vectors CD and FA are equal.

Given that, and the hexagon is equilateral, all sides have length 's'.

Now, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

So, line AB is extended beyond A and B, line CD is extended beyond C and D, line EF is extended beyond E and F.

These three lines form the sides of the triangle.

Let me denote the triangle as T with vertices P, Q, R.

Point P is the intersection of AB extended and CD extended.

Point Q is the intersection of CD extended and EF extended.

Point R is the intersection of EF extended and AB extended.

So, triangle PQR has sides PQ, QR, RP with lengths 200, 240, 300.

Now, the hexagon is inside triangle PQR, with sides AB, CD, EF lying on lines PQ, QR, RP respectively.

Wait, no, because AB is extended to form PQ, CD is extended to form QR, EF is extended to form RP.

So, AB is part of PQ, CD is part of QR, EF is part of RP.

But the hexagon is inside the triangle, so the extensions beyond the hexagon form the triangle's sides.

Therefore, the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the triangle's sides PQ, QR, RP respectively.

Thus, the lengths of PQ, QR, RP are equal to AB + some extension, which would be the same as the triangle's sides.

But since AB is a side of the hexagon, which is part of PQ, the length of PQ is AB + extension beyond B (to Q) and extension beyond A (to P).

But since PQ is a side of the triangle with length 200, and AB is a side of the hexagon with length 's', the remaining parts beyond AB are (200 - s) on each end.

Wait, but no, because AB is a single segment on PQ, not split into two parts.

Wait, perhaps AB is a part of PQ such that PQ = AB + BP + AQ, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into segments by the hexagon's sides.

Wait, perhaps PQ is divided into three segments by the hexagon: PA, AB, BQ.

But in that case, PQ = PA + AB + BQ.

But since AB is a side of the hexagon, which is part of PQ, then PA and BQ would be the extensions beyond A and B.

But the triangle's side PQ is 200, so 200 = PA + AB + BQ.

But without knowing PA and BQ, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon's side AB is such that when extended, it forms the triangle's side PQ.

But since AB is inside the triangle, the extensions beyond A and B form the triangle's side PQ.

Thus, PQ is formed by extending AB beyond A to P and beyond B to Q.

But PQ is a side of the triangle with length 200, but AB is a side of the hexagon with length 's'.

Thus, the length from P to Q would be the sum of PA + AB + BQ.

But unless PA and BQ are known, we can't find 's'.

Wait, but perhaps the hexagon is such that the extensions beyond each side are equal on both ends.

So, for example, the extension beyond A on AB is equal to the extension beyond B on AB.

Similarly for the other sides.

Thus, for side AB of the hexagon, the extensions beyond A and B would each be of length 'x', making PQ = AB + 2x = s + 2x = 200.

Similarly, for side CD, the extensions beyond C and D would be 'y', making QR = CD + 2y = s + 2y = 240.

And for side EF, the extensions beyond E and F would be 'z', making RP = EF + 2z = s + 2z = 300.

So, we have:

s + 2x = 200,

s + 2y = 240,

s + 2z = 300.

So, x = (200 - s)/2,

y = (240 - s)/2,

z = (300 - s)/2.

Now, since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, with opposite sides parallel, the extensions beyond each side must form similar triangles.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the extensions beyond each side are related through the triangle's angles.

Wait, since the triangle is formed by the extensions, the angles at points P, Q, R must correspond to the angles of the original triangle.

Wait, but without knowing the angles, it's hard to relate 'x', 'y', 'z'.

Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles for each extension.

For example, the extension beyond AB forms two small triangles at the ends, similar to the original triangle.

But the original triangle is scalene, so each extension would form a similar triangle.

Wait, perhaps the triangles formed by the extensions are similar to the original triangle.

So, the triangle formed by extending AB beyond A and beyond B (triangle PAB) is similar to the original triangle PQR.

Wait, no, because triangle PAB is part of the original triangle.

Wait, perhaps the small triangles formed by the extensions are similar to the original triangle.

So, triangle PAB ~ triangle PQR,

triangle QCD ~ triangle PQR,

triangle REF ~ triangle PQR.

If that's the case, the ratios would be consistent.

So, for triangle PAB similar to PQR,

PA / PQ = AB / QR = PB / RP.

Wait, let's denote the similarity ratios.

Let the ratio for triangle PAB be k1,

for triangle QCD be k2,

for triangle REF be k3.

Then,

PA = k1 * PQ,

AB = k1 * QR,

PB = k1 * RP.

Similarly,

QC = k2 * QR,

CD = k2 * RP,

QD = k2 * PQ.

And,

RE = k3 * RP,

EF = k3 * PQ,

RF = k3 * QR.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps using mass point geometry.

Wait, maybe I should think of the hexagon as a combination of three smaller parallelograms attached to the triangle.

Wait, another approach: using the concept of similar triangles on each side.

Each side of the triangle is divided into three segments: the hexagon's side and two extensions.

But since the triangle is scalene, the ratios of division are different for each side.

Wait, let me model the triangle as having sides a=200, b=240, c=300.

The hexagon is inside it, with sides 's' on each of a, b, c.

Wait, but the hexagon has six sides, so each side of the triangle is divided into two segments: one of length 's' (the hexagon's side) and another of length (side - s).

But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the remaining segments must form another triangle inside.

Wait, but the inner triangle would have sides (200 - s), (240 - s), (300 - s), but as we saw earlier, this leads to s=0, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps this is a dead end.

Wait, another idea: using the formula for the side length of a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel inscribed in a triangle.

I recall that in such cases, the side length can be found using the formula:

s = (a*b*c) / (a*b + b*c + c*a)

Wait, let me test this.

Given a=200, b=240, c=300,

s = (200*240*300) / (200*240 + 240*300 + 300*200)

Compute numerator: 200*240=48,000; 48,000*300=14,400,000.

Denominator: 200*240=48,000; 240*300=72,000; 300*200=60,000.

Sum: 48,000 + 72,000 + 60,000 = 180,000.

So, s = 14,400,000 / 180,000 = 80.

So, s=80.

Wait, that seems promising.

But I need to verify if this formula is correct.

Wait, I think this formula is for a regular hexagon inscribed in a triangle, but in our case, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular.

But maybe the formula still holds.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a known formula that the side length of such a hexagon is given by (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a).

So, plugging in a=200, b=240, c=300,

s = (200*240*300)/(200*240 + 240*300 + 300*200)

As computed earlier, that gives s=80.

Therefore, the side length is 80.

But let me see if this makes sense.

If the triangle sides are 200,240,300, and the hexagon's sides are 80, then the extensions beyond each side would be (200 - 80)/2 = 60 on each end, (240 - 80)/2=80, and (300 - 80)/2=110.

But how does that relate to the triangle's angles?

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the side length of a convex equilateral hexagon inscribed in a triangle with sides a,b,c:

s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a)

Which gives s=80.

Therefore, the answer is 80.


The side length of the hexagon is \boxed{80}.
