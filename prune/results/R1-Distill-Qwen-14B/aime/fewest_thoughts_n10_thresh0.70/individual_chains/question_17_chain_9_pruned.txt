Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I have to find p + q. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangular boxes and spheres. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume is xyz. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius of the sphere would be half of that space diagonal.

The space diagonal of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints of the surface area and volume. That makes sense.

So, I have two constraints:
1. The surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. Simplifying, that's xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. The volume: xyz = 23.

I need to minimize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

This seems like a problem where I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a way to do it using AM-GM inequalities or other algebraic methods. Let me think.

I remember that for positive real numbers, the relationship between the arithmetic mean and the quadratic mean can be useful. Also, perhaps using the method of substitution since we have two constraints and three variables.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 27, and V = xyz = 23.

I also remember that for three variables, x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, this simplifies to x² + y² + z² = S² - 54. Therefore, I need to minimize S² - 54. Which is the same as minimizing S².

So, if I can find the minimal possible value of S, then I can find the minimal value of x² + y² + z².

Alternatively, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others and substitute into the equations.

Let me try that. Let me solve for z in terms of x and y from the volume equation. So, z = 23/(xy).

Then, plug this into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Simplify each term:

xy + (23/y) + (23/x) = 27.

So, the equation becomes:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

This is a bit complicated, but maybe I can set x = y to reduce the number of variables. If x = y, then it's symmetric, which might give me the minimal case. Let's test that assumption.

If x = y, let's denote x = y = a. Then, z = 23/(a²).

Substituting into the surface area equation:

a² + 2*(a*z) = 27.

But z = 23/(a²), so 2*a*z = 2a*(23/(a²)) = 46/a.

So, the equation becomes:

a² + 46/a = 27.

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

a³ + 46 = 27a.

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - 27a + 46 = 0.

Hmm, let's solve this cubic equation. Maybe it factors nicely. Let me try possible integer roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 46: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a = 1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0.

a = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Oh, a = 2 is a root.

So, factor the cubic as (a - 2)(a² + 2a - 23) = 0.

Now, solve a² + 2a - 23 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

But since a is a length, it must be positive. So, a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

Wait, but if a = 2 is a root, then when x = y = 2, what is z?

z = 23/(2*2) = 23/4 = 5.75.

Then, let's check if this is a valid solution.

Compute surface area: 2*(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2*(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2*(27) = 54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75 = 23. Correct.

So, that works. So, x = y = 2, z = 23/4.

But wait, is this the minimal case? Because when I set x = y, I might not necessarily get the minimal S. Maybe the minimal occurs when all variables are different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible. But in this case, with the given surface area and volume, maybe the minimal occurs when two sides are equal, but not necessarily all three.

Wait, perhaps I should use Lagrange multipliers here. Let's set up the function to minimize.

We need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy +
