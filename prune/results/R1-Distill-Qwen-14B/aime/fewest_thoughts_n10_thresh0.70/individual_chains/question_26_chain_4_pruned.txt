Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. Let me just start by writing down the given information to make sure I have everything clear.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. The sides are given as AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. I need to find AP, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. I think it's a scalene triangle because all sides are different. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something? Maybe D is the ex-pole of BC? Not sure. Anyway, AD intersects ω again at P, so AP is a chord passing through D.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. That's a useful property.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-pole of BC. Wait, no, ex-pole is related to the Simson line or something else. Maybe it's the ex-center? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently.

Perhaps D is the symmedian point or something. Wait, no. The point where the tangents meet is called the ex-pole, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes D is called the 'exterior homothety center' or something like that. Maybe I should move on and see if I can find properties of triangle ABC first.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if this is a right-angled triangle. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. So, not a right-angled triangle. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC, because the circle ω is the circumcircle. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area.

So, let's compute Δ first using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 -5)*(12 -9)*(12 -10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] =
