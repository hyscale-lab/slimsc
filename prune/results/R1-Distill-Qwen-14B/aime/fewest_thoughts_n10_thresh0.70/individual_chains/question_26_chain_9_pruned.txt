Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D, and line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

First, let me visualize the problem. I imagine triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Since the sides are all different, it's a scalene triangle. Point D is where the tangents at B and C meet. Then, line AD is drawn, and it intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. So, AP is part of this line AD, from A to P.

I need to find AP. Hmm. So, maybe I can use some properties of circles, tangents, and power of a point. Let me recall some relevant theorems.

The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where a secant from D intersects the circle. In this case, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC are the two tangents. So, DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω. That could be useful.

Also, since AD intersects the circle ω again at P, the Power of a Point theorem can be applied again. For point D, the power with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. That gives us an equation: DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can find DA and DB, I can solve for DP, and then find AP as AD - DP or something similar.

Wait, but AP is from A to P, so AP = AD - DP, right? Because D is outside the circle, so AD is from A to D, and then DP is from D to P, which is inside the circle. So, AP is the part from A to P, which is AD minus DP.

But to find DA and DB, I might need to compute some lengths. Let me think about how to find DA.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since ABC is inscribed in ω, and we know the lengths of the sides, perhaps we can find some angles or use the Law of Cosines to find angles of triangle ABC. Then, maybe use some trigonometry with the circle.

Let me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC because ω is the circumcircle. To find the circumradius R, I can use the formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)

Where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. Let me note that a = BC = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5.

First, I need the area of triangle ABC. I can compute that using Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Calculating s: (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

So, area = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].

Simplify sqrt[504]. 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, wait, 16*31.5 is not correct. Let me actually factor 504 properly. 504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 is 126, divided by 2 is 63. 63 is 7*9, so 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. Therefore, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5)? Wait, no, that approach is confusing. Let me think:

sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) is perhaps not the right way. Let me factor 504 as 72 * 7, because 72*7=504. Then sqrt(72*7) = sqrt(72)*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So, area = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me verify that again. 72 is 36*2, so sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(72*7) = 6*sqrt(14). So, area = 6*sqrt(14). That seems right.

So, area is 6√14. Now, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*area) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14). Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 5*9=45, 45*10=450.

Denominator: 4*6=24, so 24√14.

So, R = 450 / (24√14) = 75 / (4√14). Can I rationalize the denominator?
