Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let's see if I can break this down step by step.

First, I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite both equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), this can be rewritten as x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, no, that's not the power rule. Wait, actually, the power rule applies when the exponent is outside the log, right? So log_x(y^x) is equal to x * log_x(y). So that gives x * log_x(y) = 10.

But I'm not sure if that helps me right away. Maybe another approach: since log_x(y^x) = 10, then by the definition of logarithm, x^10 = y^x. That seems more straightforward. So equation (1) is x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same logic, since log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, that would mean y^10 = x^{4y}. So equation (2) is y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay, so maybe I can express both equations in terms of exponents and find a relationship between x and y.

Looking at equation (1): x^10 = y^x. Let's take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to bring the exponents down. So ln(x^10) = ln(y^x), which becomes 10 ln x = x ln y. So equation (1a) is 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking ln again, we get ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}), which becomes 10 ln y = 4y ln x. So equation (2a) is 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have:
1a. 10 ln x = x ln y
2a. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, maybe I can express ln y from equation 1a and substitute into equation 2a.

From 1a: ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Substituting into 2a:
10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x
So 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Wait, both sides have ln x. Assuming ln x ≠ 0, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x is positive. So I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y.

Simplify that:
100 / x = 4y => y = (100) / (4x) => y = 25 / x.

So y is 25 over x. That's a helpful relationship.

Now I can substitute y = 25/x into equation 1a or equation 1 or equation 2. Let's choose equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Substituting y:
x^10 = (25/x)^x

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

Let me write (25/x)^x as 25^x / x^x. So equation becomes:
x^10 = 25^x / x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x to get rid of the denominator:
x^10 * x^x = 25^x.

Combine the exponents on the left: x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Hmm, okay, so x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Wait, I can write 25 as 5^2, so 25^x = (5^2)^x = 5^{2x}. So equation is x^{x + 10} = 5^{2x}.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe taking the natural log again would help.

Taking ln on both sides:
ln(x^{x + 10}) = ln(5^{2x})

Which becomes:
(x + 10) ln x = 2x ln 5.

Let me write that as:
(x + 10) ln x = 2x ln 5.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange terms to collect like terms. Let's bring everything to one side.

(x + 10) ln x - 2x ln 5 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe express in terms of ratios.

Alternatively, let's write it as:

(x + 10) ln x = 2x ln 5.

Let me divide both sides by x, assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't because x > 1.

So (1 + 10/x) ln x = 2 ln 5.

Hmm, that might be a more manageable form. So:

(1 + (10/x)) ln x = 2 ln 5.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me set t = x, so I can write this in terms of t.

But maybe instead, let's see if we can find a value for x that satisfies this equation. Since x and y are both greater than 1, and from earlier y = 25/x, so if x is 5, then y would be 5, but let's check.

Wait, let me test x = 5.

If x =5, then y =25/5=5.

So let's check if x=5 and y=5 satisfy the original equations.

Check equation 1: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5, but the equation says it should be 10. So that's not correct. So x=5 is not the solution.

Hmm, okay, perhaps x=25? Let's try x=25.

Then y=25/25=1. But y must be greater than 1, so y=1 isn't allowed. So x can't be 25.

Hmm, maybe x= sqrt(25)=5, but we already saw that. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Let me consider that equation: (x +10) ln x = 2x ln 5.

Let me try to rearrange this:

(x +10) ln x = 2x ln 5
=> x ln x +10 ln x = 2x ln5
Let's bring all terms to one side:

x ln x - 2x ln5 +10 ln x =0

Factor x from the first two terms:

x (ln x - 2 ln5) +10 ln x =0

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe we can factor something else.

Alternatively, let's factor ln x:

ln x (x +10) = 2x ln5

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

ln x = [2x ln5] / (x +10)

So ln x = [2 ln5 * x] / (x +10)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can let u = x +10, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider substituting t = x, and then express as a function, but that might not lead anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution like t = x/5, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to think if x and y are related in a simple way. We have y=25/x, so maybe if x is 25/x, then x^2=25, so x=5. But we saw earlier that when x=5, y=5, but that didn't satisfy the original equation. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps x is 25, but that gives y=1 which is invalid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can take the ratio of the two equations. Let me go back to equations 1a and 2a.

Equation 1a: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Equation 2a: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So from 1a, ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Substituting into 2a: 10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Which simplifies to 100 ln x /x = 4y ln x. Then 100/x =4y, so y=25/x as before.

So that's correct.

Now, going back to equation 1: x^10 = y^x. With y=25/x, so:

x^10 = (25/x)^x

Which is x^10 = 25^x / x^x

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} =25^x.

So x^{x +10}=25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(x+10)/x} =25.

So x^{1 +10/x} =25.

Hmm, so x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Let me write this as:

x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

I can write 25 as 5^2, so x^{1 +10/x}=5^2.

Perhaps now I can take the natural logarithm of both sides again:

ln(x^{1 +10/x}) = ln(5^2).

Which becomes (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier. Hmm, so perhaps I can try to find x such that (1 +10/x) ln x = 2 ln5.

Let me see if I can guess a value for x.

We tried x=5 and it didn't work. Let me try x=25: then 1 +10/25=1 +0.4=1.4. So (1.4) ln25. Let's compute that.

ln25 is about 3.2189. So 1.4 *3.2189 ≈4.506. On the other side, 2 ln5≈2*1.6094≈3.2188. So 4.506 isn't equal to 3.2188, so x=25 doesn't work.

What about x=10? Let's compute (1 +10/10)=2, so 2 * ln10 ≈2*2.3026≈4.6052. 2 ln5≈3.2188. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe x=20? Let's see: 1 +10/20=1.5. 1.5 * ln20≈1.5*2.9957≈4.4936. Still higher than 3.2188.

Wait, perhaps I need a larger x, but that might make the left side even larger, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller x.

Wait, let's try x= sqrt(25) which is 5, but that didn't work earlier.

Wait, maybe x= something else. Let me try x= sqrt(5). x=√5≈2.236.

Compute 1 +10/x ≈1 +10/2.236≈1 +4.472≈5.472.

ln x ≈ ln(2.236)≈0.8047.

So left side: 5.472 * 0.8047≈4.403. Right side is 2 ln5≈3.2188. Still not equal.

Wait, maybe x= 25/ something. Let me think, maybe x=25/2=12.5.

1 +10/12.5=1 +0.8=1.8.

ln(12.5)=2.531.

1.8 *2.531≈4.556. Still higher than 3.2188.

Hmm, this trial and error might not be the best approach. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me denote t = x, so equation is (1 +10/t) ln t = 2 ln5.

Let me try to write this as:

(1 + 10/t) ln t = 2 ln5

Multiply both sides by t:

(t +10) ln t = 2t ln5

Wait, which is where we started from. So perhaps I can write this as:

(t +10)/t = 2 ln5 / ln t

Hmm, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that x is a power of 5. Maybe x=5^k for some k.

Let me try that. Let x=5^k, where k is a positive real number.

Then, y=25/x=25/(5^k)=5^{2}/5^k=5^{2 -k}.

Now, let's substitute x=5^k and y=5^{2 -k} into equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

So (5^k)^10 = (5^{2 -k})^{5^k}

Simplify left side: 5^{10k}.

Right side: 5^{(2 -k) * 5^k}.

So, 5^{10k} =5^{(2 -k)5^k}.

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:

10k = (2 -k)5^k.

Hmm, so 10k = (2 -k)5^k.

This seems like a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution. Maybe I can find k by trial.

Let me try k=1: left=10*1=10. Right=(2-1)5^1=1*5=5. Not equal.

k=2: left=20. Right=(2-2)5^2=0*25=0. Not equal.

k=0. Let's see, but k=0 would give x=1, which is invalid as x>1.

k=0.5: left=10*0.5=5. Right= (2-0.5)*5^{0.5}=1.5 * sqrt(5)≈1.5*2.236≈3.354. Not equal.

k=0.2: left=2. Right=(2-0.2)*5^{0.2}=1.8 * ~1.475≈2.655. Close, but not equal.

Hmm, maybe k=0.3: left=3. Right=(2-0.3)*5^{0.3}=1.7 * ~1.6245≈2.761. Hmm, getting closer.

Wait, but maybe this approach isn't efficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can take logarithms again.

Wait, let's take the equation 10k = (2 -k)5^k.

Let me divide both sides by 5^k:

10k /5^k = 2 -k.

Hmm, so 10k /5^k +k =2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write it as:

k(10/5^k +1) =2.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps try to find k numerically.

Let me try k=1: 10*1=10 vs (2-1)*5^1=5. Not equal.

k=0.5: 5 vs ~3.354. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about when k=0. The left side is 0, and right side is (2 -0)*1=2, so 0=2, nope.

Wait, perhaps plotting the function f(k) =10k - (2 -k)5^k and seeing when it crosses zero.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of possible k values.

Wait, when k=1, f(k)=10 -5=5>0.

When k=2, f(k)=20 -0=20>0.

Wait, no, because when k=2, 2 -k=0, so f(2)=20 -0=20>0.

Wait, but when k approaches infinity, 5^k dominates, so (2 -k)5^k is negative, so 10k - (negative) would be positive. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation as 10k = (2 -k)5^k.

Wait, perhaps taking natural logs on both sides isn't helpful because of the product.

Wait, maybe I can express 5^k as e^{k ln5}, so equation becomes 10k = (2 -k)e^{k ln5}.

Hmm, maybe that's a better way to think about it. Let me denote a = ln5, so equation is 10k = (2 -k)e^{a k}.

Hmm, perhaps trying to find k numerically using methods like Newton-Raphson.

But perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, going back to the original equations:

We have x^10 = y^x and y^10 =x^{4y}.

And we found that y=25/x. Let me substitute y=25/x into both equations.

So equation 1: x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Equation 2: (25/x)^10 =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Wait, equation 2: y=25/x, so y^10 =x^{4y} becomes (25/x)^10 =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relationship from equation 1 and equation 2.

Let me write equation 1 as:

x^{10} = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^{10} =25^x / x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x: x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Similarly, equation 2: (25/x)^10 =x^{(4*25)/x}.

Which is 25^{10}/x^{10} =x^{100/x}.

Multiply both sides by x^{10}:25^{10}=x^{100/x +10}.

Hmm, so from equation 1, we have x^{x +10}=25^x.

From equation 2, 25^{10} =x^{(100/x)+10}.

Hmm, perhaps I can substitute x^{x+10} from equation 1 into equation 2.

Wait, equation 1: x^{x+10}=25^x.

So equation 2:25^{10}=x^{(100/x)+10}=x^{10 + (100/x)}.

But from equation 1, x^{x+10}=25^x.

So 25^{10}=x^{10 +100/x}.

Hmm, but 25^{10}=(5^2)^10=5^{20}.

So 5^{20}=x^{10 +100/x}.

But from equation 1, x^{x+10}=25^x=5^{2x}.

So, perhaps we can express x in terms of 5.

Let me suppose that x is a power of 5, like x=5^k.

Then, from equation 1, x^{x+10}=5^{2x}.

Substituting x=5^k:

(5^k)^{5^k +10}=5^{2*5^k}.

Which is 5^{k*(5^k +10)}=5^{2*5^k}.

Thus, exponents must be equal:

k*(5^k +10)=2*5^k.

Divide both sides by 5^k (since 5^k ≠0):

k*(1 +10/5^k) =2.

Hmm, so k*(1 +10/5^k)=2.

Hmm, this seems similar to an equation we had before. Let me denote m=5^k, so 5^k =m, which implies that k= log5(m). So substituting:

log5(m) * (1 +10/m) =2.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can try some integer values for m.

Let me try m=5: then k=1 (since 5^1=5).

So equation becomes 1*(1 +10/5)=1*(1+2)=3. Which is equal to 3, but we need it to be 2. So m=5 is too small.

What if m=25: then k=2.

So equation:2*(1 +10/25)=2*(1+0.4)=2*1.4=2.8. Closer, but still higher than 2.

m=20: k= log5(20)= ln20/ln5≈2.9957/1.6094≈1.86.

So equation:1.86*(1 +10/20)=1.86*(1+0.5)=1.86*1.5≈2.79, which is higher than 2.

Hmm, trying m=25, we get 2.8, which is higher than 2.

Wait, maybe m= something larger. Let's try m=40:

k= log5(40)= ln40/ln5≈3.6889/1.6094≈2.292.

So equation: 2.292*(1 +10/40)=2.292*(1.25)=2.865. Still higher than 2.

Hmm, perhaps m= something lower. Let's try m=10: k= log5(10)= ln10/ln5≈2.3026/1.6094≈1.43.

Equation:1.43*(1 +10/10)=1.43*(1+1)=2.86. Still higher than 2.

Wait, so when m=5, the value is 3; m=25, it's 2.8; m=10,2.86; m=20,2.79.

Wait, maybe we can find m where this equals 2.

Let me set up an equation: m*(1 +10/m) * (ln5)^{-1} =2, but perhaps it's better to solve numerically.

Wait, let me think: k*(1 +10/(5^k))=2.

Let me define f(k) =k*(1 +10/5^k) -2. We need to find k where f(k)=0.

We can use the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots.

Let me try k=1.5:

f(1.5)=1.5*(1 +10/5^{1.5})=1.5*(1 +10/(sqrt(5^3)) )=1.5*(1 +10/(5*sqrt(5)) )≈1.5*(1 +10/(5*2.236))≈1.5*(1 +10/11.18)≈1.5*(1 +0.894)=1.5*1.894≈2.841. Which is higher than 2.

f(1)=1*(1 +10/5)=1*(1+2)=3>2.

f(2)=2*(1 +10/25)=2*(1.4)=2.8>2.

We saw that at k=1, f(k)=3; k=2, f(k)=2.8.

Wait, perhaps trying k=3:

f(3)=3*(1 +10/125)=3*(1 +0.08)=3*1.08=3.24>2.

Hmm, perhaps I need a smaller k. Wait, let's try k=0.5:

f(0.5)=0.5*(1 +10/sqrt(5))=0.5*(1 +10/2.236)≈0.5*(1 +4.472)=0.5*5.472≈2.736>2.

Hmm, so f(k) is always greater than 2 for the k's I've tried. Wait, that can't be right because when k approaches infinity, 5^k approaches infinity, so 10/5^k approaches 0, so f(k)=k*(1+0) =k, which would go to infinity. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the substitution. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I substituted x=5^k into equation 1, I had:

x^{x+10}=25^x.

Which with x=5^k becomes (5^k)^{5^k +10}=25^{5^k}=5^{2*5^k}.

So, 5^{k*(5^k +10)}=5^{2*5^k}.

So exponents equal: k*(5^k +10)=2*5^k.

Dividing both sides by 5^k: k*(1 +10/5^k)=2.

Which is the same as before. So f(k)=k*(1 +10/5^k) -2=0.

Wait, but when k=1, f(k)=3, as before. When k=0.5, f(k)=0.5*(1 +10/sqrt(5))=0.5*(1 +4.472)=0.5*5.472=2.736. Hmm, that's still higher than 2. But I thought we had a solution earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, when we tried x=5, y=5, but it didn't satisfy equation 1. So perhaps there's no solution where x is a power of 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the two original equations to find a ratio.

Let me take equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

Equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}.

So, from equation 1, y^x =x^10. Taking both sides to the power of 1/y: y = (x^10)^{1/y}=x^{10/y}.

So y= x^{10/y}.

Similarly, from equation 2: y^10 =x^{4y}, so x= y^{10/(4y)}=y^{5/(2y)}.

Hmm, maybe I can substitute y=25/x into this.

So x = (25/x)^{5/(2*(25/x))}.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute the exponent:

5/(2*(25/x))=5/(50/x)=5x/50= x/10.

So x = (25/x)^{x/10}.

Which is x= (25/x)^{x/10}.

Taking natural log: ln x= (x/10) ln(25/x).

Hmm, ln(25/x)=ln25 - lnx, so:

lnx= (x/10)(ln25 - lnx).

Multiply through:

lnx= (x ln25)/10 - (x lnx)/10.

Bring all terms to one side:

lnx + (x lnx)/10 = (x ln25)/10.

Factor lnx:

lnx (1 +x/10) = (x ln25)/10.

Hmm, so lnx = [ (x ln25)/10 ] / (1 +x/10 ).

Simplify denominator: 1 +x/10 = (10 +x)/10.

So lnx = [ (x ln25)/10 ] * [10/(10 +x) ) ].

Simplify: lnx= (x ln25) / (10 +x).

Hmm, so we have lnx= (x ln25)/(x +10).

Hmm, that's an equation in x. Maybe I can try substituting x=25.

Wait, x=25, then lnx=ln25≈3.2189.

Right side: (25 * ln25)/(25 +10)=25*3.2189/35≈(80.4725)/35≈2.299.

Which is less than 3.2189. So, not equal.

What about x=10: lnx=2.3026.

Right side: (10 * ln25)/(10+10)=10*3.2189/20≈32.189/20≈1.6094. Less than 2.3026.

Hmm, maybe x=15.

ln15≈2.7080.

Right side: (15 *3.2189)/(15+10)=48.2835/25≈1.9313<2.7080.

Hmm, perhaps x=20.

ln20≈2.9957.

Right side: (20*3.2189)/(20+10)=64.378/30≈2.1459<2.9957.

Hmm, seems like the right side is always less than ln x as x increases. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps x is less than 25.

Let me try x=5: ln5≈1.6094.

Right side: (5 *3.2189)/(5+10)=16.0945/15≈1.073<1.6094.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can try x= 20, but we saw that's not working.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the function f(x) = ln x - (x ln25)/(x +10) and find where it equals zero.

We can see that for x=25, f(x)=3.2189 -2.299≈0.9199>0.

At x=10, f(x)=2.3026 -1.6094≈0.6932>0.

At x=20, f(x)=2.9957 -2.1459≈0.8498>0.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=5, f(x)=1.6094-1.073≈0.536>0.

Wait, maybe for x approaching infinity, let's see:

f(x)=lnx - (x ln25)/(x +10) ≈ lnx - (ln25)*(x)/(x) )= lnx - ln25.

Which approaches infinity as x approaches infinity, since lnx grows without bound. So f(x) approaches infinity.

Wait, but when x approaches 0 from the right, lnx approaches negative infinity, but x>1, so that's not the case here.

Hmm, so f(x) is positive for x>1, so perhaps there's no solution where f(x)=0. That can't be right because the problem states that such x and y exist.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find another approach. Let's go back to the original equations.

We have x^10 = y^x and y^10 =x^{4y}.

And we found that y=25/x. So let's substitute that into both equations.

So equation 1: x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which gives x^{x+10}=25^x.

Equation 2: (25/x)^10 =x^{4*(25/x)}.

Which is 25^{10}/x^{10} =x^{100/x}.

Multiply both sides by x^{10}:25^{10}=x^{100/x +10}.

But from equation 1, x^{x+10}=25^x. So 25^x =x^{x+10}.

So in equation 2, 25^{10}=(x^{x+10})^{10/x}.

Because 25^x =x^{x+10}, so 25^{10}=(25^x)^{10/x}= (x^{x+10})^{10/x}=x^{(x+10)*(10/x)}=x^{10 +100/x}.

Which matches equation 2:25^{10}=x^{10 +100/x}.

So, it's consistent. So, maybe I can take the 10th root of both sides.

Wait, 25^{10}=x^{10 +100/x}.

Take both sides to the power of 1/10:

25 =x^{(10 +100/x)/10}=x^{1 +10/x}.

Which brings us back to the equation x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which we had before. So, we're back to the same point.

Hmm, perhaps I can take natural logs again:

(1 +10/x) lnx = ln25.

So, (1 +10/x) lnx = ln25.

Which is similar to what we had before.

Let me try to rearrange this equation:

(1 +10/x) lnx = ln25.

So, lnx = (ln25)/(1 +10/x).

Hmm, perhaps I can write x in terms of lnx, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let t=lnx, so x=e^t.

Substituting, equation becomes:

t = (ln25)/(1 +10/e^t).

Hmm, which might not help much, but perhaps I can write it as:

t*(1 +10/e^t)=ln25.

Hmm, this seems like a transcendental equation again. Maybe I can try to solve it numerically.

Let me compute the right side: ln25≈3.2189.

So, t*(1 +10/e^t)=3.2189.

Let me try t=2: e^2≈7.389. 1 +10/7.389≈1 +1.353≈2.353. So 2*2.353≈4.706>3.2189.

t=1: e^1≈2.718. 1 +10/2.718≈1 +3.68≈4.68. 1*4.68≈4.68>3.2189.

t=1.5: e^1.5≈4.4817. 1 +10/4.4817≈1 +2.232≈3.232. So 1.5*3.232≈4.848>3.2189.

t=2.5: e^2.5≈12.1825. 1 +10/12.1825≈1 +0.820≈1.820. 2.5*1.820≈4.55>3.2189.

Hmm, seems like it's higher than needed. Wait, perhaps t=3:

e^3≈20.0855. 1 +10/20.0855≈1 +0.497≈1.497. 3*1.497≈4.491>3.2189.

Hmm, perhaps trying t=0.5:

e^0.5≈1.6487. 1 +10/1.6487≈1 +6.065≈7.065. 0.5*7.065≈3.532>3.2189.

Closer.

t=0.6:

e^0.6≈1.8221. 1 +10/1.8221≈1 +5.487≈6.487. 0.6*6.487≈3.892>3.2189.

t=0.7:

e^0.7≈2.0138. 1 +10/2.0138≈1 +4.964≈5.964. 0.7*5.964≈4.175>3.2189.

Hmm, perhaps t=0.9:

e^0.9≈2.4596. 1 +10/2.4596≈1 +4.066≈5.066. 0.9*5.066≈4.559>3.2189.

Wait, but as t decreases, the value seems to decrease. Wait, at t=0.5, we had 3.532; at t=0.6, 3.892. Wait, that's increasing, which contradicts intuition. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate for t=0.5:

t=0.5: e^0.5≈1.6487.

1 +10/1.6487≈1 +6.065≈7.065.

t=0.5 → 0.5 *7.065≈3.5325.

t=0.6: e^0.6≈1.8221.

1 +10/1.8221≈1 +5.487≈6.487.

0.6 *6.487≈3.892.

t=0.4: e^0.4≈1.4918.

1 +10/1.4918≈1 +6.700≈7.700.

0.4 *7.700≈3.08.

Which is close to 3.2189.

So, t=0.4 gives 3.08, t=0.5 gives 3.5325.

Wait, so between t=0.4 and t=0.5, the function crosses 3.2189.

Let me try t=0.45:

e^0.45≈1.5683.

1 +10/1.5683≈1 +6.383≈7.383.

0.45 *7.383≈3.322.

Closer to 3.2189.

t=0.44:

e^0.44≈1.5527.

1 +10/1.5527≈1 +6.433≈7.433.

0.44 *7.433≈3.270>3.2189.

t=0.43:

e^0.43≈1.5375.

1 +10/1.5375≈1 +6.506≈7.506.

0.43 *7.506≈3.227>3.2189.

t=0.42:

e^0.42≈1.5195.

1 +10/1.5195≈1 +6.580≈7.580.

0.42*7.580≈3.1836.

Which is less than 3.2189.

So between t=0.42 and t=0.43, the function crosses 3.2189.

Using linear approximation:

At t=0.42, f(t)=3.1836.

At t=0.43, f(t)=3.227.

We need f(t)=3.2189.

The difference between 3.227 and 3.1836 is 0.0434 over 0.01 t.

We need 3.2189-3.1836=0.0353.

So fraction=0.0353/0.0434≈0.814.

So t≈0.42 +0.814*(0.01)=0.42 +0.00814≈0.42814.

So t≈0.4281.

Thus, x=e^{0.4281}≈e^{0.428}.

Calculate e^0.428:

We know that e^0.4≈1.4918, e^0.42≈1.522, e^0.43≈1.5375.

Wait, so using a calculator, e^0.428≈1.533.

So x≈1.533.

Then y=25/x≈25/1.533≈16.31.

Wait, let me check if these values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x: (16.31)^1.533.

Hmm, let's compute that.

16.31^1.533 ≈ ?

Wait, 16^1.5=16*sqrt(16)=16*4=64.

16.31^1.533 is a bit higher, maybe around 64*1.02≈65.28.

So log_x(65.28)=10.

Which means x^10=65.28.

x≈65.28^(1/10).

Compute 65.28^(0.1):

We know that 10^1=10, 2^10=1024, so 65.28^(0.1) is between 1.5 and 2.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use natural logs.

ln(65.28)=4.177.

Divide by 10: 0.4177.

e^0.4177≈1.517.

Hmm, but our x was approximately 1.533, so close enough considering the approximation.

Similarly, check the second equation:log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}= (1.533)^{4*16.31}= (1.533)^{65.24}.

Hmm, that's a huge number. Let's see if y^10 equals that.

y=16.31, so y^10=(16.31)^10.

Which is definitely a very large number, but perhaps we can compare the logs.

Take log of both sides:

log(y^10)=log(x^{4y}).

Which is 10 log y =4y log x.

We can check if this holds.

Compute 10 log y: 10*log(16.31)=10*1.212≈12.12.

4y logx=4*16.31* log(1.533)=65.24 *0.428≈27.86.

Wait, 12.12 ≈27.86? No, that's not correct. Hmm, so perhaps my approximate x and y aren't accurate enough.

Wait, maybe I need a better approximation for x.

Wait, perhaps Newton-Raphson method can give a better approximation.

Let me define f(t) = t*(1 +10/e^t) - ln25.

We have f(t)=0.

We can use Newton-Raphson to find t.

We have f(t)=t*(1 +10/e^t) - ln25.

f'(t)= (1 +10/e^t) + t*(-10 e^{-t}) ).

So f'(t)=1 +10 e^{-t} -10 t e^{-t}.

Let's take t0=0.43.

f(t0)=0.43*(1 +10/e^{0.43}) - ln25.

Compute e^{0.43}≈1.5375.

10/1.5375≈6.506.

So 1 +6.506≈7.506.

0.43*7.506≈3.227.

ln25≈3.2189.

So f(t0)=3.227 -3.2189≈0.0081.

f'(t0)=1 +10 e^{-0.43} -10*0.43 e^{-0.43}.

Compute e^{-0.43}≈1/1.5375≈0.6506.

10 e^{-0.43}≈10*0.6506≈6.506.

10*0.43 e^{-0.43}≈4.3*0.6506≈2.8.

So f'(t0)=1 +6.506 -2.8≈4.706.

Now, Newton-Raphson step:

t1 = t0 - f(t0)/f'(t0)=0.43 - 0.0081/4.706≈0.43 -0.00172≈0.4283.

Compute f(t1)=0.4283*(1 +10/e^{0.4283}) - ln25.

e^{0.4283}≈e^{0.428}=1.533.

10/1.533≈6.523.

So 1 +6.523≈7.523.

0.4283*7.523≈3.225.

3.225 -3.2189≈0.0061.

f'(t1)=1 +10 e^{-0.4283} -10*0.4283 e^{-0.4283}.

e^{-0.4283}=1/1.533≈0.6523.

10 e^{-0.4283}=10*0.6523≈6.523.

10*0.4283 e^{-0.4283}=4.283*0.6523≈2.800.

So f'(t1)=1 +6.523 -2.800≈4.723.

Next step:

t2= t1 - f(t1)/f'(t1)=0.4283 -0.0061/4.723≈0.4283-0.0013≈0.4270.

Compute f(t2)=0.427*(1 +10/e^{0.427}) - ln25.

e^{0.427}≈e^{0.427}=1.531.

10/1.531≈6.533.

1+6.533=7.533.

0.427*7.533≈3.221.

3.221 -3.2189≈0.0021.

f'(t2)=1 +10 e^{-0.427} -10*0.427 e^{-0.427}.

e^{-0.427}=1/1.531≈0.653.

10 e^{-0.427}=6.53.

10*0.427 e^{-0.427}=4.27*0.653≈2.795.

f'(t2)=1 +6.53 -2.795≈4.735.

t3= t2 -0.0021/4.735≈0.427 -0.00044≈0.42656.

Compute f(t3)=0.42656*(1 +10/e^{0.42656}) - ln25.

e^{0.42656}≈1.531.

10/1.531≈6.533.

1 +6.533=7.533.

0.42656*7.533≈3.219.

Which is very close to 3.2189. So t≈0.42656.

Thus, x= e^{0.42656}≈1.531.

Then y=25/x≈25/1.531≈16.33.

Now, let's check the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}= (1.531)^{4*16.33}= (1.531)^{65.32}.

Take log base y of that.

Which is log_{16.33}( (1.531)^{65.32} )= (65.32)* log_{16.33}(1.531).

But log_{16.33}(1.531)= ln(1.531)/ln(16.33).

Compute ln(1.531)=0.427.

ln(16.33)=2.795.

So log_{16.33}(1.531)=0.427/2.795≈0.1527.

Thus, the expression becomes 65.32 *0.1527≈9.96≈10.

Which is close enough considering the approximations.

Thus, the solution is x≈1.531, y≈16.33.

But wait, the problem asks for xy.

So xy≈1.531 *16.33≈25.

Wait, that's exactly 25. So xy=25.

Wait, that's interesting. Even though x and y are approximate, their product is exactly 25. So perhaps the exact answer is 25.

Let me check if x*y=25.

From earlier, we have y=25/x, so x*y= x*(25/x)=25.

So regardless of the values of x and y, their product is always 25.

Ah! So this is a key insight. Because we found that y=25/x, so their product is always 25.

So the answer is 25.


The problem involves finding real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, that satisfy the equations \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We aim to find the product \( xy \).

First, we rewrite the logarithmic equations in exponential form:
1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies \( x^{10} = y^x \).
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the first equation gives:
\[ 10 \ln x = x \ln y \quad \text{(Equation 1a)} \]

Similarly, for the second equation:
\[ 10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \quad \text{(Equation 2a)} \]

From Equation 1a, we solve for \( \ln y \):
\[ \ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \]

Substituting this into Equation 2a:
\[ 10 \left( \frac{10 \ln x}{x} \right) = 4y \ln x \]
\[ \frac{100 \ln x}{x} = 4y \ln x \]

Assuming \( \ln x \neq 0 \) (since \( x > 1 \)), we divide both sides by \( \ln x \):
\[ \frac{100}{x} = 4y \]
\[ y = \frac{25}{x} \]

Now, substituting \( y = \frac{25}{x} \) into the first equation \( x^{10} = y^x \):
\[ x^{10} = \left( \frac{25}{x} \right)^x \]
\[ x^{10} = \frac{25^x}{x^x} \]
\[ x^{x + 10} = 25^x \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ (x + 10) \ln x = x \ln 25 \]
\[ (x + 10) \ln x = x \ln 25 \]

Simplifying:
\[ \ln x = \frac{x \ln 25}{x + 10} \]

This equation is transcendental and does not have a closed-form solution. However, we notice that \( y = \frac{25}{x} \), implying that \( xy = x \cdot \frac{25}{x} = 25 \).

Thus, the product \( xy \) is exactly 25, regardless of the specific values of \( x \) and \( y \).

**Answer:**  
\boxed{25}
