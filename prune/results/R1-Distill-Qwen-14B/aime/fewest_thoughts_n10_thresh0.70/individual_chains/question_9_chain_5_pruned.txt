Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The equations given are logarithmic, which I remember have some properties I can use. Let's write down the problem again to make sure I have it right.

We're told that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. So, in mathematical terms:

log_x(y^x) = 10  
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

And we need to find xy.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some logarithm rules. I remember that log_b(a^c) is equal to c * log_b(a). So, maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using that rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, so we can write:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same rule, that's 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now we have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10  
2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the same as 1 / log_y(x). Let me use that to relate the two equations.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. So, A = log_x(y), which means log_y(x) is 1/A.

Substituting into the equations:

1) x * A = 10  
2) 4y * (1/A) = 10

So, equation 1: xA = 10  
Equation 2: (4y)/A = 10

Now, I can solve these equations for x and y in terms of A. Let me rearrange equation 1: x = 10 / A.

From equation 2: (4y)/A = 10 => y = (10 * A) /4 => y = (5A)/2.

So, x is 10/A and y is (5A)/2.

But since A is log_x(y), which is log_x(y) = A, and we've expressed both x and y in terms of A, perhaps we can substitute back into this equation to find A.

So, let's write A = log_x(y). Since x = 10/A and y = (5A)/2, substitute these into A:

A = log_{10/A} ( (5A)/2 )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can convert this logarithm into a more manageable form using the change of base formula. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = ln(a) / ln(b), so maybe I can write this as:

A = [ ln( (5A)/2 ) ] / [ ln(10/A) ]

That's an equation in terms of A only. Let's see if I can solve for A.

Multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate the fraction:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

Hmm, this looks tricky. Let me denote u = A for simplicity.

So, equation becomes:

u * ln(10/u) = ln(5u/2)

Let me expand the left side:

u * [ ln(10) - ln(u) ] = ln(5u/2)

Which is:

u * ln(10) - u * ln(u) = ln(5u) - ln(2)

Wait, because ln(5u/2) = ln(5u) - ln(2). So, that's:

u ln(10) - u ln u = ln(5u) - ln 2

Let me bring all terms to one side:

u ln(10) - u ln u - ln(5u) + ln 2 = 0

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms. Let's see.

First, note that ln(5u) = ln 5 + ln u.

So, substituting that in:

u ln(10) - u ln u - (ln 5 + ln u) + ln 2 = 0

Simplify term by term:

u ln(10) - u ln u - ln 5 - ln u + ln 2 = 0

Now, group like terms:

- u ln u - ln u + u ln(10) + (- ln5 + ln2) = 0

Factor out ln u from the first two terms:

- ln u (u + 1) + u ln10 + ( - ln5 + ln2 ) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should consider that this equation might be solvable numerically or perhaps through substitution. Alternatively, maybe I can find a substitution that allows me to write this as a quadratic in terms of A or u.

Alternatively, let's try to express everything in terms of ln(2), ln(5), etc., since 10 is 2*5, so maybe that can be broken down.

Wait, maybe I should try to make a substitution to simplify. Let's see:

Let me set t = u, so we have:

t ln(10) - t ln t = ln(5t/2)

Wait, but that seems similar to the earlier steps. Maybe it's better to think of this in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let z = ln t, which could make the equation a bit more linear.

Wait, let's try that. Let me set z = ln t, so t = e^z.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to express this equation differently.

Let me go back to the equation:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

I can write the left side as A ln(10) - A ln A, and the right side as ln5 + ln A - ln2.

So, we have:

A ln10 - A ln A = ln5 + ln A - ln2

Let me move all terms to the left:

A ln10 - A ln A - ln5 - ln A + ln2 = 0

Factor terms with A ln A and ln A:

- A ln A - ln A + A ln10 - ln5 + ln2 =0

So, factor ln A:

ln A (-A -1 ) + A ln10 + ( - ln5 + ln2 ) =0

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

ln A ( - (A +1) ) + A ln10 + ln(2/5) =0

Wait, because -ln5 + ln2 = ln(2/5). So, equation becomes:

- (A +1) ln A + A ln10 + ln(2/5) =0

This is a transcendental equation, meaning it's not solvable with algebra alone. So, perhaps I should look for integer values of A that satisfy this equation, but since x and y are real numbers greater than 1, A must be positive.

Wait, let me think about possible integer values for A. Let's try A=2.

Plugging A=2 into the equation:

- (2 +1)*ln2 + 2*ln10 + ln(2/5)  
= -3 ln2 + 2 ln10 + ln(2) - ln5  
= (-3 ln2 + ln2) + 2 ln10 - ln5  
= (-2 ln2) + 2(ln10) - ln5

Hmm, let's compute each term:

ln10= ln(2*5)= ln2 + ln5.

So, 2 ln10 = 2 ln2 + 2 ln5.

So, substituting:

= (-2 ln2) + (2 ln2 + 2 ln5) - ln5  
= (-2 ln2 + 2 ln2) + (2 ln5 - ln5)  
= 0 + ln5  
= ln5 ≈ 1.6094, which isn't zero. So, A=2 is not a solution.

Hmm, maybe A=3?

Let me compute each term when A=3.

-4 ln3 + 3 ln10 + ln(2/5)  
= -4 ln3 + 3(ln2 + ln5) + ln2 - ln5  
= -4 ln3 + 3 ln2 + 3 ln5 + ln2 - ln5  
= (3 ln2 + ln2) + (3 ln5 - ln5) -4 ln3  
=4 ln2 + 2 ln5 -4 ln3

Hmm, not sure if that's zero. Let me compute numerically:

ln2 ≈0.6931, ln3≈1.0986, ln5≈1.6094.

So:

4*(0.6931)=2.7724  
2*(1.6094)=3.2188  
-4*(1.0986)= -4.3944

Sum: 2.7724 +3.2188=6. (Approx 5.9912) minus 4.3944 gives about 1.5968, which is roughly ln5, not zero. So A=3 is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I should try A=5/2=2.5 or A=1. Let me try A=1.

If A=1, then:

- (1+1) ln1 +1 ln10 + ln(2/5)  
But ln1=0, so:

0 + ln10 + ln(2/5) = ln10 + ln(2/5) = ln(10*(2/5)) )= ln(4). Which is not zero. So A=1 is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I should try A=5. Let me compute:

-6 ln5 +5 ln10 + ln(2/5)  
= -6 ln5 +5(ln2 + ln5) + ln2 - ln5  
= -6 ln5 +5 ln2 +5 ln5 + ln2 - ln5  
= (5 ln2 + ln2) + (5 ln5 -6 ln5 - ln5)  
=6 ln2 -2 ln5

Again, compute numerically:

6*0.6931≈4.1586  
2*1.6094≈3.2188  
So 4.1586 -3.2188≈0.9398, not zero.

Alternatively, maybe A is a fractional value like 5/3 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see if there's a substitution that can make this equation into a quadratic in terms of A.

Wait, perhaps I can let’s
