Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. It means that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers that add up to 300. So, without any constraints, the number of solutions would be C(300 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(302,2), which is a huge number. But here, we have another equation involving a, b, c. So we need to find all triples that satisfy both equations.

The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression. Looking at it, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, where one is squared. Let me group them differently.

Wait, a²b + a²c = a²(b + c), and similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression becomes: a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So, substituting these into the expression:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that simplifies to 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums or something. Let's think about known identities.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let's write that down:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Similarly, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Given that a + b + c = 300, let's compute these expressions.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let P = ab + bc + ca.

Let Q = abc.

So, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

And a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q = 27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3Q = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Now, substituting back into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So,

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300 * (-2P) = -600P.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Now, subtract (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q):

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q.

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0.

-600P + 900P = 300P.

-3Q remains.

So, the entire expression becomes 0 + 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

So,

300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

Which can be written as Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting relation. So, Q is expressed in terms of P. But Q is abc, and P is ab + bc + ca. So, abc = 100*(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

I need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = P, and abc = Q, with Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

This seems a bit tricky. Let me think about how to relate a, b, c now.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so maybe some of them are zero.

Wait, but if any of a, b, c is zero, say a=0, then from a + b + c = 300, we get b + c = 300.

Then, the second equation would become:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*300.

So, if a=0, then bc*300 = 6,000,000 => bc = 20,000.

So, bc = 20,000, and b + c = 300.

So, we can think of it as solving for b and c such that b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. Hmm, that's a quadratic equation.

Let me see: Let me set b + c = 300, bc = 20,000.

Then, the quadratic equation is x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant D = 300² - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of D is 100.

So, solutions are x = [300 ±100]/2 => (400)/
