Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her entire walk takes 4 hours, and this includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Wait, so the 4 hours is her total time, which is both the time she spends walking and the time she spends in the coffee shop.

Then, there's a second scenario where she walks at a speed of s + 2 km/h, and this time, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which I should probably convert into minutes to make it easier. Let me calculate that: 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes makes 144 minutes.

Wait, but the first scenario was 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, in both cases, the time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. That means the time she spends walking is the total time minus t.

So, for the first case, when her speed is s km/h, the time walking is 240 - t minutes, and the distance is 9 km. Since speed is distance over time, I can write an equation for that.

But wait, I should make sure all the units are consistent. Since speed is in km per hour, time should be in hours. So, let's convert those times into hours.

First scenario: 4 hours is 4 hours. So, the time walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours. So, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the walking time is (4 - t/60) hours.

Similarly, the second scenario: 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 hours. Let
