Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So imagine taking a hula hoop with radius 3 and spinning it around a stick that's 6 units away from the center of the hoop.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it internally along a circle, or it can rest outside and be tangent externally along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, which is given as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think I need to figure out the positions where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Since the torus is a surface of revolution, maybe I can model it using some coordinate system.

First, let me recall the equation of a torus. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with radius R (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) and tube radius r is given by:

√(x² + y²) = R ± √(z² + y²)

Wait, maybe I should write the parametric equations instead. Alternatively, the equation in terms of x, y, z can be written as:

(x² + y² + z² + a² - b²)^2 = 4a²(x² + y²)

Where a is the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus), and b is the minor radius (radius of the tube). Wait, no, maybe I have that backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, I think a is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, so that's 6 in our case. And b is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3. So the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

So the equation would be:

(x² + y² + z² + a² - b²)^2 = 4a²(x² + y²)

Plugging a = 6 and b = 3, we get:

(x² + y² + z² + 36 - 9)^2 = 4*36*(x² + y²)
Simplify inside the square:
(x² + y² + z² + 27)^2 = 144(x² + y²)

Hmm, okay. Now, the sphere has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

We need to find the points where the torus and the sphere are tangent. So, the intersection of the torus and the sphere will be a circle, and at the point of tangency, their tangent planes are the same. So, maybe I can set up the equations and find the conditions for tangency.

Let me think in terms of coordinates. Let's consider the sphere and torus equations.

Sphere: x² + y² + z² = 121.

Torus: (x² + y² + z² + 27)^2 = 144(x² + y²)

Let me denote S = x² + y² + z² = 121.

So, substituting into the torus equation:

(121 + 27)^2 = 144(x² + y²)
(148)^2 = 144(x² + y²)
So, x² + y² = (148)^2
