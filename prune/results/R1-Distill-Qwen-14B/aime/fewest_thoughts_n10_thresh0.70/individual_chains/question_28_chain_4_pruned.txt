Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face, and express it in a specific form.

Hmm, tetrahedrons can be tricky. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

But wait, how do I compute the volume? Since all the edges are given in pairs, maybe this is a special kind of tetrahedron. I think it might be a "isohedral" tetrahedron, where all faces are congruent. But actually, the edges are paired but not necessarily all the same. Let me check the edges:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
AD = BC = sqrt(89)

So it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it's a "disphemoid," which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's exactly this case. So for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated with a formula.

I recall that the volume of a disphenoid can be found using the formula involving the edge lengths. Let me see... I think the formula is V = sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 72, but wait, no, that doesn't seem right because that formula resembles Heron's formula for a triangle. Maybe it's similar but in 3D.

Alternatively, since it's a disphenoid, perhaps I can place it in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me try that approach. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the symmetry is preserved, it might make computing volume and surface area more manageable.

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:

Letâ€™s place point A at (x, y, z). Due to the symmetry of the edge lengths, maybe I can position the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide at the origin. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe place the centroid at the origin, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach is to realize that in a disphenoid, the four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me see. If all opposite edges are equal, then each pair of opposite edges has the same length, but does that make the faces congruent? Let me think: Each face is a triangle with sides from different pairs. For example, face ABC has sides AB, AC, BC. Similarly, face ABD has sides AB, AD, BD. Since AB is equal in both, but AC vs BD: AC is sqrt(80) and BD is sqrt(80), so perhaps the faces are congruent? Wait, but BC is sqrt(89), and AD is sqrt(89). Hmm, so each face would have sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's helpful because then the surface area is just four times the area of one face.

So first, let's compute the area of one face. Let's compute the area of triangle ABC, which has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute the semi-perimeter first: s =
