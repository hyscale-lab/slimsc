Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which will be a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

Alright, let's start by recalling some important geometry concepts that might help here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, I remember that in circle geometry, the point where two tangents meet (like D here) has some special properties. Specifically, D lies on the external angle bisector of angle BAC, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, actually, D is the ex-pole of BC, but maybe that's too advanced for now.

Wait, another property: if two tangents are drawn from a point outside the circle, then those two tangent segments are equal in length. So, from point D, the tangents DB and DC should be equal. That might come in handy later.

Also, since AD intersects the circle again at P, perhaps we can use some power of a point theorem here. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² (since DB is a tangent). Similarly, for point A, the power with respect to ω could be expressed in terms of AP and AD, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Let me write down what I know:

- AB = 5
- BC = 9
- AC = 10

So triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle. 5 + 9 > 10? 14 > 10, yes. 5 + 10 > 9? 15 > 9, yes. 9 + 10 >5? 19>5, yes. So, it's a valid triangle.

I think the first step is to find some key elements of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, maybe the coordinates of the points, or perhaps use trigonometry to find angles. Hmm, coordinate geometry might be messy, but maybe manageable. Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines to find angles could help.

Alternatively, perhaps using properties of similar triangles or Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about tangents. Since DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, DB = DC. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC. That might help in some way.

Another approach: maybe use inversion, but that's probably overkill for this problem.

Alternatively, since AD intersects the circle again at P, perhaps we can use the power of point A with respect to ω. Wait, but A is on ω, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.

Wait, but point D is outside the circle, so the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

Yes, that seems useful. Because power of D with respect to ω is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the points where any line through D intersects ω. So, in this case, line AD passes through D and intersects ω at A and P. Therefore, power of D is DA * DP = DB².

So, DA * DP = DB².

But I don't know DA yet. So that's one equation, but I need more.

Wait, so perhaps we can find DB first, but to find DB, maybe we need to find the length of the tangent from D to ω, which is DB (or DC). But without knowing where D is, that's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe we can express DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the length of the tangent from a vertex to the circumcircle can be found using the formula:

DB = (AB * BC) / (2 * R * cos(theta/2))

Wait, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the length of the tangent from D to the circumcircle is related to the semiperimeter or something.

Wait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the tangents from D to the circumcircle meet at B and C. So, point D is the ex-pole of BC, but I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to compute everything.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC = 9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Wait, but the sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, if I place C at (0,0), and B at (9,0), then A must satisfy the distances: AC=10 and AB=5.

Wait, let me check: the distance from A to C is 10, from A to B is 5, and from B to C is 9.

So, let's assign coordinates:

Let C = (0,0).

Let B = (9,0).

Let A = (x,y).

Then, distance AC = 10: so sqrt(x² + y²) = 10 => x² + y² = 100.

Distance AB = 5: sqrt( (x-9)^2 + y² ) = 5 => (x-9)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x-9)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 100.

Expanding (x-9)^2: x² -18x +81.

So, x² -18x +81 + y² - x² - y² = -75.

Simplify: -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x = 156/18 = 26/3 ≈8.666...

Then, plug x back into x² + y² = 100: (26/3)^2 + y² = 100.

Compute (26/3)^2: 676/9.

So, y² = 100 - 676/9 = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9.

Thus, y = sqrt(224/9) = (sqrt(224))/3 = (sqrt(16*14))/3 = (4*sqrt(14))/3.

So, point A is at (26/3, 4√14/3).

Alright, so coordinates:

A: (26/3, 4√14/3)

B: (9, 0)

C: (0,0)

Now, let's find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

The circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.

Let me compute the midpoint of AB and the midpoint of AC.

Midpoint of AB:

A: (26/3, 4√14/3)

B: (9,0) = (27/3, 0)

Midpoint M1: ((26/3 + 27/3)/2, (4√14/3 + 0)/2) = (53/6, 2√14/3)

Slope of AB: (0 - 4√14/3) / (9 - 26/3) = (-4√14/3) / (11/3) = (-4√14)/11

So, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope m1 = 11/(4√14)

Equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:

Using point M1: y - 2√14/3 = (11/(4√14))(x - 53/6)

Similarly, find the perpendicular bisector of AC.

Midpoint of AC:

A: (26/3, 4√14/3)

C: (0,0)

Midpoint M2: (13/3, 2√14/3)

Slope of AC: (4√14/3 - 0)/(26/3 - 0) = (4√14/3) / (26/3) = (4√14)/26 = (2√14)/13

Thus, the perpendicular bisector of AC will have slope m2 = -13/(2√14)

Equation of the perpendicular bisector of AC:

Using point M2: y - 2√14/3 = (-13/(2√14))(x - 13/3)

Now, we have two equations for the perpendicular bisectors. Let's solve them to find the circumcenter O.

First, equation for AB's perpendicular bisector:

y = (11/(4√14))x - (11/(4√14))(53/6) + 2√14/3

Let me compute the constants.

Compute (11/(4√14))*(53/6):

= (11*53)/(4*6√14) = 583/(24√14)

So, equation becomes:

y = (11/(4√14))x - 583/(24√14) + 2√14/3

Similarly, equation for AC's perpendicular bisector:

y = (-13/(2√14))x + (13/(2√14))*(13/3) + 2√14/3

Compute (13/(2√14))*(13/3) = (169)/(6√14)

So, equation becomes:

y = (-13/(2√14))x + 169/(6√14) + 2√14/3

Now, set the two equations equal to each other to find x.

(11/(4√14))x - 583/(24√14) + 2√14/3 = (-13/(2√14))x + 169/(6√14) + 2√14/3

First, notice that 2√14/3 appears on both sides, so they cancel out.

So,

(11/(4√14))x - 583/(24√14) = (-13/(2√14))x + 169/(6√14)

Multiply both sides by 24√14 to eliminate denominators.

24√14 * [ (11/(4√14))x - 583/(24√14) ] = 24√14 * [ (-13/(2√14))x + 169/(6√14) ]

Simplify each term:

Left side:

24√14*(11/(4√14))x = (24/4)*11 x = 6*11 x = 66x

24√14*(-583/(24√14)) = -583

Right side:

24√14*(-13/(2√14))x = (24/2)*(-13)x = 12*(-13)x = -156x

24√14*(169/(6√14)) = (24/6)*169 = 4*169 = 676

So, equation becomes:

66x - 583 = -156x + 676

Bring all x terms to left and constants to right:

66x + 156x = 676 + 583

222x = 1259

x = 1259 / 222

Let me see if this reduces. Hmm, 1259 is a prime? Let me check.

Divide 1259 by small primes:

1259 ÷ 2: no.

1259 ÷ 3: 1+2+5+9=17, which is not divisible by 3.

1259 ÷ 5: ends with 9, no.

7: 1259 ÷7≈179.85, 7*179=1253, 1259-1253=6, not divisible.

11: 1 -2 +5 -9= -5, not divisible by 11.

13: Let's see, 13*96=1248, 1259-1248=11, not divisible.

17: 17*74=1258, 1259-1258=1, not divisible.

19: 19*66=1254, 1259-1254=5, nope.

23: 23*54=1242, 1259-1242=17, nope.

29: 29*43=1247, 1259-1247=12, not divisible.

31: 31*40=1240, 1259-1240=19, nope.

So, x=1259/222 can't be reduced.

Now, let's find y using one of the equations, say the first one:

y = (11/(4√14))x - 583/(24√14) + 2√14/3

Plugging x=1259/222:

Compute each term:

(11/(4√14)) * (1259/222) = (11 * 1259) / (4√14 * 222)

Compute 4*222=888.

So, numerator: 11*1259 = let's compute 1259*10=12590, plus 1259=13849.

So, term is 13849/(888√14)

Similarly, 583/(24√14) = same as 583/(24√14)

And 2√14/3.

So,

y = [13849/(888√14)] - [583/(24√14)] + [2√14/3]

Let me convert all terms to have the same denominator, which is 888√14.

First term: 13849/(888√14)

Second term: 583/(24√14) = (583 * 37)/(888√14) because 24*37=888.

Compute 583 * 37:

Compute 500*37=18,500, 80*37=2,960, 3*37=111. Total: 18,500 +2,960=21,460 +111=21,571.

So, second term is -21,571/(888√14)

Third term: 2√14/3 = 2√14 * (296)/(888) [since 3*296=888]

Wait, no. To convert 2√14/3 to denominator 888√14, note that:

(2√14)/3 = (2√14)*(296) / (888) = (592√14)/888.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the denominator is 888√14, which is different. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute y as [ ... ] - [ ... ] + [ ... ] and then combine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's getting too messy. Maybe it's better to compute numerically.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Wait, perhaps I can parametrize point D.

Wait, point D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. In coordinate geometry,
