Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer should be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S,

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S of this tetrahedron.

But before that, I think I should figure out the shape of this tetrahedron. The edges are given in such a way that opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. I've heard that such tetrahedrons are called "isohedral" or maybe "edge-transitive," but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, maybe it's symmetrical in some way.

Wait, is there a special formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when opposite edges are equal? I think if all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or maybe "isohedral," but I might be mixing terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's a kind of bipyramid or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to compute the volume.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me try to position the points in 3D space such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can arrange the points so that they are symmetric in some way.

Let me think: Let's place the points such that the midpoints of the edges AB and CD coincide, and similarly for the other pairs. That might make the structure symmetric.

Alternatively, maybe use vectors. Let me consider point A at (0,0,0). Then, perhaps point B can be at (a,0,0). Point C can be at (0,b,0), and point D can be at (0,0,c). Then, I can compute the distances between these points and set them equal to the given lengths.

Wait, but the edges AB, AC, AD are not given directly. Instead, the opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps this coordinate system might not be straightforward.

Wait, edges AB and CD are sqrt(41), so AB = sqrt(a² + 0 + 0) = a, so a = sqrt(41). Then CD would be the distance between C(0,b,0) and D(0,0,c), which is sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(41). So, b² + c² = 41.

Similarly, AC is sqrt(80). AC is the distance between A(0,0,0) and C(0,b,0), so that's just b. So, b = sqrt(80). Therefore, from the previous equation, b² + c² = 41, so (80) + c² = 41 => c² = -39. Wait, that can't be. So, this coordinate system approach has a problem because c² would be negative, which is impossible.

Hmm, so maybe my initial coordinate system is flawed because placing A, B, C, D on the axes isn't compatible with the given edge lengths.

Perhaps a different approach is needed. Maybe place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of opposite edges are the same. Let me try that.

Let me consider the midpoints of AB and CD. Let’s denote M as the midpoint of AB and N as the midpoint of CD. Similarly, midpoints of AC and BD can be O and P, and midpoints of AD and BC can be Q and R.

In a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, these midpoints might coincide, leading to a symmetric structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is "equilic" or something. But maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

Let me denote vectors for the points. Let me assume that the centroid is at the origin for simplicity. Wait, but the incenter is not necessarily the centroid. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Cayley-Menger determinant to compute the volume given all the edge lengths. Oh, that's a good idea. I remember that the Cayley-Menger determinant can compute the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, that might be the way to go. Let's recall the formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant. For a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f, the volume V is given by:

288 V² = |CM|,

where |CM| is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix. The matrix is a 5x5 matrix, but I think it's actually a 6x6 matrix. Wait, no, the Cayley-Menger determinant for n points in (n-1)-dimensional space is a (n+2)x(n+2) matrix. So, for a tetrahedron in 3D space, it's a 5x5 matrix.

Wait, the formula is:

CM = determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 a² b² c²

1 a² 0 d² e²

1 b² d² 0 f²

1 c² e² f² 0

So, the determinant of this 5x5 matrix divided by 288 gives V squared.

So, let me compute this determinant.

Given the edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => AD² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89

BD = sqrt(80) => BD² = 80

CD = sqrt(41) => CD² = 41

So, the edge lengths squared are:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89,

BC² =89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

Now, arrange these into the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

The Cayley-Menger matrix is:

[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²],
  [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²],
  [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²],
  [1, AD², BD², CD², 0] ]

Wait, no, let me think again. The rows and columns correspond to points 0,1,2,3,4, where point 0 is the origin, and points 1,2,3,4 are the vertices A,B,C,D.

Wait, no. Actually, the Cayley-Menger matrix for four points in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are 0,1,1,1,1 and the first element is 0, then the next four elements are 1s.

The other rows are:

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD²

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD²

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD²

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0

Wait, but in my case, the points are A,B,C,D. So, perhaps the edge lengths are:

AB² = 41, AC²=80, AD²=89,

BC²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

So, plugging these in:

- The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

- Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

- Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

- Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

- Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, is that correct? Let me see.

Wait, for points A,B,C,D, the edge lengths AB, AC, AD are 41,80,89.

Similarly, BC is 89, BD is 80, CD is 41.

Yes, so row 1 (after the first row) corresponds to point A, so the distances from A to the others: AB, AC, AD.

Similarly, row 2 is point B: BA, BC, BD.

Row 3 is point C: CA, CB, CD.

Row 4 is point D: DA, DB, DC.

So, the matrix is set up correctly.

Now, the Cayley-Menger determinant is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Let's compute it.

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is going to be very tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or some symmetry here that can simplify the computation.

Looking at the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

I notice that the matrix is symmetric. Maybe we can perform some row or column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator or some computational tool, but since I'm doing this by hand, I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps noting that the tetrahedron is "equifacial," meaning that all faces are congruent. Because the opposite edges are equal, perhaps the faces are congruent triangles. Let me check the face triangles.

For example, face ABC: edges AB= sqrt(41), AC= sqrt(80), BC= sqrt(89).

Face ABD: edges AB= sqrt(41), AD= sqrt(89), BD= sqrt(80).

So, both triangles ABC and ABD have sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, they are congruent.

Similarly, face ACD: edges AC= sqrt(80), AD= sqrt(89), CD= sqrt(41). So, same as ABC and ABD.

And face BCD: edges BC= sqrt(89), BD= sqrt(80), CD= sqrt(41). Same again.

So, all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). That's helpful. So, the tetrahedron is isohedral (all faces congruent) and also edge-transitive (each edge is the same as another). So, it's a very symmetric tetrahedron.

Therefore, the surface area S will be 4 times the area of one face. So, if I can compute the area of one face, I can multiply by 4 to get the total surface area.

Similarly, the volume can be found using the Cayley-Menger determinant, but perhaps there's a simpler way given the symmetry.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent and the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe the inradius can be found using another formula.

Wait, I also remember that in a regular tetrahedron (which this is not, but perhaps similar properties hold), the inradius is related to the height and the surface area. But this is not a regular tetrahedron since the edges are not all equal.

Wait, but since all faces are congruent, maybe this tetrahedron is isohedral, so perhaps it's face-transitive, which would imply that the inradius can be found in a symmetric way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume by splitting the tetrahedron into two parts or using coordinates.

Wait, let me try to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I think it's the most straightforward way, despite the large computation.

So, the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   41   80   89 |
| 1  41    0   89   80 |
| 1  80   89    0   41 |
| 1  89   80   41    0 |

Let me denote this matrix as M. So, M = [m_ij], where m_00=0, m_0i=m_i0=1 for i>0, and the other entries are the squared edge lengths as above.

The determinant of M is equal to 288 V^2. So, V^2 = |M| / 288.

Calculating this determinant is going to be time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the tetrahedron is isohedral, so perhaps the volume can be computed using some formula for symmetric tetrahedrons.

Wait, another approach: since all the faces are congruent triangles, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a sphere, and the inradius is related to the sphere's radius.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the volume by using the formula for a tetrahedron with congruent faces.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the volume in terms of the face areas and dihedral angles. But that might be more complicated.

Wait, perhaps another thought: since all the edges opposite are equal, the tetrahedron might be a disphenoid. Yes, I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent. So, this must be a disphenoid.

Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal, and the four faces are congruent triangles. So, this tetrahedron is a disphenoid.

I remember that for a disphenoid, there is a formula for the volume. Let me recall it.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72,

Wait, no, that's the formula for the volume in terms of edge lengths for a regular tetrahedron? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In a disphenoid, all faces are congruent, so each face has the same area. Let me compute the area of one face first.

Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute its area.

Using Heron's formula: the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

Then area = sqrt( s(s - sqrt(41))(s - sqrt(80))(s - sqrt(89)) ).

But that's going to be messy. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for area in terms of sides:

Area = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

So, plugging in a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Let me compute:

Area² = (1/16)( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

So,

Compute each term:

a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

-a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula with vectors. Let me denote vectors for the edges.

Wait, but perhaps I can instead find the volume using another method.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the volume can also be expressed in terms of the edge lengths. I found a resource that says that for a disphenoid with edges a, b, c, the volume is sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72.

Wait, but I need to check if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps for a disphenoid, the volume is (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (something). I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the volume via the Cayley-Menger determinant.

But let's try to compute it step by step.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D is given by:

| 0  1    1    1    1  |
| 1  0  AB² AC² AD² |
| 1 AB²  0  BC² BD² |
| 1 AC² BC²  0  CD² |
| 1 AD² BD² CD²  0  |

Which is a 5x5 matrix. Let's denote the determinant as D.

We can compute D using expansion by minors or row operations, but it's quite tedious.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it by noting patterns or using the fact that the matrix is symmetric.

I think the determinant will be a function of the squared edge lengths. Given the symmetry, maybe the determinant can be expressed in terms of the products of the edge lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that all faces are congruent.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the determinant numerically.

Wait, let's compute the determinant as follows:

First, write down the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, perhaps subtracting row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros in the first column except row 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]. So, maybe perform row operations to eliminate the 1s in the first column except for row 0.

Let me denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.

First, I can leave R0 as is.

Then, for R1, R2, R3, R4, subtract R1 from them to create zeros in the first column.

Compute R2' = R2 - R1:

Row2: 1,41,0,89,80

Minus Row1: 1,0,41,80,89

Resulting in: 0,41,-41,9,-9

Similarly, R3' = R3 - R1:

Row3: 1,80,89,0,41

Minus Row1: 1,0,41,80,89

Resulting in: 0,80,48,-80,-48

Wait, let me compute:

89 - 41 = 48? Wait, 89 is the third element of R3, and 41 is the third element of R1.

So, R3' third element: 89 - 41 = 48.

Similarly, R3 fourth element: 0 - 80 = -80.

R3 fifth element: 41 - 89 = -48.

Similarly, R4' = R4 - R1:

Row4: 1,89,80,41,0

Minus Row1: 1,0,41,80,89

So, R4' is:

0,89,-41,-39,-89

Wait, let's double-check:

1-1 = 0,

89-0 =89,

80-41=39? Wait, no: 80 is the third element, R1 third element is 41. So 80 - 41 = 39.

Wait, no: Wait, in R3, the third element is 89, and R1 third is 41, so 89 - 41 = 48. Similarly, R3 fourth element is 0, R1 fourth is 80. So, 0 - 80 = -80. R3 fifth element is 41, R1 fifth is 89, so 41 - 89 = -48.

Similarly, R4':

First element: 1 - 1 = 0.

Second element: 89 - 0 = 89.

Third element:80 -41=39.

Fourth element:41 -80= -39.

Fifth element:0 -89= -89.

So, R4' is [0,89,39,-39,-89].

So, after these operations, our matrix becomes:

R0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

R1: 1,0,41,80,89

R2': 0,41,-41,9,-9

R3':0,80,48,-80,-48

R4':0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, the determinant remains the same after row operations except for row swaps and scaling. Since we've subtracted rows, the determinant remains the same.

Now, let's proceed to compute the determinant by expanding along the first column.

The first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. So, the only non-zero element is the 1 in R1.

So, the determinant is (-1)^(1+1) * 1 * det(minor of R1, C1).

The minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing R1 and C1.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0': [1,1,1,1]

Row2': [41,-41,9,-9]

Row3': [80,48,-80,-48]

Row4': [89,39,-39,-89]

So, the minor determinant is:

| 1  1    1    1  |
|41 -41   9   -9 |
|80 48  -80  -48 |
|89 39  -39  -89 |

So, we need to compute this 4x4 determinant.

Let me denote this as D'.

Compute D' = determinant of:

[1, 1, 1, 1]

[41, -41, 9, -9]

[80, 48, -80, -48]

[89, 39, -39, -89]

Hmm, perhaps perform row operations to simplify this determinant.

Looking at the first row, all ones. Maybe subtract the first row from the others to create zeros.

Compute R2' = R2 - 41*R1:

Wait, wait, R2 is [41, -41, 9, -9]. If I subtract 41*R1 where R1 is [1,1,1,1], then R2' becomes [41-41*1, -41 -41*1, 9 -41*1, -9 -41*1] = [0, -82, -32, -50].

Similarly, R3' = R3 -80*R1: [80 -80*1, 48 -80*1, -80 -80*1, -48 -80*1] = [0, -32, -160, -128].

R4' = R4 -89*R1: [89 -89*1, 39 -89*1, -39 -89*1, -89 -89*1] = [0, -50, -128, -178].

So, the transformed minor matrix is:

R0': [1, 1, 1, 1]

R2': [0, -82, -32, -50]

R3': [0, -32, -160, -128]

R4': [0, -50, -128, -178]

Now, the determinant remains the same except for the row operations, which don't affect the determinant (since we subtracted multiples of rows).

Now, the determinant is easier to compute because the first column has a 1 followed by zeros. So, expanding along the first column.

The determinant D' is 1 * det of the minor:

| -82  -32  -50 |
| -32 -160 -128 |
| -50 -128 -178 |

So, now compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me denote this as M:

[ -82, -32, -50 ]

[ -32, -160, -128 ]

[ -50, -128, -178 ]

Compute determinant:

= -82 * det( [ -160, -128 ], [ -128, -178 ] )

- (-32) * det( [ -32, -128 ], [ -50, -178 ] )

+ (-50) * det( [ -32, -160 ], [ -50, -128 ] )

Compute each minor:

First term:

-82 * [ (-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128) ] 

= -82 * [ (28480) - (16384) ]

= -82 * (12096)

= -82 * 12096

Second term:

- (-32) * [ (-32)(-178) - (-128)(-50) ]

= 32 * [ 5696 - 6400 ]

= 32 * (-704)

= -22528

Third term:

+ (-50) * [ (-32)(-128) - (-160)(-50) ]

= (-50) * [ 4096 - 8000 ]

= (-50) * (-3904)

= 195200

Now, sum all three terms:

First term: -82 * 12096 = Let's compute 82 * 12096.

Compute 80 * 12096 = 967,680

Compute 2 * 12096 = 24,192

Total = 967,680 + 24,192 = 991,872

So, first term is -991,872.

Second term: -22,528

Third term: +195,200

So, total determinant:

-991,872 -22,528 + 195,200

= (-991,872 -22,528) + 195,200

= (-1,014,400) + 195,200

= -819,200

So, the determinant D' is -819,200.

Therefore, the minor determinant is -819,200.

So, going back, the original determinant D is:

D = (-1)^(1+1) * 1 * (-819,200) = 1 * (-819,200) = -819,200.

But wait, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is 288 V², so:

288 V² = |D| = | -819,200 | = 819,200.

So, V² = 819,200 / 288.

Simplify this:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 819,200 ÷16=51,200; 288 ÷16=18.

So, V² = 51,200 / 18.

Simplify further: 51,200 ÷ 2 = 25,600; 18 ÷2=9.

So, V² = 25,600 / 9.

Therefore, V = sqrt(25,600 / 9) = sqrt(25,600)/sqrt(9) = 160/3.

So, the volume V is 160/3.

Great, that wasn't too bad, once I figured out the Cayley-Menger determinant approach.

Now, moving on to the surface area S. Since all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four.

Let me compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

Compute s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

But Heron's formula is:

Area = sqrt( s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ).

This will be messy, but let's compute it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula:

Area = (1/4) sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Which is another version of Heron's formula.

Let me compute each term:

a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Compute:

(a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

(-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

(a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

(a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)

Compute each term squared:

Let me compute each product:

First, compute (a + b + c)(-a + b + c):

= [ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ] 

= [ (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2 - 41 ]

= [ 80 + 2*sqrt(80*89) + 89 - 41 ]

= [ (80 + 89 - 41) + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

= [ 128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

Similarly, compute (a - b + c)(a + b - c):

= [ a^2 - (b - c)^2 ]

= [ 41 - (sqrt(80) - sqrt(89))^2 ]

= [ 41 - (80 - 2*sqrt(80*89) + 89) ]

= [ 41 - (169 - 2*sqrt(7120)) ]

= [ 41 - 169 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

= [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

So, now, the product:

( a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c )

= [128 + 2*sqrt(7120)] * [ -128 + 2*sqrt(7120) ]

= (2*sqrt(7120) + 128)(2*sqrt(7120) - 128)

= [ (2*sqrt(7120))^2 - (128)^2 ]

= [ 4*7120 - 16384 ]

Compute:

4*7120 = 28,480

28,480 - 16,384 = 12,096

So, the product is 12,096.

Therefore, Area² = (1/16)*12,096 = 12,096 / 16 = 756.

Thus, Area = sqrt(756).

Simplify sqrt(756):

756 = 4 * 189 = 4 * 9 * 21 = 4 * 9 * 3 *7.

So, sqrt(756) = 2 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).

So, the area of one face is 6*sqrt(21).

Therefore, the total surface area S = 4 * 6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).

Now, having V = 160/3 and S = 24*sqrt(21), the inradius r is given by:

r = 3V / S.

So, plug in the values:

r = 3*(160/3) / (24*sqrt(21)).

Simplify:

3 cancels out in numerator and denominator:

= 160 / (24*sqrt(21)).

Simplify 160 /24: divide numerator and denominator by 8:

160 ÷8=20; 24 ÷8=3.

So, 20/(3*sqrt(21)).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

= (20*sqrt(21)) / (3*21) = (20*sqrt(21))/63.

Simplify 20 and 63: they have no common factors (since 20=2^2*5, 63=7*3^2), so it's reduced.

Thus, r = (20 sqrt(21))/63.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but 63 can be divided by 3 and 21 by 3. Wait, no, in the fraction 20/63, 20 and 63 are coprime because 20 is 2^2*5 and 63 is 7*3^2, no common factors.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Thus, m + n + p = 20 +21 +63= 104.

So, the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) is a disphenoid, meaning all its faces are congruent triangles. The edge lengths are given in pairs: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\).

### Step 1: Compute the Volume
We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron. The determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix for the given edge lengths is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{det} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\
1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\
1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\
1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0
\end{vmatrix}
\]

After performing row operations and simplifying, the determinant is found to be \(-819200\). The volume \(V\) is then calculated using the formula:

\[
288V^2 = |\text{det}| \implies V^2 = \frac{819200}{288} = \frac{25600}{9} \implies V = \frac{160}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Surface Area
Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is computed as:

\[
s = \frac{\sqrt{41} + \sqrt{80} + \sqrt{89}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - \sqrt{41})(s - \sqrt{80})(s - \sqrt{89})}
\]

After simplification, the area of one face is found to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \(S\) is:

\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Inradius
The inradius \(r\) is given by the formula:

\[
r = \frac{3V}{S}
\]

Substituting the values of \(V\) and \(S\):

\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}}
\]

Rationalizing the denominator:

\[
r = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, the distance is in the form \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
\]
