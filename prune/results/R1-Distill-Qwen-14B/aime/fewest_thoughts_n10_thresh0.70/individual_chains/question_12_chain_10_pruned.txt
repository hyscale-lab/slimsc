Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and it's about figuring out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999. The second condition is that when I read the numbers top to bottom, their sum should be 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, which means there are 2 rows and 3 columns. So, the grid looks like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Each of these cells (a, b, c, d, e, f) needs to be filled with a digit from 0 to 9, right? Now, the problem is about forming numbers by reading left to right and top to bottom.

When reading left to right, I think each row forms a two-digit or three-digit number? Wait, no. Wait, the first row has three cells, so that would form a three-digit number. Similarly, the second row would also form a three-digit number. So, the sum of these two three-digit numbers should be 999.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me check the example they gave. The example grid is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

They say that 8 + 991 = 999, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe each row is a three-digit number, and their sum is 999. So, in the example, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999, which matches the condition.

Then, reading top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99. In the example, the first column is 0 and 9, making 09, which is 9. The second column is 0 and 9, making 09, which is 9. The third column is 8 and 1, making 81. So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which also matches the condition. Okay, so that's clear now.

So, the problem is to find the number of possible grids where:

1. The top row is a three-digit number, say ABC, and the bottom row is DEF. Then ABC + DEF = 999.
2. Each column is a two-digit number: AD, BE, CF. Then AD + BE + CF = 99.

Each cell (A to F) must be a digit (0-9). So, how do I approach this?

Let me write down the two conditions mathematically.

First condition: ABC + DEF = 999.

Since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, but ABC can be less than 100 if the first digit is zero. Similarly, DEF can be less than 100. But their sum is 999, which is a three-digit number. So, ABC and DEF can be thought of as three-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed.

Similarly, for the columns: AD, BE, CF, each is a two-digit number (with leading zeros allowed), and their sum is 99.

Let me express ABC, DEF, AD, BE, CF in terms of their digits.

ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C

DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F

AD = 10*A + D

BE = 10*B + E

CF = 10*C + F

So, the first condition is:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

Which can be rewritten as:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

The second condition is:

(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99.

Simplify that:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1. 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999. Let's call this Equation (1).

2. 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99. Let's call this Equation (2).

Hmm, so both equations involve the sums of the digits in different groupings. Maybe I can find some relationships between these sums.

Let me denote:

Let S1 = A + D,

S2 = B + E,

S3 = C + F.

Then Equation (1) becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

And Equation (2):

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But A + B + C is the sum of the top row digits, and D + E + F is the sum of the bottom row digits.

Wait, but from the first condition, S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F).

Which is exactly the sum in Equation (2). Let me denote S = S1 + S2 + S3 = (A
