Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it through again and try to understand what it's asking for.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and they're all indistinguishable except for their color. The task is to place some of these chips on a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. Now, there are some conditions:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Once we place some chips, if we try to add any more, it would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

And we need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm. So, the key here is that each row and each column must be monochromatic—either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no, because you can have some rows without any chips and some with all white or all black.

Wait, the problem says "some of these chips"—so we don't have to fill all cells. But the condition is that any additional chip would violate the row or column conditions. So, the placement must be such that it's already maximal—meaning you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column uniformity.

So, how do I model this?

Let me think of each row and column as being either white, black, or empty. But wait, no. Because in a row, if you place a chip, it must all be the same color. So, maybe each row is either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be either white, black, or empty.

But the problem is that when you have both row and column constraints, it's a bit more complicated. Because the color of a cell is determined by both its row and its column. So, for a cell at (i, j), the color must be the same as the color of row i and the color of column j. Therefore, row i's color and column j's color must agree for all cells (i,j) that are filled.

Wait, but if row i is white, then any cell in that row must be white. But if column j is black, then any cell in that column must be black. So, if row i is white and column j is black, the cell (i,j) must be
