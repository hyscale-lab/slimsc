Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable within their colors. We need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, after placing the chips, any extra chip we try to add would violate the first two conditions. So, the placement has to be such that it's maximal in some way—it can't have any more chips placed without breaking the row or column color rules.

Hmm, okay. So each row must be all one color or none. Similarly, each column must be all one color or none. But since each cell can have at most one chip, a row or column can't have more than one chip unless it's entirely filled with that color.

Wait, no. Wait, each cell can have at most one chip. So if a row is all white, then each cell in that row would have a white chip. But we only have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. So, if a row is all white, that uses 5 white chips. Similarly, a column can't be all white because that would require 5 white chips in that column.

Wait, but each cell is either in a row and a column. So if a row is all white, then those cells in that row are in various columns. So the columns that intersect with this all-white row must either also be all white or else have no chips. Because if a column has a white chip in the row that's all white, then the rest of the column can't have any chips because they can't be a different color. So the column would have to be all white as well.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think.

Each row must be monochromatic (all one color or empty), and each column must be monochromatic as well. Also, the placement is maximal—meaning adding any chip would violate the row or column conditions.

So, to maximize the number of chips, each row and column that we choose to place chips must be filled entirely
