Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a game theory problem, specifically involving the concept of winning and losing positions. I remember that in such games, a position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, I need to figure out for which n Bob can make Alice face a losing position on her first move, and then maintain that throughout the game.

Let me start by analyzing small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 1, and Bob takes it to win. So Alice would not do that. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, no, if n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4 because there are only 2 tokens. So she takes 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob takes that 1 and wins. So for n=2, Bob can win. Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1 for Bob, Bob takes it and wins. So Alice can't let Bob take the last token. Wait, so if n=2, Alice can't take 4, so she takes 1, and Bob takes the last one and wins. So Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting the initial analysis wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the game as a series of positions where each position is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the current player.

Let me try to list n from 0 upwards and label each as W or L.

n=0: Well, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So the
