Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular octagon, each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. We need to find the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the original red vertices were. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let's break it down.

First, a regular octagon has 8 vertices, right? So, each vertex can be either red or blue. Since each color is equally likely, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the question is about the probability that there exists a rotation which maps the blue vertices to the red ones. Wait, let me make sure I understand: after some rotation, each blue vertex should be where a red vertex was originally. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blue ones should align with the original red positions.

Hmm, so this is similar to saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, rotations correspond to symmetries in the dihedral group. But maybe I can think in terms of group actions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this with permutation. Each rotation corresponds to a cyclic permutation of the vertices. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the blue set must be a shifted version of the red set.

But since each vertex is colored independently, the red and blue sets are subsets of the 8 vertices. So, the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of the blue set as a shifted version of the red set. So, for each possible rotation, we can check if the blue set matches the red set shifted by that rotation. But since rotations are cyclic, maybe the blue set must be a shifted version by some k steps.

Wait, but for each coloring, we can rotate it by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps and see if any rotation transforms the blue set into the red set.

But that seems a bit complicated. Maybe another approach: the problem is equivalent to saying that the
