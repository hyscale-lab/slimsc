Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find AP in terms of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. So, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. So, I remember that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC. 

Point D is where these two tangents meet. So, D is the intersection of the tangent at B and the tangent at C. From properties of circles, I recall that the point where two tangents intersect is called the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the two circles if considering the circle with two tangents. But in this case, since it's a single circle, D is just the point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle.

Next, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line through D, and it meets the circle again at P. The goal is to find the length of AP.

Given the sides of triangle ABC: AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. So, triangle ABC has sides of lengths 5, 9, 10. Let me note that these sides satisfy the triangle inequality, so the triangle is valid.

I think I need to find the coordinates of these points or use some theorems related to circles, tangents, and intersecting chords. Alternatively, maybe power of a point could be useful here since we're dealing with tangents and intersections with circles.

Let me recall the power of a point theorem. If a line passes through a point outside a circle and intersects the circle at two points, then the product of the distances from the point to each intersection point is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from the point to the circle. In formula terms, for point D outside the circle, the power with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA, but wait, no. Wait, point D is outside, so the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB², since DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, DC² is also equal to DB² because both are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, but actually, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω, so DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

So, for point D, the power with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Wait, because AD passes through the circle at P and A, so DP * DA would be the power of D with respect to ω. But isn't DA the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P? Wait, no, actually, when you have a secant, the power is DP * DQ, where P and Q are the two intersection points. But in this case, AD passes through A and P, so perhaps the power is AP * AD? Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² because DB is the tangent. Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D is equal to DP * DA. But wait, no. The power of a point outside the circle for a secant is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point. So, if you have a point D outside the circle, and a line through D intersects the circle at points X and Y, then the power is DX * DY.

In this case, the line AD passes through D and intersects the circle at A and P. So, the power of D is DA * DP. But DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Wait, but if A is on the circle, then DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

Wait, no. The power of D is actually DB² = DA * DP. Because the two tangent lengths from D to the circle are equal, and for the secant, it's the product of the entire secant length (from D to the far intersection) and the external part.

Wait, hold on, I think I might be mixing up the parts. The power of D is equal to DB² = DC², which is also equal to DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A (the near point) and DP is from D to P (the far point). So, DA * DP = DB².

Wait, but DA is from D to A, which is on the circle, so that's just DA, and DP is from D to P, which is the other intersection. So, the formula is DA * DP = DB². Therefore, DP = DB² / DA.

But I need to find AP, which is the distance from A to P. So, AP is the segment from A to P on the circle. If I can express AP in terms of DA and DP, that could be useful.

Wait, AP is equal to DP - DA? No, that can't be, because D is outside the circle, A is on the circle, and P is another point on the circle. So, the order along the line AD is D, then A, then P. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, which is DA + AP. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, DA * (DA + AP) = DB².

So, that gives us DA² + DA * AP = DB². Therefore, DA * AP = DB² - DA². Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or projective geometry? Or maybe coordinate geometry? Since I have specific lengths, maybe coordinate geometry could work.

Let me see. Let's try setting up coordinate axes. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since AC=10, I can place point A at (10, 0). Point B is somewhere in the plane, and we know AB=5 and BC=9.

So, let me define coordinates:

Let me set C at (0,0), A at (10,0), and B at (x,y). Then, the distances are:

AB = 5: distance between A(10,0) and B(x,y) is 5.

So, sqrt[(x - 10)^2 + (y)^2] = 5.

BC = 9: distance between B(x,y) and C(0,0) is 9.

So, sqrt[(x)^2 + (y)^2] = 9.

AC is 10, already set.

So, I have two equations:

1. (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25
2. x^2 + y^2 = 81

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

x^2 + y^2 - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25
x^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56
x^2 - x^2 + 20x -100 = 56
20x = 156
x = 156 / 20 = 39 / 5 = 7.8

So, x is 7.8, which is 39/5.

Now, substitute x into equation 2 to find y.

x^2 + y^2 = 81

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81

Calculating (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, 5^2=25, so 1521/25 = 60.84.

So, y^2 = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16.

20.16 is equal to 2016/100, which simplifies. Let me compute 2016 divided by 16: 2016 /16 = 126. So, 2016/100 = 126/6.25. Hmm, perhaps it's better to keep it as a fraction.

Wait, 81 is 81/1, 60.84 is 6084/100. Let me write them as fractions:

81 = 8100/100.

So, y^2 = 8100/100 - 6084/100 = (8100 - 6084)/100 = 2016/100 = 504/25.

So, y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504):

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Wait, 504 divided by 4 is 126, which is 9*14. So, 504 = 4 * 9 * 14 = 4 * 9 * 14. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(4*9*14) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6 sqrt(14). Therefore, sqrt(504)/5 = 6 sqrt(14)/5.

So, y = 6 sqrt(14)/5. Since the triangle is drawn with point B above the x-axis, y is positive.

So, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6 sqrt(14)/5).

So, now I have coordinates for points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6 sqrt(14)/5), and C(0,0).

Next, I need to find the tangents from D to ω at points B and C. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, perhaps I can find the equations of these tangents and then find their intersection point D.

The tangent at B to ω: since ω is the circumcircle of ABC, I need to find the equation of the tangent at B. Similarly, the tangent at C.

But first, I need the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since points A, B, and C lie on ω, I can find the equation using their coordinates.

Given points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Let's plug in the points.

For point C(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Now plug in point A(10,0):

10² + 0 + D*10 + E*0 = 0 => 100 + 10 D = 0 => 10 D = -100 => D = -10.

Now, the equation is x² + y² -10x + Ey = 0.

Now plug in point B(39/5,6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) = 0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

E*(6√14/5) is the term with E.

So, putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14/5) E = 0.

Combine the fractions:

(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14/5) E = 0.

Which simplifies to:

3 + (6√14/5) E = 0.

Solve for E:

(6√14/5) E = -3 => E = (-3) * (5)/(6√14) = (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14). Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

E = (-5√14)/(2*14) = (-5√14)/28.

So, the equation of the circle ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14)/28 y = 0.

Wait, let me write that as:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28) y = 0.

Alternatively, we can write it in standard form by completing the squares.

But perhaps I don't need to for finding the tangent equations.

The tangent to the circle at a point (x1,y1) is given by:

xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.

Wait, another formula for the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is:

x x1 + y y1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F = 0.

Let me confirm: the standard equation for the tangent at (x1,y1) on circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F = 0.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for point B(39/5, 6√14/5), the tangent line equation is:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y + 6√14/5)/2 = 0.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute each term step by step.

First, the equation is:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x + 39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y + 6√14/5)/2 = 0.

Simplify term by term.

First term: (39/5)x

Second term: (6√14/5)y

Third term: (-10)/2 * (x + 39/5) = (-5)(x + 39/5) = -5x - 39.

Fourth term: (-5√14/28)/2 * (y + 6√14/5) = (-5√14/56)(y + 6√14/5).

Let me compute the fourth term:

Multiply out:

(-5√14/56)y - (5√14/56)*(6√14/5)

Simplify each part:

First part: (-5√14/56)y

Second part: (-5√14 * 6√14) / (56 * 5)

Multiply numerator: (-5*6)*(√14*√14) = (-30)*(14) = -420.

Denominator: 56*5=280.

So, second part is (-420)/280 = -3/2.

So, the fourth term becomes (-5√14/56)y - 3/2.

Putting all the terms together:

First term: (39/5)x

Second term: (6√14/5)y

Third term: -5x -39

Fourth term: (-5√14/56)y - 3/2

Now, combine all like terms.

For x terms:

(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 - 25/5)x = (14/5)x

For y terms:

(6√14/5)y + (-5√14/56)y = Let's find a common denominator. 5 and 56 have LCM of 280.

Convert 6√14/5 to 336√14/280 and -5√14/56 to (-25√14)/280.

So, 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280.

So, (311√14/280)y.

Constant terms:

-39 - 3/2 = (-78/2 -3/2) = (-81/2)

So, the equation is:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2 = 0

Multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:

14/5 x *280 = 14 *56 x = 784x

311√14/280 y *280 = 311√14 y

-81/2 *280 = -81*140= -11340.

So, equation becomes:

784x + 311√14 y -11340 = 0.

That's the equation of the tangent at point B.

Similarly, I can find the equation of the tangent at point C.

Point C is at (0,0). Using the tangent formula at (x1,y1)=(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + (-10)*(x + 0)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y + 0)/2 + 0 = 0.

Simplify:

0 + 0 + (-10/2)x + (-5√14/28/2)y = 0.

Which is:

-5x - (5√14/56)y = 0.

Multiply both sides by -56 to eliminate denominators:

280x +5√14 y =0.

So, the tangent at C is 280x +5√14 y =0.

Now, I have two equations for the tangents at B and C:

1. Tangent at B: 784x + 311√14 y = 11340

2. Tangent at C: 280x +5√14 y =0

We need to find their intersection point D.

So, I have two equations:

784x + 311√14 y = 11340 ...(1)

280x +5√14 y =0 ...(2)

Let me solve equation (2) for x in terms of y.

From equation (2): 280x = -5√14 y => x = (-5√14 y)/280 = (-√14 y)/56.

So, x = (-√14 /56)y.

Now, substitute x into equation (1):

784*(-√14 /56)y + 311√14 y = 11340.

Simplify each term:

784 /56 = 14.

So, 14*(-√14)y + 311√14 y = 11340.

Factor out √14 y:

√14 y (-14 + 311) = 11340.

Compute (-14 +311)=297.

So, √14 y *297 = 11340.

Solve for y:

y = 11340 / (297√14)

Simplify the fraction 11340 /297:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9:

11340 ÷9=1260; 297 ÷9=33.

So, 1260/33. Again, divide numerator and denominator by 3:

1260 ÷3=420; 33 ÷3=11.

So, 420/11.

So, y= (420/11)/√14 = (420)/(11√14).

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

y = (420√14)/(11*14) = (420√14)/(154).

Simplify 420 and 154: both divisible by 14.

420 ÷14=30; 154 ÷14=11.

So, y= (30√14)/11.

Now, substitute back into x = (-√14 /56)y:

x = (-√14 /56)*(30√14/11) = (-√14 *30√14)/(56*11).

Compute numerator: √14 *√14=14, so 30*14=420.

Denominator: 56*11=616.

So, x= -420/616.

Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 28.

420 ÷28=15; 616 ÷28=22.

So, x= -15/22.

Thus, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I have coordinates for A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11). I need to find the equation of line AD to find where it intersects the circle ω again at point P.

First, find the parametric equations or the slope of line AD.

Compute the slope of AD:

Slope m = (yD - yA)/(xD - xA) = (30√14/11 - 0)/(-15/22 -10).

Compute denominator: -15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = (-235)/22.

So, slope m = (30√14/11) / (-235/22) = (30√14/11) * (22/-235) = (30√14 *2)/ (-235) = (60√14)/(-235).

Simplify:

60 and 235 have a GCD of 5: 60 ÷5=12; 235 ÷5=47.

So, m= (-12√14)/47.

So, the slope is (-12√14)/47.

Now, equation of line AD: Using point A(10,0):

y -0 = m(x -10)

So, y = [(-12√14)/47](x -10).

Now, need to find intersection point P of this line with circle ω, other than A.

The circle ω has equation x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

We can substitute y from the line equation into the circle's equation.

Let me write y = [(-12√14)/47](x -10).

Let me denote m = (-12√14)/47 for simplicity.

So, y = m(x -10).

Substitute into the circle equation:

x² + [m(x -10)]² -10x - (5√14/28)[m(x -10)] =0.

This will give a quadratic equation in x, which we can solve. Since A(10,0) is on both the line and the circle, x=10 will be one solution, and the other solution will be the x-coordinate of P.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute [m(x -10)]²:

m² (x -10)^2.

m = (-12√14)/47, so m² = (144 *14)/47² = (2016)/2209.

So, [m(x -10)]² = (2016/2209)(x -10)^2.

Next, compute -(5√14/28)*m(x -10):

First, compute (5√14/28)*m:

(5√14/28)*(-12√14/47) = (5*(-12)*(14))/ (28*47) )= (-60*14)/(28*47).

Simplify:

14/28=1/2. So, (-60*(1/2))/47= (-30)/47.

Thus, -(5√14/28)*m(x -10) = - [ (-30)/47 ] (x -10) = (30/47)(x -10).

Now, putting all terms into the circle equation:

x² + (2016/2209)(x -10)^2 -10x + (30/47)(x -10) =0.

This is a bit complex, but let's expand and simplify.

First, expand (x -10)^2: x² -20x +100.

So, (2016/2209)(x² -20x +100).

Similarly, (30/47)(x -10)= (30/47)x - 300/47.

Now, write all terms:

x² + (2016/2209)x² - (2016/2209)*20x + (2016/2209)*100 -10x + (30/47)x - 300/47 =0.

Combine like terms:

1. x² terms: 1 + 2016/2209 = (2209 + 2016)/2209 = 4225/2209.

2. x terms: (-2016*20)/2209 x -10x + (30/47)x.

Compute each coefficient:

First term: (-40320)/2209.

Second term: -10x = (-10*47)/47 x = (-470)/47 x = (-470*47)/ (47*47) x = (-22090)/2209 x (Wait, perhaps better to convert all to denominator 2209).

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert all x coefficients to the same denominator.

Compute:

-40320/2209 x -10x +30/47 x.

Convert -10x to over 2209:

-10x = (-10 *2209)/2209 x = (-22090)/2209 x.

30/47 x = (30 *47)/ (47 *47) x = 1410/2209 x.

So, summing all x coefficients:

(-40320 -22090 +1410)/2209 = (-40320 -22090 = -62410; -62410 +1410 = -61000)/2209.

So, x term: (-61000)/2209 x.

3. Constant terms: (2016/2209)*100 - 300/47.

Compute each:

(2016*100)/2209 = 201600/2209.

-300/47 = (-300 *47)/ (47*47) = (-14100)/2209.

So, sum: 201600/2209 -14100/2209 = (201600 -14100)/2209 = 187500/2209.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

(4225/2209)x² + (-61000/2209)x + 187500/2209 =0.

Multiply both sides by 2209 to eliminate denominators:

4225x² -61000x +187500 =0.

That's a quadratic in x.

Let me write it as:

4225x² -61000x +187500=0.

I can divide all terms by 25 to simplify:

4225/25 =169; 61000/25=2440; 187500/25=7500.

So, equation becomes:

169x² -2440x +7500=0.

Let me solve this quadratic equation.

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac = (2440)^2 -4*169*7500.

First, compute 2440^2:

2440^2 = (2400 +40)^2 =2400² +2*2400*40 +40²=5,760,000 +192,000 +1,600=5,953,600.

Now compute 4*169*7500:

4*169=676; 676*7500=5,070,000.

So, discriminant D =5,953,600 -5,070,000=883,600.

Square root of D: sqrt(883600)=940.

So, solutions x=(2440 ±940)/(2*169).

Compute numerator:

2440 +940=3380; 2440-940=1500.

So, x=(3380)/(338)= (3380 ÷ 338) Wait, 2*169=338.

Wait, 3380 /338=10, because 338*10=3380.

Similarly, 1500/338: can we simplify?

1500 and 338: 338=2*169=2*13².

1500 divided by 2 is 750, 338 divided by 2 is 169.

So, 1500/338=750/169.

So, the two solutions are x=10 and x=750/169.

Since point A is at x=10, the other intersection P must be at x=750/169.

Now, find the corresponding y-coordinate for P.

Using the equation of line AD: y = m(x -10), where m=(-12√14)/47.

So, y= (-12√14/47)(750/169 -10).

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750-1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, y= (-12√14/47)*(-940/169).

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

Numerators: (-12)(-940)=11,280.

Denominator:47*169=47*13²=47*169=7943.

So, y=11,280√14 /7943.

Simplify 11,280 and7943.

Let me see if they have a common factor. 7943 divided by 47 is 169, because 47*169=7943.

11,280 divided by 47: 47*240=11,280. So, 11,280/47=240.

So, y=240√14 /169.

Thus, point P has coordinates (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, I need to find AP, the distance between points A(10,0) and P(750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the differences:

Δx =750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (-940)/169.

Δy=240√14/169 -0=240√14/169.

So, AP = sqrt[ (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ].

Compute (Δx)^2 = (940/169)^2 = (940^2)/(169^2).

(Δy)^2 = (240√14)^2/(169^2) = (240^2 *14)/(169^2).

So, AP^2 = [940² +240² *14]/(169²).

Compute numerator:

940²: 940*940. Let me compute 900²=810,000, 40²=1600, and 2*900*40=72,000. So, (900+40)^2=810,000 +72,000 +1,600= 883,600.

240^2=57,600. 57,600 *14=806,400.

So, numerator=883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.

So, AP^2=1,690,000/(169^2)=1,690,000/(28561).

Simplify:

1,690,000 divided by 28561.

But 28561 is 169^2, which is 13^4.

1,690,000 =1,690 *1000= (169 *10) *1000=169*10,000.

So, 1,690,000=169*10,000.

So, AP^2= (169*10,000)/(169^2)=10,000/169.

Thus, AP= sqrt(10,000/169)=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

As a fraction, 100 and13 are coprime, so m=100, n=13. Thus, m +n=113.


The problem involves finding the length of segment \( AP \) in triangle \( ABC \) with sides \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \). The triangle is inscribed in a circle \( \omega \), and point \( D \) is the intersection of the tangents to \( \omega \) at \( B \) and \( C \). The line \( AD \) intersects \( \omega \) again at \( P \). 

Using coordinate geometry, the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are determined, and the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \) are found. Solving these equations gives the coordinates of point \( D \). The equation of line \( AD \) is then derived, and its intersection with the circumcircle \( \omega \) (other than \( A \)) is found to be point \( P \). 

Finally, the distance \( AP \) is calculated using the distance formula, resulting in \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \). Therefore, \( m = 100 \) and \( n = 13 \), giving \( m + n = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
