Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk and coffee stop. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because word problems can be tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop. Her walking speed is given as 's' kilometers per hour. When she walks at this speed, the total time she takes is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to 's + 2' km/h, her walking time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. The question is asking, what is the total time she takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find out her walking time when her speed is 's + 1/2' km/h. But to do that, I think I need to first figure out what 's' is, the original speed. Because once I know 's', I can calculate the time for the new speed.

Wait, but there's also 't' involved. So, the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee stop time. So, for each scenario, the total time is walking time plus 't' minutes. But since the problem gives the total time including 't', I can set up equations to solve for 's' and 't'.

Let me write down what I know:

1. Distance walked = 9 km.
2. At speed 's' km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. This includes walking time plus 't' minutes.
3. At speed 's + 2' km/h, total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Again, this includes walking time plus 't' minutes.
4. Need to find the total time when speed is 's + 1/2' km/h, including 't'.

So, let me denote the walking time without the coffee stop as 't_walk'. Then, the total time would be t_walk + t_coffee, where t_coffee is 't' minutes. But in the problem, the total time is given as including 't', so that's how I can set up the equations.

Wait, but the units need to be consistent. The speed is in km/h, so the walking time should be in hours. So, maybe it's better to convert everything into hours or minutes. Let me think.

Let's convert everything into hours because the speed is in km/h. So, 4 hours is just 4. 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours. And 't' minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the first scenario:

Walking time is (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours.

Total time = walking time + coffee time. So,

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, the second scenario:

Walking time is 9/(s+2) hours.

Total time is 2.4 hours, so,

9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 't':

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Factor out 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2):

That's (s+2 - s)/(s(s+2)) ) = 2/(s(s+2))

So, we have:

9*(2)/(s(s+2)) = 1.6

Simplify numerator:

18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6

So,

18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s+2):

1.6 s(s+2) = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So,

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, let's write this as:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

To make it easier, maybe multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 * 10 is 16, 3.2 *10 is 32, 18*10 is 180. So,

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Hmm, this quadratic equation can be simplified. Let me see if all coefficients are divisible by a common factor. 16, 32, and 180 are all divisible by 4.

Divide by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

So, 4s² +8s -45=0.

Now, to solve for 's', we can use the quadratic formula.

The quadratic is 4s² +8s -45=0. So, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

Square root of D is sqrt(784)=28.

So, solutions:

s = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-8 ±28]/(8)

So, two solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s=2.5 km/h.

So, Aya's original walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't'. Using the first equation:

9/s + t/60 = 4

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply 60:

t = 0.4*60 =24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.

So, her new speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which is walking time + coffee time.

Walking time is distance/speed = 9 km /3 km/h = 3 hours.

Plus coffee time, which is 24 minutes. So,

3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes.

But the problem asks for the number of minutes, including 't' minutes. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 is 204 minutes.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.

Wait, let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, determining 's' was correct. We had two equations and solved for 's' correctly, ending up with s=2.5 km/h. Then, using that to find 't' as 24 minutes. Then, for the new speed, s + 0.5 =3 km/h, so walking time is 9/3=3 hours, adding 24 minutes gives 3h24m, which is 204 minutes. Yeah, that seems right.

I think I got it.


Aya's walking speed is determined by solving the equations derived from the given scenarios. The original speed is found to be 2.5 km/h, with a coffee stop of 24 minutes. When walking at 3 km/h, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

\boxed{204}
