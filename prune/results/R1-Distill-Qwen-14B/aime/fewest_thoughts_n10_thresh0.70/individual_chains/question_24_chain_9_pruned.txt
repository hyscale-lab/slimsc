Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll take each condition one by one and see how they can help me construct the list.

Starting with the first condition: the sum is 30. So whatever numbers I choose, their total must add up to 30.

Second condition: the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently. And it's unique, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list. That means I need at least two 9s because otherwise, every number would appear once, and there wouldn't be a mode. But wait, if there are two 9s, there might be other numbers with two appearances, making the mode not unique. Hmm, so I have to make sure that 9 appears more times than any other number.

So, maybe three 9s? Because if another number appears twice, then 9 would still be the unique mode. Let's keep that in mind.

Third condition: the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Median is the middle number when the list is ordered. So for a list with an odd number of elements, it's the middle one; for even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But here, the median is a positive integer not in the list. That's interesting.

Wait, if the median is not in the list, then for an even-length list, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer not present in the list. Alternatively, for an odd-length list, the middle number would have to be an integer not present in the list, which is impossible because the list is made up of integers and the median is one of them. So, wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, say n is odd, then the median is the (n+1)/2-th term. Since the list is made of integers, that median must be an integer. But the problem says that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. That seems impossible because if the list is ordered, the median is one of the elements. So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which might not be an integer in the list.

Wait, no, the median can be an integer even if the average of two middle numbers is an integer. For example, if you have two even numbers, their average is an integer. So, for example, the list [2,4], the median is 3, which isn't in the list. So, that's possible.

So, the list must have an even number of elements because if it's odd, the median would be an element of the list, but in this case, the median is an integer not in the list. So, the list must have even length. So let's say the length is 2k, so the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

So, our list has an even number of elements, and the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not in the list.

Let me think about how the numbers are arranged. Since the mode is 9, it appears more than any other number. So, the list should have several 9s, but to keep the sum low (30), maybe not too many.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Determine the number of elements in the list. It must be even.

2. The mode is 9, so 9 appears more times than any other number.

3. The sum of all numbers is 30.

4. The median is an integer not in the list, which suggests that the two middle numbers average to that integer, which isn't present.

So, let's think about how many 9s we need. Let's say n is the number of elements. Since the mode is 9, it must appear at least twice, but possibly more.

Wait, but if it's the unique mode, it should appear more times
