Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me parse this step by step. First, the variables are nonnegative integers, which is important because it restricts the kind of solutions we can have. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more complex—it's a combination of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. 

I remember that sometimes, for symmetric equations, it's helpful to consider symmetric functions or try to factor expressions. Let me see if I can rewrite the second equation in a more manageable form.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Oh, I notice that each term is of the form x²y where x and y are different variables. So, maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out common terms. Let me see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, the entire expression can be written as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, then (b + c) is (300 - a), (a + c) is (300 - b), and (a + b) is (300 - c). So, substituting these into the expression, we have:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.

So, the second equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, interesting. So, I can rewrite the equation as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Now, maybe I can express this in terms of the known sum a + b + c = 300. Let me see if I can relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to this sum.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 300, then (300)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).

But I don't have ab + bc + ac in my second equation. Hmm. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc. These are the standard symmetric sums. Maybe I can express the second equation in terms of S, Q, and P.

Let me try that. So, the second equation after substitution is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

First, let's express a² + b² + c². From earlier, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) becomes 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Now, what about a³ + b³ + c³? I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S, Q, and P.

The formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

So, substituting that in, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

300³ is 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Now, putting it all together into the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = (27,000,000 - 600Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute that:

27,000,000 - 600Q -27,000,000 + 900Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600Q +900Q) -3P = 6,000,000.

So, that's 0 + 300Q -3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, now we have:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Now, since P = abc, which is a product of nonnegative integers, it must be nonnegative. So, 100Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → 100Q ≥ 2,000,000 → Q ≥ 20,000.

So, Q must be at least 20,000.

But I also know that Q is ab + bc + ac. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, what is the maximum possible
