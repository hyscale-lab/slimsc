Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, each side has 8 units, so to get from the start to the end, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the problem mentions paths of length 16.

Now, changing direction exactly four times. So, a path that moves only right and up can change direction each time it switches from right to up or up to right. Each change in direction is a turn. So, for example, if I go right, right, up, up, right, right, that's two direction changes: first from right to up, then back to right.

Wait, but in that example, how many direction changes are there? Let's see: starting right, then up—that's one change. Then back to right—that's the second change. So in that case, two direction changes. So, each time the direction switches, it's a change.

So, in this problem, we need paths that change direction exactly four times. So, how does that translate to the number of runs or segments in each direction?

Let me think. Each direction change adds a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments do you have?

Let's see: each change adds a new segment. So, starting with the first segment, each direction change adds one more. So four changes would mean five segments. For example, one change leads to two segments, two changes lead to three, etc. So yes, four changes lead to five segments.

Now, these five segments are alternations between moving right and moving up. So, depending on whether the first segment is to the right or up, the number of segments in each direction will vary.

Wait, since the path has to end at the upper right corner, which is at (8,8), and starting at (0,0), the number of right and up moves must each be 8. So, the total number of right moves is 8, and the same for up moves.

So, if we have five segments, each segment is a consecutive run of right or up moves. Since we have four direction changes, the path alternates between right and up. So, the number of right segments and up segments can be either three right and two up or two right and three up.

Wait, let me think: if you have five segments, and the path starts with right, then the segments go right, up, right, up, right. That's three right segments and two up segments.

Alternatively, if it starts with up, then the segments are up, right, up, right, up. That's three up segments and two right segments.

So, total, if we have four direction changes,
