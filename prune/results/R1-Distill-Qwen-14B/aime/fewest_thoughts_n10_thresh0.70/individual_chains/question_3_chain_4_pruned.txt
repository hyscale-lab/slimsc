Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize (at least two numbers match). Since winning the grand prize automatically means she also won a prize, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is denoted as C(10,4). I can calculate this using the combination formula:

C(n,k) = n! / (k! (n - k)! )

So, C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible ways for the lottery numbers to be chosen.

Jen picks 4 specific numbers. Let's denote her chosen set as J = {a, b, c, d}, where each is a unique number from 1 to 10.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize, P(A), is the probability that all four numbers chosen by the lottery match J. Since there's only one such winning combination, that's 1 out of 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, we need to find the probability that she wins a prize, P(B). Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This includes scenarios where exactly 2, 3, or all 4 of her numbers are selected. So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these three events.

Let me compute each of these probabilities.

1. Exactly 2 numbers match: The number of ways to choose exactly 2 numbers from J and 2 from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). The number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2) * C(6,2). Similarly, the probability is [C(4,2) * C(6,2)] / C(10,4).

2. Exactly 3 numbers match: Similarly, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,3) * C(6,1). Probability is [C(4,3) * C(6,1)] / C(10,4).

3. Exactly 4 numbers match: We already know this is 1, so probability is 1/210.

Wait, actually, for P(B), I don't need to compute the probability each separately. Instead, I can compute the total number of favorable outcomes for at least 2 matches and then divide by the total number of possible outcomes (210).

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for at least 2 matches is:

Number of ways to choose exactly 2 matches + exactly 3 matches + exactly 4 matches.

Let me compute each:

- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = (6) * (15) = 90.

- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = (4) * (6) = 24.

- Exactly 4 matches: 1 (since all four must be chosen).

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Hmm. But the total possible combinations are 210. So, the number of favorable for B is 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. 6 *15 =90.

C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6. 4*6=24.

C(4,4) is 1, C(6,0) is 1. 1*1=1.

So, 90 +24 +1=115. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Wait, 42 and 23 have no common factors, so yes, 23/42 is the simplified form.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think. If I'm computing P(B) as 115/210, which is equal to 23/42.

But now, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the probability is 1/115.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me re-express the problem.
