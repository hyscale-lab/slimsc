Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h, taking her 4 hours including 't' minutes at the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, which takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same 't' minutes at the coffee shop. 

The question is asking me to find out how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time. 

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should focus on the walking part without the coffee shop time because the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both scenarios. Maybe I can find out what 's' is by comparing the two walking times.

Let me write down the information given.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours, which includes walking and coffee shop time (t minutes). So, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes.

Wait, but t is in minutes, and the speed is in hours. Maybe I should convert everything to the same units to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can express t in hours. Since t is in minutes, I can write it as t/60 hours. 

So, for the first scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = walking time + t/60 hours.

Walking time = total time - t/60 = 4 - (t/60) hours.

The distance she walks is 9 km, so using the formula:

Distance = speed × time
9 = s × (4 - t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So total time is 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours.

So, walking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Again, using the distance formula:
9 = (s + 2) × (2.4 - t/60)

Now I have two equations:

1) 9 = s*(4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)

I can set these equal to each other since both equal 9.

s*(4 - t/60) = (s + 2)*(2.4 - t/60)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: s*4 - s*(t/60) = 4s - (s t)/60

Right side: (s + 2)*2.4 - (s + 2)*(t/60) = 2.4s + 4.
