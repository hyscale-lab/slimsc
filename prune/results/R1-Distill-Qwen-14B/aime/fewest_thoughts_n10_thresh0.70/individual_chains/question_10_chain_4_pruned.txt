Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let's understand what Bob is doing. He's considering all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in Alice's set A. So for each element 'a' in A, Bob can create sets B where 'a' is the maximum. But each of these sets must be finite and non-empty, and every element in B must be a positive integer less than or equal to 'a'.

Wait, actually, the elements in B can be any positive integers, but the maximum has to be in A. So, for each 'a' in A, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is 'a' is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each such subset can be combined with 'a' to form a set B where 'a' is the maximum.

But wait, no. Because for each 'a', the number of possible sets where 'a' is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each subset corresponds to the elements less than 'a' in B. And each subset can be combined with 'a' to form B. Since B must be non-empty, we have to include the subset that's just {a} by itself.

The number of subsets of a set with 'n' elements is 2^n. So for each 'a' in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum 'a' is 2^{a-1}. Because the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} are 2^{a-1} in number, each of which can be combined with 'a' to form B.

So the total number of sets Bob can list is the sum over each 'a' in A of 2^{a-1}. It's given that this sum equals 2024.

So, mathematically, we can write:

Sum_{a âˆˆ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024

We need to find the sum of the elements of A, which is
