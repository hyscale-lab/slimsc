Alright, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because probability can get tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let me understand the problem. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is "winning the grand prize" and event B is "winning a prize." Since winning the grand prize means all four numbers match, which is a subset of winning a prize (since if all four match, then certainly at least two do), A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

Let me figure out how many possible ways there are for each of these events.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is the combination formula. Let me calculate that. C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total number of possible combinations is 210.

Now, event A: winning the grand prize. That happens only when all four numbers match. How many ways can that happen? Well, there's only one specific set of four numbers that she picked. So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, event B: winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, we need to find the number of ways that at least two of her four numbers are in the randomly chosen four. Hmm, calculating this directly might be a bit involved, so maybe it's easier to calculate the complement: 1 - P(less than two matches) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

Wait, but since we need the number of favorable outcomes for B, maybe it's better to compute it directly. Let me think.

Wait, no, actually, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that at least two of them are in Jen's chosen set of four. Alternatively, since the lottery picks 4 numbers, we can think about how many of these match Jen's numbers.

So, in combinatorics, the number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because we're choosing k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the 6 numbers not in Jen's set.

Therefore, for event B, which includes k=2,3,4, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term:

1. For k=2: C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.
2. For k=3: C(4,3) is 4, C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.
3. For k=4: C(4,4) is 1, C(6,0) is 1. So, 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115. Therefore, P(B) is 115 / 210.

Wait, let me confirm that. Because the total number of possible winning outcomes (for the lottery) is 210, and 115 of them result in at least two matches with Jen's numbers. So yes, P(B) = 115/210.

But wait, let me double-check that calculation because 115 seems a bit high for at least two matches. Let me compute the number of ways she can have 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Wait, another approach: The total number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers is 210. The number of ways that none of Jen's numbers are picked is C(6,4) = 15. The number of ways exactly one of Jen's numbers is picked is C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80. So, the number of ways with at least two matches is total minus none minus one: 210 - 15
