Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. They mention that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon means all sides are equal in length, and each internal angle is the same. But wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's just equilateral, so sides are equal but angles might not be. But they do mention that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel.

Given that, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. The triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's side length.

I remember that in such hexagons with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three parallelograms. Each pair of opposite sides is a pair of parallel sides of a parallelogram, and the other sides are the other pair of parallel sides. So, maybe I can model this hexagon as three parallelograms arranged around a common center?

Wait, another thought: when you extend the sides AB, CD, EF, they might form a larger triangle outside the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions would indeed form a triangle. So, perhaps the triangle is an outer triangle, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it.

I think the key is to recognize that the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. Because all the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle, the hexagon is a similar figure inside the triangle, scaled by some factor.

But wait, no. The hexagon isn't similar to the triangle. It's a hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. So, perhaps the triangle is related to the hexagon through homothety, a dilation transformation.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the triangle as a combination of the hexagon
