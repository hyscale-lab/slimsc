Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4.

Hmm, right. So z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. The expression involves both z and its reciprocal, 1/z. I need to find the maximum real part of the entire expression. That is, I need to maximize the real part of (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

First, let's recall that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by r squared. So, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2. Since |z| = 4, then |z|^2 = 16, so 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

So, I can rewrite the entire expression in terms of z and \overline{z}.

Let me denote z as 4e^{iθ}, since |z| = 4, it's convenient to write it in polar form. That way, z = 4e^{iθ}, and \overline{z} = 4e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (4e^{-iθ}) / 16.

Wait, wait, let me do that step by step.

First, (75 + 117i)z is (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}.

Second, (96 + 144i)/z is (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (96 + 144i)/(4) * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each term separately.

First, compute (75 + 117i) * 4:

75 * 4 = 300, 117 * 4 = 468. So the first term is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Similarly, (24 + 36i) is as it is multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it together:

E = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, since I'm interested in the real part of E, I can write E as a complex number and then take its real part.

But perhaps it's easier to express E in terms of sine and cosine.

Recall that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let me write each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, the last term is -468 sinθ.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Similarly, second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

So, putting it all together, E is:

[ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) ] + i [ (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) ]

Wait, no. Because E is the sum of the first term and the second term.

Wait, actually, E = first term + second term.

So, each term already has real and imaginary parts as I computed. So, I can add their real parts together and their imaginary parts together.

So, let's compute the real part:

Real part of first term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Real part of second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, total real part Re(E) = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ).

Similarly, the imaginary part Im(E) = (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

But since we only need Re(E), let's compute that first.

Compute Re(E):

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So our goal is to find the maximum value of Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ is the phase shift.
