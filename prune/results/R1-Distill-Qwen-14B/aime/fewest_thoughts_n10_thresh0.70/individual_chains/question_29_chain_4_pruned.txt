Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the setup. Since both ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, A, D, H, G are concyclic, which means they lie on a circle.

Let me note the given lengths. BC is 16, so in rectangle ABCD, BC is one side. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AD=BC=16, and AB=CD=107. So rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG=17 and EF=184. So EF is one side, FG is another. Therefore, EF=184, FG=17. So EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

Now, let's think about their positions. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line DEF C is a straight line. I think that D and C are adjacent vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent vertices of EFGH.

Wait, but ABCD is a rectangle, so the order of the vertices is important. Let me consider the rectangle ABCD. Let me label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, sides AB and CD are of length 107, and sides BC and AD are of length 16.

Similarly, for EFGH, the order is E, F, G, H. So sides EF and GH are 184, sides FG and EH are 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, let me think about their positions. So, perhaps the line is arranged as D-E-C-F or some other order. But since E and F are adjacent in EFGH, and D and C are adjacent in ABCD, maybe the line goes D-E-F-C? Or D-C-E-F? Wait, that might not make sense because E and F are adjacent. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the line is D-E-C-F, but that would make E and C adjacent, but E is part of EFGH. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to sketch a rough diagram.

Let me assume that the points are arranged as D-E-C-F on the straight line. So, starting from D, moving to E, then to C, then to F. That way, E is between D and C, and F is after C. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and E and F are adjacent, so EF is a side of the rectangle. So, if E is next to F on the line, that makes sense.

Wait, but in that case, EF is a horizontal side of the rectangle, so perhaps EFGH is placed such that EF is along the same line as D-E-C-F. Then, GH would be the other side of the rectangle, perpendicular to EF.

But then, H and G would be the other two vertices of EFGH, and since H and G are connected to E and F, their positions would be somewhere off the line D-E-C-F.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic. That's an important piece of information. Maybe I can use the cyclic quadrilateral properties here.

Let me note
