Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, interesting.

Let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each to be colored red or blue. Each color has a probability of 1/2. So, the total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon such that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, if I think about it, this means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, in other words, the colorings must be such that the blue points form a rotation of the red points.

Wait, but actually, the octagon is being rotated, so the blue points must be a rotationally shifted version of the red points. So, more precisely, the blue vertices must be a rotation of the red vertices by some number of steps. Since it's a regular octagon, the possible rotations are 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., up to 315째, which correspond to shifts by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 vertices respectively.

So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation (by some k steps) of the set of red vertices. But wait, the set of blue vertices is exactly the complement of the red vertices, right? Because each vertex is either red or blue. So, if the blue vertices are a rotation of the red vertices, then the red vertices must be a rotation of the blue vertices as well.

Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think. The octagon has rotational symmetry, so if B is the set of blue vertices, and R is the set of red vertices, then B is a rotation of R if there exists some k such that B = R shifted by k positions. But since B is the complement
