Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300 units long. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, first, let me visualize what's going on here. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a hexagon where each pair of opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Since it's equilateral, all sides have the same length, say 's', which I need to find.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF... I think these sides are not adjacent, so when extended, they form a triangle. Let me try to draw this mentally. Let's label the hexagon as ABCDEF, going around clockwise. So, AB is one side, BC is next, CD, DE, EF, FA.

Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Wait, noâ€”if it's a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. Wait, actually, I think I got that wrong. For a hexagon, each side has an opposite side. So, for side AB, the opposite side would be ED, right? Because moving three sides away. Similarly, BC is opposite to FE, and CD is opposite to AF. Hmm, maybe I should confirm that.

Alternatively, perhaps in a hexagon, the opposite sides are separated by two sides. So, for a convex hexagon ABCDEF, the opposite sides would be AB and ED, BC and FE, CD and AF. But I'm not too sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of their positions. So, AB is the first side, the opposite side would be the fourth one, which is DE. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA. That makes sense because in a regular hexagon, each side is opposite the one three steps away. So, yeah, opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, AB, CD, EF are three non-consecutive sides. Wait, AB is one side, CD is another, EF is the third. Extending these sides until they meet to form a triangle. Let me see: if I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, where would they meet?

Wait, maybe it's better to think about how these sides relate. Since AB, CD, EF are all being extended to form the triangle. So, each of these sides is a side of the hexagon, and when extended, they form the sides of a larger triangle.

I think the key here is that the triangle formed by these extensions has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. So, the triangle's sides are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, and the hexagon is convex, with opposite sides parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular. Hmm, but in a regular hexagon, the triangle formed by extending alternate sides (like AB, CD, EF) would be equilateral, but here it's a scalene triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. So, the hexagon isn't regular.

I need to find the side length 's' of the hexagon. Let
