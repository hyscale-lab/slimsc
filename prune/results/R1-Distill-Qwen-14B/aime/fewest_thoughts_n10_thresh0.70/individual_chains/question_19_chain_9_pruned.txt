Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm. Let's jot down what we know.

First, triangle ABC has circumradius R = 13. That means the radius of the circumscribed circle is 13. The inradius is r = 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and O is the circumcenter, where the perpendicular bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That seems like an important condition. Maybe there's a relationship or theorem that relates these two centers when such a perpendicularity holds?

I remember that in some cases, the Euler line connects several centers, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here because the Euler line connects the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter, not the incenter.

Wait, but maybe there's a formula or relation involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I think there's a formula connecting IO, the distance between I and O, with R and r. Let me recall.

Yes, I think the formula is IO² = R(R - 2r). Let me check if I remember correctly. So, IO squared equals R times (R minus twice r). So, plugging in R =13 and r =6, we get IO² =13*(13 - 12)=13*1=13. So, IO is sqrt(13). That might be useful later.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA ⊥ OI. Hmm, that suggests that triangle IAO is a right triangle at A. Wait, no. IA is perpendicular to OI, so OI is the hypotenuse, and IA and AO are the legs? Wait, let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then in triangle IAO, angle at A is 90 degrees. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at A.

So, by Pythagoras, in triangle IAO, we have:

IA² + AO² = IO².

Wait, but I know IO² is 13. So, IA² + AO² =13.

But IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. Wait, IA is not the inradius, though. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to the vertex. IA is the distance from I to A, which is a different length.

Hmm, so I need to find IA and AO in terms of other quantities.

Wait, AO is the distance from the circumcenter to vertex A. But since O is the circumradius, AO is just R, which is 1
