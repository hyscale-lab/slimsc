Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand what's going on.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She goes at a constant speed, s km per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including t minutes she spends at a coffee shop. Then, when she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, her walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same t minutes at the coffee shop.

The question is asking, what's the total time she takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the time taken when her speed is s + 0.5 km/h. To do that, I probably need to find the values of s and t first.

Let me write down what I know.

First scenario:
- Distance walked: 9 km
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes.

Wait, but wait. Is the total time 4 hours including the coffee shop time, or is the walking time 4 hours, separate from the coffee shop time? The wording says, "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, the total time from when she starts walking until she leaves the coffee shop is 4 hours, which includes both the time she spends walking and the t minutes in the shop.

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.

"the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." Hmm, maybe that means the time from leaving home to leaving the coffee shop is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee break.

Similarly, in the second scenario, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes. So, same thing.

So, the total time from start to finish is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes.

So, in both cases, the total time is the walking time plus the coffee time.

So, in the first scenario, walking time is when she's moving, and then she stops for t minutes.

So, I can model this. Let's see.

First scenario:
Walking time: (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours.

Plus coffee time: t minutes. But since the total time is given in hours, I should convert t minutes to hours. t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, total time is (9/s) + (t/60) = 4 hours.

Second scenario:
Speed is (s + 2) km/h.

Walking time: 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Plus coffee time: t/60 hours.

Total time: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So, now I have two equations:

1. (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2. (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Hmm, okay. So we have two equations with two variables, s and t. Let me write them out:

Equation 1: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
Equation 2: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

If I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I can eliminate t/60.

So:

[ (9/s) + (t/60) ] - [ (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) ] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify left side:

(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 1.6

Which becomes:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, now we have an equation only in terms of s.

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

First, factor out the 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

[ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So:

9 * [2 / (
