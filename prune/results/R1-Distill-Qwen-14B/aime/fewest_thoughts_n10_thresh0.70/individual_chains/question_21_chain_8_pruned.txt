Okay, so I have this problem about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

My goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such b-eautiful numbers.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's think about what a two-digit number in base b looks like. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, n = d1 * b + d0.

Since it's a two-digit number, d1 must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both d1 and d0 must be less than b (digits in base b can't exceed b-1). So, d1 ∈ {1, 2, ..., b-1} and d0 ∈ {0, 1, ..., b-1}.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d0, equals sqrt(n). So, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n = d1 * b + d0, substituting gives:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2 * d1 * d0 + d0^2 = d1 * b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

d1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 - d1b - d0 = 0

Hmm, maybe we can collect terms involving d1 and d0:

d1^2 + (2d0 - b) d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1. Alternatively, we can think of it as a quadratic in terms of d0 as well.

But perhaps it's easier to consider each possible pair (d1, d0) and see what conditions must hold for n to be a perfect square, with the sum of digits equal to its square root.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's denote s = d1 + d0. Then, s = sqrt(n) implies n = s^2. So, we have:

s^2 = d1 * b + d0

But since d1 and d0 are digits, d1 can range from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1. So, s must be an integer because sqrt(n) must be integer (since n is a perfect square).

So, s must be a positive integer. Let's think about possible s values.

Given that n is a two-digit number in base b, the minimal value of n is when d1=1 and d0=0: n = b. The maximal value is when d1 = b-1 and d0 = b-1: n = (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

So, n is in [b, b^2 - 1]. Therefore, sqrt(n) is in [sqrt(b), sqrt(b^2 - 1)] which is approximately [sqrt(b), b).

So, s = sqrt(n) must be an integer in [sqrt(b), b). Since s must be an integer, the minimal s is ceiling(sqrt(b)), and s can go up to b-1.

Wait, but s is also equal to d1 + d0. Since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, s is at least 1. But given that n is at least b, s is at least sqrt(b). So, s must be an integer greater than or equal to ceiling(sqrt(b)).

But let's get back. For each possible s, we can write n = s^2
