Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the torus T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles in both cases. Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres.

First, the equation of a torus can be described in 3D coordinates. If we consider the torus centered at the origin, the equation is:

(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2,

where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In our case, R is 6 and r is 3. So the equation becomes:

(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency lies on both surfaces, and their normals are the same at that point. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the same condition applies but in the opposite direction.

Wait, but the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle. So, the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when T rests on the outside of S, it's externally tangent along another circle.

So, for internal tangency, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, except for the circle where they touch. For external tangency, the torus encloses the sphere, touching along a circle.

But wait, actually, is that correct? Or does the torus, which is a donut shape, when inside the sphere, rest such that it's near the 'equator' of the torus, and when outside, it's somehow positioned differently?

I think I need to find the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to points on the torus. Because the sphere is centered at the origin, I assume. So the closest point on the torus to the origin would be R - r = 6 - 3 = 3 units away, and the
