Alright, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to parse this. So each of the eight vertices is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings in total.

We need to find the number of colorings such that there exists some rotation (i.e., by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.) that maps all the blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. Then, the probability would be that number divided by 256.

Wait, no, the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, that means for a given coloring, if you can rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, in other words, after rotation, all blue vertices are in red positions, and the red vertices are now where the blue ones were, except for the rotation.

Wait, actually, if I rotate the octagon, every vertex is moved to a new position. So, for the condition to hold, each blue vertex in the original coloring must be mapped via rotation to a position that was red. So, in the original coloring, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation (cyclic shift) of the set of red vertices.

Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me try another approach.

Suppose we have a coloring where some of the vertices are blue. We can rotate the octagon, and we want that after rotation, all the blue vertices are now on red positions. So, in the original coloring, the blue vertices must be exactly the positions that, when rotated, land on red vertices.

Wait, maybe another way: the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices' positions under some rotation.
