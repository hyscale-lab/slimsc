Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R, where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder. Finally, I have to compute Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I can start by considering numbers near 9999 and work my way down until I find one that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit of N to 1 should make the resulting number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), if you replace that digit with 1, the new number should be a multiple of 7.

Wait, but N itself doesn't have to be divisible by 7 necessarily, right? Only the numbers obtained by changing each digit to 1 must be divisible by 7. So, I need to ensure that for each digit position, replacing it with 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number, so N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 because it's a four-digit number.

Our goal is to find the largest N such that:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d is divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d is divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d is divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 is divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's denote each modified number as N_i where i is the digit being changed.

So, let's write each condition mathematically.

1. When a is changed to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
2. When b is changed to 1: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
3. When c is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.
4. When d is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, four congruence conditions.

I think it might be helpful to compute each modified number modulo 7 and set them equal to zero.

But first, perhaps I can compute the values modulo 7. Let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7, since these will be used in each condition.

Let me compute:

1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷7: 10-7=3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, now, let's plug these into each condition.

Condition 1: (1000*1 + 100b +10c +d) mod7 =0.

Substituting mod7 equivalents:

6*1 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, condition 2: (1000a +100*1 +10c +d) mod7=0.

Which is 6a +2*1 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Condition3: (1000a +100b +10*1 +d) mod7=0.

Which is 6a +2b +3*1 +d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Condition4: (1000a +100b +10c +1) mod7=0.

Which is 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now, I have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (1)
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (2)
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 --> Equation (4)

So, Equations (1)-(4) must all be satisfied.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

First, let's consider Equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (2): 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

(6a +2 +3c +d) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +2 -6 -2b ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6a -4 -2b ≡0 mod7.

Let me rearrange:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6a -2b ≡4 mod7. Let me note this as Equation (5).

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):

Equation (3): 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (1): 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting: (6a +2b +3 +d) - (6 +2b +3c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6a +3 -6 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6a -3 -3c ≡0 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3*(2a -1 -c) ≡0 mod7.

Since 3 and 7 are coprime, this implies 2a -1 -c ≡0 mod7.

So, 2a -c ≡1 mod7. Let me note this as Equation (6).

Similarly, let's look at Equations (3) and (4):

Equation (3): 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (4): 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract Equation (4) from Equation (3):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 3 +d -3c -1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

So, d -3c ≡-2 mod7, which is the same as d -3c ≡5 mod7. Let's note this as Equation (7).

Now, let's see Equations (1) and (4):

Equation (1): 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract Equation (4) from Equation (1):

(6 +2b +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6 +d -6a -1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is (5 -6a) +d ≡0 mod7.

So, -6a + d +5 ≡0 mod7.

Which is d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Let me note this as Equation (8).

So, now we have several equations:

Equation (5): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Equation (6): 2a -c ≡1 mod7.

Equation (7): d -3c ≡5 mod7.

Equation (8): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, perhaps I can express d in terms of a (Equation 8), c in terms of a (Equation 6), and then substitute into Equation (7) to find a relation between a and b.

Let's proceed step by step.

From Equation (6): c ≡2a -1 mod7.

From Equation (8): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

From Equation (7): d ≡3c +5 mod7.

Substituting c from Equation (6) into Equation (7):

d ≡3*(2a -1) +5 mod7.

Simplify: d ≡6a -3 +5 mod7.

Which is d ≡6a +2 mod7.

But from Equation (8), d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, 6a -5 ≡6a +2 mod7.

Subtract 6a from both sides: -5 ≡2 mod7.

Which is -5 -2 ≡0 mod7 → -7 ≡0 mod7, which is true.

So, the equations are consistent.

Now, let's move to Equation (5): 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can multiply by the inverse of 2 mod7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

So, 6a *4 ≡ (2b +4)*4 mod7.

Which is 24a ≡8b +16 mod7.

Simplify 24 mod7: 24 ÷7=3*7=21, 24-21=3 → 24≡3 mod7.

Similarly, 8 mod7=1, 16 mod7=2 (since 7*2=14, 16-14=2).

So, 3a ≡1b +2 mod7.

Which is 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, Equation (9): 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So, we have:

Equation (6): c = (2a -1) mod7.

Equation (8): d = (6a -5) mod7.

Equation (9): b = (3a -2) mod7.

So, now, we can express b, c, d in terms of a modulo7.

But since a is a digit from 1 to 9 (since N is a four-digit number, a can be 1-9), we can compute a, b, c, d as integers, but their residues mod7 are as above.

But perhaps I can find a in such a way that b, c, d are also digits (0-9).

Wait, but a is from 1 to 9, and when we compute b, c, d, they must also be digits (0-9). So, perhaps I can express b, c, d in terms of a, but ensuring that they are digits.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Given that a is a digit from 1 to 9, let's compute for each possible a (from 9 down to 1):

Compute b ≡3a -2 mod7.

Compute c ≡2a -1 mod7.

Compute d ≡6a -5 mod7.

But since b, c, d must be digits (0-9), we can compute their values as (residue mod7) +7*k, where k is 0 or 1 or 2, etc., but ensuring that the result is between 0 and 9.

Wait, but actually, since each
