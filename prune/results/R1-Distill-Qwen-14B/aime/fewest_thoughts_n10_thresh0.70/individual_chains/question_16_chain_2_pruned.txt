Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's about finding the least prime number p where there's a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that for a prime p, if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But wait, that might not necessarily hold because if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then certainly p divides it as well. So, first, let's figure out for small primes whether p divides n⁴ + 1, and then see if p² also does.

I remember that for primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But I'm not entirely sure about the conditions under which this is true. Maybe I should check some small primes.

Let me list the first few primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

Starting with p=2: Let's see, n⁴ + 1. For n=1, 1 + 1 = 2, which is divisible by 2 but not by 4. For n=2, 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. So, 2²=4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. Maybe p=2 isn't the prime we're looking for.

Next, p=3: Check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 3. Let's compute n⁴ mod 3 for n=1,2. 1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡1 mod 3. So, n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod 3. So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod 3, which is not -1 since -1 ≡ 2 mod 3. So, 3 isn't a candidate.

p=5: Let's compute n⁴ mod 5. The possible residues are 0,1,2,3,4. Let's compute 1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡1, 3⁴=81≡1, 4⁴=256≡1. So, all n⁴ ≡ 0 or 1 mod 5. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5 would require 1 ≡ -1 mod 5, which is 1≡4 mod5, which is false. So, p=5 isn't suitable.

p=7: Let's see. Compute n⁴ mod 7. Let's compute for n=1 to 6.

1⁴=1

2⁴=16≡2

3⁴=81≡4

4⁴=256≡256-7*36=256-252=4

5⁴=625. Let's divide 625 by 7: 7*89=623, so 625-623=2. So, 5⁴≡2.

6⁴=1296. 7*185=1295, so 1296≡1 mod7.

Wait, so n⁴ mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. So, is -1 mod7 equal to 6. So, do any n⁴ ≡6 mod7? From above, the residues are 1,2,4. So, no. So, p=7 doesn't work.

Next, p=11: Let's compute n⁴ mod11.

n from 1 to 10:

1⁴=1

2⁴=16≡5

3⁴=81≡4

4⁴=256. Let's compute 256/11: 11*23=253, so 256≡3.

5⁴=625. 625/11=56*11=616. 625-616=9. So 5⁴≡9.

6⁴=1296. Let's compute 1296 mod11:

11*117=1287, so 1296-1287=9.

Wait, 6⁴= (6²)²=36²=1296.

Wait, but 6²=36≡3 mod11, so 6⁴=(6²)²≡3²=9 mod11. So, 6⁴≡9 mod11.

7⁴: Well, 7≡-4 mod11, so 7
