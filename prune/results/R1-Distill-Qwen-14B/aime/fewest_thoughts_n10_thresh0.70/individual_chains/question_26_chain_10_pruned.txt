Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. Alright, let's start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So first, I can check if this is a right-angled triangle or not. Let's see: 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. So not a right-angled triangle. Maybe an acute or obtuse triangle.

Next, since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. From properties of circle tangents, I remember that the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, where O is the center of ω.

I also recall that the point D, being the intersection of two tangents, lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Wait, symmedian? Right, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². So, DB = DC because they're both equal to the length of the tangent from D to ω.

Wait, yes, the power of D is DB
