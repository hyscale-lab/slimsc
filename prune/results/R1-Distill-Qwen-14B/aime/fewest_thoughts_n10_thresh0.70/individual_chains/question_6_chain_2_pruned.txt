Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \]
and
\[ x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \]

where \( f(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{2}| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - \tfrac{1}{4}| \).

Hmm, first, I should probably understand what these functions f and g look like. They involve absolute values nested inside each other, so they're probably creating some V-shaped graphs with specific symmetries.

Let me start by analyzing f(x). The function is f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, |x| is a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then, |x| - 1/2 shifts that graph down by 1/2 units. But then, taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, would flip any part of the graph that goes below the x-axis back up.

So, let's think about |x| - 1/2. This function will have a V shape, but the vertex is at (0, -1/2). The points where |x| - 1/2 = 0 are at |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2. So, when x is between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative, and then taking the absolute value would flip it to positive. So, outside of x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, the function |x| - 1/2 is positive, so the absolute value doesn't change it. So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| would have a W shape perhaps? Let me sketch it mentally.

For x <= -1/2: |x| is -x, so |x| - 1/2 = -x - 1/2. Taking absolute value, since this is negative when x <= -1/2, it becomes x + 1/2. Wait, no, because x is negative here. Let me plug in x = -1: | -1 | = 1, so 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, absolute value is 1/2. Similarly, x = -1/2: | -1/2 | - 1/2 = 0, absolute value is 0. So, for x <= -1/2, the function f(x) is |x| - 1/2, which is (-x) - 1/2 for x <= -1/2, but since x is negative, -x is positive. Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider different intervals.

Maybe let's consider f(x) in different intervals:

1. When x >= 1/2: |x| = x, so |x| - 1/2 = x - 1/2. Since x >= 1/2, this is non-negative, so ||x| - 1/2| = x - 1/2.

2. When x is between 0 and 1/2: |x| = x, so |x| - 1/2 = x - 1/2, which is negative. So, ||x| - 1/2| = -(x - 1/2) = 1/2 - x.

3. When x is between -1/2 and 0: |x| = -x, so |x| - 1/2 = -x - 1/2. Since x is negative, -x is positive, so -x - 1/2 could be positive or negative depending on x. Wait, at x = -1/2: |x| = 1/2, so |x| -1/2 = 0. For x between -1/2 and 0: |x| -1/2 = (-x) -1/2. Since x is greater than -1/2, (-x) < 1/2, so (-x) -1/2 is negative. Thus, taking absolute value: ||x| -1/2| = -( (-x) - 1/2 ) = x + 1/2.

4. When x <= -1/2: |x| = -x, so |x| -1/2 = (-x) -
