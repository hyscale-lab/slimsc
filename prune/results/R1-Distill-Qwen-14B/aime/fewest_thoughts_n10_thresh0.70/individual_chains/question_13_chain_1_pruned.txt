Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the total time she takes is the walking time plus the time she spends in the coffee shop, which is t minutes. But t is the same in both scenarios, right? Because whether she walks at speed s or s+2, she still spends t minutes in the coffee shop.

So, I think I can set up two equations based on the information given. Let me think about how to do that.

First, when she walks at speed s km/h, the time it takes her to walk 9 km is 4 hours, but that includes t minutes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and coffee shop time. So, the walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walking time plus t minutes equals 2 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, so maybe I should convert all the times into the same units. Let me choose minutes because t is given in minutes. So, 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours and 24 minutes is 144 minutes.

Wait, wait, 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes. Right.

So, let's denote the walking time as T1 and T2 for the two different speeds.

For the first case, walking at speed s km/h:

The time taken to walk 9 km is (9/s) hours. But since we're including t minutes, which is t/60
