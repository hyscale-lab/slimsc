Okay, so I have this problem here that says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, ω is a 13th root of unity, so ω^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, it's a primitive root, right? So ω, ω^2, ..., ω^12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity except 1.

Now, the product given is over all k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so plugging that in: 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Hmm, so the first term is 1. Maybe that's a clue? Or maybe not, but I'll keep that in mind.

So, the product is from k=0 to k=12, but one term is 1, so it's equal to the product from k=1 to k=12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) multiplied by 1, so it's just the product from k=1 to 12. But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

I think I should consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor that or rewrite it in a more manageable form.

Let me factor out a 2: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. That looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see: a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c. So here, a=1, b=-2, c=2. So, x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor that?

Wait, discriminant is b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are (2 ± i√4)/2 = (2 ± 2i)/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, that's a product of (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, substituting back, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k +
