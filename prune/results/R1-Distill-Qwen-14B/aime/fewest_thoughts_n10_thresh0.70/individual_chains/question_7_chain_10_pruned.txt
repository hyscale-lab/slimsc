Okay, let's see. I have this problem where each vertex of a regular octagon is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that there's a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, the octagon has 8 vertices, right? So each vertex is colored either red or blue. Since each color is equally likely, each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue. The colorings are independent, so the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That part is straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon so that all blue vertices move to positions where the original color was red. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, every blue vertex should end up on a red vertex. Wait, but that might not always be possible, right? It depends on the coloring.

I think I need to find all colorings where such a rotation exists and then divide by the total number of colorings to get the probability. So, probability = (number of valid colorings) / 256.

But how do I find the number of valid colorings? Let me consider the rotations of the octagon. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which correspond to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since each step is 45°). So, for each coloring, I need to check if there's a rotation (including the identity rotation, which is 0 steps) such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, but how does this rotation affect the colorings? Maybe I can model this as a permutation of the vertices. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices, right? So, if the blue vertices are mapped to red vertices under some rotation, then the coloring satisfies the condition.

So, another way to think about it is: for a given coloring, is there a rotation such that the image of every blue vertex under the rotation is a red vertex in the original coloring.

Let me try to rephrase that. Suppose we have a coloring C. We want a rotation r such that for every vertex v, if C(v) is blue, then C(r(v)) is red. Hmm, or wait, no: When we rotate the octagon, each blue vertex moves to some position. We want that new position to have been red originally. So, the color of the vertex after rotation is determined by the original coloring.

Wait, no, the rotation is applied to the octagon, so the colors of the vertices don't change, but their positions do. So, the set of blue vertices is moved around by the rotation. We need that after rotation, every blue vertex is now on a position that was red in the original coloring.

So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the original red vertices under some
