Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation (by some number of steps) that turns all the blue vertices into positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. So we have a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability, so each has a 1/2 chance.

The key part is about rotating the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Wait, so after rotating, every blue vertex must align with a red vertex from the original configuration. So, this is like saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices is a shifted version of the set of red vertices under rotation. So, if R is the set of red vertices, and B is the set of blue vertices, then B must be equal to R shifted by some rotation.

Wait, but since each vertex is colored either red or blue, the entire octagon is partitioned into red and blue vertices. So, if the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices align with red ones, that would mean that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. Or, in other words, the blue set is a translation (rotation) of the red set.

So, for the octagon, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, since you can rotate by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which are 8 positions.

So, the problem reduces to: What is the probability that the blue set is a rotation of the red set? Because if that's the case, then rotating the octagon appropriately would map all blue vertices to red ones.

Wait, but the colors are assigned randomly. So, for each coloring, either it's possible to rotate it such that the blue set maps to the red set, or not.

So, we need
