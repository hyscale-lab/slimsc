Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down what I know. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, which is a pretty large number. The second condition is a bit more complicated, involving terms like a squared times b and so on. I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) that meet both conditions.

Let me think about the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks symmetric in a, b, c. Each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this somehow.

Wait a minute, I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be factored into a product involving (a + b + c). Let me see. Let me factor the expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But since a + b + c = 300, each of these terms can be expressed in terms of 300 minus the variable. For example, b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me expand each term:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So that's another way to write the second equation. Now, I wonder if I can relate this to the first equation, which is a + b + c = 300.

I remember that for three variables, there's an identity involving the sum of cubes and the squares. Let me recall that identity. I think it's that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. But wait, is that right?

Wait, maybe I should verify that formula. So, the expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc. So, if I subtract 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca), which is 3*(a + b + c)*(ab + bc + ca), let's expand that.

3*(a + b + c)*(ab + bc + ca) = 3*(a*ab + a*bc + a*ca + b*ab + b*bc + b*ca + c*ab + c*bc + c*ca)
= 3*(a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + bc² + c²a)
Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, I know that (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, from that, I can solve for a² + b² + c²:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, substituting back into the expression I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Replace a² + b² + c² with 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca):

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute 300*90,000: 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000

And 300 * (-2(ab + bc + ca)) = -600(ab + bc + ca)

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let's rearrange that:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) - 600(ab + bc + ca) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000

Which is:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) - 600(ab + bc + ca) = -21,000,000

Multiplying both sides by -1:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000

Hmm. Now, let me think about the identity for a³ + b³ + c³. Earlier, I thought about the identity, but maybe I should write it down again:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

We know a + b + c = 300, so let's plug that in:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Compute 300³: 300*300 = 90,000; 90,000*300 = 27,000,000

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Now, substitute this into our earlier equation:

[27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 21,000,000

Bring 27,000,000 to the other side:

-300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000

Which is:

-300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = -6,000,000

Let me factor out -3 from both terms on the left:

-3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = -6,000,000

Divide both sides by -3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

So now I have this equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, that seems more manageable. Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0

Wait, or maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let's see:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Dividing both sides by abc (but wait, abc could be zero, so maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can factor this equation. Let me see.

Let me write the equation as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0

Wait, maybe I can factor 100 as a common factor? Alternatively, maybe I can factor (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). Let me try that.
