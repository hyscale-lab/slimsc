Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

First, we're given three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit more than halfway up to (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Next, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a line segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with the length between them being exactly 1.

Now, the problem is talking about a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F because its length is 1. Wait, let me check that. The distance between A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2) should be 1, right?

Let me calculate that distance. Using the distance formula: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed in F.

So, point C is on AB but not on any other segment in F. That means, for all other PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. So, C is unique in that sense. The question is asking for OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, and then we need to find p + q.

Alright, so my plan is:

1. Find the equation of line AB.
2. For a general segment PQ in F, find its equation.
3. Find the condition that a point C on AB is not on any other PQ in F except AB. Maybe this relates to C being the only intersection point or something.
4. Probably use some optimization or geometric condition to find C.

First, let's find the equation of AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. To find c, plug in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, parametric equations for AB: Let t vary from 0 to 1. So, x = 1/2*(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2)*t. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, point C is somewhere on AB, so its coordinates can be written as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, let's think about the segments PQ in F. Each PQ connects a point P(p, 0) on the x-axis to a point Q(0, q) on the y-axis, with PQ having length 1. So, the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which gives p² + q² = 1.

So, for any such PQ, the equation of the line is x/p + y/q = 1. Since p² + q² =1, we can think of p and q as variables satisfying this condition.

Each PQ is a line in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q). So, the family F consists of all such lines with p, q > 0 and p² + q² = 1.

We need to find point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB itself. So, the only PQ in F that passes through C is AB.

Hmm, that suggests that C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F. Alternatively, maybe C is such that the only PQ in F that passes through it is AB.

Wait, but AB is a member of F, so
