Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. 

So, the torus T is made by revolving this circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away. I remember that the major radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis, which is 6 here, and the minor radius is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3. 

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find the radii of these circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases.

Let me start by recalling the geometry of a torus. The torus can be represented in 3D coordinates with the equation: 

$(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2$,

where R is the major radius (6 in this case) and r is the minor radius (3). 

But I'm not sure if that's the easiest way to approach this. Maybe I can think about the centers of the circles where the torus and sphere are tangent.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the centers of the circles of tangency must lie along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. Similarly, for external tangency.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when it's resting on the inside of the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere must touch the sphere. Similarly, when it's resting outside, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center must touch it.

But actually, no. Wait, the torus is a surface with a hole. So when it's inside the sphere, the sphere will touch the inner part of the torus, and when it's outside, the sphere will touch the outer part.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus.

Let me try to model this. Let's assume the sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0), and the axis of revolution is the z-axis? Wait, no, because if the
