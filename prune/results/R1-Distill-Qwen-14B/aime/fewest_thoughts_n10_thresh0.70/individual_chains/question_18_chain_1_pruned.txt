Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting problem. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are symmetries that can help in counting shapes like rectangles.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees. 

Now, the problem is about rectangles. A rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. Since the dodecagon is regular, I can use its symmetry to find these rectangles.

I think the key is to consider the diagonals of the dodecagon because a rectangle's sides would lie on either sides or diagonals. So, maybe I can think in terms of selecting four points that form a rectangle.

Wait, but selecting four points that form a rectangle in a regular polygon requires that the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles are 90 degrees. So, perhaps each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides.

In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. For example, in a 12-gon, a side connects two adjacent vertices, a diagonal can connect vertices with one vertex in between, two vertices in between, etc., up to five vertices in between because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.

So, the diagonals can be categorized by their lengths. Let me see: in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2. But in our case, n=12, so 12*(12-3)/2 = 54 diagonals. But wait, that's the total number of diagonals, including all lengths. But for our purpose, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Instead, think about the possible distances between vertices in terms of steps around the polygon. Each vertex can be connected to others by steps of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., up to 5 steps because beyond that, it's symmetric. For example, in a dodecagon, stepping 6 positions from a vertex brings you to the opposite vertex, which is the longest diagonal.

So, the possible step sizes for diagonals in a dodecagon are 1 (sides), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, but step size 6 is the diameter of the polygon, right? So, when you connect vertices with step size k, where k ranges from 1 to 5 because stepping 6 is the same as stepping 6 in the opposite direction, but stepping beyond 6 would just mirror the steps from 1 to 5
