Okay, so I've got this problem about paths on an 8x8 grid. The task is to find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right means moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is a sequence of these steps, and without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction. So that would be C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without considering direction changes.

The problem here is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how direction changes come into play. I think direction changes occur when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. Each time it switches, that's a direction change.

Wait, so if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, etc., each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a change. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. Like, if the path has segments: R, U, R, U, ..., then each switch is a direction change.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, starting at (0,0) and ending at (8,8), the number of direction changes would be related to how the path is segmented into runs of right (R) and up (U) steps.

So, for example, a path that goes all right first and then all up would have only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates R and U each step would have 15 direction changes, but that's probably not the case here.

But the problem says exactly four direction changes. So, how does that translate?

I think each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U. So, if we have exactly four direction changes, that means the path is made up of five segments. Because each direction change marks the start of a new segment. So, for four changes, we have five segments.

Each segment is either a run of R's or U's. Since the path must start with either R or U. Wait, but in the grid, starting at lower left, moving right or up is possible. So, the first step could be R or U, but the path must end at (8,8), so the total number of R steps is 8 and U steps is 8.

So, if the path has four direction changes, it would have five segments. These segments alternate between R and U. So, if the first segment is R, then the next is U, then R, and so on. Similarly, if the first is U, then next is R, etc.

Therefore, the number of direction changes (4) is even, so the number of segments would be 5, which is odd. So, the starting direction could be R or U.

Wait, but actually, if you have four direction
