Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is, if she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take her, including the coffee shop time?

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the total time she takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time 't'. 

Let me break this down. First, when she walks at 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But this includes the walking time and the coffee shop time 't'. Similarly, when she walks faster at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes.

Wait a second, so the total time is the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop. That makes sense. So, the walking time plus 't' equals the total time given.

So, let's denote:

- For the first case: walking speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes.
- For the second case: walking speed = (s + 2) km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

Wait, is that right? 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144. Yes, that's correct.

So, the total time for each case is the walking time plus 't', the coffee shop time. 

Let me write equations for both cases.

Case 1:
Walking speed = s km/h
Time taken to walk = distance / speed = 9 / s hours
Total time = walking time + coffee time = (9/s) hours + (t/60) hours = 4 hours.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to convert everything into minutes. Let me try that.

Total time in minutes for case 1: 4 hours * 60 = 240 minutes.
Walking time in minutes: (9 / s) * 60 minutes.
Coffee shop time: t minutes.
So, equation 1: (9/s)*60 + t = 240.

Similarly, for case 2:
Walking speed = (s + 2) km/h
Walking time in hours: 9 / (s + 2) hours.
Total time in minutes: 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes.
So, equation 2: (9/(s + 2))*60 + t = 144.

Now, I have two equations:

1. (540 / s) + t = 240
2. (540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144

Hmm, okay, so I can set up these two equations with two variables, s and t. Let me write them more clearly.

Equation 1: (540 / s) + t = 240
Equation 2: (540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, equation 1 minus equation 2:

(540/s - 540/(s+2)) + (t - t) = 240 - 144
Simplify:

540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96

Now, let me compute 540/s - 540/(s + 2). Let's factor out 540:

540 * [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 96

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, we have:

540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

540 * 2 = 96 * s(s + 2)

So, 1080 = 96 s^2 + 192 s

Let me write this as a quadratic equation:

96 s^2 + 192 s - 1080 = 0

Wait, let me verify that algebra again.

Wait, 540 * 2 / [s(s + 2)] = 96, so 1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96.

Then, multiplying both sides by s(s + 2):

1080 = 96 s(s + 2)

Which is 96 s^2 + 192 s = 1080

So, bringing all terms to one side:

96 s^2 + 192 s - 1080 = 0

I can simplify this by dividing all terms by 24:

96 /24 = 4, 192/24=8, 1080/24=45.

So, equation becomes: 4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Hmm, that's better.

Now, let me solve this quadratic equation for s.

Quadratic in the form: 4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Where a=4, b=8, c=-45.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = 64 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2 * 4) = ( -8 ± 28 ) / 8

We have two solutions:

1. s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h
2. s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5 km/h

Since speed can't be negative, we discard the negative solution.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that we have s, we can find t using one of the original equations.

Let's take equation 1: (540 / s) + t = 240

Substitute s=2.5:

540 / 2.5 = ?

Well, 2.5 is 5/2, so 540 divided by (5/2) is 540 * (2/5) = (540 * 2)/5 = 1080 /5 = 216.

So, 216 + t = 240

Subtract 216: t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h
