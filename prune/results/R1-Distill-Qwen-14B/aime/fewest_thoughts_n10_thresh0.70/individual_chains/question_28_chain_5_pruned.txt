Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, and express it in the form m√n/p, then find m + n + p.

Hmm, first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from this point to each face is the inradius. So I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I think the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is related to its volume (V) and its surface area (A). Specifically, r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Wait, no, actually, I think for a tetrahedron, since it has four faces, each face contributes to the total surface area. So maybe r = 3V / (sum of the areas of the four faces). Let me confirm that.

Yes, for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area. So first, I need to find the volume V and the total surface area S of this tetrahedron.

But how do I find the volume? I remember that for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, we can use the formula involving the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for points A, B, C, D is a determinant of a matrix constructed from the distances between the points. The formula is:

CM = determinant of the matrix:
[ 0   1    1    1    1  ]
[ 1   0   AB² AC² AD² ]
[ 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² ]
[ 1  AC² BC² 0   CD² ]
[ 1  AD² BD² CD² 0   ]

So I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this matrix.

Given:
AB = CD = sqrt(41) => AB² = 41, CD² = 41
AC = BD = sqrt(80) => AC² = 80, BD² = 80
BC = AD = sqrt(89) => BC² = 89, AD² = 89

So let's construct the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So the matrix looks like:

0  1    1    1    1
1  0   41   80   89
1 41    0   89   80
1 80   89    0   41
1 89   80   41    0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That's going to be a bit involved, but let me try to proceed step by step.

First, let's denote the matrix as M. So M is a 5x5 matrix. To compute det(M), one approach is to expand along the first row, which has a zero, which might make it easier.

The determinant is:

0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But since the first element is 0, that term is zero. So det(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4), where M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors for the elements in the first row after the 0.

Wait, actually, the cofactor expansion for the first row (i=0) is:

sum_{j=0 to 4} (-1)^{0+j} * M[0,j] * det(minor_{0,j})

Since M[0,0] = 0, that term is zero. So det(M) = sum from j=1 to 4 of (-1)^{0+j} * M[0,j] * det(minor_{0,j})

M[0,j] for j=1,2,3,4 are all 1. So det(M) = sum_{j=1 to 4} (-1)^{j} * 1 * det(minor_{0,j})

Wait, actually, the sign is (-1)^{i+j}, which here i=0, so it's (-1)^j for each term.

So det(M) = (-1)^1 * det(M1) + (-1)^2 * det(M2) + (-1)^3 * det(M3) + (-1)^4 * det(M4)

Simplify:

det(M) = -det(M1) + det(M2) - det(M3) + det(M4)

Where:

M1 is the minor for element (0,1), which is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column 1.

Similarly for M2, M3, M4.

So let's get these minors:

M1: remove row 0, column 1:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 80, 41, 0

Wait, no. Wait, when you remove column 1, the columns become 0, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, the original matrix (excluding row 0) is:

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

So minor M1 is removing column 1 (which is the second column since we start from 0). So columns 0, 2, 3, 4.

So M1 is:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 80, 41, 0

Similarly, minor M2 is removing column 2:

So columns 0,1,3,4:

Row 1: 1, 0, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 41, 0

Minor M3 is removing column 3:

Columns 0,1,2,4:

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 0

Minor M4 is removing column 4:

Columns 0,1,2,3:

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41

Hmm, calculating all four 4x4 determinants is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a symmetry or pattern we can exploit since the tetrahedron is symmetrical.

Looking back at the edge lengths, it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Each pair of opposite edges are equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So this is an isosceles tetrahedron, also known as a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, and all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, the edge lengths are given as AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, BC=AD=√89. So the faces are not congruent, because the edges are different. But perhaps the faces are congruent in pairs.

Wait, each face is a triangle with edges sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. Wait no, each face is made up of three edges. Let me check.

Wait, for example, face ABC has edges AB, AC, BC which are sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.

Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.

Same for faces ACD and BCD.

Wait, yes, all four faces are congruent triangles because each face has sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. So the tetrahedron is a disphenoid where all four faces are congruent.

Therefore, all the faces have the same area, which might simplify the calculation.

So, first, let's compute the area of one face. Then, since all four are congruent, the total surface area will be four times that.

Compute the area of triangle with sides sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89.

Use Heron's formula. Let's denote a = sqrt41, b = sqrt80, c = sqrt89.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

But wait, a, b, c are sqrt41, sqrt80, sqrt89. Let me compute s:

s = (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2

But Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

This might get messy, but maybe we can compute it another way.

Alternatively, since all edges are known, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron points to make calculations easier.

Given that it's a disphenoid, maybe we can place it in a coordinate system symmetrically.

Let me try to set up coordinates for ABCD such that the centroid is at the origin, but perhaps it's more straightforward to assign coordinates based on the edge lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps using the property that in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, so we can assign coordinates to
