Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in a place called Aimeville. There are 900 residents total. Each resident owns some combination of four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Wait, actually, every resident owns the candy hearts. So that's one thing everyone has. The other three—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade—some people have them, some don't.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And all 900 own a bag of candy hearts.

Then, there's information about how many own exactly two or exactly three of these items. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four—so the candy hearts plus the other three.

Hmm. So I think this is a problem involving sets and their intersections. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Because we're dealing with multiple overlapping sets.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle. For four sets, the formula is a bit complicated, but in this case, since everyone owns the candy hearts, maybe it can simplify things.

Wait, actually, since all 900 own candy hearts, that means for any item, the number of people who own that item is the same as the number who own that item and the candy hearts. Because candy hearts are universal.

So, for example, the number of people who own a diamond ring is 195. But since all residents have candy hearts, the number who own a diamond ring is equal to those who own both a diamond ring and candy hearts.

So, if I think of each of the other three items, their counts are already the number of people who own them along with the candy hearts. That might help in setting up the equations.

The problem also mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these are the counts for exactly two and exactly three. The rest must own either one, four, or none. But wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, no one owns none. So, the remaining residents must own one, two, three,
