Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.

So, given an integer b that's at least 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when 81 is written in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

The task is to find the least integer b (with b ≥ 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are over ten numbers n that satisfy the b-eautiful condition.

Let me break this down. 

First, let's think about what it means for a number n to be expressed as a two-digit number in base b. In base b, a two-digit number would be written as 'ab' where a is the first digit and b is the second digit, but wait, actually, in base b, the digits can't be equal to or larger than b. So, each digit must be from 0 to b-1. But since it's a two-digit number, the first digit can't be zero. So, the number n would be equal to a * b + d, where a is the first digit (1 to b-1) and d is the second digit (0 to b-1). 

So, n = a * b + d. 

The next condition is that a + d = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and d are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let's denote k = sqrt(n), so n = k². 

Putting it together, we have k² = a * b + d, and k = a + d. 

So, substituting k into the first equation, we get:

k² = a * b + (k - a), because d = k - a. 

Let me rearrange this equation:

k² = a*b + k - a  
k² - k = a*(b - 1)  
So, a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer (as it's a digit in base b), and a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1, and d must satisfy 0 ≤ d ≤ b - 1. 

Also, since d = k - a, we have to make sure that d is non-negative and less than b. So, d = k - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ k. Also, d = k - a < b ⇒ a > k - b. But since a is at least 1, this might not always be a constraint.

So, summarizing:

For each base b, we can find all integers k such that:

1. a = (k² - k)/(b - 1) is an integer.
2. 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1.
3. d = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ d ≤ b - 1.

So, for each b, we can iterate over possible k and see if these conditions are satisfied. However, since b is our variable here, and we're trying to find the smallest b where the number of such n's (which would correspond to the number of valid k's) is more than ten, I need a better approach.

Perhaps we can express the conditions in terms of b and k.

From a = (k² - k)/(b - 1), since a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide (k² - k). So, (b - 1) | (k² - k). 

Let me write that as (b - 1) divides k(k - 1). 

So, for a given k, the possible b's are such that b - 1 is a divisor of k(k - 1). 

But since we're looking for the minimal b, perhaps for each k, we can determine the possible b's and then count how many valid b's each k can produce. 

Wait, maybe another approach. Since a must be less than or equal to b - 1, and a = (k² - k)/(b - 1), then (k² - k)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1.

So, (k² - k) ≤ (b - 1)^2.

Hmm, but we're trying to find for a given b, how many k's satisfy the conditions. Alternatively, perhaps for a given b, we can find all k where (b - 1) divides k(k - 1) and a is within the required range.

Wait, let me think about the possible values of k.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be less than b². But n is also k², so k² < b² ⇒ k < b. So, k can be from 1 to b - 1, because k needs to be an integer (since it's sqrt(n)).

Wait, but when k is 1, n is 1, which is a single-digit number in any base. So, the smallest possible k is 2, because n must be a two-digit number. Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, in base 2, the two-digit numbers go from 2 (10_2) to 3 (11_2). So, n=2 is 10_2, which is two digits. So, k could be sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, but that's not an integer. So, the next possible k is 2, n=4. 4 in base 2 is 100_2, which is three digits, so that's too long. Hmm, so perhaps in base 2, there are no two-digit numbers n which are perfect squares. That might be the case.

Let me test that. In base 2, the two-digit numbers are 2 (10_2) and 3 (11_2). sqrt(2) is about 1.414, not integer, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, not integer. So, no b-eautiful numbers in base 2.

Similarly, in base 3. The two-digit numbers are 3 (10_3), 4 (11_3), 5 (12_3), 6 (20_3), 7 (21_3), 8 (22_3). The perfect squares in this range are 4 (2²) and 9 is 100_3, which is three digits. So, n=4 is 11_3. The digits sum to 1 + 1 = 2, which is sqrt(4)=2. So, n=4 is 3-eautiful. So, that's one number. So, base 3 has one b-eautiful number.

Okay, so how do I proceed? Since the problem is about finding the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, I need to find for each b, the number of pairs (a,d) such that a + d = sqrt(a*b + d), and a is from 1 to b-1, d is from 0 to b-1.

Alternatively, since n = k², and n = a*b + d, and k = a + d, we can write:

k² = a*b + (k - a)  
⇒ k² - k = a*(b - 1)  
⇒ a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)

So, for a to be an integer,
