Okay, so I have this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can place digits in each cell so that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. So, reading left to right gives 008 and 991, which add up to 999. Reading top to bottom gives 09, 99, 81, which add up to 99. 

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. Let me visualize the grid:

Top row: A | B | C
Bottom row: D | E | F

So, the two numbers formed left to right are ABC and DEF. These should add up to 999. The three numbers formed top to bottom are AD, BE, CF, and their sum should be 99.

Wait, no, the sum when reading top to bottom is three numbers. Wait, each column has two digits, right? So each column is read as a two-digit number. So, the top to bottom numbers are AD, BE, CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

And the left to right numbers are ABC and DEF, so ABC + DEF = 999.

So, the problem is to find the number of possible digit assignments to A, B, C, D, E, F such that ABC + DEF = 999 and AD + BE + CF = 99.

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9, right? So, A can be 0, but since ABC is a number, if A is 0, then ABC is a two-digit number. Similarly for DEF.

Wait, but ABC is a three-digit number, or could it be? Wait, the grid is 2x3, so each row has three digits, so ABC is a three-digit number, right? So, ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C, and DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F. So, their sum is 100*(A+D) + 10*(B+E) + (C + F) = 999.

Similarly, the columns form two-digit numbers: AD, BE, CF. So, AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, CF is 10*C + F. So, their sum is 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So, we have two equations:

1. 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.
2. 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

Then equation 1 becomes: 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But note that A + B + C is the sum of the top row, and D + E + F is the sum of the bottom row. Also, since S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F, then (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = S1 + S2 + S3. But in equation 2, it's 10*(A+B+C) + (D+E+F) = 99.

Wait, so equation 2 can be rewritten as 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But also, since (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = S1 + S2 + S3.

Let me denote T = A + B + C, and U = D + E + F. So, equation 2 is 10*T + U = 99.

Also, T + U = S1 + S2 + S3.

From equation 1, 100*S
