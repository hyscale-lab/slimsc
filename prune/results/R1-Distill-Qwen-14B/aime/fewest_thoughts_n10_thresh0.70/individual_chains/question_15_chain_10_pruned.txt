Alright, so I have this problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, moving from one corner to the opposite typically involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, that means moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But this problem adds a twist: the path must change direction exactly four times. So, how do I account for that?

Changing direction four times... Let me think about what that means. Each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, starting from the lower left, the first step is either right or up. Then, every time you change direction, you alternate.

Wait, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many straight segments does it have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. So, if you start with one direction, each change adds another segment. So, starting with one segment, four changes would lead to five segments in total. For example, if you went right, then up, then right, then up, then right, that would be four direction changes and five segments.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, you can't have five segments if you're making four direction changes. Because each direction change alternates between right and up. Let me visualize this. Suppose you start moving right, then up, then right, then up, then right. That's four changes, and five segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up.

So, the path is composed of five straight segments, alternating between right and up. Now, each of these segments must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length; you have to actually move.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, moving from the start to the end, you have to cover 8 right steps and 8 up steps in total. So
