Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I need to visualize this. A regular dodecagon is a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Now, the question is about rectangles formed by the sides or diagonals of this shape. So, each side of the rectangle must align with either a side of the dodecagon or one of its diagonals. 

Wait, but how exactly do rectangles form in a dodecagon? I think rectangles are four-sided figures with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, to form such a rectangle, the sides must be aligned in such a way that they meet at right angles.

Let me think about the diagonals in a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of diagonals is given by n(n-3)/2. For a dodecagon, that's 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2 = 54 diagonals. But how does that help me?

Maybe I should think about the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetry. That might help in counting the rectangles systematically.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are a lot of rectangles because opposite sides are parallel, and certain diagonals can act as the sides of rectangles. But wait, in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, the opposite sides are parallel, but the diagonals might form different angles.

Let me try to think of the dodecagon as being inscribed in a circle. Each vertex is equally spaced around the circumference. So, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That might be useful because the length of a diagonal in a regular polygon can be determined by the number of sides it skips. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between spans 2*30 = 60 degrees, two vertices in between span 90 degrees, and so on.

Wait, so the diagonals can be categorized based on the number of vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the possible steps are 1 (which is a side), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But beyond 6, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction. So, step sizes beyond 6 are equivalent to 12 - step. So, for step size 7, it's the same as step size 5 in the other direction, etc.

So, for each vertex, the possible diagonals step 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 vertices away. But maybe I need to consider the lengths of these
