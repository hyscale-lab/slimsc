Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express \( z \) in polar form. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make the calculations easier because multiplying and dividing by \( z \) will involve just manipulating the exponents.

So, let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression. Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |z| = 4 \), so \( 1/|z| = 1/4 \).

Now, substituting these into the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)
That's equal to \( 4 \cdot (75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} \)
Let me compute \( 4 \times (75 + 117i) \):
75 * 4 = 300
117 * 4 = 468
So, that becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). Hmm, but \( e^{i\theta} \) is \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), so multiplying by that will involve distributing it.

Similarly, the second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} \)
96 /4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so that becomes \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \), which is \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, now the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Let me expand each of these products.

Starting with the first term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)

Using distributive property:
= 300 * cosθ + 300 * i sinθ + 468i * cosθ + 468i * i sinθ

Simplify each term:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ

Remember that \( i² = -1 \), so:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Combine like terms:
The real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
The imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

So the first term becomes:
\( (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) \)

Similarly, let's expand the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cosθ - i sinθ) \)

Again, using distributive property:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ

Simplify each term:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ (since i² = -1, so negative times negative)

Combine like terms:
Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

So the second term becomes:
\( (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) \)

Now, let me combine both terms to get the entire expression:

First term real: \( 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ \)
Second term real: \( 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ \)
Total real part: \( (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ \)

Imaginary parts:
First term imaginary: \( 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ \)
Second term imaginary: \( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ \)
Total imaginary part: \( (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ \)

So, the entire expression simplifies to:
\[
(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)
\]

But we are interested in the real part of the expression, which is:
\[
324 cosθ - 432 sinθ
\]

So, we need to find the maximum value of \( 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ \) over all real θ.

Wait, that's a linear combination of sine and cosine. I remember that expressions of the form \( A cosθ + B sinθ \) can be rewritten as \( R cos(θ + φ) \) or \( R sin(θ + φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A² + B²} \), and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), since the cosine or sine function has a maximum of 1.

So, in this case, the real part is \( 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ \), which can be written as \( A cosθ + B sinθ \), where A = 324 and B = -432.

So, the maximum value of this expression is \( \sqrt{A² + B²} \).

Let me compute that:

\( A² = 324² = let's compute 324 * 324

I can compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400.

So, (300 +24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 +14400 is 104400, +576 is 104,976.

Similarly, B² = (-432)^2 = 432^2.

Compute 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, 2*400*32=25600.

So, (400+32)^2=400² + 2*400*32 +32²=160000+25600+1024=160000+25600=185600, +1024=186,624.

So, A² + B² = 104976 + 186624.

Let me add those:

104,976 + 186,624.

104,976 + 186,624:

104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 291,600.

So, \( R = \sqrt{291600} \).

What is sqrt(291600)? Let's see: 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 540²= (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250,000 +40,000 +1,600 =291,600.

So, R=540. Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure, because sometimes the phase shift might affect things, but since we're taking the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ, which is indeed the amplitude R, which is sqrt(A² + B²). So, yeah, 540 is the maximum.

So, the largest possible real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of A and B.

Wait, the real part was 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so A is 324, B is -432, so when computing R, it
