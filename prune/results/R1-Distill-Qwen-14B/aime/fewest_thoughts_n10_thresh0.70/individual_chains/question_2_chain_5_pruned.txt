Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where point C is on segment AB. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis, and B is somewhere up on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. That makes sense.

So, all these segments PQ are in the first quadrant, starting from some point on the x-axis and going to some point on the y-axis, with length 1. Since they're all unit segments, they form a sort of curve in the first quadrant, but each is just a straight line segment between (p,0) and (0,q) where p² + q² =1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F besides AB itself. So, C is on AB, and none of these other PQ segments pass through C except AB.

I need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so let's try to visualize this. AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me write the equation of AB first.

To find the equation of line AB, I can use the two points. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form with point A (1/2, 0):

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)
y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

But point C is such that it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from family F except AB itself. So, if I can find such a point C on AB where, for every other segment PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

Alternatively, C is the only intersection point of AB with all these PQ segments except for AB itself. Hmm, maybe another way to think about it is that C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of these segments PQ. Because if you have a family of lines (segments in this case), the envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, maybe AB is tangent to the envelope of family F at point C.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if C is on AB and is only on AB and not on any other PQ, then AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F at C. So, the envelope of family F is the curve that touches each PQ exactly once, and AB is tangent to this envelope at C.

So, first I need to find the envelope of the family F of segments PQ.

Each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1. So, for each p, q such that p² + q² =1, the segment PQ is part of the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q). Let me find the equation of the line PQ for general p and q.

The line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). Its equation can be written in intercept form as x/p + y/q = 1.

Since p² + q² =1, we can express q in terms of p or vice versa. Let's say q = sqrt(1 - p²), but since p and q are positive (they are in the first quadrant), we can write this as q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1.

Now, to find the envelope of this family of lines, we can use the standard method from calculus or differential equations. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to the parameter (here, p) set to zero.

Let me denote the equation as F(x, y, p) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 = 0.

Then, the condition for the envelope is that F(x, y, p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

So, let's compute dF/dp.

dF/dp = -x/p² + y*( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2)*(2p) ) / (sqrt(1 - p²)) )
