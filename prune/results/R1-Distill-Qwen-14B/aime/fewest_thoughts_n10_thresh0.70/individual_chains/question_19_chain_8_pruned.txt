Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some concepts. The circumradius R is 13, so that relates to the sides of the triangle. The inradius r is 6, which connects to the area and the semiperimeter. Also, the condition IA perpendicular to OI seems important.

First, let's jot down what I know:

1. Circumradius (R) = 13. So, for any triangle, the formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area.
2. Inradius (r) = 6. The formula for inradius is r = Δ/s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a+b+c)/2.
3. IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or some vector approach? Or perhaps there's a theorem related to this?

Wait, maybe before diving into coordinates, I can think about properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O and incenter I.

I know that in any triangle, the Euler line connects the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter, but the incenter doesn't generally lie on the Euler line unless the triangle is equilateral. So, maybe this condition of IA perpendicular to OI is something specific.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities or coordinate geometry could be helpful here.

Let me think about coordinate systems. Maybe I can place the triangle in a coordinate system such that point I is at the origin. Then O would be somewhere else, and IA is a line from I (origin) to point A, which is perpendicular to OI. So vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.

If I set I at (0,0), then O is at some point (h,k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. Since IA is from I to A, which is (x,y), and OI is from I (0,0) to O (h,k). So the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, meaning their dot product is zero.

So, the vector IA is (x,y), and vector OI is (h,k). Their dot product is x*h + y*k = 0.

That's one equation, but I don't know the coordinates of A, O, or I.

Wait, I is the incenter. Maybe it's better to place the triangle such that I is at the origin, but then O is somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps placing O at the origin to simplify? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use barycentric coordinates or trigonometric relations.

Wait, another thought: the distance between the incenter and
