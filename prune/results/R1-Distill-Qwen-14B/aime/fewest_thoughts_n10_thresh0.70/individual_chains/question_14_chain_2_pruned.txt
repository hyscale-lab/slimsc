Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Hmm, let's break this down. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so probably starting from 9999 and working downwards would be a good approach.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N and change the thousands digit to 1, the result is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds, tens, or units digit to 1 each should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, for a four-digit number N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), changing each digit one by one to 1 and checking divisibility by 7.

Let me consider each case:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions must be satisfied.

Since we're looking for the greatest such number, starting from 9999 and going down, checking each number to see if it satisfies all four conditions. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the conditions mathematically.

Let's express N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Changing each digit to 1 gives us new numbers:

1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1.
2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2.
3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7
N2 ≡ 0 mod 7
N3 ≡ 0 mod 7
N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write each condition as congruences.

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I can compute each coefficient modulo 7 to simplify:

First, compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

100 /7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 ≡ 3 mod7.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, substituting:

1. (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod7
2. (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod7
3. (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 mod7
4. (6A + 2B + 3C +1 ) ≡ 0 mod7.

So the four congruences are:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (4)

So, I have four equations with variables A, B, C, D. Since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9, A≠0), I need to find such digits that satisfy all four equations.

Let me think about how to solve these equations.

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) = 6A + 2 -6 -2B = 6A -2B -4.

This should be ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - 2B -4 ≡0 mod7 → 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +3 + D) = 3C +1 -3 - D = 3C - D -2.

This should be ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡ 2 mod7 → Equation (5).

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) = 6A +1 -6 -D =6A - D -5.

This should be ≡0 mod7 → 6A - D ≡5 mod7 → Equation (6).

Hmm, let's see. I have several equations here. Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From Equation (5): 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → D ≡3C -2 mod7.

From Equation (6): 6A - D ≡5 mod7 → substituting D from Equation (5):

6A - (3C -2) ≡5 → 6A -3C +2 ≡5 → 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is possible):

2A - C ≡1 mod7 → Equation (7).

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (2) - Equation (1):

6A -2B ≡4 mod7 → Let's write this as:

3A - B ≡2 mod7 → Equation (8), because we can divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so multiplying both sides by 4 gives 6A -2B *4 ≡4*4 → but wait, maybe better to not complicate. Instead, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7 can be written as 6A ≡2B +4 mod7.

Alternatively, since 6 ≡-1 mod7, so -A ≡2B +4 mod7 → A ≡ -2B -4 mod7 → A ≡ ( -2B -4 ) mod7 → A ≡ (5B +3) mod7 since -2 ≡5 mod7 and -4≡3 mod7.

So, A ≡5B +3 mod7. Equation (9).

So, now, from Equation (7):

2A - C ≡1 mod7 → C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From Equation (9): A ≡5B +3 mod7.

So, substituting A into Equation (7):

C ≡2*(5B +3) -1 mod7 → C ≡10B +6 -1 mod7 → 10B ≡3B mod7, since 10-7=3. So, 3B +5 mod7.

Thus, C ≡3B +5 mod7. Equation (10).

So, now, from Equation (10): C = (3B +5) mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (5): D = (3C -2) mod7.

Substituting C from Equation (10):

D ≡3*(3B +5) -2 mod7 → D ≡9B +15 -2 mod7 → 9B ≡2B mod7 (since 9-7=2), 15 mod7 is 1, so 2B +1 -2 → 2B -1 mod7.

Thus, D ≡2B -1 mod7. Equation (11).

So, now, from Equation (9), A ≡5B +3 mod7.

Equation (1): 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Let me substitute C and D from Equations (10) and (11) into Equation (1):

6 + 2B +3*(3B +5) + (2B -1) ≡0 mod7.

Compute step by step:

3*(3B +5) =9B +15.

So, 6 +2B +9B +15 +2B -1.

Combine like terms:

6 +15 -1 =20.

2B +9B +2B =13B.

So, total: 20 +13B.

20 mod7: 7*2=14, 20-14=6 → 6 mod7.

13B mod7: 13-7=6, so 6B mod7.

So, 6 +6B ≡0 mod7 → 6B ≡-6 mod7 → 6B ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, the inverse is 6.

So, B ≡6*1 ≡6 mod7.

Thus, B ≡6 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), possible values are 6 and 13, but 13 is invalid. So, B=6.

So, B=6.

Now, we can find A, C, D.

From Equation (9): A ≡5B +3 mod7 → A ≡5*6 +3=30 +3=33 mod7.

33 divided by7: 7*4=28, 33-28=5 → A≡5 mod7.

A is a digit (1-9, since it's the thousands place). So possible A:5, 12→invalid, 19→invalid. So A=5.

Wait, but since we are looking for the greatest four-digit number possible, we might need higher A. Wait, but if A is 5 mod7, the next possible would be 5, 12 (invalid), 19 (invalid). So, maximum A possible is 5.

Wait, but hang on: If A=5 is the only possible value, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, 5 mod7 can be 5, 12, 19, etc., but since A is a single digit, A=5 is the only possibility here.

But wait, if A is allowed to be 5, 12, but 12 is not a digit, so A must be 5.

Wait, but that can't be the case because we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, so perhaps there is a way for A to be higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the modular equations.

Wait, let me double-check.

From Equation (8): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7, with B=6.

So, 6A -2*6=6A -12 ≡4 mod7.

6A ≡4 +12=16 mod7. 16 mod7 is 2, so 6A ≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 6 mod7, which is 6, as before.

So, A ≡2*6=12 ≡5 mod7. So yes, A≡5 mod7.

So, the possible A is 5, 12, 19, etc., but since A is a digit, only 5 is possible. So, A=5.

Hmm, so A=5. Then, from Equation (10): C ≡3B +5 mod7.

B=6, so 3*6=18, 18+5=23. 23 mod7: 7*3=21, 23-21=2. So, C≡2 mod7.

C is a digit, so possible C=2,9 (since 2+7=9). So, possible C=2 or 9.

Similarly, from Equation (11): D≡2B -1 mod7.

B=6: 2*6=12, 12-1=11. 11 mod7=4. So, D≡4 mod7.

D is a digit, so possible D=4,11→invalid. So, D=4.

So, now, variables:

A=5, B=6, C=2 or 9, D=4.

So, N could be either 5624 or 5694.

But wait, since we want the greatest four-digit number, 5694 is larger than 5624. So, let's check if N=
