Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis, but not halfway—sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, which is about 75% of the way to (0,1). So the line AB connects these two points.

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So for any such segment PQ in F, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. That means sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

So F is all such segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the segment PQ is of unit length. So each PQ is part of a line that's the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs on the axes, and hypotenuse of length 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the distance between A and B.

The distance AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is indeed a segment in F. So C is a point on AB, not at A or B, such that C is not on any other segment PQ from F. So AB is the only segment in F that contains C.

We have to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and give p + q as the answer.

So, the plan is probably to find the coordinates of point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

First, let me figure out the equation of line AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Let me check that. When x=1/2, y=0, which is correct. When x=0, y = -sqrt(3)*(-1/2) = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be parametrized. Let me use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, it's point A, and t=1, it's point B.

So parametric equations:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

Because when t=0, x=1/2, y=0 (point A); when t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B).

So point C has coordinates ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) where t is between 0 and 1.

Now, the problem is to find t such that point C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), if we can show that C is not on PQ, then C satisfies the condition.

So, perhaps for C to not lie on any other PQ, the system of equations given by PQ and AB must have C as their unique intersection point, which is C itself. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps C is such that the line PQ only intersects AB at C and nowhere else.

Wait, but PQ is a segment from P(p,0) to Q(0,q), with p² + q² =1, and PQ is of length 1.

So, the equation of PQ can be found. Let's find the equation of a general PQ.

Given two points P(p,0) and Q(0,q), the equation of the line PQ can be written as:

x/p + y/q = 1.

Because when x= p, y=0, and when x=0, y=q.

But since p² + q² =1, because PQ is length 1.

So for any such PQ, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q² =1.

Now, point C lies on AB, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, for point C to lie on PQ (x/p + y/q =1), we can substitute y from AB's equation into PQ's equation.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x/p + y/q =1:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1

Let me rearrange:

x/p - (sqrt(3)/q) x + sqrt(3)/(2q) =1

Factor x:

x [1/p - sqrt(3)/q] + sqrt(3)/(2q) =1

Since point C is on both AB and PQ, this equation must hold for the specific x-coordinate of C.

But C is a point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB. So our goal is to find a point C on AB such that for all other PQ segments in F (i.e., all other p and q with p² + q²=1), except for the one where PQ is AB itself, the above equation has no solution except at point C.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to find the envelope of all these lines PQ. The envelope would be the curve that is tangent to all these lines. So point C is where the envelope touches AB, making it the only point on AB that is on the envelope, hence not lying on any other PQ except AB.

So if I can find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p² + q²=1, then the envelope will intersect AB at point C, and this C will be the unique point only on AB and no other PQ.

So, to find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1, with the constraint p² + q² =1.
