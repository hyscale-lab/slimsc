Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's given and what's being asked.

It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, the triangle has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. Also, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to I. So, IA is perpendicular to OI.

I remember that in triangle geometry, the inradius and circumradius have certain relationships with the sides and the area of the triangle. Maybe I can use some formulas involving R and r.

First, let's recall some important formulas:

1. The area (Δ) of triangle ABC can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter (s) as Δ = r * s.
2. The area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius and the sides as Δ = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle.
3. There's also Euler's formula which relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) to R and r: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that right? Let me verify. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that means the lines IA and OI form a right angle. So, triangle OIA is a right triangle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is given as 13. IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. Hmm, I'm not sure about the formula for IA. Let me think.

Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius. Specifically, IA = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct? Let me recall: in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Yes, I think that's right.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).

Similarly, OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

So, in triangle OIA, which is right-angled at I, we have:

OA² = OI² + IA²

Substituting the known values:
