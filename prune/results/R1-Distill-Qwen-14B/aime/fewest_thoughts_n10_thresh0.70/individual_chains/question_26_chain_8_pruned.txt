Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle ABC. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We need to find AP.

Given lengths: AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, their lengths are equal. So, the lengths from D to B and D to C should be equal. That is, DB = DC. So, point D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Hmm, okay. So, maybe I can find coordinates for these points or use coordinate geometry to solve this. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point or some triangle properties.

Power of a point might be helpful here. Since D is the ex-tangent point, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD intersects ω at P, the power of D with respect to ω can be expressed as DB² = DP * DA.

Wait, yes! The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the length of the tangent from D to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points where any secant from D intersects the circle. So, in this case, DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DP and DA. But I don't know DB yet. Let me think about how to find DB.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC first, since it's inscribed in ω. Once I have the circumradius, perhaps I can find other lengths like DB.

To find the circumradius R of triangle ABC, I can use the formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area)

Where a, b, c are the
