Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner, no matter how Alice plays. 

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. It's a two-player game with perfect information, so each position (number of tokens) is either a winning position or a losing position. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this context, Alice is the first player, and Bob is the second. We need to find n where Bob can always win, regardless of Alice's moves. That would mean that for such n, the position is a losing position for Alice, meaning she can't force a win, so Bob can.

Let me think about the basic positions. Let's start from small n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob will take that 1 and win. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. If Alice takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1, then Bob can take that 1 and win. So Alice doesn't want to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So she can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, so does that mean that n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Because whatever she does, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob? Hmm, but that seems contradictory because Bob is the second player. Wait, no: if n=2 is a losing position for the first player (Alice), then Bob can win. So yes, for n=2, Bob can win.

Wait, let me think again. For n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and
