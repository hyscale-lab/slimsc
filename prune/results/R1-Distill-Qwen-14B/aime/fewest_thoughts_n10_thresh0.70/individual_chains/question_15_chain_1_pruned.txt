Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because to go from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The catch is that these paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

Let me try to visualize this. On a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite, the path can only move right or up. So each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. For an 8x8 grid, we have exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, so the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's without considering the direction changes.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how direction changes relate to the sequence of R's and U's.

Let me think: if a path changes direction, that means it alternates between moving right and up. So each time the direction changes, the path switches from R to U or U to R. Starting from the lower left, the first move could be either right or up. Then, each time it changes direction, it alternates.

Wait, so the number of direction changes is related to the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R. For example, a path that goes all the way right first and then all the way up has only one direction change. Similarly, a path that alternates every step would have a lot more direction changes.

But in this problem, we need exactly four direction changes. Hmm. How can I model this?

I remember that in such grid path problems, the number of direction changes can be tied to the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, for example, if a path goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, that's three runs of R and three runs of U. Each run switch is a direction change.

Wait, so the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. Because each time you switch from one run to another, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you have two runs, you have one direction change.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: if the path has a certain number of runs, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. Because the first run doesn't count as a change. So, for example:

- RRRUUU has two runs and one direction change.
- RURURU has three runs and two direction changes.

So, if we need paths that change direction exactly four times, that means the number of runs is five. Because 4 direction changes imply 5 runs.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's say I have a path with runs R, U, R, U, R. That's three runs of R and two runs of U, totaling five runs.
