Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Got it.

Let me start by understanding the problem. We're dealing with primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1. So, first, find the smallest such prime p, then find the minimal m for that p.

I know that if p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Which implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². So the order of n modulo p² divides 8. Also, since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order doesn't divide 4, so the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides p² - 1 because of Fermat's little theorem, which says that the multiplicative order divides p² - 1 (since the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic of order p(p-1) when p is odd, right? Wait, actually, for odd primes, the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, for the order of n to be 8, 8 must divide p(p-1). 

Wait, but p is a prime, so either 8 divides p-1 or 8 divides p. But p is prime, so p can only be 2 or primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because 8 divides p(p-1), and since p is prime, either p=2 or p ≡1 mod 8.

So, p must be 2 or a prime ≡1 mod8. Let's see, the primes in order are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,... So let's check if p=2 works first, since it's the smallest.

For p=2: Let's see if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod4. Let's see, n can be 0,1,2,3 mod4.

n=0 mod4: 0⁴=0, so 0+1=1 mod4, which is 1 mod4, not 0.

n=1 mod4: 1⁴=1, so 1+1=2 mod4.

n=2 mod4: 16 mod4 is 0, 0+1=1 mod4.

n=3 mod4: 81 mod4 is 1, 1+1=2 mod4.

So, for any n, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4, never 0. Therefore, p=2 cannot be such a prime because p²=4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=2 is out.

Next, the next primes are 3,5,7,11, etc. So we need to check the next primes to see if they are ≡1 mod8. Let's see: 3≡3 mod8, 5≡5 mod8,7≡7 mod8,11≡3 mod8,13≡5 mod8,17≡1 mod8. So p=17 is the first prime after 2 that is 1 mod8.

Wait, but before jumping to 17, maybe there are smaller primes p where p² divides n⁴ +1 even if p isn't 1 mod8? Because maybe for p=17, it's the first prime where the multiplicative order allows n⁸ ≡1 mod p², but perhaps for smaller primes, even though the order isn't 8, maybe n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² exists?

Wait, but earlier, I thought that the order must be 8 because n⁴ ≡-1 implies n⁸≡1, and if the order is 8, then 8 must divide p(p-1
