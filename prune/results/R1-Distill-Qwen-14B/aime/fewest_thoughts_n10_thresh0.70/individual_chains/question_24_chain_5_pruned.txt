Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We have a list of positive integers with a few properties. The sum is 30. The unique mode is 9, which means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list. Also, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. So let's break this down. First, I'll try to recall what each term means.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently. Since it's a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, for example, if 5 appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times, or something like that.

The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, the median is an integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list.

The sum of all numbers is 30. So, the total is fixed. Our job is to figure out the composition of the list.

So, let's think about the properties one by one.

First, the mode is 9. That means 9 occurs more times than any other number. So, if I have a list where 9 is the mode, I need to make sure that 9 appears more frequently than any other number. So, for example, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

Next, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the list has, say, n elements, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term for odd n, or the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 + 1)-th terms for even n. But in either case, the median must be an integer not present in the list.

Also, all numbers are positive integers, so no zeros or negatives.

So, let's try to construct such a list. Let me think about possible lengths of the list.

The sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, so the minimum length of the list is 1 (if the number is 30), but that's probably too short. Let's think of what's possible.

But considering the median, the list must have a certain number of elements. Let's consider both even and odd lengths.

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's an even number, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in our case, the median is an integer not in the list. So, if the median is the average of two numbers, it's an integer, meaning the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd, so their average is integer.

But if the median is an integer not in the list, then for even-length lists, the two middle numbers must average to a number not present in the list. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, for an odd-length list, the median is a single number not present in the list. So, that's also a possibility.

Wait, but the mode is 9, so 9 must be in the list multiple times. So, let's think about how many times 9 must appear.

If the mode is unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. If another number appears three times, 9 must appear four times.

But since the sum is 30, we can't have too many 9s. Let me think: if 9 appears, say, three times, that's 27, leaving 3 to be distributed among other numbers. Hmm, but 3 can be one 3 and others 1s, but that might complicate the mode.

Wait, let's try to consider possible numbers of 9s.

Case 1: 9 appears three times. So, sum contributed by 9s is 27. Then the remaining sum is 3. Since we have to have positive integers, the other numbers could be 3, but wait, if we have a 3, how many times can it
