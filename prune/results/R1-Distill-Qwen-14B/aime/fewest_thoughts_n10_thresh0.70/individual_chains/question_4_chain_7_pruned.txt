Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since Alice goes first, she has the initial advantage. But depending on the number of tokens, Bob might be able to force a win by using some strategy.

I think the best way to approach this is to model it using game theory, specifically by determining the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The losing positions are the ones where the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

Let me start by listing the positions from n=0 upwards and see if I can find a pattern.

n=0: Well, if there are zero tokens, the game is already over. So the player whose turn it is can't make a move. But wait, in our problem, the last person to take a token wins. So if n=0, the game has ended, and the player who just took the last token wins. So n=0 is a losing position because the player can't move.

Wait, no, maybe I should clarify. The player who takes the last token wins, so if n=0, it's the end of the game, and the last player to have taken a token wins. So if it's your turn and n=0, you lose because you can't make a move. So yes, n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a winning position for the opponent, they can take the last token. Wait, no, wait. If the player takes 1, leaving n=1, the opponent can take 1 and win. So that's bad. Alternatively
