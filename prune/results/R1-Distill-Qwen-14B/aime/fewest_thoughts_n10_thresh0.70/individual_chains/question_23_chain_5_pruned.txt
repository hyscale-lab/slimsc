Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The transverse axis length is 2a, where a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20). The conjugate axis is 2b, with b²=24, so b is sqrt(24). 

The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Or wait, no, not necessarily right angles. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Hmm, wait, no, actually, I think I was correct the first time: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's right. Because a rhombus is a special kind of parallelogram where all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's a key property. So, the diagonals of ABCD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular to each other.

So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis since its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the four vertices of the rhombus are points on the hyperbola, and they are symmetric in such a way that if (x, y) is a vertex, then (-x, -y) is another vertex. Wait, or maybe (x, y), (-x, y), (-x, -y), (x, -y)? Hmm, no, wait, because in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the vertices are arranged such that they are symmetric with respect to both axes. So, perhaps the four points are (p, q), (-p, q), (-
