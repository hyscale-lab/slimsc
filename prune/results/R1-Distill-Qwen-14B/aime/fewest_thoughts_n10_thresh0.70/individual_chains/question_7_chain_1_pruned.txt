Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so each color has a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally.

Hmm, that's a bit abstract. Let me try to parse it. So we have a regular octagon, right? That means all sides and angles are equal, so it's symmetric. Each vertex is either red or blue, each color with probability 1/2, and the colorings are independent.

The key part is figuring out when we can rotate the octagon so that every blue vertex moves to a position where there was a red vertex before the rotation. So, in other words, after rotation, the set of blue vertices is exactly the set of previously red vertices. Or maybe more accurately, the blue vertices after rotation are where the red ones were. So, the blue and red sets are swapped via some rotation.

Wait, no, maybe not swapped, but the blue vertices are moved to where the reds were. So, in the original configuration, some vertices are red and some are blue. After a rotation, the blue ones are now in positions that were red. So, the rotated blue set is a subset of the original red set.

Wait, no, because it's a permutation. So, if the octagon is rotated, each vertex is mapped to another vertex. So, the set of blue vertices after rotation is a rotated version of the original blue set. So, for the problem, we need that this rotated blue set is exactly the original red set.

But since the octagon is regular, rotation is a cyclic permutation. So, the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°.

So, the question is: what is the probability that there exists some rotation (i.e., some multiple of 45°) such that when we apply that rotation to the octagon, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red.

In other words, the image of the blue set under rotation must be a subset of the original red set. But since the octagon is a permutation, the image of the blue set is another set of the same size, so it must exactly equal the original red set. Hence, the blue set must be a rotation of the red set.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the red and blue sets must be related by a rotation. So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

But wait, since the octagon is regular, the rotation of the blue set would result in another set of the same size. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Because if you rotate the blue set, it's still the same size. So, if the number of blue vertices isn't equal to the number of red vertices, which are 4 each, then this condition cannot be satisfied.

Wait, no, the octagon has 8 vertices.
