Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g are. They're defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. Let me visualize them.

Starting with f(x). The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, it's going to reflect any negative parts back up. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me think about the graph of f(x). When x is 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When x is 1/2, f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. Similarly, when x is -1/2, f(-1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. For x > 1/2, say x=1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Same for x < -1/2.

So f(x) has its minimum at 0 when |x| = 1/2, and it's 1/2 elsewhere. So it's a V-shaped graph that touches down at x=1/2 and x=-1/2, with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, actually, the vertex of f(x) would be at the points where |x| = 1/2, so f(x) is zero there. So the graph is like two Vs, one on the right and one on the left, meeting at the points (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), with the top at (0, 1/2). Hmm, maybe I should sketch it mentally. Alternatively, maybe better to find specific key points.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze it. The inner |x| is the V-shape, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So when x = 0, g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. When x = 1/4, g(1/4) = |1/4 -1/4| = 0. Similarly, when x=-1/4, it's zero. For x beyond 1/4, like x=1, |1| -1/4 = 3/4, absolute value is 3/4, so g(1)=3/4. Similarly, for x less than -1/4, same.

So g(x) has minima at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, both at y=0, and it peaks at x=0 with y=1/4.

So now, both f and g are these V-shaped graphs, but with different shifts.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So both y and x are functions involving g(f of some trigonometric function). Let me try to see what these functions look like.

First, let's consider the inner functions: sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Then, these are passed into f, then into g, and then scaled by 4.

Let me try to break it down step by step.

Starting with y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's compute f(sin(2πx)) first.

f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) = || ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| - 1/4 |.

Then, multiply by 4: 4 * || ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| - 1/4 |.

So, y is a function of x, and x is a function of y in the second equation. So to find their intersections, I need to solve for (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied.

But because each equation defines y in terms of x and x in terms of y, we can think of it as a system:
y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))
x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, it's a system of equations where each variable is defined in terms of the other. Solving such a system can be tricky because each equation is non-linear and involves trigonometric functions and absolute values.

I think the approach here should be to consider the periodicity and the ranges of these functions, then perhaps analyze possible intersections by considering the possible values of x and y.

Let me first find the ranges of both functions y and x. Since both are defined using 4g(f(...)), and f and g are absolute values, I can figure out the possible outputs.

First, let's consider the inner functions:

For y: sin(2πx). The range of sin is [-1, 1], so |sin(2πx)| is [0,1].

Then f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's compute this for |sin(2πx)| in [0,1].

So, |s| = |sin(2πx)|, which ranges from 0 to 1.

f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |.

So, when |s| is between 0 and 1.

What's the range of f(s)?

Well, when s is in [0,1], |s - 1/2| is a V-shape that goes from 1/2 at s=0, down to 0 at s=1/2, then back up to 1/2 at s=1.

So f(s) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Similarly, g(f(s)) = ||f(s) - 1/4|.

So f(s) is in [0, 1/2]. Let's compute ||f(s) - 1/4|.

When f(s) is in [0, 1/2], subtracting 1/4 gives a range from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, so |f(s) - 1/4| ranges from 0 to 1/4.

So, the maximum value is 1/4 (when f(s) is 0 or 1/2), and the minimum is 0 (when f(s) is 1/4).

Then, g(f(s)) is in [0, 1/4].

Then, multiplying by 4, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is in [0, 1].

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that.

cos(3πy) has output in [-1,1], so |cos(3πy)| is in [0,1].

Then f(|cos(3πy)|) is | | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | |.

Wait, f(|cos(3πy)|) = || |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 |.

Wait no, f is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. So here, x is |cos(3
