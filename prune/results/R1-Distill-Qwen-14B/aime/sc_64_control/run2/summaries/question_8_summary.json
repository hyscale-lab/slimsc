      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is linear, and the second is a combination of quadratic and linear terms. It might help to simplify or factor the second equation.\n\nLooking at the second equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. I notice that this can be factored by grouping. Let me try that.\n\nGrouping terms with similar factors:\n- a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\n- Similarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\n- And c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nHmm, interesting. Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.\n\nSo substituting, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nLet me write that out:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it differently or find a way to relate it to the first equation.\n\nWait, another thought: the expression a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b) can also be written as (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc. Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc). Expanding that gives:\na(ab + ac + bc) + b(ab + ac + bc) + c(ab + ac + bc)\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + abc + ab\u00b2 + abc + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + abc\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + 3abc\n\nBut the original expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2. So if I subtract 3abc from (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc), I get exactly the expression in the problem. So:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc\n\nThat's a useful identity! So substituting, the second equation becomes:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nWe already know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:\n\n300*(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me write that as:\n300*(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this equation. Let's see:\n\nFactor out 3 from the left side:\n3[100*(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n100*(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSo now we have:\n100*(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + ac + bc.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\nOr, rearranged:\nP = 100Q - 2,000,000\n\nBut I also know that for three variables, the relationship between S, Q, and P is given by the cubic equation:\nx\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0\nWhich is:\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0\n\nBut since P = 100Q - 2,000,000, I can substitute that into the equation:\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0\nSimplify:\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can express everything in terms of Q.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nWe know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, the product abc can't be too large. Let me see if I can find possible values for Q.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think in terms of variables. Let's consider the equation:\n\nP = 100Q - 2,000,000\n\nSince P = abc must be nonnegative (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), we have:\n\n100Q - 2,000,000 \u2265 0\n=> 100Q \u2265 2,000,000\n=> Q \u2265 20,000\n\nSo ab + ac + bc \u2265 20,000.\n\nBut also, in the case where a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the maximum value of Q can be found when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible. For example, if c = 0, then Q = ab, and since a + b = 300, maximum ab is when a = b = 150, so ab = 22500. Similarly, if c is 1, then a + b = 299, max ab is (149)(150) = 22350, which is less than 22500. So the maximum Q is 22500.\n\nWait, but earlier we have Q \u2265 20,000, so 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nSo Q is between 20,000 and 22,500.\n\nBut since Q must be an integer (as a, b, c are integers), Q ranges from 20,000 to 22,500.\n\nSo let's write Q as 20,000 + k, where k is an integer between 0 and 2,500.\n\nBut maybe it's better to iterate over possible Q values. But considering that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and a + b + c = 300, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another thought: Let me consider the equation P = 100Q - 2,000,000. Since P must be nonnegative, Q must be at least 20,000 as established earlier.\n\nBut also, since P = abc, and a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can bound Q.\n\nWait, the maximum of Q is 22500 as above. So 20,000 \u2264 Q \u2264 22,500.\n\nSo for each Q in this range, we can compute P = 100Q - 2,000,000, and then check whether the cubic equation x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0 has nonnegative integer roots a, b, c.\n\nBut that seems computationally intensive. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a, b, c, since they are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, and Q is their pairwise products.\n\nLet me think about possible triples (a, b, c). Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps we can assume an order, like a \u2264 b \u2264 c, and then account for permutations.\n\nBut before that, maybe it's better to consider specific cases where two variables are equal or some other symmetry.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that in the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, since P = abc, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + ac + bc) - 2,000,000\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor out ab:\n\nabc = ab(100 + c) + ac(100) + bc(100) - 2,000,000 ?\n\nWait, no, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:\n\nabc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000\n\nHmm, maybe factor:\n\nabc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 100^2 (a + b + c) = 100^2 * 300 - 2,000,000\n\nWait, let's see: adding and subtracting 100^2*(a + b + c) which is 10000*300 = 3,000,000.\n\nSo:\n\nabc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 3,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000\n\nSo the left side becomes:\n\nabc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor:\n\nLooking at abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc, perhaps factor as ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b). Wait, let's try:\n\nabc -100ab -100ac -100bc = ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c. So substitute:\n\nab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c)\n\n= ab(c - 100) - 100c*(300 - c)\n\nHmm, maybe that's a way to proceed.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nWait, no, earlier step was:\n\nabc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nSo substituting the expression:\n\nab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) + 3,000,000 = 1,000,000\n\nSo:\n\nab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that a, b, c are each less than or equal to 300. So maybe think about the cases where one of them is 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, let's consider if one of a, b, c is 0.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then the equations become:\n\na + b = 300\n\nAnd the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000\n\nSo 300ab = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000\n\nSo with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000, we can solve for a and b.\n\nLet me set a and b as roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nCompute discriminant D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSo sqrt(D) = 100.\n\nThus, a = [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400/2)=200 or (200/2)=100.\n\nSo a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.\n\nSo when c=0, we have two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since the problem is symmetric, each permutation counts, so we need to consider all permutations where one variable is 0, and the other two are 200 and 100.\n\nWait, but since c was set to 0, and a and b are 200 and 100 in some order, the number of triples is the number of permutations of (200,100,0). The number of distinct permutations is 3! / 1! (since all are distinct) = 6. Wait, but wait, 200,100,0 are all distinct, so yes, 6 permutations.\n\nWait, but in this case, c is fixed at 0, so (a,b,c) can be (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). So that's 6 triples.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions when one variable is 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if when two variables are 0, but then the third would be 300, and the second equation would be 0, which is less than 6,000,000, so no solutions there.\n\nSo, so far, 6 solutions when one variable is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when none of a, b, c is zero. So a, b, c \u2265 1.\n\nIn this case, perhaps we can make substitutions to reduce the variables.\n\nLet me set x = a - 1, y = b - 1, z = c - 1. Then x, y, z are nonnegative integers, and:\n\na = x + 1\n\nb = y + 1\n\nc = z + 1\n\nSo, the sum a + b + c = (x + y + z) + 3 = 300 => x + y + z = 297.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nExpressed in terms of x, y, z, it becomes:\n\n(x+1)\u00b2(y+1) + (x+1)\u00b2(z+1) + (y+1)\u00b2(x+1) + (y+1)\u00b2(z+1) + (z+1)\u00b2(x+1) + (z+1)\u00b2(y+1) = 6,000,000\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps expanding and simplifying can help.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(x+1)\u00b2(y+1) = (x\u00b2 + 2x + 1)(y + 1) = x\u00b2y + x\u00b2 + 2xy + 2x + y + 1\n\nSimilarly, (x+1)\u00b2(z+1) = x\u00b2z + x\u00b2 + 2xz + 2x + z + 1\n\nAnd similarly for the others.\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the earlier equation:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nWhere Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc.\n\nGiven that a, b, c \u22651, Q can be as small as when a=1, b=1, c=298: Q=1*1 + 1*298 + 1*298 = 1 + 298 + 298 = 600. But in our earlier analysis, Q must be at least 20,000, so that's way larger. So in this case, a, b, c can't be too small.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are all \u226510, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that if a, b, c are all \u226510, then perhaps a\u00b2b would be significant. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the case where two variables are equal, say a = b.\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nNow, the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, no, better to compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = a^3\n\na\u00b2c = a\u00b2(300 - 2a)\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = a^3\n\nb\u00b2c = a\u00b2(300 - 2a)\n\nc\u00b2a = (300 - 2a)^2 a\n\nc\u00b2b = (300 - 2a)^2 a\n\nSo adding all together:\n\na^3 + a^2(300 - 2a) + a^3 + a^2(300 - 2a) + a*(300 - 2a)^2 + a*(300 - 2a)^2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na^3 + a^3 = 2a^3\n\na^2(300 - 2a) + a^2(300 - 2a) = 2a^2(300 - 2a) = 600a^2 - 4a^3\n\nc\u00b2a terms: 2a*(300 - 2a)^2\n\nSo total expression:\n\n2a^3 + 600a^2 -4a^3 + 2a*(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2a^3 -4a^3) = -2a^3\n\nSo:\n\n-2a^3 + 600a^2 + 2a*(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000\n\nLet me compute 2a*(300 - 2a)^2:\n\nFirst, expand (300 - 2a)^2 = 90000 - 1200a +4a\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 2a: 2a*90000 = 180,000a; 2a*(-1200a) = -2400a\u00b2; 2a*4a\u00b2 = 8a^3\n\nSo:\n\n-2a^3 + 600a^2 + 180,000a -2400a\u00b2 +8a^3 = 6,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2a^3 +8a^3) =6a^3\n\n(600a^2 -2400a^2) = -1800a^2\n\nSo overall:\n\n6a^3 -1800a^2 +180,000a =6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 6 to simplify:\n\na^3 - 300a^2 +30,000a =1,000,000\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation: a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 =0\n\nLet me try to find integer roots. Possible roots are factors of 1,000,000, but since a must be \u2264150 (since 2a \u2264300, as c=300-2a must be \u22650), possible a is between 1 and 150.\n\nLet me try a=100: 100^3 =1,000,000; 300a\u00b2=300*10,000=3,000,000; 30,000a=3,000,000. So:\n\n1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 =0. So a=100 is a root.\n\nSo we can factor (a -100) out of the cubic equation.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide a\u00b3 -300a\u00b2 +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a -100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1  -300   30000  -1000000\n\n          100   -20000    1000000\n\n      1   -200   10000        0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a -100)(a\u00b2 -200a +10,000)=0\n\nSo the other roots come from a\u00b2 -200a +10,000=0\n\nDiscriminant D=40,000 -40,000=0\n\nSo a=(200)/2=100. So a=100 is a double root.\n\nThus, the only solution is a=100, which gives c=300 -2a=100.\n\nSo when a=b=100, c=100.\n\nThus, the triple is (100,100,100). Since a=b=c=100, this is a single solution, but considering permutations, it's just one unique triple since all are equal.\n\nWait, but in this case, since a=b, we already considered a specific case. So in the case where a=b=100, c=100, it's a single solution. But wait, in the general case, when a=b=c=100, it's one solution, but since we're considering a=b, perhaps we have to account for the permutations.\n\nWait, no, in this specific case, when a=b=100, c=100, so all three are equal, so there's only one such triple.\n\nSo that's another solution.\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\na + b + c =100+100+100=300, correct.\n\nSecond equation: a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nEach term is 100\u00b2*100=1,000,000. There are six terms, so total is 6,000,000, which matches.\n\nSo that's one solution.\n\nNow, so far, we have 6 solutions where one variable is 0, and two are 200 and 100, and one solution where all are 100.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier when I considered a=b=100, c=100, that's one solution, but in the case where a=b, I found that a=100 is the only solution, leading to c=100. So that's the only solution in that symmetric case.\n\nNow, are there other cases where two variables are equal, but not all three?\n\nLet me consider a=b\u2260c.\n\nSo, let me assume a=b, then c=300 -2a.\n\nWe already saw that when a=100, c=100, which gives the symmetric solution. But are there other values of a where a\u2260c, but a=b?\n\nWait, let's try a=50. Then c=300-2*50=200.\n\nCheck the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nSince a=b=50, c=200:\n\n=50\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +50\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*200 +200\u00b2*50 +200\u00b2*50\n\n= (2500*50)+(2500*200)+(2500*50)+(2500*200)+(40,000*50)+(40,000*50)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2500*50 = 125,000\n\n2500*200 = 500,000\n\nSo two of each: 2*125,000 = 250,000 and 2*500,000=1,000,000\n\n40,000*50=2,000,000, and there are two of those: 4,000,000\n\nTotal sum: 250,000 +1,000,000 +4,000,000 =5,250,000, which is less than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe try a=150, then c=0, but that's the case where c=0, which we've already considered.\n\nWait, perhaps a=125, c=50.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n=125\u00b2*125 +125\u00b2*50 +125\u00b2*125 +125\u00b2*50 +50\u00b2*125 +50\u00b2*125\n\nCompute each term:\n\n125\u00b2=15,625\n\n15,625*125=1,953,125\n\n15,625*50=781,250\n\nSo terms:\n\n1,953,125 +781,250 +1,953,125 +781,250 + (2500*125)*2\n\nWait, 50\u00b2=2500, 2500*125=312,500, two terms: 625,000\n\nSo total:\n\n1,953,125 +781,250 = 2,734,375\n\nAnother 1,953,125 +781,250 = 2,734,375\n\nPlus 625,000.\n\nTotal: 2,734,375 +2,734,375 =5,468,750 +625,000=6,093,750, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's over.\n\nHmm, so maybe a=125 gives a sum larger than 6,000,000. So perhaps the only solution when a=b is when a=100, c=100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying a=110, c=80.\n\nCompute the sum:\n\na=110, b=110, c=80.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n110\u00b2*110 = 12,100*110=1,331,000\n\n110\u00b2*80=12,100*80=968,000\n\nSo terms:\n\n1,331,000 +968,000 +1,331,000 +968,000 +80\u00b2*110*2\n\n80\u00b2=6,400; 6,400*110=704,000; two terms: 1,408,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n1,331,000 +968,000 =2,299,000\n\nAnother 1,331,000 +968,000=2,299,000\n\nPlus 1,408,000.\n\nTotal: 2,299,000 +2,299,000=4,598,000 +1,408,000=5,006,000, which is less than 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so perhaps a=110 gives a sum of 5,006,000, which is below the target. So maybe the only a where a=b and the sum is 6,000,000 is when a=100.\n\nSo, so far, we have 6 solutions where one variable is 0, and two variables are 200 and 100, and one solution where all are 100.\n\nNow, let's check if there are other cases where two variables are equal, but not all three, and the sum is 6,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider cases where two variables are equal and the third is different, but we've already seen that a=100 is the only case where a=b=c=100 works.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: Let's suppose that one of the variables is 100, and the others are arranged such that the sum is 300 and the second equation is satisfied.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to consider that the only solutions are when one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100, or when all are 100.\n\nWait, but let's check another case. Suppose a=200, b=100, c=0, which we've already considered. Another possibility is when two variables are 100 and the third is 100, which is the case where all are 100.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are other cases where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. But we've already considered that.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider the equation 100Q - P =2,000,000.\n\nWe can write P =100Q -2,000,000.\n\nNow, since Q =ab + ac + bc, and P=abc.\n\nWe can think of Q as being at least 20,000, as before.\n\nNow, let's consider that for a, b, c \u22651, perhaps Q can be written as ab + ac + bc = Q.\n\nWe can also note that for a + b + c =300, the expression ab + ac + bc can be written in terms of (a + b + c)^2.\n\nWe know that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + ac + bc).\n\nSo, ab + ac + bc = [ (a + b + c)^2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ] / 2 = (300\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)) / 2\n\nBut not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the identity that for three variables:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the correct identity.\n\nThe correct identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.\n\nThe correct identity is:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ?\n\nNo, that's not right. Let me check:\n\nThe expansion of (a + b + c)^3 is:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a^2b + 3a^2c + 3ab^2 + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + 6abc\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a^2b + a^2c + ab^2 + b^2c + ac^2 + bc^2) + 6abc\n\nBut the problem's second equation is a^2b + a^2c + ab^2 + b^2c + ac^2 + bc^2 =6,000,000.\n\nSo,\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc\n\nGiven that a + b + c =300, so 300^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 18,000,000 + 6abc\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\nFrom the second equation, a^2b + a^2c + ... =6,000,000.\n\nSo,\n\n300^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 18,000,000 + 6abc\n\nCompute 300^3: 27,000,000\n\nSo,\n\n27,000,000 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 18,000,000 + 6abc\n\nSubtract 18,000,000:\n\n9,000,000 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe express a^3 + b^3 + c^3 in terms of S, Q, P.\n\nWe know that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.\n\nSo:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 300^3 - 3*300*Q + 3P\n\nFrom earlier, 300^3=27,000,000\n\nSo:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 =27,000,000 -900Q +3P\n\nFrom the equation above:\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nWait, no, from earlier, we had:\n\n9,000,000 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 +6abc\n\nSo,\n\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nBut also, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 =27,000,000 -900Q +3P\n\nSo,\n\n27,000,000 -900Q +3P =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nBut P=100Q -2,000,000, so substitute:\n\n27,000,000 -900Q +3*(100Q -2,000,000) =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nSimplify:\n\n27,000,000 -900Q +300Q -6,000,000 =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(27,000,000 -6,000,000) + (-900Q +300Q) =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nSo,\n\n21,000,000 -600Q =9,000,000 -6abc\n\nRearrange:\n\n21,000,000 -9,000,000 =600Q -6abc\n\n12,000,000 =600Q -6abc\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n2,000,000 =100Q - abc\n\nBut wait, earlier we had P=100Q -2,000,000, which is abc=100Q -2,000,000.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, from earlier, P=100Q -2,000,000.\n\nSo abc=100Q -2,000,000.\n\nBut from the equation above, 2,000,000=100Q -abc.\n\nWhich would imply:\n\n100Q -abc=2,000,000\n\nBut we have abc=100Q -2,000,000.\n\nSo substituting abc into the equation:\n\n100Q - (100Q -2,000,000) =2,000,000\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n100Q -100Q +2,000,000=2,000,000\n\nWhich is 2,000,000=2,000,000, an identity.\n\nSo, this doesn't give us new information. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't helping.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Since we've found the case where one variable is 0, giving 6 solutions, and the case where all variables are 100, giving 1 solution, perhaps these are the only solutions. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's consider another case: Suppose two variables are 150, and the third is 0. Then a + b + c=150+150+0=300.\n\nThen, compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nSince c=0, this becomes a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a.\n\nWhich is ab(a + b) = ab*300.\n\nSo 300ab=6,000,000 => ab=20,000.\n\nWith a=150, b=150: ab=22,500, which is more than 20,000. So that doesn't work.\n\nSo, in this case, a=150, b=150, c=0 would give ab=22500, leading to 300*22500=6,750,000>6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nSo perhaps, when two variables are 150, it's too big. So maybe other cases where two variables are larger than 100 but not 150.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider a=200, b=100, c=0, which we've already considered. So that's 6 permutations.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that the only solutions are when one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100, or when all variables are 100. Are there any other possibilities?\n\nLet me try to see if there are solutions where none of the variables are 0 or 100.\n\nSuppose a=150, b=150, c=0. As before, that gives ab=22500, which leads to 300*22500=6,750,000>6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nWhat about a=120, b=120, c=60.\n\nCompute Q=ab +ac + bc=120*120 +120*60 +120*60=14,400 +7,200 +7,200=28,800.\n\nP=abc=120*120*60=864,000.\n\nThen 100Q - P=100*28,800 -864,000=2,880,000-864,000=2,016,000\u22602,000,000. Close, but not exact.\n\nHmm, perhaps a=130, b=130, c=40.\n\nQ=130*130 +130*40 +130*40=16,900 +5,200 +5,200=27,300.\n\nP=130*130*40=676,000.\n\n100Q -P=2,730,000 -676,000=2,054,000\u22602,000,000.\n\nHmm, still not matching.\n\nWhat about a=140, b=140, c=20.\n\nQ=140*140 +140*20 +140*20=19,600 +2,800 +2,800=25,200.\n\nP=140*140*20=392,000.\n\n100Q -P=2,520,000 -392,000=2,128,000>2,000,000.\n\nHmm, still higher.\n\nWait, perhaps a=110, b=110, c=80.\n\nQ=110*110 +110*80 +110*80=12,100 +8,800 +8,800=29,700.\n\nP=110*110*80=968,000.\n\n100Q -P=2,970,000 -968,000=2,002,000, which is very close to 2,000,000, but not exactly.\n\nHmm, perhaps a=100, b=100, c=100, which gives Q=3*100*100=30,000, P=1,000,000.\n\nThen 100Q -P=3,000,000 -1,000,000=2,000,000. Perfect, that's our known solution.\n\nWait, but when a=110, b=110, c=80, we get 2,002,000, which is just 2,000 more than needed. So perhaps there are other solutions where a, b, c are close to 100 but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that when a, b, c are all 100, it's the only solution where all are equal.\n\nNow, let me think about whether there are other triples where none are equal, and none are zero.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to think that the only solutions are the ones we've found: the 6 permutations of (200,100,0) and the single solution (100,100,100).\n\nWait, but wait, when a=200, b=100, c=0, we have 6 permutations, and when a=b=c=100, that's one solution.
