      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nThe problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.\n\n1. The sum of all the items is 30.\n2. The unique mode is 9. So, 9 appears more times than any other number, and it's the only number that does that.\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.\n\nAnd the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.\n\n- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. If all numbers appear the same number of times, there is no mode. But here, the unique mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.\n- **Median**: The middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, the median must be an integer, which means that if there's an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number. Also, this median isn't present in the list.\n\nOkay, so let's think about the structure of the list.\n\nSince the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the list can't be too long. Let's consider how many numbers are in the list.\n\nThe mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice. But to be the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear three times, and so on.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible lengths of the list.\n\nSuppose the list has n elements.\n\nCase 1: n is odd.\n\nThen, the median is the middle element, which is the ((n+1)/2)th element. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, the middle element must be a number that isn't present in the list. Also, because the list is sorted, the median would be between the two middle numbers if n were even, but if n is odd, the median is the exact middle number.\n\nWait, no\u2014if n is odd, the median is the middle number, which is present in the list. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, that can't happen if n is odd because the median is an element of the list. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nAh, that's a key point. So, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if n were odd, the median would be an element in the list, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nSo, n is even. Let me denote n as 2k, where k is an integer. Then, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. Since the median is an integer not in the list, the average of these two elements must be an integer, which implies that the two middle numbers are either both even or both odd (so their sum is even). But the median itself isn't in the list, so these two middle numbers can't be equal to the median.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014if the two middle numbers are both the same, then the median would be that same number. But that number would be in the list, which is not allowed. Therefore, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average must be an integer not present in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer not in the list? Wait, no\u2014if 9 is the mode, it must appear multiple times. So if 9 is in the list, but the median is 9, that's a problem because the median would be in the list. But wait, no\u2014the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if the two middle numbers are, say, 8 and 10, the median is 9, which isn't in the list. But 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number. So, 9 must appear at least twice, but in this case, it's not in the middle.\n\nWait, but if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, then the median is 9, which is not present in the list. But 9 is the mode, so it must appear somewhere else in the list.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's possible. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of n.\n\nSince the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the maximum possible n is 30 (if all numbers are 1), but since we have a mode of 9, which is a relatively large number, the list can't be too long.\n\nLet me try to figure out the minimal and maximal possible n.\n\nThe minimal n is determined by the mode. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. But to be the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if other numbers appear at most once, then 9 can appear twice. But if other numbers appear more, 9 must appear more.\n\nBut wait, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear three times, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the minimal case where 9 appears twice. Then, all other numbers can appear at most once. So, the minimal n is 2 (just two 9s, but sum would be 18, which is less than 30). So, we need more numbers.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me denote:\n\nLet the number of 9s be m.\n\nSince 9 is the unique mode, m > the count of any other number.\n\nSo, if any other number appears t times, m > t.\n\nSo, to minimize the number of elements, we can have m as small as possible, but since m has to be greater than the counts of other numbers, we can have m = 2, but then all other numbers can appear at most once.\n\nWait, but if m=2, then other numbers can appear once, but 9 is the mode, so 2>1.\n\nSo, possible.\n\nBut let's see: sum of the list is 30.\n\nIf m=2, then the sum contributed by 9s is 18. The remaining sum is 12, which needs to be distributed among other numbers, each appearing once or twice, but not more than 1 time (since m=2 is the maximum count).\n\nWait, but if other numbers can appear twice, but m=2, so they can appear up to 1 time. Wait, no\u2014if m=2, then other numbers can appear at most once, because if any other number appears twice, m would not be the unique mode.\n\nWait, no\u2014if another number appears twice, m must be greater than that, so m must be at least 3.\n\nAh, right. So, if m=2, no other number can appear twice or more. So, all other numbers must appear once.\n\nSo, let's try m=2.\n\nSum from 9s: 2*9=18. Remaining sum: 12. The rest of the numbers must be distinct and each appears once, and sum to 12.\n\nBut wait, the list needs to have even length because the median is not in the list.\n\nWait, n must be even. So, if m=2, the rest of the numbers are (n-2) numbers, each appearing once, and their sum is 12.\n\nSo, n-2 numbers, each at least 1, summing to 12.\n\nWhat's the minimal number of numbers needed? If all are 1s, 12 ones would sum to 12. But that's 12 numbers, which would make n=14 (2 nines and 12 ones). But let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, but the list needs to have an even number of elements, which 14 is. The median would be the average of the 7th and 8th elements.\n\nIf the list is sorted, let's arrange the numbers.\n\nWait, if we have 2 nines and 12 ones, the sorted list would be [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,...]. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no\u2014if you have 12 ones and 2 nines, the sorted list would have the ones first, then the nines. So, the list would be [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9]. Wait, that's 14 elements.\n\nSo, the 7th and 8th elements are both 1. So, the median would be (1+1)/2=1. But 1 is in the list, which contradicts the condition that the median is not in the list.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, m=2 is not sufficient because the median would end up being 1, which is in the list.\n\nSo, perhaps m needs to be higher.\n\nLet me try m=3.\n\nThen, sum from 9s is 27. Remaining sum is 30-27=3.\n\nNow, the remaining 3 needs to be distributed among other numbers, each appearing at most 2 times because m=3 is the mode, so other numbers can appear up to 2 times.\n\nWait, but if m=3, other numbers can appear at most 2 times. So, let's see.\n\nWe have 3 remaining to distribute. Let's say we have one 3, but 3 appears once. Alternatively, two 1s and one 1 (but that's three 1s, which would require m=3 to be higher than that, which it is).\n\nWait, but let's think about the minimal number of elements.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently.\n\nWe have 3 to distribute as the sum of other numbers, each appearing at most twice.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- One 3: sum=3, count=1. So, n=3+3=6? Wait, no. Wait, m=3 (number of 9s), and then one 3. So total numbers would be 3+1=4. But n must be even.\n\nWait, n=4. Let's check.\n\nSorted list: [3,9,9,9]. The median would be (9+9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list, which is not allowed. So, that's no good.\n\nAnother option: distribute the remaining 3 as 1+2.\n\nSo, one 1 and one 2. Each appears once. So, total numbers: 3 (nines) +1+1=5. But n=5 is odd, which we can't have. So, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, distribute the remaining 3 as three 1s. So, three 1s. Then, total numbers: 3 (nines) +3 (ones)=6. So, n=6.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which are 1 and 9. So, (1+9)/2=5. 5 is an integer not in the list. That works!\n\nSo, let's check the conditions:\n\n1. Sum: 3*9 + 3*1 =27+3=30. Good.\n\n2. Mode is 9, which appears three times. All other numbers (just 1) appear three times as well. Wait, no\u2014wait, 1 appears three times, same as 9. So, both 9 and 1 are modes. But the problem says the unique mode is 9. So, this doesn't work because we have two modes: 9 and 1.\n\nAh, that's a problem. So, this configuration doesn't satisfy the unique mode condition.\n\nSo, we need to adjust. Let's see.\n\nIf m=3, and the remaining sum is 3, but we can't have any other number appearing three times because that would tie with 9 for mode.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of three 1s, we have two 1s and one 2.\n\nSo, sum is 1+1+2=4. But wait, we only have 3 left. So, that's not possible. Alternatively, one 1 and two 1s? No, that's three 1s again.\n\nWait, maybe we can have one 3. So, one 3, which is sum=3. Then, the numbers are three 9s and one 3. So, n=4. But n=4 is even, so the median is average of 2nd and 3rd elements.\n\nSorted list: [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can have two 1s and one 1? No, that's three 1s again, which causes the mode issue.\n\nHmm, maybe m=3 isn't working. Let's try m=4.\n\nThen, sum from 9s is 4*9=36. But 36 is more than 30, which is the total sum. So, that's impossible. So, m can't be 4.\n\nWait, so m can be at most 3 because 4*9=36>30.\n\nSo, m=3 is the maximum possible.\n\nBut with m=3, we have sum of 27, so remaining sum is 3. But as we saw, that leads to either having another number appearing three times, which conflicts with the unique mode, or having numbers that cause the median to be in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider more numbers with higher values. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m=3, and the remaining sum is 3, but the other numbers are arranged such that the two middle numbers are different, leading to a median that's not in the list.\n\nWait, let's try m=3 and the remaining sum is 3, but spread across more numbers.\n\nFor example, two 1s and one 1, but that's three 1s again. Alternatively, one 2 and one 1, but that's sum=3, with two numbers: 1 and 2. So, total numbers would be 3 (nines) +2 (1 and 2) =5, which is odd. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, three 1s, which as before, gives n=6, but causes a tie in mode.\n\nWait, maybe if I have other numbers besides 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but the remaining sum is 3, so I can't have numbers larger than 3 because 3 is the remaining sum.\n\nWait, maybe the remaining numbers are 3. So, one 3. Then, n=4, but that leads to median being 9, which is in the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=3, and the remaining sum is 3, but the other numbers are arranged in such a way that the two middle numbers are different, leading to a median not in the list.\n\nWait, let's try to structure the list.\n\nSuppose we have three 9s, and the remaining three sum to 3, but with more numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps we have one 3 and two 0s, but 0 isn't allowed because the numbers are positive integers.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the remaining sum is 3, but distributed as 1,1,1. So, three 1s. So, total numbers: 3+3=6.\n\nBut as before, the sorted list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is (1+9)/2=5, which is not in the list. But the problem is that both 9 and 1 appear three times, so they are both modes, which violates the unique mode condition.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to have m=4, but that's impossible because 4*9=36>30.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to see if m=3 can work with a different distribution.\n\nSuppose m=3, sum from 9s is 27. Remaining sum is 3. Let's have one 3 and two 0s, but 0 isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, one 2 and one 1, sum=3. So, numbers: 9,9,9,2,1. That's 5 numbers, which is odd. Not allowed.\n\nWait, but n has to be even. So, perhaps 6 numbers: three 9s, one 2, and two 1s. Wait, that's sum=27+2+2=31, which is over.\n\nWait, no: three 9s (27), one 2, and two 1s (sum=2+1+1=4). Total sum=31, which is over 30. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, three 9s, one 1, and one 2. So, numbers: 9,9,9,1,2. Sum=27+1+2=30. So, n=5, which is odd. But n must be even.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, three 9s, one 3. Sum=27+3=30. So, n=4. Sorted list: [3,9,9,9]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nSo, that's not working.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have more numbers with smaller values, but without causing the mode issue.\n\nWait, perhaps m=3, and the remaining sum is 3, but spread across more numbers, each appearing once.\n\nFor example, three 1s: sum=3, but as before, that leads to two modes.\n\nAlternatively, one 3: sum=3, but that leads to n=4, which as before, gives median=9.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the median condition.\n\nThe median is an integer not in the list. So, if the list has 2k elements, the median is (a_k + a_{k+1})/2, which is an integer, say m, and m is not in the list.\n\nAlso, the list is sorted, so a_1 \u2264 a_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 a_{2k}.\n\nSince m is the median, it's between a_k and a_{k+1}.\n\nSo, if m is not in the list, then a_k < m < a_{k+1}.\n\nWait, because if a_k \u2264 m \u2264 a_{k+1}, but m is not in the list, then either a_k < m < a_{k+1}, or m is equal to one of them but not in the list. Wait, but if m equals a_k or a_{k+1}, then it would be in the list, which contradicts the condition. So, m must lie strictly between a_k and a_{k+1}.\n\nSo, a_k < m < a_{k+1}.\n\nAnd m is an integer, so a_k < m < a_{k+1}.\n\nTherefore, a_k and a_{k+1} must be such that their average is m, which is an integer.\n\nSo, a_k and a_{k+1} must be equidistant from m.\n\nWait, for example, if a_k = m - d and a_{k+1} = m + d, their average is m.\n\nBut since a_k < m < a_{k+1}, d must be at least 1.\n\nSo, a_k = m -1 and a_{k+1} = m +1, then their average is m.\n\nAlternatively, a_k = m -2 and a_{k+1}=m +2, average is m.\n\nBut in any case, a_k and a_{k+1} must be such that their average is m, an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, for example, if m=5, then a_k and a_{k+1} could be 4 and 6, or 3 and 7, etc.\n\nSo, let's think about possible m values.\n\nWhat possible m could there be?\n\nWell, the sum is 30, and the list has positive integers.\n\nLet me think of possible m values.\n\nIf the list has 6 elements (n=6), then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.\n\nSo, for example, if the list is [a,b,c,d,e,f], sorted.\n\nThen, median is (c + d)/2.\n\nWe need (c + d)/2 = m, integer not in the list.\n\nAlso, the mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's try n=6.\n\nLet me try to construct a list of 6 numbers.\n\nWe need the sum to be 30.\n\nMode is 9, so 9 appears at least twice, more than any other number.\n\nSo, let's say 9 appears three times.\n\nThen, sum from 9s is 27. Remaining sum is 3, to be distributed among 3 other numbers.\n\nBut each of these other numbers can appear at most twice, since 9 appears three times.\n\nWait, but if we have three other numbers, each appearing once, their sum is 3.\n\nSo, for example, three 1s.\n\nSo, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (1 +9)/2=5, which is not in the list. That works.\n\nBut the problem is that 9 appears three times, and 1 appears three times as well. So, both are modes. But the problem states that the mode is unique, which is 9. So, this doesn't work.\n\nSo, we need to have 9 appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, if 9 appears three times, other numbers can appear at most twice.\n\nBut in this case, other numbers (just 1) appear three times, which ties with 9. So, that's not allowed.\n\nSo, we need to adjust.\n\nLet me try to have 9 appear three times, and the remaining sum distributed as two numbers, each appearing once, and one number appearing once as well.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, have 9 appear three times, and the remaining sum is 3, which can be split as 2 and 1.\n\nSo, numbers: 9,9,9,2,1,1.\n\nWait, sorted list: [1,1,2,9,9,9].\n\nSum: 9*3 + 2 +1+1=27+4=31. Oh, that's over 30.\n\nWait, no, 2+1+1=4, plus 27=31. So, that's too much.\n\nWait, we need the remaining sum to be 3.\n\nSo, 9 appears three times (sum=27), remaining sum=3.\n\nSo, numbers: 9,9,9, and three 1s.\n\nBut that's six numbers: [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Sum=30. But as before, both 9 and 1 are modes.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, can we have 9 appear three times, and the remaining sum=3 distributed as one 3 and two 0s? No, 0s not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, one 2 and one 1, but that's sum=3, but then n=5, which is odd.\n\nWait, perhaps n=6 is the way to go, but we need to arrange the numbers such that no other number appears three times.\n\nSo, let's try 9 appears three times, and the remaining sum=3 is split into numbers that appear at most twice.\n\nFor example, one 3: sum=3, appearing once.\n\nSo, the list would be [3,9,9,9, x, y], but wait, n=6. Wait, 9 appears three times, 3 appears once, and the remaining two numbers must sum to 0, which isn't possible because they're positive integers.\n\nWait, no: 3*9=27, plus 3=30, so the other three numbers must be zero, which isn't allowed. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, two 1s and one 1: but that's three 1s, which causes the mode issue.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps n=8.\n\nLet me try n=8.\n\nSo, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements.\n\nWe need that average to be an integer not in the list.\n\nAlso, the mode is 9, appearing more times than any other number.\n\nLet me try m=4 (number of 9s). Sum from 9s is 36, which is over 30. So, can't have m=4.\n\nSo, m=3.\n\nSum from 9s=27. Remaining sum=3.\n\nSo, with n=8, we have 8-3=5 other numbers.\n\nThese five numbers must sum to 3, and each can appear at most twice (since m=3 is the mode).\n\nWait, five numbers summing to 3, each at least 1.\n\nThe minimal sum is 5*1=5, which is more than 3. So, that's impossible.\n\nSo, n=8 isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe m=2.\n\nSum from 9s=18. Remaining sum=12.\n\nn=8, so 8-2=6 other numbers, summing to 12.\n\nEach can appear at most once, because if any appears twice, m=2 wouldn't be the unique mode.\n\nWait, no\u2014if m=2, other numbers can appear at most once, because if any appears twice, m=2 isn't the unique mode.\n\nWait, no\u2014if another number appears twice, m=2 is still the mode because 2>2? No, if another number appears twice, then m=2 is not greater than that. So, m=2 can't be the mode if any other number appears twice.\n\nSo, to have m=2 as unique mode, all other numbers must appear at most once.\n\nSo, in n=8, 2 nines and 6 other numbers, each appearing once, summing to 12.\n\nSo, the six numbers must sum to 12, each being at least 1.\n\nThe minimal sum for six numbers is 6, so 12 is possible.\n\nFor example: six numbers are 1,1,1,1,1,7. But wait, that's sum=1+1+1+1+1+7=12. But 7 appears once, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but let me arrange the list.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,1,1,1,7,9,9].\n\nWait, n=8, so the 4th and 5th elements are both 1. So, median is (1+1)/2=1, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, spread the numbers more.\n\nLet me have the six numbers as 1,1,2,3,3,2. Wait, but that would have duplicates. Wait, but each number can appear only once.\n\nWait, no, because if any number appears twice, m=2 wouldn't be the unique mode.\n\nSo, all six numbers must be distinct? No, not necessarily, but they can't appear more than once.\n\nWait, but if I have six numbers, each appearing once, their sum is 12.\n\nSo, possible combination: 1,2,3,4,1,1. Wait, no, that's duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps 1,2,3,4,1,1 is invalid because 1 appears three times, which would make m=3, which conflicts with m=2.\n\nSo, all six numbers must be distinct? Because if any number appears twice, m=2 isn't the unique mode.\n\nWait, no\u2014if a number appears twice, m=2 is not the mode because another number appears twice as well. So, to have m=2 as the unique mode, all other numbers must appear at most once.\n\nTherefore, the six numbers must all be distinct and sum to 12.\n\nWhat's the minimal sum for six distinct positive integers? It's 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is more than 12. So, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, n=8 with m=2 is impossible because the six other numbers can't sum to 12 while being distinct and positive.\n\nSo, n=8 isn't possible with m=2.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try n=10.\n\nWait, n=10 would require the median to be the average of the 5th and 6th elements.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf m=3, sum from 9s=27, remaining sum=3.\n\nSo, 10-3=7 other numbers, summing to 3. Each can appear at most twice.\n\nBut 7 numbers summing to 3: minimal sum is 7 (all 1s), which is more than 3. So, impossible.\n\nSo, n=10 isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe n=6 is the only possible even number, but we saw that with m=3, it causes a mode conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps m=4 is impossible because sum exceeds 30.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the remaining numbers after 9s can have duplicates, but not exceeding the count of 9s.\n\nWait, let me think again about n=6.\n\nIf m=3, sum=27, remaining sum=3.\n\nWe have to have three other numbers summing to 3, each appearing at most twice.\n\nWait, but three numbers summing to 3, each at least 1. The only way is 1,1,1. But that gives three 1s, which ties with m=3 for 9s, causing a mode conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have two 1s and one 1, but that's the same as above.\n\nWait, unless we have one 3 and two 0s, but 0s aren't allowed.\n\nSo, seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the list has more 9s.\n\nWait, m=4: sum=36>30. Not allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the list has m=3, and the remaining sum=3 is achieved with one 3 and two 0s, but 0s aren't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, one 2 and one 1, but that's sum=3, but n=5, which is odd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWhat if the list has m=3, and the remaining sum=3 is achieved with one 3 and two 0s, but 0s are invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining numbers are 1,1,1, which causes mode conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to have more 9s but not too many.\n\nWait, maybe m=3, sum=27, remaining sum=3, but with two numbers: one 2 and one 1.\n\nSo, n=5: 9,9,9,2,1. Sum=30. But n=5 is odd, so median is the 3rd element, which is 9. Which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, n=6: 9,9,9,2,1, something. Wait, sum is 27+2+1=30. So, the sixth number must be 0, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, no, 27+2+1=30, so n=6, but that's 3 nines, 2, and 1. So, the sorted list is [1,2,9,9,9, something]. Wait, no, n=6, so it's [1,2,9,9,9, x], but x must be 0, which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, no, sum is 27+2+1=30, so the sixth number must be 0, which is invalid. So, that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the list has m=3, and the remaining sum=3 is achieved with one 3 and two 0s, but 0s are invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the list has m=3, and the remaining sum=3 is achieved with one 3, but that makes n=4, which as before, gives median=9, which is in the list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the list has m=3, and the remaining sum=3 is achieved with one 3 and two 0s, but 0s are invalid.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles here.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach.\n\nPerhaps the median is 8, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, averaging to 8.\n\nBut 9 is in the list, but 8 isn't.\n\nWait, but 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's try to construct a list where the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, making the median 8, which isn't in the list.\n\nLet me try n=6.\n\nSo, the list would be [a,b,c,d,e,f], sorted.\n\nMedian is (c + d)/2 =8, so c=7 and d=9.\n\nSo, the list is [a,b,7,9,e,f], with a \u2264 b \u22647 \u22649 \u2264 e \u2264f.\n\nSum of the list is 30.\n\nAlso, mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nWe have two 9s so far (in positions d and e or f? Wait, d is 9, but e and f could be 9 as well.\n\nWait, let's structure the list as [a,b,7,9,9,9], which has three 9s.\n\nSum: a + b +7 +9+9+9= a +b +25=30. So, a +b=5.\n\nSince a and b are positive integers, possible pairs are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1).\n\nSo, let's pick a=1 and b=4.\n\nSo, the list is [1,4,7,9,9,9]. Sum=1+4+7+9+9+9=39. Wait, that's over 30.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in this case, the sum is a +b +7 +9+9+9= a +b +25=30. So, a +b=5.\n\nSo, a=1, b=4: sum=1+4=5. So, total sum=5+25=30.\n\nSo, the list is [1,4,7,9,9,9]. Let's check:\n\n- Sum:1+4+7+9+9+9=39. Wait, that's 39, not 30. Wait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, no, the sum of a and b is 5, plus 7, plus 3*9=27. So, 5+7+27=39. That's way over.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, in the list [a,b,7,9,e,f], d=9, but e and f could be 9 as well, making three 9s.\n\nBut that leads to a sum of 25 + a +b =30, so a +b=5.\n\nBut then, a and b are positive integers, so possible a=1, b=4.\n\nBut then, the list is [1,4,7,9,9,9], sum=1+4+7+9+9+9=39>30.\n\nThat's not acceptable.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have fewer 9s.\n\nIf I have two 9s, then sum from 9s is 18. Then, a +b +7 +9 +e +f=30.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two middle numbers are 8 and 8, but that would make the median 8, which is in the list if 8 is present. But 8 isn't in the list.\n\nWait, no, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 8, the median is 8, which would be in the list if 8 is present. But if 8 isn't present, that's not possible because the two middle numbers must be 8 each, but 8 isn't in the list.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, making median 8, which isn't in the list.\n\nSo, let's try again.\n\nList: [a,b,7,9,e,f], with a \u2264 b \u22647 \u22649 \u2264e \u2264f.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +e +f=30.\n\nAlso, mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nSo, sum becomes a +b +7 +9 +9 +9= a +b +34=30. Impossible because a +b would be negative.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, have two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSo, sum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +f= a +b +25 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=5.\n\nBut a and b are at least 1, so a +b \u22652. Then f=5 - (a +b) \u22643.\n\nSo, f can be 3, and a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,7,9,9,3]. Wait, but we need to sort it.\n\nWait, sorted list would be [1,1,3,7,9,9].\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are 3 and7. Their average is (3+7)/2=5, which is the median.\n\n5 is not in the list, which is good.\n\nNow, check the mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice, 3,7 appear once. So, both 1 and 9 are modes. But the problem says the mode is unique, which is 9. So, this doesn't work.\n\nSo, we need to have 9 appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's try three 9s.\n\nBut as before, that leads to sum exceeding 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have four 9s, but that's sum=36>30.\n\nNo good.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 8 and 8, but that would require 8 to be in the list, which it isn't.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 6 and 10, averaging to 8.\n\nBut then, 6 and 10 are in the list, and 8 isn't.\n\nBut let's try that.\n\nList: [a,b,6,10,e,f], sorted.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +10 +e +f=30.\n\nAlso, mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s.\n\nSo, e=9, f=9.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +10 +9 +9= a +b +34=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +10 +9 +f= a +b +25 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=5.\n\nAgain, a +b \u22652, so f \u22643.\n\nLet's set f=3, then a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,3,6,9,10].\n\nMedian is (3+6)/2=4.5, which isn't an integer. So, that's not acceptable because the median must be a positive integer.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are 5 and 11, averaging to 8.\n\nBut let's try.\n\nList: [a,b,5,11,e,f].\n\nSum: a +b +5 +11 +e +f=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nSum: a +b +5 +11 +9 +9= a +b +34=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSum: a +b +5 +11 +9 +f= a +b +25 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=5.\n\na +b \u22652, so f \u22643.\n\nLet f=3, a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,3,5,9,11].\n\nMedian is (3+5)/2=4, which is an integer not in the list. Good.\n\nNow, check the mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice. So, both are modes. Not allowed.\n\nSo, need 9 to appear more times.\n\nBut if I add another 9, making three 9s, sum becomes 1+1+3+5+9+9+9=37>30. Not allowed.\n\nSo, this doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating.\n\nWait, perhaps the median is 8, achieved by two middle numbers 7 and 9.\n\nSo, list: [a,b,7,9,e,f], sorted.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +e +f=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nLet's have three 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +9= a +b +34=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +f= a +b +25 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=5.\n\na +b \u22652, so f \u22643.\n\nLet f=3, a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,3,7,9,9].\n\nMedian is (3+7)/2=5, which is not in the list. Good.\n\nNow, check mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice. So, both are modes. Not allowed.\n\nSo, need 9 to appear more times.\n\nBut adding another 9 makes sum=1+1+3+7+9+9+9=39>30. Not allowed.\n\nSo, stuck again.\n\nWait, perhaps the median is 6, achieved by two middle numbers 5 and7.\n\nSo, list: [a,b,5,7,e,f], sorted.\n\nSum: a +b +5 +7 +e +f=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nSum: a +b +5 +7 +9 +9= a +b +30=30. So, a +b=0. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSum: a +b +5 +7 +9 +f= a +b +21 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=9.\n\nWith a +b \u22652, f \u22647.\n\nLet me choose f=7, then a +b=2.\n\nSo, a=1, b=1.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,5,7,9,7]. Wait, but sorted, it's [1,1,5,7,7,9].\n\nNow, check the mode: 7 appears twice, 1 appears twice, 9 appears once. So, modes are 1 and7. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, f=6, a +b=3.\n\nSo, a=1, b=2.\n\nSorted list: [1,2,5,6,9,6]. Wait, sorted: [1,2,5,6,6,9].\n\nMode is 6, which appears twice. 9 appears once. So, mode is 6, which contradicts the requirement that mode is 9.\n\nAlternatively, f=5, a +b=4.\n\na=1, b=3.\n\nSorted list: [1,3,5,5,9,5]. Wait, sorted: [1,3,5,5,5,9].\n\nMode is 5, which appears three times. 9 appears once. So, mode is 5, which is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, f=4, a +b=5.\n\na=1, b=4.\n\nSorted list: [1,4,5,4,9,4]. Wait, sorted: [1,4,4,4,5,9].\n\nMode is 4, appears three times. 9 appears once. So, mode is 4, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, perhaps the median is 7, achieved by two middle numbers 6 and8.\n\nSo, list: [a,b,6,8,e,f], sorted.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +8 +e +f=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +8 +9 +9= a +b +32=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: e=9, f>9.\n\nSum: a +b +6 +8 +9 +f= a +b +23 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=7.\n\na +b \u22652, so f \u22645.\n\nLet f=5, a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,5,6,8,9].\n\nMedian is (5+6)/2=5.5, which isn't an integer. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, f=4, a +b=3.\n\na=1, b=2.\n\nSorted list: [1,2,4,6,8,9].\n\nMedian is (4+6)/2=5, which is not in the list. Good.\n\nNow, check mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So, mode is 9, unique. Perfect.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nList: [1,2,4,6,8,9].\n\nWait, sum is 1+2+4+6+8+9=30. Yes.\n\nMode is 9, appears once. Wait, no, only once. So, that's not enough. Because mode is the most frequent number, which here is 9, but it appears once. All other numbers appear once as well. So, there is no mode, which contradicts the condition.\n\nAh, right. So, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, in this case, 9 appears once, same as others. So, no unique mode.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, we need 9 to appear at least twice.\n\nSo, let's adjust.\n\nLet me have two 9s: e=9, f=9.\n\nBut then, sum is a +b +6 +8 +9 +9= a +b +32=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, have three 9s: e=9, f=9, but that would require sum= a +b +6 +8 +9 +9= a +b +32=30. Impossible.\n\nSo, can't have three 9s.\n\nWait, perhaps have two 9s and another number appearing once.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nList: [1,2,4,6,8,9,9]. But that's n=7, which is odd. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, n=8.\n\nWait, let me try n=8.\n\nList: [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h], sorted.\n\nMedian is (d +e)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.\n\nLet me try to have d=6 and e=8, median=7, which isn't in the list.\n\nSo, list: [a,b,c,6,8,f,g,h].\n\nSum: a +b +c +6 +8 +f +g +h=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nSo, let's have three 9s: f=9, g=9, h=9.\n\nSum: a +b +c +6 +8 +9 +9 +9= a +b +c +41=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two 9s: f=9, g>9.\n\nSum: a +b +c +6 +8 +9 +g +h= a +b +c +23 +g +h=30.\n\nSo, a +b +c +g +h=7.\n\nBut a, b, c are at least 1, so a +b +c \u22653. Thus, g +h \u22644.\n\nBut g and h are \u22659, which is impossible because 9+9=18>4.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the median is an integer not in the list, and the mode is 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the list has two 9s, and the remaining numbers are arranged such that the two middle numbers average to a number not in the list.\n\nWait, let's try n=6.\n\nList: [a,b,c,d,e,f], sorted.\n\nMedian is (c +d)/2.\n\nLet me set c=7 and d=9, so median=(7+9)/2=8, which isn't in the list.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +e +f=30.\n\nAlso, mode is 9, appearing more than any other number.\n\nSo, let's have two 9s: d=9, e=9.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +f= a +b +25 +f=30.\n\nSo, a +b +f=5.\n\na +b \u22652, so f \u22643.\n\nLet f=3, a +b=2. So, a=1, b=1.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,7,9,9,3]. Sorted: [1,1,3,7,9,9].\n\nMedian is (3+7)/2=5, which isn't in the list. Good.\n\nNow, check the mode: 9 appears twice, 1 appears twice. So, both are modes. Not allowed.\n\nSo, need 9 to appear more times.\n\nBut if I add another 9, making three 9s, sum becomes 1+1+3+7+9+9+9=39>30. Not allowed.\n\nSo, stuck again.\n\nWait, perhaps the list has four numbers: [a,b,c,d], sorted.\n\nMedian is (b +c)/2.\n\nLet me set b=8 and c=10, so median=9, which isn't in the list.\n\nSum: a +8 +10 +d=30.\n\nAlso, mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.\n\nBut in this case, 9 isn't in the list, so that's a problem. Because mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number. But if 9 isn't in the list, how can it be the mode?\n\nAh, right, 9 must be in the list.\n\nSo, this approach won't work.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the list has two 9s, and the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, making median 9, which isn't in the list.\n\nBut 9 is in the list as two of the numbers.\n\nWait, let's try.\n\nList: [a,b,8,10,c,d], sorted.\n\nWait, no, n=6.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nList: [a,b,8,10,c,d], sorted.\n\nBut 9 must be in the list. So, perhaps c=9.\n\nSo, list: [a,b,8,9,10,d], sorted.\n\nWait, but then the two middle numbers are 8 and9, median=8.5, which isn't integer. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, list: [a,b,8,9,10,d], sorted.\n\nTwo middle numbers are 8 and9, median=8.5. Not integer.\n\nSo, not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, list: [a,b,7,9,c,d], sorted.\n\nTwo middle numbers 7 and9, median=8, not in the list.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +c +d=30.\n\nMode is 9, appearing more times.\n\nSo, let's have two 9s: c=9, d=9.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +9= a +b +34=30. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, one 9: c=9, d>9.\n\nSum: a +b +7 +9 +9 +d= a +b +25 +d=30.\n\nSo, a +b +d=5.\n\na +b \u22652, so d \u22643.\n\nBut d must be \u22659, which is impossible.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to list possible configurations that meet the sum and mode conditions, then check the median.\n\nGiven that the sum is 30, and the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.\n\nLet me consider m=3 (9 appears three times).\n\nSum from 9s:27. Remaining sum:3.\n\nWe need to distribute 3 among other numbers, each appearing at most twice.\n\nPossible distributions:\n\n- One 3: sum=3. So, numbers are 9,9,9,3. Sum=30. But n=4, which is even.\n\nSorted list: [3,9,9,9]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\n- Three 1s: sum=3. Numbers:9,9,9,1,1,1. Sum=30. n=6.\n\nSorted list: [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Median is (1+9)/2=5, which is not in the list. Good.\n\nBut mode: 9 appears three times, 1 appears three times. Both are modes. Not allowed.\n\n- Two 1s and one 1: same as above.\n\n- One 2 and one 1: sum=3. Numbers:9,9,9,2,1. Sum=30. n=5, which is odd.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.\n\nThe list of positive integers has three main properties:\n\n1. The sum of the items is 30.\n2. The unique mode is 9.\n3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sum of all the numbers is 30. So whatever numbers we have, when we add them all together, they should total 30.\n\nNext, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, I need to have at least two 9s, but more than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times, right? Because if another number appears twice, 9 needs to appear more than that to be the unique mode.\n\nWait, actually, the mode is the most frequent. So if another number appears the same number of times as 9, then it's not unique anymore. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list.\n\nThen, the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. That's interesting. So, the median is some number that's not in the list, but it's a positive integer, and it's the median.\n\nOkay, so I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nLet me think about the median. The median depends on whether the list has an odd or even number of elements. If there are an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the median is an integer, that might impose some conditions on the list.\n\nWait, but if the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of two middle numbers. But the median is an integer, so the average must be integer. That means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd so their sum is even, so their average is integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is just the middle number, which is an integer, but it's not in the list. So, that would be a problem because if the list has an odd number of elements, the middle number must be part of the list. So, if the median is not in the list, then the list must have an even number of elements. Because in an odd-length list, the median is an element of the list.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if the median isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because for an odd-length list, the median is the middle element, so it's part of the list. So, since the median is not in the list, the list must be even in length. Therefore, the number of elements in the list is even.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of elements as n, where n is even. Let's say n=2k, so the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.\n\nSo, the median is an integer not present in the list, so the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not in the list. Therefore, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is integer, but that average isn't present in the list.\n\nAlso, all numbers are positive integers.\n\nSo, putting this together, let's outline what I know:\n\n- Sum of list = 30\n- Mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number\n- Number of elements is even, n=2k\n- The median is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which is an integer not in the list.\n\nAlright, so let's think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by considering the number of 9s in the list.\n\nSince 9 is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's assume the minimum number of 9s required to be the unique mode.\n\nSuppose another number appears m times. Then 9 must appear at least m+1 times. To minimize the number of 9s, I should maximize m, but ensuring that 9 still has a higher count.\n\nBut since I want the sum to be 30, having too many 9s might make the sum too big or too small. Let's see.\n\nWait, 9 is a relatively large number. So if I have too many 9s, the sum would be high. Let's see: if I have four 9s, that's 36, which is more than 30. So that's too much. So the maximum number of 9s can be three because 3*9=27, which leaves 30-27=3 for the other numbers. But wait, 3 is a small number. Let's see.\n\nWait, but 3 is small, but the list must have at least n elements. Let's think about how many elements we can have.\n\nWait, the list must have an even number of elements because the median is not present. So, let's think about the possible number of elements.\n\nLet me consider different possibilities for n, the number of elements.\n\nCase 1: n=4.\n\nThen, the sum is 30. Let's see if that's possible. Let's have 9 as the mode. So, we need at least two 9s, but maybe more.\n\nWait, if n=4, the median would be the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. Let's say the list is [a, b, c, d], sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nThe median is (b + c)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, (b + c) must be even, so b and c are both even or both odd.\n\nAlso, the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, in a list of four elements, 9 must appear at least twice. Because if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times to be the unique mode.\n\nWait, but in a list of four elements, the maximum number of 9s is four. Let's try with three 9s.\n\nSo, three 9s and one other number.\n\nSum is 9*3 + x = 27 + x = 30. So x=3.\n\nSo the list would be [3,9,9,9], but wait, that's four elements. Let's sort it: [3,9,9,9]. The median is (9 + 9)/2 =9, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if I have two 9s. Then, the other two numbers can be different or same.\n\nBut wait, if I have two 9s, then other numbers can't have two of the same number, because then the mode wouldn't be unique.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If I have two 9s, and another number also appears twice, then 9 isn't the unique mode. So, to have a unique mode of 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, in a list of four elements, if 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once. So, the other two elements must be distinct or both 1s, but that would make two 1s, which would tie with 9 as mode. So, that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, in the case of n=4, if 9 is the unique mode, it must appear at least three times. But as we saw, that leads to the median being 9, which is in the list, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, n=4 doesn't seem to work.\n\nCase 2: n=6.\n\nLet's try n=6. So, six elements. Let's see.\n\nSum is 30, so average is 5. But with mode 9, so 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nIn a list of six elements, the mode must appear at least three times, because if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.\n\nSo, let's try with three 9s.\n\nSum from 9s is 27, so remaining sum is 3. So, we have three more numbers to add, each at least 1, and no other number can appear more than two times.\n\nWait, but in six elements, three 9s, and the other three numbers must sum to 3. So, each of the other three numbers is 1, since 1+1+1=3.\n\nSo, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Let's sort it: [1,1,1,9,9,9].\n\nNow, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. The 3rd element is 1, the 4th is 9. So, (1 + 9)/2 = 5. So the median is 5, which is an integer and not in the list. That fits the conditions.\n\nWait, let me check all conditions:\n\n1. Sum is 1+1+1+9+9+9=30. Correct.\n\n2. Mode is 9, which appears three times. All others appear once or three times? No, the 1s appear three times as well. Wait, wait, no. The list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. So 1 appears three times, 9 appears three times. So, they both have the same count. So, the mode isn't unique. That's a problem because the mode is supposed to be unique, 9.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so in this case, having three 9s and three 1s leads to a tie in the mode. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, what can I do? Maybe have four 9s.\n\nWait, n=6, four 9s: sum from 9s is 36, which is more than 30. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three 9s, but the other numbers are different. So, for example, two 1s and one 2.\n\nSum from 9s: 27. Remaining sum: 3. So, 1,1,1. But that brings us back to the previous problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have the other numbers sum to 3, but not all the same. So, for example, two 1s and one 1, but that's still three 1s. Alternatively, 1,1,1, which is three 1s. So, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, can I have two 1s and one 2? Then sum is 1+1+2=4. 27+4=31, which is more than 30. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1, 2, 0. But 0 isn't a positive integer, so that's invalid.\n\nHmm, seems like with n=6, having three 9s, the remaining sum is 3, which requires three 1s, which ties with 9 for mode.\n\nSo, perhaps n=6 isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe I can have four 9s, but that would require sum 36, which is over 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two 9s and other numbers. But then, if I have two 9s, the other numbers can't have two of the same, because that would make the mode not unique.\n\nSo, in that case, with two 9s, the remaining four numbers must all be distinct or appear once.\n\nWait, but four numbers, each at least 1, sum to 30 - 2*9=12.\n\nSo, 12 split into four distinct positive integers. Hmm, 1,2,3,6 sum to 12. So, the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Let's sort it: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. The median is (3 +6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So that's a problem because the median must be an integer.\n\nAlternatively, can I split 12 into four numbers such that the two middle numbers are both even or both odd so their average is integer.\n\nWait, let's try numbers that are both even or both odd.\n\nLet me think of four numbers that sum to 12.\n\nLet me try 2,2,4,4. Sum is 12. But then 2 and 4 each appear twice. So, in the list, we have two 9s, two 2s, two 4s. So, the modes would be 2,4,9, each appearing twice. So, the mode isn't unique. So that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,5,5: sum is 12. Then, modes are 1,5,9 each appearing twice. Again, not unique.\n\nHmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe 1,3,4,4: sum is 12. Then, 4 appears twice, 9 appears twice. So, modes are 4 and 9. Not unique.\n\nAlternatively, 1,2,4,5: sum is 12. All appear once. So, the list would be [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9]. Median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, 3,3,3,3: sum is 12, but that's four 3s. So, modes are 3 and 9, each appearing four and two times. So, 3 is the mode. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe n=6 isn't the right number of elements.\n\nLet me try n=8.\n\nSo, n=8. Let's see.\n\nSum is 30. Let's try to have 9 as the mode.\n\nSo, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nLet's try with four 9s. Sum from 9s is 36, which is over 30. Not possible.\n\nThree 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum: 3. So, five more numbers, each at least 1, sum to 3. But 5 numbers summing to 3: only possible if four are 1 and one is -1, which isn't allowed. So, that's impossible.\n\nWait, no, positive integers. So, five numbers each at least 1: minimum sum is 5. So 3 is too small. So, three 9s won't work.\n\nSo, perhaps two 9s. Then, sum from 9s is 18. Remaining sum is 12, spread over six numbers.\n\nBut in this case, the other numbers can't have more than one occurrence each, because otherwise, if another number appears twice, 9 is the mode only if it appears more.\n\nWait, but if 9 appears twice, other numbers can appear at most once, but with six numbers, that would require six distinct numbers, each appearing once, but sum 12.\n\nWait, that's possible. For example, numbers 1,2,3,4,1,1: but that would have three 1s, which would tie with 9 as mode.\n\nWait, no, I can't have any other number appearing twice.\n\nWait, perhaps 1,2,3,4,1,1 is not allowed because of the duplicates. So, maybe the other six numbers are all distinct, each appearing once.\n\nSo, six distinct positive integers summing to 12. The minimum sum for six distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way more than 12. So that's impossible.\n\nSo, two 9s won't work because the remaining six numbers can't sum to 12 without duplicates, which would cause other modes.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to have more 9s but not enough to make the sum too big.\n\nWait, perhaps four 9s: sum 36, which is too much. Three 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum 3, but with five numbers, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe five 9s: sum 45, way too big.\n\nWait, maybe n=8 isn't the right number of elements.\n\nWait, maybe n=5? But earlier, I thought the list must have even number of elements because the median isn't in the list. Wait, n=5 is odd, so the median is the 3rd element, which is part of the list. So, the median is in the list, which violates the condition. So, n must be even.\n\nWait, maybe n=2.\n\nWait, n=2, two elements. Sum is 30, so two numbers adding to 30. The median is the average of the two numbers, which is 15. So, the median is 15, which must not be in the list.\n\nSo, the list would be [a,30 - a], with a < 15 < 30 - a. So, a must be less than 15, and 30 - a must be greater than 15. So, a <15, and 30 -a >15 \u2192 a <15.\n\nSo, for example, [14,16]. Median is 15, which is not in the list. So, that works.\n\nNow, mode is 9. But in a list of two elements, the mode is the number that appears most frequently. So, unless both numbers are same, there's no mode. Or, if both are same, that's the mode.\n\nWait, but in this case, if the list is [9,21], then both numbers are unique, so no mode. Alternatively, if the list is [9,21], but that doesn't have a mode. So, to have a unique mode of 9, both numbers must be 9. But then sum is 18, which is less than 30. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the list has two 9s, but then sum is 18, which is less than 30. So, can't do that.\n\nSo, n=2 is impossible because we can't have a mode of 9 with two elements, unless both are 9, which doesn't sum to 30.\n\nSo, n=2 is out.\n\nSo, maybe n=6 is the way to go, but earlier attempts didn't work. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps in n=6, having four 9s is too much, but three 9s plus three 1s causes a tie in mode. So, maybe I can have four 9s and two other numbers, but that would require the sum of 9s to be 36, which is over 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three 9s, one 3, and two 0s, but 0 isn't positive.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps n=8 isn't the right approach. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me try to consider the median.\n\nThe median is an integer not in the list. So, in the case of even n, the median is (a_k + a_{k+1})/2 = m, an integer not in the list.\n\nSo, a_k + a_{k+1} = 2m.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers add up to 2m, which is even.\n\nAlso, m is not in the list.\n\nSo, perhaps, for example, the two middle numbers are m-1 and m+1, which sum to 2m. So, their average is m, which is not in the list.\n\nThat could be a way to construct the list.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nSo, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the mode. But 9 is in the list, which is a problem because the median (9) is not in the list.\n\nWait, no, the median is 9, which is in the list. So, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, their average is 9. So, the median is 9, which is not in the list. That works.\n\nSo, let's try to make the two middle numbers 7 and 11. Then, the median is 9, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, now, let's try to build the list around that.\n\nSo, the list would have numbers less than or equal to 7, then 7, 11, and numbers greater than or equal to 11.\n\nWait, but 7 and 11 are the two middle numbers.\n\nWait, let's think of n=6.\n\nSo, the list would be [a, b, 7, 11, d, e], sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, no, for n=6, the two middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th elements. So, a_3=7, a_4=11.\n\nSo, the list would be [x, y, 7, 11, z, w], sorted.\n\nWait, but to have 7 and 11 as the middle elements, the first three elements must be less than or equal to 7, and the last two must be greater than or equal to 11.\n\nBut wait, the list is sorted, so a_1 \u2264 a_2 \u2264 a_3=7 \u2264 a_4=11 \u2264 a_5 \u2264 a_6.\n\nSo, the first three elements are \u22647, and the last two are \u226511.\n\nNow, the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.\n\nWait, but 9 is greater than 7, so in the first three elements, the maximum is 7. So, 9 can't be in the first three elements.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because 9 is the mode, it needs to appear multiple times. But in this setup, the first three elements are \u22647, so 9 can't be in those. The fourth element is 11, which is higher than 9. So, where can 9 be?\n\nIt must be in the last two elements. But the last two elements are \u226511, so 9 can't be there either. So, that's a contradiction. So, this setup doesn't allow 9 to be in the list.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps having the two middle numbers as 7 and 11 isn't feasible because 9 can't be in the list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, but then the median is 9, which is in the list. Which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, but 9 is the mode, so it has to be in the list.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to have the two middle numbers as 9 and something else, but that would make the median 9, which is in the list. Which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are both 9, but that would make the median 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, the two middle numbers are both something else, say 8 and 10, which average to 9. So, the median is 9, which is not in the list.\n\nWait, but then 9 isn't in the list, which contradicts the mode being 9. Because the mode is the most frequent number, which has to be in the list. So, that's impossible.\n\nWait, so perhaps the median is 9, which is not in the list, but the mode is 9, which is in the list. So, how can that happen?\n\nBecause the median is 9, which is not in the list, but 9 is the mode, which is in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to construct such a list.\n\nLet me think of n=6.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers sum to 18 (since median is 9). So, a_3 + a_4 = 18.\n\nSo, possible pairs: (8,10), (7,11), (9,9). But (9,9) would make the median 9, which is in the list. So, that's not allowed. So, the other two pairs are possible.\n\nLet me try a_3=8 and a_4=10.\n\nSo, the list would be [x, y, 8, 10, z, w], sorted.\n\nNow, the numbers before 8 must be \u22648, and numbers after 10 must be \u226510.\n\nBut 9 must be the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 has to be in the list. Let's say 9 is one of the elements after 10. But wait, z and w are \u226510, so 9 can't be there. So, 9 must be in the first three elements.\n\nBut the first three elements are x, y, 8. So, 9 can be either x, y, or 8.\n\nBut 9 is greater than 8, so it can't be in the first three elements. Because the list is sorted, so x \u2264 y \u22648.\n\nSo, 9 can't be in the first three elements. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 9 is in the last two elements. But in that case, z and w are \u226510, so 9 can't be there either.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, in this setup, 9 can't be in the list, which is required because the mode is 9.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, as before, but then 9 can't be in the list. So, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are 10 and 8, which sum to 18, same as before.\n\nBut same issue: 9 can't be in the list because it's between 8 and 10, but the list is sorted, so 9 would have to be in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps n=8.\n\nSo, let's try n=8.\n\nThe two middle numbers are a_4 and a_5. Their sum is 2m, where m is the median.\n\nSo, a_4 + a_5 = 2m.\n\nSo, if m=9, then a_4 + a_5=18.\n\nSo, possible pairs: (8,10), (7,11), (9,9).\n\nBut (9,9) would make the median 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nSo, let's take a_4=8 and a_5=10.\n\nSo, the list would be [x, y, z, 8,10, v, w, u], sorted.\n\nWait, no, for n=8, the two middle numbers are the 4th and 5th elements.\n\nSo, the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h], sorted.\n\nSo, d=8, e=10.\n\nSo, the list is [a, b, c, 8,10, f, g, h], sorted.\n\nSo, a \u2264 b \u2264 c \u22648 \u226410 \u2264f \u2264g \u2264h.\n\nNow, 9 must be the mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 has to be in the list.\n\nBut where can 9 be? It has to be between 8 and 10, but in the sorted list, 8 is the 4th element, 10 is the 5th.\n\nSo, 9 can be in the 5th position, but that's already 10.\n\nWait, no, the list is sorted, so 9 must be between 8 and 10. So, perhaps 9 is in the 5th position, but then 10 is after that.\n\nWait, no, in the list, after 8 comes 9, then 10, but in this setup, the 5th element is 10.\n\nSo, 9 can't be in the list because after 8 comes 10. So, 9 would have to be between 8 and 10, but in the list, 8 is followed by 10. So, 9 can't be there.\n\nWait, unless the 5th element is 9, but then the 5th element is 10, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to have 9 in the list somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps 9 is in the first four elements. But the first four elements are \u22648, so 9 can't be there.\n\nAlternatively, 9 is in the last four elements. But the last four elements are \u226510, so 9 can't be there either.\n\nSo, that's a problem. So, in this setup, 9 can't be in the list, which is necessary because 9 is the mode.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust the two middle numbers to allow 9 to be in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 9 and something else, but that would make the median 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are such that one is 9, but then the median would be 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nSo, this seems like a dead end.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are both 9, but that makes the median 9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two middle numbers are 10 and 8, which sum to 18, making the median 9, not in the list.\n\nBut then, as before, 9 can't be in the list because it's between 8 and 10.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about the list structure.\n\nWe need 9 to be the mode, so it must appear more frequently than any other number.\n\nAlso, the sum is 30.\n\nThe median is an integer not in the list, so the list must have an even number of elements.\n\nLet me try n=8 again, but with a different approach.\n\nSuppose the list has four 9s. Sum from 9s is 36, which is over 30. Not possible.\n\nThree 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum: 3. So, five more numbers summing to 3, which is impossible because five positive integers must sum to at least 5.\n\nTwo 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum:12. So, six numbers summing to 12.\n\nBut in this case, the other numbers can't have duplicates, because otherwise, the mode would be tied.\n\nWait, but six numbers summing to 12. Let's see, 1+1+1+1+1+6=11, which is too low. 1+1+1+1+2+6=12. So, numbers are 1,1,1,1,2,6. So, the list would be [1,1,1,1,2,6,9,9]. Sorted: [1,1,1,1,2,6,9,9].\n\nNow, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements: (1 +2)/2=1.5, which is not an integer. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the numbers such that the two middle numbers add to an even number.\n\nWait, let's try to have the two middle numbers as 3 and 5, which sum to 8, making the median 4. But 4 is not in the list.\n\nSo, let's construct the list with that in mind.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are 3 and 5. So, the list would be [a, b, 3,5,c,d,e,f], sorted. Wait, no, for n=8, the two middle numbers are 4th and 5th.\n\nSo, the list is [x, y, z, 3,5, w, v, u], sorted.\n\nWait, no, the two middle numbers are 4th and 5th elements, which are 3 and5. So, the list is [a,b,c,3,5,d,e,f], sorted.\n\nWait, but 3 is the 4th element and 5 is the 5th. So, the list is:\n\na \u2264 b \u2264 c \u22643 \u22645 \u2264d \u2264e \u2264f.\n\nBut 3 is the 4th element, which is \u22645, but 3 can't be greater than 5. Wait, that can't be. Because in a sorted list, the 4th element is less than or equal to the 5th.\n\nSo, 3 \u22645, which is correct.\n\nNow, the sum is 30. Let's compute the sum.\n\nSo, the list has:\n\na, b, c,3,5,d,e,f.\n\nWe need to have 9 as the mode. So, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 has to be in the list. Let's say 9 is one of d, e, f, since a,b,c are \u22643.\n\nSo, let's set d=9.\n\nThen, the list becomes [a,b,c,3,5,9,e,f], sorted.\n\nNow, a,b,c \u22643, and e,f \u22659.\n\nBut wait, after 9 comes e and f, which are \u22659.\n\nBut the list is sorted, so e and f must be \u22659.\n\nNow, the sum is a + b + c +3 +5 +9 +e +f =30.\n\nSo, a + b + c + e + f =30 - (3+5+9) =30-17=13.\n\nSo, a + b + c + e + f =13.\n\nBut a,b,c are \u22643, and e,f \u22659.\n\nLet me assign the minimum possible to a,b,c to maximize e and f.\n\nLet\u2019s set a=1, b=1, c=1. Then, a+b+c=3.\n\nSo, e + f=13 -3=10.\n\nBut e and f are \u22659.\n\nSo, possible values:\n\nIf e=9, then f=1. But f must be \u2265e=9, so f=1 is invalid.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If e=9, then f must be \u22659.\n\nSo, e=9, f=10: sum is 19, which is more than 10.\n\nAlternatively, e=5, but that's less than 9.\n\nWait, this isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a,b,c are higher.\n\nWait, a,b,c are \u22643. Let me try a=1, b=1, c=2. Then, a+b+c=4.\n\nSo, e + f=13-4=9.\n\nBut e and f are \u22659.\n\nSo, the minimum e=9, f=0, which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, e=9, f=0: invalid.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, a=1, b=1, c=3. Sum=5.\n\nThen, e + f=13-5=8.\n\nBut e and f \u22659, so minimum e=9, which would require f= -1, which is invalid.\n\nSo, that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a=2, b=2, c=2. Sum=6.\n\ne + f=13-6=7.\n\nBut e and f \u22659, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, seems like this approach isn't working. Maybe I need a different setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 4 and 4, making the median 4, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, a_4=4, a_5=4. So, the list is [x,y,z,4,4,w,v,u], sorted.\n\nNow, the sum is x+y+z+4+4+w+v+u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z + w +v +u=18.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode, appearing more than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 must be in the list. Let's say w=9.\n\nThen, the list is [x,y,z,4,4,9,v,u], sorted.\n\nSo, z \u22644, and v \u22659.\n\nSo, x,y,z \u22644, and v,u \u22659.\n\nSum: x+y+z +4+4+9 +v +u=30 \u2192 x+y+z +v +u=10.\n\nNow, x,y,z \u22644, and v,u \u22659.\n\nLet me assign x,y,z the smallest possible to maximize v and u.\n\nx=1, y=1, z=1. Sum=3.\n\nSo, v + u=10-3=7.\n\nBut v and u are \u22659. So, v=9, u= -2: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x=1, y=1, z=2. Sum=4. v +u=6. Still too small.\n\nx=1, y=1, z=3. Sum=5. v+u=5. Still too small.\n\nx=1, y=1, z=4. Sum=6. v+u=4. Still too small.\n\nx=1, y=2, z=2. Sum=5. v+u=5.\n\nStill, v and u can't be less than 9.\n\nSo, this setup isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are 5 and 5, making the median 5, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, a_4=5, a_5=5.\n\nThe list is [x,y,z,5,5,w,v,u], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +5+5 +w +v +u=30 \u2192 x+y+z +w +v +u=15.\n\n9 must be in the list. Let's set w=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,5,5,9,v,u], sorted.\n\nSo, z \u22645, v \u22659.\n\nSum: x+y+z +9 +v +u=15 -5=10.\n\nWait, no: original sum is x+y+z +w +v +u=15.\n\nw=9, so x+y+z +v +u=6.\n\nBut x,y,z \u22645, v,u \u22659.\n\nLet me assign x=1, y=1, z=1. Sum=3.\n\nv +u=6-3=3.\n\nBut v and u must be \u22659. So, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, x=1, y=1, z=2. Sum=4. v +u=2. Still impossible.\n\nSo, this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to have more 9s.\n\nWait, let's try n=10.\n\nSum is 30.\n\nLet me have four 9s. Sum from 9s is 36, which is over 30. Not possible.\n\nThree 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum 3. So, seven numbers summing to 3. Each at least 1, which is impossible because seven 1s sum to 7.\n\nTwo 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum 12, spread over eight numbers.\n\nBut eight numbers summing to 12. Minimum sum is 8 (eight 1s). So, 12-8=4. So, distribute the extra 4 as additional 1s.\n\nSo, eight numbers: five 1s and three 2s. Sum is 5*1 +3*2=5+6=11. Still need 1 more. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe four 1s and four 2s: sum is 4+8=12. So, the list would be [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,9,9], sorted.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,9,9].\n\nNow, the two middle numbers are the 5th and 6th elements: 2 and 2. So, median is (2+2)/2=2, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the numbers differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 3 and 1. No, that's not possible because the list is sorted.\n\nWait, perhaps I can arrange the two middle numbers to be 3 and 1, but that's impossible in a sorted list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are 1 and 3, but again, in a sorted list, the middle numbers can't be 1 and 3 if the list is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,9,9].\n\nWait, in this case, the 5th element is 2, the 6th is 2. So, median is 2, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the list to have the two middle numbers sum to an even number, whose average is not in the list.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are 3 and 5, sum to 8, median 4, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try to construct the list with that in mind.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are 3 and5, making median 4.\n\nSo, for n=10, the list is [x1,x2,x3,x4,3,5,x7,x8,x9,x10], sorted.\n\nSo, x4 \u22643, x7 \u22655.\n\nNow, the sum is x1+x2+x3+x4 +3+5 +x7+x8+x9+x10=30.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3+x4 +x7+x8+x9+x10=15.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 has to be in the list.\n\nLet me set x7=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x1,x2,x3,x4,3,5,9,x8,x9,x10], sorted.\n\nSo, x4 \u22643, x8 \u22659.\n\nSum: x1+x2+x3+x4 +3+5+9 +x8+x9+x10=30.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3+x4 +x8+x9+x10=13.\n\nAlso, x4 \u22643, x8 \u22659.\n\nLet me assign x1=1, x2=1, x3=1, x4=1. Sum=4.\n\nSo, x8+x9+x10=13-4=9.\n\nBut x8 \u22659, so x8=9, x9=0, x10=0: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x8=9, x9=0, x10=0: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x8=9, x9= something, but they have to be \u22659.\n\nSo, x8=9, x9=9, x10= -9: invalid.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternatively, x4=3.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3=4.\n\nLet me set x1=1, x2=1, x3=2. Sum=4.\n\nSo, x8+x9+x10=13-4-3=6.\n\nBut x8 \u22659, which makes x8=9, but then x9 and x10 must be \u22659, so x8=9, x9=9, x10= -12: invalid.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternatively, x4=2.\n\nx1+x2+x3=3.\n\nSet x1=1, x2=1, x3=1. Sum=3.\n\nx8+x9+x10=13-3-2=8.\n\nBut x8 \u22659, so x8=9, x9=9, x10= -10: invalid.\n\nNope.\n\nThis approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are 2 and 6, sum to 8, median 4.\n\nSo, the list is [x1,x2,x3,x4,2,6,x7,x8,x9,x10], sorted.\n\nSum: x1+x2+x3+x4 +2+6 +x7+x8+x9+x10=30.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3+x4 +x7+x8+x9+x10=22.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSet x7=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x1,x2,x3,x4,2,6,9,x8,x9,x10], sorted.\n\nSum: x1+x2+x3+x4 +9 +x8+x9+x10=22 -6=16.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, original sum after subtracting 2+6=8 is 30-8=22.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3+x4 +x7+x8+x9+x10=22.\n\nWith x7=9, sum becomes x1+x2+x3+x4 +9 +x8+x9+x10=22.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3+x4 +x8+x9+x10=13.\n\nAlso, x4 \u22642, x8 \u22659.\n\nSet x4=2.\n\nSo, x1+x2+x3=1.\n\nBut they are positive integers, so minimum sum is 3 (1+1+1). So, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, x4=1.\n\nThen, x1+x2+x3=0, which is impossible.\n\nSo, this setup doesn't work.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of 9s required.\n\nTo be the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.\n\nSo, if another number appears m times, 9 must appear m+1 times.\n\nTo minimize the number of 9s, I can have another number appear as much as possible.\n\nBut since the sum is 30, having too many 9s would make the sum too big.\n\nWait, let's try with four 9s. Sum is 36, which is over 30. Not possible.\n\nThree 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum 3, with n-3 elements.\n\nLet me try n=5. But n must be even. So, n=6.\n\nThree 9s, sum 27. Remaining sum 3, with 3 elements.\n\nSo, the other three numbers must sum to 3, which can be 1,1,1.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nBut as before, this makes the mode both 1 and 9, which is a tie. So, not unique.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have two 1s and one 1: same problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the list has three 9s and three 1s, but arranged such that the two middle numbers are 1 and 9, making the median 5, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9], sorted. Wait, no, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, the two middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th elements: 1 and9. So, median is (1+9)/2=5, which is not in the list. That works.\n\nBut in this case, the mode is both 1 and9, each appearing three times. So, the mode isn't unique. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can have four 9s and two other numbers that sum to 6. But four 9s sum to 36, which is over 30.\n\nAlternatively, three 9s, and three numbers summing to 3.\n\nWait, but as before, that leads to a tie in mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three 9s and two 1s and one 2. So, sum is 9*3 +1*2 +2=27+2+2=31, which is over 30.\n\nAlternatively, three 9s, two 1s, and one 0: invalid because 0 isn't positive.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to have the other numbers not duplicate except for 9.\n\nSo, three 9s, and the rest are unique numbers.\n\nSo, for n=6, three 9s and three unique numbers.\n\nSum from 9s:27. Remaining sum:3. So, three unique positive integers summing to 3.\n\nThe only way is 1,1,1, but that duplicates. So, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,1: same problem.\n\nSo, n=6 with three 9s doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe n=7.\n\nBut n must be even, so n=8.\n\nThree 9s: sum 27. Remaining sum 3. Five numbers summing to 3.\n\nImpossible, as five positive integers sum to at least 5.\n\nSo, n=8: three 9s isn't possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have four 9s in a list with n=10.\n\nSum from 9s:36. Over 30. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two 9s and other numbers.\n\nWait, two 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum 12, with eight numbers.\n\nBut eight numbers summing to 12, each at least 1. So, minimum sum is 8, so 12-8=4 extra.\n\nSo, distribute four extra 1s as +1 to four of the numbers.\n\nSo, four 2s and four 1s.\n\nSo, the list would be [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (2 +2)/2=2, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the two middle numbers to be different.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are 3 and1, but that's impossible in a sorted list.\n\nAlternatively, have the two middle numbers as 3 and something else.\n\nWait, let me try to construct the list with two 9s, and other numbers arranged such that the two middle numbers sum to an even number, whose average isn't in the list.\n\nLet me try n=8.\n\nTwo 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum 12, spread over six numbers.\n\nLet me have the two middle numbers as 5 and5, sum to10, median 5, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as4 and6, sum to10, median5, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nSo, the two middle numbers are4 and6.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,4,6,v,w,u], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +4+6 +v +w +u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +v +w +u=14.\n\nAlso, 9 must be in the list. Let's set v=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,4,6,9,w,u], sorted.\n\nSo, z \u22644, w \u22659.\n\nSum: x+y+z +9 +w +u=14 -6=8.\n\nWait, no: original sum after subtracting 4+6=10 is 30-10=20.\n\nSo, x+y+z +v +w +u=20.\n\nBut v=9, so x+y+z +9 +w +u=20 \u2192 x+y+z +w +u=11.\n\nAlso, z \u22644, w \u22659.\n\nLet me assign z=4.\n\nSo, x+y+4 +w +u=11 \u2192 x+y +w +u=7.\n\nBut w and u are \u22659, so minimum w=9, u=9. Sum=18, which is way more than 7. Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, z=3.\n\nx+y+3 +w +u=11 \u2192 x+y +w +u=8.\n\nAgain, w and u \u22659, so impossible.\n\nSame with z=2 or 1.\n\nSo, this setup doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the two middle numbers are 5 and5, but that makes the median5, which is in the list.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as6 and4, same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to have the two middle numbers as 7 and 9, which sum to16, making the median8, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, for n=8, the two middle numbers are7 and9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,7,9,w,v,u], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +7+9 +w +v +u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=14.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode, so it must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, 9 appears at least twice.\n\nSet w=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,7,9,9,v,u], sorted.\n\nNow, z \u22647, v \u22659.\n\nSum: x+y+z +9 +v +u=14 -9=5.\n\nWait, no: original sum after subtracting 7+9=16 is 30-16=14.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=14.\n\nw=9, so x+y+z +9 +v +u=14 \u2192 x+y+z +v +u=5.\n\nBut v and u \u22659, so v=9, u= -4: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe w=9 and v=9.\n\nSo, x+y+z +9 +9 +u=14 \u2192 x+y+z +u= -4: impossible.\n\nSo, this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe the two middle numbers are8 and8, making the median8, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as8 and something else.\n\nWait, but that would require the median to be in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 8 and10, sum to18, median9, which is not in the list.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nFor n=8, the two middle numbers are8 and10.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,8,10,w,v,u], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +8+10 +w +v +u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=12.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSo, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, let's set w=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,8,10,9,v,u], sorted.\n\nWait, but in a sorted list, after 8 comes9, then10, then v and u.\n\nSo, the list would be [x,y,z,8,9,10,v,u], sorted.\n\nSo, z \u22648, v \u226510.\n\nSum: x+y+z +8 +9 +10 +v +u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +v +u=3.\n\nBut x,y,z \u22651, so x+y+z \u22653. Thus, v +u=0: impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe z=8, x=1,y=1,z=8.\n\nSum x+y+z=10.\n\nSo, v +u=12 -10=2.\n\nBut v and u \u226510. So, v=10, u=2: but u must be \u2265v=10. So, u=2 is invalid.\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are7 and11, sum to18, median9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,7,11,w,v,u], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +7+11 +w +v +u=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=12.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSet w=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,7,11,9,v,u], sorted.\n\nSo, z \u22647, v \u226511.\n\nSum: x+y+z +9 +v +u=12 -11=1.\n\nBut x,y,z \u22651, so x+y+z \u22653. So, 9 +v +u= -2: impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to try a different n.\n\nWait, let's try n=10.\n\nTwo 9s: sum18. Remaining sum12, spread over eight numbers.\n\nLet me set the two middle numbers as 5 and5, making the median5, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as4 and6, median5, not in the list.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,4,6,w,v,u,9,9], sorted.\n\nWait, but 9s are at the end. So, the two middle numbers are4 and6.\n\nSum: x+y+z +4+6 +w +v +u +9 +9=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=30 - (4+6+9+9)=30-28=2.\n\nBut x,y,z,w,v,u are positive integers, so minimum sum is6. So, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange the 9s in the middle.\n\nWait, but the two middle numbers are4 and6, so 9s can't be in the middle.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are3 and7, sum to10, median5, not in the list.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,3,7,w,v,u,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +3+7 +w +v +u +9 +9=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=30 - (3+7+9+9)=30-28=2.\n\nAgain, impossible.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as2 and8, sum10, median5.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,2,8,w,v,u,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+z +2+8 +w +v +u +9 +9=30.\n\nSo, x+y+z +w +v +u=30 - (2+8+9+9)=30-28=2.\n\nAgain, impossible.\n\nHmm, seems like this approach isn't working.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are1 and9, sum10, median5.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,z,1,9,w,v,u,9,9], sorted.\n\nBut in this case, the two middle numbers are1 and9, so the list would be [x,y,z,1,9,w,v,u,9,9], but that's not sorted correctly because 1 should come before 9.\n\nWait, actually, the two middle numbers are1 and9, so the list would be [x,y,z,1,9,w,v,u,9,9], but that's not possible because after 1 comes9, but then the list isn't sorted properly.\n\nWait, no, in a sorted list, the middle numbers must be in order. So, the 5th and 6th elements are1 and9, which can't happen because 1 <9, so the 5th element must be \u22646th.\n\nSo, it's possible if 1 is the 5th element and9 is the6th, but that would mean the first four elements are \u22641, which can only be1s.\n\nSo, the list would be [1,1,1,1,1,9,w,v,u,9], sorted.\n\nBut then, the two middle numbers are1 and9, sum10, median5.\n\nBut in this case, the list has five 1s, two 9s, and two more numbers \u22659.\n\nSum:5*1 +2*9 +w +v=5 +18 +w +v=23 +w +v=30 \u2192 w +v=7.\n\nBut w and v \u22659, so minimum w=9, v= -2: impossible.\n\nSo, this setup doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to accept that n=6 is the only possible even number and try to find a way to make it work.\n\nSo, n=6, two 9s.\n\nSum from 9s:18. Remaining sum:12, spread over four numbers.\n\nBut four numbers summing to12, each at least1, with no duplicates except for 9.\n\nWait, but if I have four numbers summing to12, with no duplicates, the numbers could be 1,2,3,6. So, the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not integer. So, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, four numbers summing to12, with two duplicates.\n\nFor example, 2,2,4,4: sum12.\n\nSo, the list is [2,2,4,4,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (4+4)/2=4, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 1,1,5,5: sum12.\n\nList: [1,1,5,5,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (5+5)/2=5, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 1,3,4,4: sum12.\n\nList: [1,3,4,4,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (4+4)/2=4, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 3,3,3,3: sum12.\n\nList: [3,3,3,3,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (3+3)/2=3, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, seems like all possibilities either have the median in the list or don't sum correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the four numbers are 1,2,2,7: sum12.\n\nList: [1,2,2,7,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (2+7)/2=4.5, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, 1,2,3,6: same as before.\n\nAlternatively, 2,2,3,5: sum12.\n\nList: [2,2,3,5,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (3+5)/2=4, which is not in the list. That works.\n\nSo, the list is [2,2,3,5,9,9], sorted.\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n\n1. Sum:2+2+3+5+9+9=30. Correct.\n\n2. Mode: 2 appears twice, 9 appears twice. So, modes are2 and9. Not unique. Problem.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, make one of the numbers appear once.\n\nWait, four numbers summing to12, with three duplicates.\n\nFor example, 1,1,1,9: sum12. But 9 is already in the list as mode.\n\nSo, list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nBut that leads to mode tie between1 and9.\n\nAlternatively, 2,2,2,6: sum12.\n\nList: [2,2,2,6,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (2+6)/2=4, not in the list.\n\nMode is2, which appears three times. 9 appears twice. So, mode is2, not9. Problem.\n\nSo, that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, three 3s and one 3: sum12. But that's four 3s.\n\nList: [3,3,3,3,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (3+3)/2=3, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, 4,4,2,2: sum12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging.\n\nWait, maybe the four numbers are 1,1,2,8: sum12.\n\nList: [1,1,2,8,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (2+8)/2=5, not in the list.\n\nMode:1 appears twice, 9 appears twice.

Not allowed.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to have the two middle numbers as non-integers, but that's impossible because all numbers are integers.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are3 and5, sum8, median4.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,3,5,z,w], sorted.\n\nWait, no, for n=6, the two middle numbers are3rd and4th.\n\nSo, the list is [a,b,3,5,c,d], sorted.\n\nSum: a +b +3 +5 +c +d=30 \u2192 a +b +c +d=17.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSo, 9 must appear more than any other number.\n\nSo, let's have c=9.\n\nSo, the list is [a,b,3,5,9,d], sorted.\n\nSo, d \u22659.\n\nSum: a +b +9 +d=17 -3 -5=9.\n\nWait, no: a +b +3 +5 +9 +d=30 \u2192 a +b +d=13.\n\nAlso, a \u2264b \u22643, d \u22659.\n\nLet me set a=1, b=1. Then, d=13 -1 -1=11.\n\nSo, the list is [1,1,3,5,9,11], sorted.\n\nCheck the conditions:\n\n1. Sum:1+1+3+5+9+11=30. Correct.\n\n2. Mode:1 appears twice, 3,5,9,11 appear once. So, mode is1. Not9.

So, invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, a=2, b=3. Then, d=13-2-3=8. Invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the two middle numbers are4 and4, making the median4, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as5 and5, median5, in the list.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps the two middle numbers are6 and6, median6, in the list.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, two middle numbers as2 and8, sum10, median5.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,2,8,z,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x +y +2 +8 +z +w=30 \u2192 x +y +z +w=18.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSo, let's set z=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,2,8,9,w], sorted.\n\nSo, y \u22642, w \u22659.\n\nSum: x +y +9 +w=18 -2 -8=8.\n\nBut x and y are \u22642.\n\nLet me set x=1, y=1.\n\nSo, 1 +1 +9 +w=8 \u2192 w= -3: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x=2, y=2.\n\n2+2+9 +w=8 \u2192 w= -5: invalid.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, set z=9 and w=9.\n\nSo, x +y +9 +9=18 \u2192 x +y=0: impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are7 and something else.\n\nWait, but I'm running out of ideas.\n\nLet me try to summarize.\n\nAfter trying multiple approaches, the only possible setup that comes close is n=6, with two 9s, and the two middle numbers as3 and5, making the median4, which isn't in the list.\n\nBut in that case, the mode isn't9 because other numbers appear twice.\n\nWait, unless I can have three 9s and three other numbers that don't duplicate.\n\nWait, but in n=6, three 9s would require the other three numbers to sum to3, which can only be1,1,1, leading to a tie in mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have three 9s and three numbers that are all different.\n\nSo, three 9s and three unique numbers.\n\nSum from 9s:27. Remaining sum:3.\n\nThree unique positive integers summing to3: only possible as1,1,1, which duplicates.\n\nSo, impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list has four 9s, but that's over the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the list has five 9s and one other number.\n\nSum:5*9=45, which is way over30.\n\nNot possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have more numbers and a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the list is [5,5,5,5,5,5], but that's all5s. Mode is5, not9. Problem.\n\nAlternatively, [6,6,6,6,6,6], same problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the list is [1,1,9,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:1+1+9+9+9+9=38.

But we need sum30.\n\nSo, add 8 more, but that would require adding 8 to the list, but then the mode might change.\n\nWait, let's see. If I have four 1s and two 9s, sum is4+18=22. Need 8 more.\n\nAdd 8 as another number: [1,1,1,1,8,9,9], but now mode is1, appears four times. 9 appears twice. So, mode is1. Not9.\n\nAlternatively, add two 4s: [1,1,1,1,4,4,9,9], sum4+8+18=30.\n\nNow, mode is1, appears four times. 4 appears twice,9 appears twice. So, mode is1. Not9.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, add three 3s: [1,1,1,1,3,3,3,9,9], sum4+9+18=31. Over.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [1,1,1,1,2,25], but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, [1,1,1,1,5,21], but sum is1+1+1+1+5+21=30.\n\nMode is1, appears four times. 5 and21 appear once. So, mode is1. Not9.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [1,1,1,1,9,17], sum1+1+1+1+9+17=30.\n\nMode is1, appears four times. 9 appears once. So, mode is1. Not9.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, [1,1,1,9,9,17], sum1+1+1+9+9+17=38. Over.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, [1,1,9,9,9,11], sum1+1+9+9+9+11=30.\n\nMode is9, appears three times. 1 appears twice, 11 once. So, mode is9. Correct.\n\nNow, check the median.\n\nList is [1,1,9,9,9,11], sorted.\n\nMedian is (9 +9)/2=9, which is in the list. Not allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the list differently.\n\nWait, but in a sorted list, the two middle numbers are9 and9, so median is9, which is in the list.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [1,1,9,9,11,9], but that's not sorted.\n\nSorted, it's [1,1,9,9,9,11], same as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the list is [1,1,1,9,9,17], sum30.\n\nBut mode is1, which appears three times. 9 appears twice.

Remaining four numbers sum12, all unique.\n\nPossible:1,2,3,6: sum12.\n\nList: [1,2,3,6,9,9], sorted.\n\nMedian is (3+6)/2=4.5, not integer.\n\nMode is9, appears twice. 1,2,3,6 appear once. So, mode is9. Correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the mode was9, but in this case, 9 appears twice, others once. So, mode is9.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9], sorted.\n\nCheck all conditions:\n\n1. Sum:1+2+3+6+9+9=30. Correct.\n\n2. Mode is9, appears twice. All others appear once. So, unique mode is9. Correct.\n\n3. Median is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. Wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. But 4.5 isn't an integer. So, that's a problem.\n\nAh, right. So, the median must be an integer. So, this setup doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, make the two middle numbers sum to an even number.\n\nSo, in the list of six numbers, the two middle numbers must sum to an even number.\n\nSo, let's try to have the two middle numbers as4 and4, sum8, median4.\n\nBut then, the list would be [x,y,4,4,z,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+4+4+z+w=30 \u2192 x+y+z+w=18.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSo, let's set z=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,4,4,9,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+9 +w=18 -4 -4=10.\n\nAlso, y \u22644, w \u22659.\n\nLet me set x=1, y=1.\n\nSo, 1 +1 +9 +w=10 \u2192 w= -1: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x=1, y=2.\n\n1+2+9 +w=10 \u2192 w= -2: invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, x=2, y=2.\n\n2+2+9 +w=10 \u2192 w= -3: invalid.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, x=3, y=3.\n\n3+3+9 +w=10 \u2192 w= -5: invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe z=9 and w=9.\n\nSo, x+y+9 +9=10 \u2192 x+y= -8: impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are5 and5, sum10, median5.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,5,5,z,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+5+5+z+w=30 \u2192 x+y+z+w=15.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSet z=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,5,5,9,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+9 +w=15 -5 -5=5.\n\nBut x,y \u22645, w \u22659.\n\nLet me set x=1, y=1.\n\nSo, 1+1+9 +w=5 \u2192 w= -6: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x=1, y=2.\n\n1+2+9 +w=5 \u2192 w= -7: invalid.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, x=5, y=5.\n\n5+5+9 +w=5 \u2192 w= -14: invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, set w=9.\n\nSo, x+y+9 +9=5 \u2192 x+y= -13: impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are6 and6, sum12, median6.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,6,6,z,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+6+6+z+w=30 \u2192 x+y+z+w=12.\n\nAlso, 9 must be the mode.\n\nSet z=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,6,6,9,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+9 +w=12 -6 -6=0.\n\nBut x,y \u22651, w \u22659.\n\nSo, x+y +w \u22651+1+9=11.

Over.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [2,3,3,4,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:2+3+3+4+9+9=30.\n\nMode:3 appears twice,9 appears twice. Not unique.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [2,2,3,5,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:2+2+3+5+9+9=30.\n\nMode:9 appears twice, others once. So, mode is9.\n\nMedian is (3+5)/2=4, which isn't in the list.\n\nYes! That works.\n\nSo, the list is [2,2,3,5,9,9], sorted.\n\nCheck all conditions:\n\n1. Sum:2+2+3+5+9+9=30. Correct.\n\n2. Mode is9, appears twice. Others appear once or twice. 2 appears twice, but 9 appears twice as well. So, mode isn't unique. Problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [2,2,4,4,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:2+2+4+4+9+9=30.\n\nMode:2,4,9 each appear twice.

Maybe the answer is that there is no such list, but the problem states that such a list exists. So, I must have missed something.\n\nWait, going back to the problem, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, perhaps the median is5, and the two middle numbers are4 and6.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,4,6,z,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+4+6+z+w=30 \u2192 x+y+z+w=14.\n\nAlso, mode is9.\n\nSet z=9.\n\nSo, the list is [x,y,4,6,9,w], sorted.\n\nSum: x+y+9 +w=14 -4 -6=4.\n\nBut x,y \u22644, w \u22659.\n\nLet me set x=1, y=1.\n\nSo,1+1+9 +w=4 \u2192 w= -7: invalid.\n\nAlternatively, x=1, y=2.\n\n1+2+9 +w=4 \u2192 w= -8: invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, set w=9.\n\nSo, x+y+9 +9=4 \u2192 x+y= -14: impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a valid list. Maybe the answer is that there is no such list, but the problem states that such a list exists. So, I must have missed something.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [1,1,2,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:1+1+2+9+9+9=31. Over.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the list is [1,1,3,9,9,9], sorted.\n\nSum:1+1+3+9+9+9=32.
