      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC, which is AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and their radii. So, the circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6.\n\nFirst, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. The inradius r is given by r = \u0394/s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for AB \u00b7 AC. Let me denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively. So, AB is opposite angle C, which is c. Wait, maybe I should get that straight.\n\nWait, no, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. So, in triangle ABC, side BC is a, AC is b, and AB is c. So, AB is c, AC is b, so AB \u00b7 AC is c*b. So, I need to find b*c.\n\nAlright. So, the product I'm looking for is b*c. Let me see if I can find expressions involving b and c.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's an interesting condition. IA is the line from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the line from circumcenter O to incenter I. So, these two lines are perpendicular. That seems like a key piece of information that might relate the positions of O and I in the triangle.\n\nI think I should draw a diagram to visualize this. Triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, perhaps triangle AIO is a right triangle at I.\n\nWait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, so in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle AIO is right-angled at I.\n\nLet me think about the positions of O and I. In any triangle, the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nIn some triangles, like in equilateral triangles, O and I coincide, but that's not the case here since the radii are different. So, in this case, O and I are distinct points.\n\nI recall that the distance between O and I can be calculated using the formula OI^2 = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me confirm that formula. Yes, I think it's OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, substituting the given values, R is 13, r is 6. So, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's helpful. So, the distance between O and I is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, in triangle AIO, we have a right triangle with legs AI and OI, and hypotenuse AO.\n\nSo, in triangle AIO, by Pythagoras' theorem, AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2 = AO\u00b2.\n\nI know AO is the distance from circumcenter O to vertex A. But in a triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is just the circumradius R, which is 13. So, AO = R =13.\n\nSo, plugging in the known values: AI\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 \u2192 AI\u00b2 +13 = 169 \u2192 AI\u00b2 = 156 \u2192 AI = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, AI is 2*sqrt(39). Now, AI is the length from inradius I to vertex A. I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the area and semi-perimeter, but AI is different. There's a formula for the length of the angle bisector, but maybe AI can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be calculated using the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. I think the formula is AI = (r) / sin(A/2). Let me verify.\n\nYes, in triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed AI = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, BI = r / sin(B/2), and CI = r / sin(C/2).\n\nSo, since we have AI = 2*sqrt(39) and r =6, we can write:\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, let me compute that again: 3 divided by sqrt(39) is equal to 3*sqrt(39)/39, which simplifies to sqrt(39)/13. Because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nNow, from trigonometry, we know that sin(A/2) = sqrt[(s - a)/s], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula. Yes, the formula for sin(A/2) is sqrt[(s - a)/s], where s is the semi-perimeter (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt[(s - a)/s] = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, let's square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n[(s - a)/s] = (39)/(169) = 3/13.\n\nSo, (s - a)/s = 3/13.\n\nLet me write that as (s - a) = (3/13) s.\n\nSo, s - a = (3/13) s \u2192 s - (3/13)s = a \u2192 (10/13)s = a.\n\nSo, a = (10/13)s.\n\nBut a is the side BC, which is opposite angle A.\n\nAlso, the semi-perimeter s is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, let me write s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut from the above, a = (10/13)s.\n\nSo, substituting a into the expression for s:\n\ns = ( (10/13)s + b + c ) / 2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n2s = (10/13)s + b + c.\n\nSubtract (10/13)s from both sides:\n\n2s - (10/13)s = b + c.\n\nCompute 2s as (26/13)s, so (26/13)s - (10/13)s = (16/13)s = b + c.\n\nSo, b + c = (16/13)s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2. So, s = ( (10/13)s + b + c ) / 2.\n\nWait, but we just found that b + c = (16/13)s. So, s = ( (10/13)s + (16/13)s ) / 2.\n\nCompute (10/13 + 16/13) s = (26/13)s = 2s.\n\nSo, s = (2s)/2 \u2192 s = s. Hmm, that's just an identity, so it doesn't give me new information.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me think about what else I know.\n\nI also know that the area \u0394 of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: using the inradius, \u0394 = r*s, and using the circumradius, \u0394 = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, \u0394 = r*s = 6s.\n\nAlso, \u0394 = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 312s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nWait, let's think about the formula for the distance AI. I have AI = 2*sqrt(39). Also, AI can be expressed as 2R sin(A/2), where R is the circumradius. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall. I think in a triangle, AI can be expressed as (r)/sin(A/2), but also, another formula might involve R.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate angle A with the sides. Let me think.\n\nSince I have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, perhaps I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, another formula that might be helpful is the formula for the sides in terms of the inradius, semi-perimeter, and angles.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for the sides: a = 2R sin A, but wait, actually, in the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A.\n\nYes, because in the Law of Sines, a/sin A = 2R.\n\nSo, a = 2R sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, if I can find sin A, that would give me a, and then I can find b and c as well.\n\nBut I have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. So, I can find sin A using the double-angle formula.\n\nSin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nCompute 39*130: 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so 3900+1170=5070. So, sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 can be factored as 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13\u00b2. So, sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2) = 13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, a = 26 sin A = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (52 sqrt(30))/13 = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = BC = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, knowing that, let me see if I can find the other sides, b and c.\n\nI also know that the area \u0394 = 6s, and \u0394 = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nBut I need to find b and c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the inradius r = \u0394/s =6.\n\nSo, \u0394 =6s.\n\nBut I also have \u0394 = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 \u2192 a*b*c = 312 s.\n\nBut I have a =4 sqrt(30), so 4 sqrt(30)*b*c = 312 s.\n\nSo, b*c = (312 s)/(4 sqrt(30)) ) = (78 s)/sqrt(30) = (78 s sqrt(30))/30 ) = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo, b*c = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nHmm, but I need to find b*c, which is the product AB\u00b7AC, which is c*b. So, that's what I'm looking for.\n\nBut I still don't know s, the semi-perimeter. Let me see if I can find s.\n\nI know that a =4 sqrt(30), and from earlier, a = (10/13)s.\n\nSo, (10/13)s =4 sqrt(30) \u2192 s = (4 sqrt(30))*(13/10) )= (52 sqrt(30))/10 = (26 sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo, s =26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nTherefore, plugging back into b*c:\n\nb*c = (13 * (26 sqrt(30)/5 ) * sqrt(30))/5.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, multiply the constants: 13 *26 = 338.\n\nThen, sqrt(30)*sqrt(30)=30.\n\nSo, numerator: 338 *30 = 10140.\n\nDenominator:5*5=25.\n\nSo, b*c= 10140/25 = 405.6.\n\nWait, but that's a decimal. Let me see if that reduces to a fraction.\n\n10140 divided by 25: 25*405=10125, so 10140-10125=15, so 405 and 15/25=405.6, which is 405 3/5. But I suspect that there might be an error in my calculation because the answer is coming out as a decimal, which seems a bit messy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nWe had:\n\na =4 sqrt(30).\n\nFrom earlier, a = (10/13)s \u2192 s = (a *13)/10 = (4 sqrt(30)*13)/10 = (52 sqrt(30))/10 = (26 sqrt(30))/5. So, s=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nThen, b*c = (13 s sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSubstituting s:\n\nb*c = (13 * (26 sqrt(30)/5) * sqrt(30))/5.\n\nCompute numerator: 13 *26=338.\n\nsqrt(30)*sqrt(30)=30.\n\nSo, numerator: 338 *30 = 10140.\n\nDenominator:5 *5=25.\n\nSo, 10140/25=405.6.\n\nHmm, that's correct, but 405.6 is 405 and 3/5, which is 2028/5.\n\nWait, 405 *5=2025, plus 3 is 2028, so yes, 2028/5.\n\nBut I feel like this might not be the simplest form or perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nAnother formula I remember is that in any triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle.\n\nSo, for sides b and c, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have \u0394 =6s, and we have sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A \u2192 6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13).\n\nSimplify: 6s = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, b*c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut earlier, I had b*c = (13 s sqrt(30))/5. Let me check if these are consistent.\n\nWait, let me compute (78 s)/sqrt(30):\n\ns is 26 sqrt(30)/5. So, 78*(26 sqrt(30)/5)/sqrt(30) = 78*26/(5) = (78*26)/5.\n\nCompute 78*26: 70*26=1820, 8*26=208, total=1820+208=2028.\n\nSo, 2028/5=405.6, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the product b*c is 2028/5, which is 405.6.\n\nBut the problem asks for AB \u00b7 AC, which is c*b, so that's 2028/5.\n\nWait, but the problem might expect an integer answer, so 2028 divided by 5 is 405.6, but that's a decimal. Maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another way to find b*c without going through s.\n\nLet me think about other relations.\n\nI know that in a triangle, (b + c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc.\n\nBut I don't know b + c or b^2 + c^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find b + c from earlier.\n\nFrom earlier, we had b + c = (16/13)s.\n\nSince s =26 sqrt(30)/5, then b + c = (16/13)*(26 sqrt(30)/5 )= (16*26 sqrt(30))/(13*5).\n\nSimplify 26/13=2, so (16*2 sqrt(30))/5 = (32 sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo, b + c =32 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nHmm, so I have:\n\nb + c =32 sqrt(30)/5,\n\nand from earlier,\n\nb*c =2028/5.\n\nWait, but that would mean that b and c are the roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - (b + c)x + b*c =0.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - (32 sqrt(30)/5)x + 2028/5 =0.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps me. Maybe I can compute this quadratic, but I don't think it's necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula for the sides in terms of the angles.\n\nWe have a =4 sqrt(30), and a =2R sin A. So, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, angle A can be found as arcsin(2 sqrt(30)/13). Let me compute that.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area in another way.\n\nWait, the area can also be expressed as \u0394 = r*s =6s.\n\nBut also, \u0394 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13, so:\n\n6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13 )= (b*c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, 6s = (b*c sqrt(30))/13.\n\nWe can rearrange to get b*c = (6s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).\n\nBut earlier, we found s=26 sqrt(30)/5, so substituting:\n\nb*c = (78 *26 sqrt(30)/5)/sqrt(30)= (78*26)/5= (2028)/5=405.6.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this is the correct answer, but it's a fractional value. But the problem says \"Find AB \u00b7 AC\", and it's possible that the answer is a fraction, but I was expecting an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe there's another formula or approach that can relate the product bc more directly.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the circumradius and the sine of the included angle. So, bc = 4R^2 sin B sin C.\n\nWait, that might be a way, but I don't know angles B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the inradius, semi-perimeter, and the sides.\n\nWait, I also know that the distance from the inradius to vertex A is AI = 2 sqrt(39), which we found earlier.\n\nBut maybe I can relate AI to the sides. There's a formula for AI in terms of the sides.\n\nI think AI = (r)/sin(A/2) as we used before, but perhaps another formula: AI = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c).\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me recall. The length of the angle bisector can be given by a formula, but AI is part of the angle bisector.\n\nWait, the formula for the length of the internal angle bisector from A is:\n\nd = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c).\n\nSo, in this case, AI is the length from the incenter to vertex A, which is part of the angle bisector. Wait, but actually, the incenter divides the angle bisector in a particular ratio.\n\nWait, yes, the incenter divides the angle bisector in the ratio (b + c):a.\n\nWait, more precisely, the inradius is located at a distance from the vertex along the angle bisector.\n\nWait, the formula for the length from the vertex to the inradius is indeed AI = (r)/sin(A/2), which we used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the formula AI = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c) is another expression.\n\nWait, so if I can express AI in two different ways, perhaps I can set up an equation.\n\nWe have AI =2 sqrt(39) = (2bc cos (A/2))/(b + c).\n\nWe already have cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13, and b + c =32 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n2 sqrt(39) = [2 bc (sqrt(130)/13)] / (32 sqrt(30)/5 )\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= [2 bc sqrt(130) /13 ] * [5 / (32 sqrt(30)) ]\n\n= (10 bc sqrt(130)) / (416 sqrt(30)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(130)/sqrt(30) = sqrt(130/30) = sqrt(13/3) = sqrt(39)/3*sqrt(3).\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(130)/sqrt(30):\n\nsqrt(130/30) = sqrt(13/3) = sqrt(39)/3.\n\nWait, because 13/3 = (13*13)/(3*13) = 169/(39). Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, sqrt(13/3) is equal to sqrt(39)/3, because sqrt(13/3)=sqrt(13*3)/3 = sqrt(39)/3.\n\nYes, so sqrt(130)/sqrt(30)=sqrt(130/30)=sqrt(13/3)=sqrt(39)/3.\n\nSo, sqrt(130)/sqrt(30)=sqrt(39)/3.\n\nSo, going back to the equation:\n\n2 sqrt(39) = [10 bc * sqrt(39)/3 ] / 416\n\nWait, wait, let me recast the denominator correctly.\n\nWait, the denominator was 32 sqrt(30)/5, and when we took the reciprocal, it's 5/(32 sqrt(30)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should recompute the right-hand side step by step.\n\nRight-hand side:\n\n[2 bc (sqrt(130)/13)] / (32 sqrt(30)/5 ) = [2 bc sqrt(130)/13 ] * [5/(32 sqrt(30)) ]\n\nMultiply the constants: 2 *5=10; 13*32=416.\n\nSo, 10/(416) =5/208.\n\nMultiply the square roots: sqrt(130)/sqrt(30)=sqrt(13/3)=sqrt(39)/3.\n\nSo, overall, RHS= (5 bc sqrt(39))/(208 *3 )= (5 bc sqrt(39))/624.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, [2 bc sqrt(130)/13 ] * [5/(32 sqrt(30)) ].\n\nMultiply numerators: 2*5=10; bc; sqrt(130).\n\nMultiply denominators:13*32=416; sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(130)/sqrt(30)=sqrt(130/30)=sqrt(13/3)=sqrt(39)/3 as before.\n\nSo, the expression becomes: [10 bc sqrt(39)/3 ] /416.\n\nWait, no, let's recompute.\n\nWait, 2 *5 =10; 13*32=416.\n\nsqrt(130)/sqrt(30)=sqrt(13/3)=sqrt(39)/3.\n\nSo, the entire expression is (10 bc * sqrt(39)/3 ) /416.\n\nWhich is (10 bc sqrt(39)) / (3*416) ) = (10 bc sqrt(39)) / 1248.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: (5 bc sqrt(39))/624.\n\nSo, RHS= (5 bc sqrt(39))/624.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n2 sqrt(39) = (5 bc sqrt(39))/624.\n\nMultiply both sides by 624:\n\n2 sqrt(39)*624 =5 bc sqrt(39).\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(39):\n\n2*624 =5 bc.\n\nSo, 1248=5 bc \u2192 bc=1248/5=249.6.\n\nWait, but earlier I had bc=2028/5=405.6.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So, that suggests I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, perhaps one of the formulas I used is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nI used AI = (2 bc cos(A/2))/(b + c). But is that correct?\n\nWait, I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector is different.\n\nWait, the formula for the length of the internal angle bisector from A is:\n\nLength = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c).\n\nBut AI is not the entire angle bisector; it's only a part of it from A to the inradius.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify that.\n\nThe incenter divides the angle bisector into two parts: from the vertex to the incenter (AI) and from the incenter to the side (which is the inradius).\n\nWait, no, actually, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to the side, not along the angle bisector.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider.\n\nThe formula AI = (r)/sin(A/2) is correct, as I used earlier, so AI=2 sqrt(39)=6/sin(A/2).\n\nWhich gave me sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for AI is AI= (bc cos(A/2))/(b + c).\n\nWait, perhaps that's where I made the mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check the formula for AI.\n\nI found a source that says AI = (r)/sin(A/2) = ( (\u0394/s) ) / sin(A/2) ).\n\nBut also, another formula is AI = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c).\n\nWait, perhaps both are correct.\n\nWait, let's compute AI using both formulas.\n\nFrom the first formula: AI=2 sqrt(39).\n\nFrom the second formula: AI= (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c).\n\nSo, if I can compute bc, then I can find AI. But since AI is known, perhaps I can set up an equation.\n\nBut earlier, using the second formula, I got a different bc than from the first method, which suggests an inconsistency.\n\nBut that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in applying the second formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula for AI is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is AI = ( (b + c) cos(A/2) ) / (1 + (b + c)/a ) ).\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, let's consider the formula AI = r / sin(A/2).\n\nWe have AI=2 sqrt(39), r=6.\n\nSo, 2 sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2) \u2192 sin(A/2)=6/(2 sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWhich we did earlier.\n\nSo, that gives us sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nFrom which we can find cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, using the formula for sin A, which is 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(4970)/169.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, sqrt(39)*sqrt(130)=sqrt(39*130)=sqrt(5070). Which is 13*sqrt(30), as we did earlier.\n\nSo, sin A=2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, that gives us a=2R sin A=26*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, from the Law of Cosines, we can relate a, b, c, and angle A.\n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use Heron's formula.\n\nHeron's formula says that \u0394= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nWe know that \u0394=6s.\n\nSo, 6s= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nSquare both sides: 36 s\u00b2 = s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nSimplify: 36 s = (s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nBut I don't know s -b and s -c, but I do know s -a= (3/13)s, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, (s -a)= (3/13)s.\n\nSo, 36 s = (3/13)s * (s -b)(s -c).\n\nDivide both sides by s: 36= (3/13)*(s -b)(s -c).\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= (36 *13)/3= 12*13=156.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nBut I also know that s -b = (s - (b)) = ( (a + b + c)/2 -b )= (a + c -b)/2.\n\nSimilarly, s -c= (a + b -c)/2.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= [(a + c -b)/2] * [(a + b -c)/2] = [ (a + c -b)(a + b -c) ] /4.\n\nWhich is [a\u00b2 - (b -c)^2 ] /4.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find (s -b) + (s -c)= 2s -b -c= a.\n\nWait, since s=(a +b +c)/2, then 2s= a +b +c.\n\nSo, (s -b)+(s -c)=2s -b -c= a.\n\nSo, the sum of (s -b) and (s -c) is a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nAnd the product is 156.\n\nSo, (s -b) and (s -c) are two numbers whose sum is 4 sqrt(30) and product is156.\n\nSo, let me denote x= s -b and y= s -c.\n\nSo, x + y=4 sqrt(30), and x*y=156.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation would be t\u00b2 - (4 sqrt(30))t +156=0.\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt= [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*1*156 ) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\n4*1*156=624.\n\nSo, discriminant=480 -624= -144.\n\nWait, negative discriminant? That can't be possible because (s -b) and (s -c) are real positive numbers.\n\nHmm, that suggests a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier, we had (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nBut s -a= (3/13)s.\n\nSo, (3/13)s*(s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nDivide both sides by s: (3/13)*(s -b)(s -c)=36 \u2192 (s -b)(s -c)= (36 *13)/3= 12*13=156.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut then, when I tried to compute (s -b)(s -c)=156, and x + y=4 sqrt(30), but then discriminant is negative, which suggests no real solutions.\n\nBut that's impossible because in a triangle, (s -b) and (s -c) must be positive real numbers.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the discriminant.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the discriminant.\n\nThe equation is t\u00b2 - (4 sqrt(30)) t +156=0.\n\nCompute discriminant D= (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*1*156= 16*30 - 624=480-624= -144.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, D is negative, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in Heron's formula step.\n\nLet me check.\n\nWe have \u0394=6s.\n\nHeron's formula: \u0394= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nSo, 6s= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nSquare both sides: 36 s\u00b2= s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nDivide both sides by s: 36 s= (s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nWe know that (s -a)= (3/13)s.\n\nSo, (3/13)s*(s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nDivide both sides by s: (3/13)*(s -b)(s -c)=36.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= (36 *13)/3= 156.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nBut then, if (s -b)(s -c)=156 and (s -b)+(s -c)= a=4 sqrt(30), then the quadratic equation has negative discriminant.\n\nWhich is impossible, so that suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps a is not equal to 4 sqrt(30). Did I make a mistake earlier in computing a?\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe had sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nThen, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nWait, 39*130=5070.\n\nsqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*507)=sqrt(10*3*13^2)=13 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A=2*13 sqrt(30)/169=26 sqrt(30)/169=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nThen, a=2R sin A=2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so a is correct. So, s -b +s -c= a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut then, (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation in t is t\u00b2 - (4 sqrt(30))t +156=0.\n\nWhich has discriminant D= (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*1*156=480 -624= -144.\n\nWhich is negative, implying no real roots.\n\nBut that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (s -a)=3s/13.\n\nWait, earlier, I had:\n\nFrom AI = r / sin(A/2)=6/(sqrt(39)/13)=6*13/sqrt(39)=78/sqrt(39)=78 sqrt(39)/39=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nThen, from the formula sin(A/2)=sqrt( (s -a)/s ).\n\nSo, sqrt( (s -a)/s )=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, (s -a)/s=39/169=3/13.\n\nSo, (s -a)= (3/13)s.\n\nWhich implies that a= s - (3/13)s= (10/13)s.\n\nSo, a=10s/13.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, s= (13/10)a.\n\nSince a=4 sqrt(30), s= (13/10)*4 sqrt(30)= (52 sqrt(30))/10=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, s=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nThen, s -a= (26 sqrt(30)/5) -4 sqrt(30)= (26 sqrt(30) -20 sqrt(30))/5=6 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, s -a=6 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, then, (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nBut s -a=6 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, 6 sqrt(30)/5 * (s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= (36 s *5)/(6 sqrt(30)) )= (180 s)/(6 sqrt(30))=30 s / sqrt(30)=30 s / (sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify 30/sqrt(30)=sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)=sqrt(30)*s.\n\nWait, s=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, sqrt(30)*s= sqrt(30)*(26 sqrt(30)/5 )=26*30/5=26*6=156.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut then, when I set up the quadratic equation, I get a negative discriminant, which suggests no solution. But that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.\n\nWait, (s -b)+(s -c)= 2s -b -c.\n\nBut in a triangle, b +c=2s -a.\n\nSo, 2s -b -c= a.\n\nSo, yes, (s -b)+(s -c)=a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the sum is correct.\n\nBut then, the product is 156, so the quadratic equation is t\u00b2 - (4 sqrt(30)) t +156=0.\n\nWhich discriminant D= (4 sqrt(30))\u00b2 -4*156= 480 -624= -144.\n\nWhich is negative.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption is wrong, but I can't see where.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Heron's formula.\n\nWait, Heron's formula says that \u0394= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nBut I used \u0394=6s, which is correct because \u0394=r*s=6s.\n\nSo, 6s= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nSquaring: 36 s\u00b2= s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nDivide by s: 36 s= (s -a)(s -b)(s -c).\n\nWe have s -a=6 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, 6 sqrt(30)/5 * (s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= (36 s *5)/(6 sqrt(30))= (180 s)/(6 sqrt(30))=30 s/sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is sqrt(30)*s.\n\nSince s=26 sqrt(30)/5, sqrt(30)*s= sqrt(30)*(26 sqrt(30)/5)=26*30/5=156.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut then, when I set up the quadratic equation, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I should accept that there's a mistake and try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula for the product bc in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, another formula I recall is that in a triangle, bc=2R^2 sin B sin C.\n\nBut I don't know angles B and C.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a=4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\nSo, 480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we don't know cos A.\n\nWait, but we can find cos A using sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, cos A= sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 A)=sqrt(1 - (4*30)/(13\u00b2))=sqrt(1 - 120/169)=sqrt(49/169)=7/13.\n\nSo, cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, 480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, so we have an equation involving b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 and bc.\n\nBut I need another equation to relate b and c.\n\nI know that b + c=32 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, let me write (b + c)^2= b\u00b2 + 2bc +c\u00b2= (32 sqrt(30)/5 )\u00b2= (1024 *30)/25= 30720/25=1228.8.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2= (b +c)^2 - 2bc=1228.8 - 2 bc.\n\nNow, substitute into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480= (1228.8 - 2 bc) - (14/13) bc.\n\nSimplify:\n\n480=1228.8 -2 bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nCombine the bc terms:\n\n-2 bc - (14/13) bc= -(2 +14/13) bc= -( (26/13 +14/13 )) bc= -(40/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 - (40/13) bc.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(40/13) bc=1228.8 -480=748.8.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (748.8 *13)/40.\n\nCompute 748.8 *13:\n\n700*13=9100,\n\n48.8*13=634.4,\n\nSo, total=9100+634.4=9734.4.\n\nDivide by 40: 9734.4 /40=243.36.\n\nHmm, so bc=243.36.\n\nBut earlier, from another approach, I had bc=2028/5=405.6 and bc=249.6.\n\nSo, now, using Law of Cosines, I get bc=243.36.\n\nBut these are all different, which suggests that I'm making a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, but 243.36 is 24336/100=6084/25.\n\nWait, 243.36=24336/100=6084/25.\n\nSo, 6084 divided by 25 is 243.36.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting different results for bc, which is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Law of Cosines step.\n\nLet me recompute.\n\nWe have a\u00b2= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2bc cos A.\n\na=4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\ncos A=7/13.\n\nSo, 480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 -2bc*(7/13).\n\nWe also know that (b +c)^2= (32 sqrt(30)/5 )\u00b2= (32^2)*(30)/(25)=1024*30/25=30720/25=1228.8.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=1228.8 -2 bc.\n\nSubstituting into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480= (1228.8 -2 bc) -

(4*30)/169)=sqrt(1 - 120/169)=sqrt(49/169)=7/13.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, cos A=7/13.\n\nHmm, so that step is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in (b +c)^2.\n\nWait, b +c=32 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, (b +c)^2= (32^2)*(30)/(5^2)=1024*30/25=30720/25=1228.8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=1228.8 -2 bc.\n\nSo, that step is correct.\n\nThen, substituting into the Law of Cosines:\n\n480= (1228.8 -2 bc) - (14/13) bc.\n\nWhich gives:\n\n480=1228.8 -2 bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, 480=1228.8 - (40/13) bc.\n\nThen,\n\n(40/13) bc=1228.8 -480=748.8.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (748.8 *13)/40=9734.4/40=243.36.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, now, I have bc=243.36.\n\nBut earlier, from the other approach, I had bc=2028/5=405.6.\n\nSo, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nFrom the first approach, using AI=2 sqrt(39)= (r)/sin(A/2)=6/sin(A/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=6/(2 sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, from the Law of Sines, a=2R sin A=26*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nThen, using the formula (s -a)=3s/13, which gives s= (13/10)a= (13/10)*4 sqrt(30)=52 sqrt(30)/10=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, s=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nThen, from Heron's formula, we have (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nBut when I set up the quadratic equation, I end up with a negative discriminant, which is impossible.\n\nBut in the Law of Cosines approach, I get bc=243.36.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that bc=243.36=24336/100=6084/25.\n\nSo, 6084/25=243.36.\n\nBut the problem asks for AB \u00b7 AC, which is bc.\n\nSo, 6084/25=243.36.\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting an integer answer, as it's a competition-style problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of bc from the Law of Cosines.\n\nWait, let me compute bc again.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines:\n\n480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nBut we also have (b +c)^2= (32 sqrt(30)/5 )^2=30720/25=1228.8.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=1228.8 - 2 bc.\n\nSubstitute into the Law of Cosines equation:\n\n480=1228.8 -2 bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 -

(14/13) bc.\n\nWe also have (b +c)^2= (32 sqrt(30)/5 )\u00b2=30720/25=1228.8.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=1228.8 -2 bc.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n480=1228.8 -2 bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 - (2 +14/13) bc.\n\nCompute 2 +14/13= (26 +14)/13=40/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 - (40/13) bc.\n\nRearrange:\n\n(40/13) bc=1228.8 -480=748.8.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (748.8 *13)/40.\n\nCompute 748.8 *13:\n\n700*13=9100,\n\n48.8*13=634.4,\n\nTotal=9100+634.4=9734.4.\n\nDivide by 40:9734.4/40=243.36.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, bc=243.36.\n\nHmm, but this seems to be the correct value, despite the earlier contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is designed to have a fractional answer, and 243.36 is the correct value.\n\nBut 243.36 is 24336/100=6084/25.\n\nSo, 6084/25=243.36.\n\nBut perhaps I can write it as 6084/25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (b +c).\n\nWait, from earlier, we had:\n\nFrom the formula, a= (10/13)s.\n\nSo, s= (13/10)a= (13/10)*4 sqrt(30)=52 sqrt(30)/10=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, s=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nThen, from earlier, b +c= (16/13)s= (16/13)*(26 sqrt(30)/5 )= (16*26 sqrt(30))/(13*5)= (416 sqrt(30))/(65)= (416/65)*sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify 416/65: 65*6=390, 416-390=26, so 6 +26/65=6 +2/5=6.4.\n\nWait, 416/65=6.4, because 65*6=390, 65*6.4=416.\n\nSo, b +c=6.4 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is 32 sqrt(30)/5, which matches earlier.\n\nSo, b +c=32 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think that the correct value of bc is 6084/25.\n\nBut the problem is expecting an integer answer, as per the instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula for OI.\n\nWait, let me check the formula for OI.\n\nThe formula is OI\u00b2= R\u00b2 -2Rr.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2=13\u00b2 -2*13*6=169-156=13.\n\nSo, OI= sqrt(13).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2= AO\u00b2.\n\nSo, AI\u00b2= AO\u00b2 - OI\u00b2=13\u00b2 - (sqrt(13))\u00b2=169-13=156.\n\nSo, AI= sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, AI=2 sqrt(39)= r / sin(A/2)=6/sin(A/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=6/(2 sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, sin(A)=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169.\n\nBut sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*507)=sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2)=13 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin(A)=2*13 sqrt(30)/169=26 sqrt(30)/169=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen, a=2R sin A=26*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30).\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen, s= (13/10)a=26 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen, (s -a)=6 sqrt(30)/5.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen, (s -a)(s -b)(s -c)=36 s.\n\nSo, (6 sqrt(30)/5)*(s -b)(s -c)=36*(26 sqrt(30)/5).\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)= (36*(26 sqrt(30)/5 )) / (6 sqrt(30)/5 )= (36*26 sqrt(30)/5 ) * (5/(6 sqrt(30)) ))= (36*26 sqrt(30)*5)/(5*6 sqrt(30))= (36*26)/6=6*26=156.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nBut then, when I set up the quadratic equation, I get a negative discriminant, which is impossible.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that (s -b) and (s -c) are not real numbers, but that's impossible because in a triangle, s >b and s> c, so s -b and s -c are positive.\n\nSo, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that I made a mistake in the Law of Cosines approach.\n\nWait, let me recompute the Law of Cosines.\n\nWe have a=4 sqrt(30), so a\u00b2=480.\n\ncos A=7/13.\n\nLaw of Cosines: a\u00b2= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -2 bc cos A.\n\nSo,\n\n480= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nWe also have (b +c)^2= (32 sqrt(30)/5 )^2=30720/25=1228.8.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=1228.8 -2 bc.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n480=1228.8 -2 bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 - (2 +14/13) bc.\n\nCompute 2 +14/13= (26 +14)/13=40/13.\n\nSo,\n\n480=1228.8 -

(32 sqrt(30)/5)x + 6084/25=0.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant:\n\nD= (32 sqrt(30)/5)^2 -4*(6084/25)= (1024*30)/25 -4*(6084)/25.\n\nCompute:\n\n1024*30=30720,\n\n4*6084=24336.\n\nSo,\n\nD=30720/25 -24336/25= (30720 -24336)/25=6384/25.\n\nWhich is positive, so the roots are real.\n\nSo, b and c are real.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think that the correct answer is 6084/25, which is 243.36.\n\nBut since the problem is likely expecting an integer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of bc as 2028/5=405.6, but that approach led to a contradiction in Heron's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that bc=6084/25 is the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the area in two ways.\n\nFrom Heron's formula: \u0394= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)]=sqrt[s*(3/13 s)*(s -b)(s -c)].\n\nBut s*(3/13 s)=3 s\u00b2/13.\n\nAnd (s -b)(s -c)=156.\n\nSo, \u0394= sqrt[3 s\u00b2/13 *156 ]=sqrt[3 s\u00b2/13 *156 ]=sqrt[ (3*156 s\u00b2)/13 ]=sqrt[ (468 s\u00b2)/13 ]=sqrt[36 s\u00b2]=6s.\n\nWhich matches \u0394=6s.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, Heron's formula is satisfied.\n\nBut when I set up the quadratic equation, I get a negative discriminant, which suggests that my approach is wrong.\n\nBut the Law of Cosines approach gives bc=6084/25.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 6084/25.\n\nBut since the problem is likely expecting an integer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2028/5, which is 405.6, but that approach led to a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should accept that bc=6084/25 is the correct answer, and write it as a fraction.\n\nSo, the answer is 6084/25.\n\nBut let me check if this reduces further.\n\n6084 divided by 4 is 1521, which is 39\u00b2.\n\n25 is 5\u00b2.\n\nSo, 6084=4*39\u00b2.\n\nSo, 6084/25= (4*39\u00b2)/25.\n\nBut that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nSo, the product AB \u00b7 AC is 6084/25.\n\nBut to write it as an integer, perhaps I should multiply numerator and denominator by something.\n\nBut no, 6084/25 is the simplest form.\n\nSo, the answer is 6084/25.\n\nBut the problem says to put the final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nSo, I'll write that.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\).
