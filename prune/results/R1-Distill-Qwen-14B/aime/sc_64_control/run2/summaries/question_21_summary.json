      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nSo, let me break this down. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c < b. The sum of the digits is a + c, and this must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\nn = a*b + c\nsqrt(n) = a + c\nSo, substituting n from the first equation into the second, we get:\nsqrt(a*b + c) = a + c\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\na*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I can group terms differently. Let's see:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\nI can write this as:\na^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Since a and c are digits in base b, they must be integers with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can iterate over possible values of a and c to see if they satisfy the equation. But since we're looking for the least b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the equation differently. Let me start again.\n\nWe have:\nn = a*b + c\nsqrt(n) = a + c\nSo, n = (a + c)^2\n\nTherefore, a*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n= a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\n= a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor it differently.\n\nWait, let's express it as:\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n= a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\n\nSo, a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\n\nI can factor a on the left side:\na*b = a(a + 2c) + c^2 - c\n\nAlternatively, maybe solve for b:\nb = [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a\n= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. That gives us a condition on a and c.\n\nSo, for given a and c, we can compute b as [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c]/a, but this has to be an integer, which requires (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nAlternatively, since a and c are digits in base b, a must be less than b, and c must be less than b.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by expressing it as a quadratic in a. Let's write the equation again:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n=> (a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nWhich is a quadratic in a:\na^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nFor a to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)\n= 4c^2 -4cb + b^2 -4c^2 +4c\n= (-4cb) + b^2 +4c\n\nSo, D = b^2 -4cb +4c\n\nThis must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k^2 for some integer k.\n\nSo, b^2 -4cb +4c = k^2\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can fix c and express in terms of b, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, since a and c are digits, and a is at least 1, maybe I can fix a and c and compute b, but with the constraints that b must be greater than the maximum digit, which is max(a, c). Since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, but b must be at least a+1 (since a is a digit in base b, so a < b). Similarly, c must be less than b.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's suppose that s = a + c. Then, n = s^2. Also, n = a*b + c. So:\n\ns^2 = a*b + c\n\nBut since s = a + c, we can write:\n\ns^2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\ns^2 - s + a = a*b\n\nSo, b = (s^2 - s + a)/a\n\nSimplify:\n\nb = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nSo, since b must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, (s^2 - s) mod a = 0.\n\nWhich implies that a divides s(s - 1).\n\nSince s = a + c, and c is less than b, which is at least a + 1, so c can be up to b - 1, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, but since s = a + c, and a is at least 1, c is at least 0, so s is at least 1.\n\nBut since n = s^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy:\n\nb \u2264 n < b^2\n\nWhich is because a two-digit number in base b is between b (10_b) and b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b).\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible n's are the squares s^2 where s is such that:\n\nb \u2264 s^2 < b^2\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s < b\n\nBut s is a + c, which is at least 1 (since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0). So, s must be in [sqrt(b), b).\n\nBut s is an integer because it's the sum of digits a and c, which are integers. So, s can take integer values from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nWait, but s must be at least a + c \u2265 1, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, n \u2265 b, so s^2 \u2265 b, which implies s \u2265 sqrt(b). So, s must be an integer in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1].\n\nHmm, maybe that's a way to limit the possible values of s for each b.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of s as varying, and then for each s, determine possible a and c.\n\nGiven s = a + c, and n = s^2 = a*b + c.\n\nWe can write:\n\ns^2 = a*b + c\n\nBut since c = s - a, substituting:\n\ns^2 = a*b + s - a\n\nRearranging:\n\ns^2 - s = a*(b - 1)\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) divides s(s - 1).\n\nSo, (b - 1) | s(s - 1)\n\nAlso, since a must be a digit in base b, a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a < b.\n\nSo, 1 \u2264 (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) < b\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1 \u2264 (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) < b\n\nMultiply all parts by (b - 1):\n\nb - 1 \u2264 s^2 - s < b*(b - 1)\n\nSo, s^2 - s \u2265 b - 1 and s^2 - s < b^2 - b\n\nHmm, but s is less than b, so s \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it this way: for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then compute a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). If a is an integer and 1 \u2264 a < b, then that's a valid a and c = s - a, which must also satisfy 0 \u2264 c < b.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the corresponding a and c satisfy the digit constraints.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each b starting from 2 upwards, count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), and then find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable, but doing this for each b might be time-consuming, especially since we don't know how large b might be. But perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nFor each b, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors d of (s(s - 1)) where d = (b - 1). So, for each s, s(s - 1) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, for each s, (b - 1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1).\n\nWait, but for a given b, (b - 1) is fixed. So, for each b, we can find all s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1).\n\nSo, the number of such s is equal to the number of s in that range where s(s - 1) is a multiple of (b - 1).\n\nAlternatively, since (b - 1) is fixed, we can compute the number of s in the range where s \u2261 0 or 1 mod (b - 1), because s(s - 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so one of them must be divisible by any prime factor of (b - 1). But to have s(s - 1) divisible by (b - 1), it's necessary that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1). So, s \u2261 0 mod (b - 1) or s \u2261 1 mod (b - 1).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so if (b - 1) is a prime number, then either s \u2261 0 mod (b - 1) or s \u2261 1 mod (b - 1). But if (b - 1) is composite, then it's possible that s is congruent to 0 mod some factor of (b - 1) and s-1 is congruent to 0 mod another factor.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider the multiplicative properties of (b - 1). Let me denote m = b - 1. So, m must divide s(s - 1). So, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), m] (since s \u2264 b - 1 = m) such that m divides s(s - 1).\n\nSo, for each m, how many s in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] satisfy m divides s(s - 1)?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each m, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] such that s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod d for each prime power d dividing m.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of solutions s in [1, m] such that m divides s(s - 1). Then, subtract those s which are less than ceil(sqrt(m + 1)).\n\nBut perhaps I can find how many s in [1, m] satisfy m | s(s - 1). Then, subtract the number of s < ceil(sqrt(m + 1)).\n\nBut let's first find the number of s in [1, m] such that m divides s(s - 1). \n\nSince m divides s(s - 1), which are two consecutive integers, their product is divisible by m. So, for each prime p dividing m, the highest power of p in m must divide either s or s-1.\n\nThis is similar to solving s \u2261 0 mod p^k or s \u2261 1 mod p^k for each prime power p^k in the factorization of m.\n\nThis resembles the Chinese Remainder Theorem, so the number of solutions s in [1, m] is equal to 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, for each distinct prime factor p of m, s must be \u22610 or 1 mod p. So, if m is square-free, then the number of solutions s in [1, m] is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors. But if m has higher exponents, like p^2, then it's more complicated because s must be \u22610 or 1 mod p^2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose m = p^k, a prime power. Then, s(s - 1) must be divisible by p^k. Since s and s - 1 are consecutive, only one of them can be divisible by p. So, for m = p^k, the solutions are s \u2261 0 mod p^k or s \u2261 1 mod p^k. So, two solutions in the range [1, p^k].\n\nIf m is a product of distinct prime powers, say m = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pr^kr, then the number of solutions s in [1, m] is 2^r, because for each prime power, s can be \u22610 or 1 mod that prime power, and by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, these can be combined.\n\nSo, in general, if m has t distinct prime factors, the number of solutions s in [1, m] is 2^t. Because for each prime, you have two choices, 0 or 1, and since they're coprime, you can combine them.\n\nWait, but if m has repeated prime factors, like m = p^2, then the number of solutions is still 2, right? Because s can be 0 or 1 mod p^2.\n\nWait, yes. For m = p^k, the number of solutions s in [1, m] is 2, regardless of k.\n\nSo, for m = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pr^kr, the number of solutions s is 2^r, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nTherefore, the number of s in [1, m] such that m divides s(s - 1) is 2^r, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nBut wait, does this hold? Let me test with m=6 (which is 2*3, so r=2). So, 2^2=4 solutions.\n\nLet's list s from 1 to 6:\n\ns=1: 1*0=0, which is divisible by 6? No, 0 is divisible by 6, but s=1 is allowed. Wait, s=1: s(s-1)=0, which is divisible by 6. So yes.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 6.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, divisible by 6.\n\ns=4: 4*3=12, divisible by 6.\n\ns=5:5*4=20, not divisible by 6.\n\ns=6:6*5=30, divisible by 6.\n\nSo, s=1,3,4,6: four solutions, which is 2^2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=4 (which is 2^2, so r=1). So, number of solutions should be 2^1=2.\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2, not divisible by 4.\n\ns=3:3*2=6, not divisible by 4.\n\ns=4:4*3=12, divisible by 4.\n\nSo, s=1 and s=4: two solutions. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=8 (2^3, r=1). So, number of solutions is 2.\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=2:2*1=2, not divisible by 8.\n\ns=3:6, not divisible by 8.\n\ns=4:12, not divisible by 8.\n\ns=5:20, no.\n\ns=6:30, no.\n\ns=7:42, no.\n\ns=8:56, which is 7*8, yes.\n\nSo, s=1 and s=8: two solutions. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=12 (factors 2^2*3, so r=2). So, number of solutions should be 4.\n\ns=1: yes.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, not divisible by 12.\n\ns=4:4*3=12, yes.\n\ns=5:20, no.\n\ns=7:42, no.\n\ns=8:56, no.\n\ns=9:72, yes.\n\ns=12:12*11=132, yes.\n\nWait, let me list all s from 1 to 12:\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=2:2, no.\n\ns=3:6, no.\n\ns=4:12, yes.\n\ns=5:20, no.\n\ns=6:30, no.\n\ns=7:42, no.\n\ns=8:56, no.\n\ns=9:72, yes.\n\ns=10:90, no.\n\ns=11:110, no.\n\ns=12:132, yes.\n\nSo, s=1,4,9,12: four solutions. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the number of solutions s in [1, m] is 2^r where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nBut in our problem, s is in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m]. So, the number of solutions is the number of s in [1, m] that satisfy the condition and are \u2265 ceil(sqrt(m + 1)).\n\nSo, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we compute m = b - 1, find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), m] such that m divides s(s - 1). That number is equal to the number of solutions s in [1, m] minus the number of solutions s in [1, ceil(sqrt(b)) - 1].\n\nWait, but the number of solutions in [1, m] is 2^r, where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nBut how many of those solutions are less than ceil(sqrt(b))?\n\nHmm, that's tricky because it depends on the specific values. Maybe for a given m, the number of solutions less than L (where L = ceil(sqrt(m + 1))) is variable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for m >= something, the number of solutions s >= L is roughly 2^r minus the number of solutions s < L.\n\nBut without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that for larger m, the number of solutions s >= L is roughly 2^{r - 1}, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for m with more prime factors, the number of solutions increases, which would mean that m with higher r will have more s satisfying the condition.\n\nSo, to get more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need 2^r - k > 10, where k is the number of solutions s < L. But since k is hard to determine, perhaps we can look for m with high r, which would make 2^r large, and thus likely to have more than ten solutions s >= L.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal b is such that m = b - 1 has r >= 4, because 2^4=16, which would give 16 solutions in [1, m], and perhaps enough of them are above L.\n\nWait, but let's test with m=30, which has r=3 (primes 2,3,5). 2^3=8 solutions. Maybe some of them are above sqrt(31) \u22485.567, so s >=6.\n\nSo, the number of solutions s >=6 would be 8 minus the number of solutions s <6.\n\nHow many solutions are there in s <6?\n\ns=1: yes.\n\ns=2: no.\n\ns=3: no.\n\ns=4: yes (since 4*3=12, which is divisible by 30? No, 12 is not divisible by 30. Wait, wait, m=30.\n\nWait, m=30, so s(s -1) must be divisible by 30.\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=2:2*1=2, no.\n\ns=3:6, no.\n\ns=4:12, no.\n\ns=5:20, no.\n\ns=6:30, yes.\n\ns=7:42, no (42 is divisible by 6 and 7, but 42/30=1.4, not integer).\n\nWait, 42 is 30*1 +12, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier conclusion is incorrect. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, m=30, so s(s-1) must be divisible by 30.\n\nSo, s(s-1) must be divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even (divisible by 2), one of s or s-1 must be divisible by 3, and one of s or s-1 must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, s must satisfy s \u22610 or 1 mod 3, and s \u22610 or 1 mod 5.\n\nSo, using Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solutions are s \u22610 or 1 mod 3 and s \u22610 or 1 mod5.\n\nSo, there are 2^2=4 solutions mod 15, because 3 and 5 are coprime.\n\nWait, but 30 is 2*3*5, so the solutions would be s \u22610 or 1 mod 2, mod3, and mod5.\n\nWait, no, because s and s-1 are consecutive, so for each prime p in {2,3,5}, one of s or s-1 must be divisible by p.\n\nWait, for p=2: either s even or s-1 even (which is s odd). So, it's automatically satisfied because either s or s-1 is even.\n\nSimilarly for p=3: s \u22610 or 1 mod3.\n\nFor p=5: s \u22610 or 1 mod5.\n\nSo, the number of solutions s in [1,30] is 2^2=4, because for each of 3 and 5, we have two choices (0 or1 mod p). But since 2 is already covered because one of s or s-1 is even, we don't need to consider it.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example with m=6, which is 2*3, we had four solutions, which is 2^2=4, which matches the number of primes (2 and 3). So, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^r where r is the number of primes in the prime factorization of m, excluding 2? Or including?\n\nWait, for m=6 (2*3), r=2, solutions=4=2^2.\n\nFor m=30 (2*3*5), r=3, solutions=8? But earlier, when I tried m=30, I found only s=1,6, etc., but perhaps I was mistaken.\n\nWait, let me correctly compute the number of solutions for m=30.\n\nEach s must satisfy:\n\n- s \u22610 or 1 mod3\n\n- s \u22610 or1 mod5\n\nSo, the combinations are:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod3 and 0 mod5: s \u22610 mod15\n\n2. s \u22610 mod3 and 1 mod5: find s \u22610 mod3, s \u22611 mod5.\n\n3. s \u22611 mod3 and 0 mod5: s \u22611 mod3, s \u22610 mod5.\n\n4. s \u22611 mod3 and 1 mod5: s \u22611 mod15.\n\nSo, each combination gives a unique solution mod15, because 3 and5 are coprime.\n\nThus, there are 4 solutions mod15, and since 30 is 2*15, each solution mod15 repeats twice in mod30.\n\nWait, no. Because for each solution mod15, there are two residues mod30 that satisfy it: one even and one odd. Because s can be even or odd, but since m=30 is even, s can be even or odd.\n\nWait, actually, for each solution mod15, s can be congruent to that mod15, and then either s is even or odd.\n\nWait, but for each solution mod15, there are two solutions mod30: one with s even and one with s odd.\n\nWait, no. Because s can be either even or odd, but the condition is that s(s-1) is divisible by 30, which requires that s is even or odd, but the other factors are already handled by the mod3 and mod5 conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps each of the four solutions mod15 corresponds to two solutions mod30, one even and one odd. So, total solutions would be 4*2=8.\n\nBut let's test:\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=6: 30, yes.\n\ns=11: 110, which is 10*11, 110/30=3.666, not integer. So, no.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each of the four solutions mod15 gives exactly one solution in each 15 numbers, so in 30 numbers, there are 4*2=8 solutions.\n\nWait, let me list all s from 1 to30 where s(s-1) is divisible by 30.\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=6: 30, yes.\n\ns=10: 90, yes.\n\ns=16: 16*15=240, which is 8*30, yes.\n\ns=21: 21*20=420, which is 14*30, yes.\n\ns=25:25*24=600, which is 20*30, yes.\n\ns=30:30*29=870, which is 29*30, yes.\n\nWait, that's s=1,6,10,16,21,25,30. That's seven solutions, not eight. Hmm, that contradicts the earlier idea.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each s:\n\ns=1: 0, yes.\n\ns=6:6*5=30, yes.\n\ns=10:10*9=90, which is 3*30, yes.\n\ns=16:16*15=240, which is 8*30, yes.\n\ns=21:21*20=420, which is14*30, yes.\n\ns=25:25*24=600, which is20*30, yes.\n\ns=30:30*29=870, which is29*30, yes.\n\nWait, that's seven solutions. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier reasoning was incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{r}, where r is the number of distinct prime factors, but for m=30, r=3 (2,3,5), so 2^3=8, but in reality, there are only 7 solutions. So, my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps m=30 is even, so s=1 is allowed, but s=30 is also allowed. Wait, but in the list above, s=1,6,10,16,21,25,30: seven solutions.\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial formula overcounts. Maybe for m even, the number of solutions is 2^{r-1}.\n\nWait, for m=6, which is even, r=2, 2^{2}=4, and we had four solutions. For m=30, which is even, r=3, 2^{3}=8, but we have seven solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when m is even, one of the solutions is s=1, which is the same as s=m.\n\nWait, no, s=1 and s=m are distinct except when m=1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to abandon the formula and instead, for each m, compute the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s - 1). Since we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I can iterate over b starting from 2, compute m = b - 1, and count the number of valid s for each m.\n\nBut this might take a while, but perhaps I can find a pattern or find a way to compute it.\n\nLet me try small b's.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nm=1. s must be in [ceil(sqrt(2)),1], which is [2,1], which is invalid. So, no solutions.\n\nb=3:\n\nm=2.\n\ns must be in [ceil(sqrt(3))=2, 2].\n\nSo, s=2.\n\nCheck if 2 divides 2*(2-1)=2*1=2. Yes.\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s)/(m) = (4-2)/2=1.\n\na=1, which is <3, so valid.\n\nc = s - a =2-1=1, which is <3.\n\nSo, n = a*b + c =1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2=1+1. Correct.\n\nSo, only one solution.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about something called \"b-eautiful\" numbers. Let me try to understand what exactly that means. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nHmm, okay. So let me break this down. If n is a two-digit number in base b, that means n can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, right? So a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b because they're digits in base b.\n\nThe second condition is that a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. But n is also equal to a * b + c. So putting that together, sqrt(a * b + c) = a + c. \n\nWait, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's try that. \n\nSo, (a + c)^2 = a * b + c. Expanding the left side, that becomes a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a * b + c. \n\nHmm, let's rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a * b - c = 0.\n\nHmm, maybe factor out the a and c terms:\n\na\u00b2 + (2ac - a * b) + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem too helpful. Maybe I can express b in terms of a and c. Let's see. \n\nFrom the equation:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, let's solve for b:\n\na * b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nHmm, that's an interesting expression. So, for given a and c, b must equal that fraction. But b has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2, right? Because it's the base, and a and c are digits in that base, so a must be at least 1, and c must be at least 0 but less than b.\n\nWait, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, the first digit a must be between 1 and b-1, and the second digit c must be between 0 and b-1. So, for each a and c, we can compute b and see if it's an integer and satisfies the base conditions.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the least integer b >=2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, for each base b, I need to count how many two-digit numbers in base b satisfy that the sum of the digits equals the square root of the number. And find the smallest b where this count is more than ten.\n\nSo, maybe the approach is to, for each b starting from 2 upwards, find all possible two-digit numbers in base b, compute a and c, check if a + c = sqrt(n), and count how many such numbers exist. Then find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.\n\nBut that sounds computationally intensive. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the equation again.\n\nWe had:\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 ] / a - c / a\n\nBut since b has to be an integer, [ (a + c)^2 - c ] must be divisible by a. So, (a + c)^2 \u2261 c mod a. Let me see:\n\n(a + c)^2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nBut a\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod a, 2ac \u2261 0 mod a, so:\n\n0 + 0 + c\u00b2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nWhich simplifies to c\u00b2 \u2261 c mod a. So,\n\nc\u00b2 - c \u2261 0 mod a => c(c - 1) \u2261 0 mod a\n\nSo, a must divide c(c - 1). Since a and c are digits in base b, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.\n\nWait, but a is at least 1, so c(c - 1) must be a multiple of a. So, a divides c(c - 1). So, for each a, c must satisfy that a divides c(c - 1).\n\nSo, for each a, possible c's are such that c \u2261 0 or 1 mod a, or something like that? Wait, because if a divides c(c - 1), then either a divides c or a divides (c - 1), or a divides a product where c and c-1 are consecutive integers.\n\nWait, but a can have factors that are products of factors of c and c-1, since c and c-1 are coprime. So, since c and c-1 are coprime, any divisor a must divide either c or c-1.\n\nWait, no. Because a divides c(c-1), and since gcd(c, c-1) =1, then a must be a product of factors of c and c-1, but not necessarily just dividing c or c-1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that a must divide c(c-1). So, for each a, the possible c's are those where c \u2261 0 mod d or c \u2261 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of a. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of a in terms of c. Let's rearrange the equation for b:\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nWhich is:\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a = a + 2c + (c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, (c\u00b2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, (c\u00b2 - c) mod a = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as c(c - 1) \u2261 0 mod a.\n\nSo, for each a, c must satisfy c \u2261 0 mod a or c \u2261 1 mod a? Not exactly, because a might have multiple prime factors.\n\nWait, but if a divides c(c - 1), then the prime factors of a must be present in either c or c - 1. Since c and c -1 are coprime, the prime factors of a must be entirely in c or entirely in c -1.\n\nWait, no, because a can have multiple prime factors, some in c and some in c-1. But since c and c-1 are coprime, a can't have a common factor with both c and c-1 unless a is 1, which it's not because a is at least 1 and can be 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider specific cases. Let's say a=1. Then, the condition c(c-1) must be divisible by 1, which is always true. So for a=1, any c is allowed. Then, b = [ (1 + c)^2 - c ] / 1 = (1 + 2c + c\u00b2 - c) = 1 + c + c\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, in base b, the digits must be less than b. So, a=1, which is less than b, and c must be less than b. So, for a=1, c can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nBut then, n in base b is 1 * b + c, which is b + c.\n\nAnd sqrt(n) = a + c = 1 + c.\n\nSo, sqrt(b + c) = 1 + c.\n\nSquaring both sides: b + c = (1 + c)^2 = 1 + 2c + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, b = 1 + 2c + c\u00b2 - c = 1 + c + c\u00b2.\n\nWhich is what we had earlier.\n\nBut since c must be less than b, which is 1 + c + c\u00b2, so c < 1 + c + c\u00b2, which is always true for c >=0.\n\nSo for a=1, any c from 0 to b-1 will give a valid b, but wait, no. Because b is 1 + c + c\u00b2, which depends on c. Wait, this seems a bit circular.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to fix a and c, compute b, and then check if a and c are valid digits in base b.\n\nSo, for a given a and c, b must be equal to (a + c)^2 - c divided by a.\n\nBut also, since a and c are digits in base b, they must satisfy 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b.\n\nSo, for each a >=1 and c >=0, compute b as above, and check if a < b and c < b.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible a and c, compute b, check if b is integer and satisfies a < b and c < b, and then count how many such n's exist for each b.\n\nBut doing this for all a and c might be time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this equation as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\n(a + c)^2 - c = a * b\n\nSo,\n\nb = (a + c)^2 - c / a\n\nWhich must be integer.\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a.\n\nAs before, this implies that c(c - 1) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, for each a, c must satisfy c \u2261 0 mod a or c \u2261 1 mod a. Wait, no, because if a divides c(c-1), then a must divide either c or c-1, but only if a is prime? No, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, for example, if a=6, then c must satisfy 6 divides c(c-1). Since 6=2*3, and c and c-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by 2 and the other by 3. So, c \u22610 mod 2 and c \u22611 mod 3, or c\u22611 mod 2 and c\u22610 mod 3. So, c \u22610 or 1 mod 6? No, that's not exactly. Let's see, the solutions would be c \u22610 or 1 mod 2, and c\u22610 or 1 mod 3. So, possible c's are 0,1,3,4,6,7,... but modulo 6, so 0,1,3,4.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the factors of a. For each a, the possible c's are those where c \u22610 mod d or c\u22611 mod d, for each prime power in a's prime decomposition. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible a and c, compute b, and check if it's an integer and satisfies the digit conditions.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = a*b + c, where 1 <= a < b and 0 <= c < b.\n\nAnd sqrt(n) = a + c.\n\nSo, n = (a + c)^2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na * b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nSo, let's write this as:\n\na * b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nWhich must be an integer.\n\nSo, for each a and c, compute this, and if it's an integer and satisfies a < b and c < b, then n is b-eautiful.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, starting from 2, we can find all a and c such that a and c are digits in base b, and the above equation holds.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can express b in terms of a and c, and then for each possible a, find c such that b is integer and a < b, c < b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each a, c can vary from 0 to b-1, but since b is determined by a and c, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I can fix a and then find possible c's that make b an integer and satisfy the digit constraints.\n\nLet me try for a=1.\n\nThen, b = (1 + c)^2 - c / 1 = (1 + 2c + c\u00b2 - c) = 1 + c + c\u00b2.\n\nSo, for a=1, b = c\u00b2 + c + 1.\n\nBut since c must be less than b, we have c < c\u00b2 + c + 1, which is always true for c >=0.\n\nAlso, since a=1, we need 1 < b, which is true as long as c >=0, since b = c\u00b2 + c + 1 >=1.\n\nSo for each c >=0, we get a b, but b must be an integer, which it is because c is integer.\n\nBut wait, in base b, the digits a and c must be less than b. So, a=1 < b, which is true. And c must be less than b, so c < c\u00b2 + c +1, which simplifies to 0 < c\u00b2 +1, which is always true for c >=0.\n\nSo for a=1, any c >=0 gives a valid b. But wait, but in base b, c must be less than b. So, for each a=1 and c, b is c\u00b2 + c +1, so c must be less than b, which is c < c\u00b2 + c +1, which is always true.\n\nSo for a=1, any c from 0 to b-1 is allowed. But wait, but b depends on c, so for each c, b is determined. So, for a=1, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of possible c's for each b.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given b, how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the equation and the digit constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, I can iterate a from 1 to b-1, and for each a, find c such that (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.\n\nWhich is the same as c\u00b2 + (2a -1)c + (a\u00b2 - a*b) =0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic in c. So, for each a, I can solve for c.\n\nLet me write the quadratic equation:\n\nc\u00b2 + (2a -1)c + (a\u00b2 - a*b) = 0.\n\nThe solutions for c are:\n\nc = [ -(2a -1) \u00b1 sqrt( (2a -1)^2 - 4*1*(a\u00b2 - a b) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\nD = (2a -1)^2 -4(a\u00b2 - a b) = 4a\u00b2 -4a +1 -4a\u00b2 +4a b = (-4a +1 +4a b).\n\nSo,\n\nD = 4a(b -1) +1.\n\nSo, for c to be integer, D must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, 4a(b -1) +1 must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me denote D = k\u00b2, so:\n\n4a(b -1) +1 = k\u00b2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nk\u00b2 -4a(b -1) =1\n\nHmm, that looks like a Pell equation, but not exactly. Alternatively, we can think of it as k\u00b2 = 4a(b -1) +1.\n\nSo, for each a, and for each b, k must be such that k\u00b2 =4a(b -1)+1.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't the most straightforward path. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as:\n\nFor each a, c must satisfy the quadratic equation, which must have integer solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps for each a, the discriminant D must be a perfect square. So, 4a(b -1) +1 must be a square.\n\nSo, 4a(b -1) +1 = m\u00b2, for some integer m.\n\nSo, 4a(b -1) = m\u00b2 -1 = (m-1)(m+1).\n\nHmm, so 4a(b -1) is equal to (m-1)(m+1). Since (m-1) and (m+1) are two even numbers if m is odd, or two odd numbers if m is even.\n\nWait, let's think about m. Since m\u00b2 =4a(b-1)+1, m must be odd because 4a(b-1) is even, so m\u00b2 is odd, so m is odd.\n\nSo, let me set m = 2k +1, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nThen,\n\nm\u00b2 = (2k+1)^2 =4k\u00b2 +4k +1.\n\nSo,\n\n4a(b -1) =4k\u00b2 +4k +1 -1 =4k\u00b2 +4k.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\na(b -1) =k\u00b2 +k.\n\nSo,\n\na(b -1) =k(k +1).\n\nSo, for each a, we can write:\n\nb -1 = [k(k +1)] /a\n\nWhich implies that a must divide k(k +1). Since k and k+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, a must be a divisor of either k or k+1, or a product of their factors.\n\nSo, for a given a, we can set k = a * t, where t is an integer, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since a divides k(k+1), and k and k+1 are coprime, a must be a product of factors of k and k+1. So, a can be expressed as a product of factors of k and k+1, but since they are coprime, a can be written as a = d * e, where d divides k and e divides k+1.\n\nBut this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express k in terms of a and b.\n\nWait, let's go back to the equation:\n\na(b -1) =k(k +1)\n\nSo, for each a, k(k +1) must be divisible by a, and then b =1 + [k(k +1)] /a.\n\nSo, for each a, possible k's are such that a divides k(k +1). Since k and k+1 are coprime, a must be a product of factors of k and k+1.\n\nBut this might not be the easiest way. Maybe I can fix a and then find k such that a divides k(k+1), then compute b and check if c is an integer and satisfies the digit constraints.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe I should try specific values for a and see what happens.\n\nLet me try a=1.\n\nThen, a=1, so from the equation a(b -1) =k(k+1), we have:\n\n1*(b -1) =k(k+1)\n\nSo, b = k(k+1) +1.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation for c is:\n\nc\u00b2 + (2*1 -1)c + (1\u00b2 -1*b) =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc\u00b2 + c + (1 - b) =0\n\nBut since b =k(k+1)+1,\n\n1 - b =1 - [k(k+1)+1] = -k(k+1)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nc\u00b2 + c -k(k+1) =0\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nc = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4k(k+1))]/2\n\nWhich is:\n\nc = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(4k\u00b2 +4k +1)]/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc = [-1 \u00b1 (2k +1)]/2\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nc = [ -1 + (2k +1) ] /2 = (2k)/2 =k\n\nand\n\nc = [ -1 - (2k +1) ] /2 = (-2k -2)/2 = -k -1\n\nBut c must be a non-negative integer less than b. So, c =k is a possible solution, and c=-k-1 is negative, so we discard it.\n\nSo, for a=1, c=k, and b =k(k+1)+1.\n\nSo, for each k >=0, we have a solution where a=1, c=k, and b=k(k+1)+1.\n\nNow, check the digit constraints: a=1 <b, which is true since b=k(k+1)+1 >=1 for k>=0.\n\nc=k <b =k(k+1)+1. Since k <k(k+1)+1 for all k >=0, this holds.\n\nSo, for each a=1 and k>=0, we get a valid b and c.\n\nThus, for a=1, there are infinitely many solutions, but we need to consider for each b, how many such pairs (a,c) exist.\n\nWait, but for each b, how many a's and c's satisfy the equation. So, for a=1, we get one solution per b, but only for specific b's.\n\nWait, no. For a=1, each k gives a specific b. So, for a=1, each b corresponds to a specific k, so for each b in the form k(k+1)+1, there is one solution (a=1, c=k).\n\nSo, for each b of the form k(k+1)+1, there's at least one b-eautiful number.\n\nBut the problem is to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps other a's contribute more solutions for a given b.\n\nLet me try a=2.\n\nSo, a=2.\n\nFrom the equation a(b -1) =k(k +1), we have:\n\n2(b -1) =k(k +1)\n\nSo,\n\nb = [k(k +1)] /2 +1\n\nNow, since b must be an integer, [k(k +1)] must be even, which it is because either k or k+1 is even.\n\nSo, for each k, we can compute b.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation for c is:\n\nc\u00b2 + (2a -1)c + (a\u00b2 - a b) =0\n\nWhich, with a=2, becomes:\n\nc\u00b2 + (4 -1)c + (4 -2b) =0\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 +3c + (4 -2b) =0\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nc = [ -3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 -4*(4 -2b) ] /2\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\n9 -16 +8b =8b -7\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(8b -7) must be integer.\n\nLet me denote m = sqrt(8b -7), so m must be integer.\n\nSo,\n\n8b -7 =m\u00b2 => 8b =m\u00b2 +7 => b=(m\u00b2 +7)/8\n\nBut from earlier, b= [k(k +1)]/2 +1.\n\nSo,\n\n(m\u00b2 +7)/8 = [k(k +1)]/2 +1\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\nm\u00b2 +7 =4k(k +1) +8\n\nSimplify:\n\nm\u00b2 =4k(k +1) +1\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2 =4k\u00b2 +4k +1 = (2k +1)^2\n\nThus, m=2k +1.\n\nSo, m must be odd, which makes sense because 8b -7 must be a perfect square, and 8b is even, so 8b -7 is odd, hence m must be odd.\n\nSo, m=2k +1.\n\nThus, from earlier, b= [k(k +1)]/2 +1.\n\nBut also, from m=2k+1,\n\nb=(m\u00b2 +7)/8 = [(2k+1)^2 +7]/8 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +1 +7)/8 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +8)/8 = (k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb= (k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nBut from a=2, we have b= [k(k +1)]/2 +1 = (k\u00b2 +k)/2 +1 = (k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nSo, consistent.\n\nSo, the solutions for a=2 are when b=(k\u00b2 +k +2)/2, and c is given by:\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, c = [ -3 \u00b1 m ] /2, where m=2k+1.\n\nSo,\n\nc = [ -3 + (2k +1) ] /2 = (2k -2)/2 =k -1\n\nand\n\nc = [ -3 - (2k +1) ] /2 = (-2k -4)/2 = -k -2\n\nDiscard the negative solution, so c=k-1.\n\nBut c must be >=0, so k-1 >=0 => k>=1.\n\nAlso, c <b.\n\nSo, c=k-1 < (k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nWhich is true for k>=1.\n\nSo, for a=2, each k>=1 gives a solution with c=k-1 and b=(k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nSo, for each a=2 and k>=1, we get a valid b and c.\n\nThus, for a=2, each k>=1 gives a solution, so for each b of the form (k\u00b2 +k +2)/2, there is a solution (a=2, c=k-1).\n\nSo, for a=2, the number of solutions per b is one for each such b.\n\nSimilarly, for a=3, let's see.\n\na=3.\n\nFrom a(b -1)=k(k+1), we have:\n\n3(b -1)=k(k +1)\n\nSo,\n\nb = [k(k +1)]/3 +1\n\nFor b to be integer, [k(k +1)] must be divisible by 3. Since k and k+1 are consecutive, one of them must be divisible by 3. So, k \u22610 or 2 mod3.\n\nSo, k can be 0,2,3,5,6, etc.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation for c is:\n\nc\u00b2 + (2*3 -1)c + (9 -3b)=0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc\u00b2 +5c + (9 -3b)=0\n\nThe discriminant D=25 -4*(9 -3b)=25 -36 +12b=12b -11.\n\nSo, sqrt(12b -11) must be integer.\n\nLet m = sqrt(12b -11), so m\u00b2=12b -11.\n\nFrom earlier, b= [k(k +1)]/3 +1.\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2=12*[k(k +1)/3 +1] -11=4k(k+1) +12 -11=4k(k+1) +1.\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2=4k(k+1)+1.\n\nHmm, so 4k(k+1) +1 must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nLet me compute 4k(k+1) +1 for small k:\n\nk=0: 0 +1=1=1\u00b2, yes.\n\nk=1:4*1*2 +1=9=3\u00b2, yes.\n\nk=2:4*2*3 +1=25=5\u00b2, yes.\n\nk=3:4*3*4 +1=49=7\u00b2, yes.\n\nk=4:4*4*5 +1=81=9\u00b2, yes.\n\nk=5:4*5*6 +1=121=11\u00b2, yes.\n\nWait a minute, this seems to be a pattern. 4k(k+1)+1 = (2k+1)^2.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n(2k+1)^2=4k\u00b2 +4k +1.\n\nBut 4k(k+1)+1=4k\u00b2 +4k +1.\n\nYes, exactly equal. So,\n\nm=2k+1.\n\nThus,\n\nFrom m=2k+1,\n\nm\u00b2=4k\u00b2 +4k +1=4k(k+1)+1.\n\nSo, for a=3, each k where 3 divides k(k+1) gives a valid solution.\n\nSo, from earlier, b= [k(k +1)]/3 +1.\n\nAnd c is given by:\n\nc = [ -5 \u00b1 m ] /2.\n\nWith m=2k +1,\n\nc = [ -5 + (2k +1) ] /2 = (2k -4)/2 =k -2\n\nand\n\nc= [ -5 - (2k +1) ] /2 = (-2k -6)/2 = -k -3.\n\nDiscard the negative solution, so c=k-2.\n\nBut c must be >=0, so k-2 >=0 =>k>=2.\n\nAlso, c <b.\n\nSo, c=k-2 < [k(k+1)]/3 +1.\n\nWhich is true for k>=2.\n\nThus, for a=3, each k>=2 gives a solution with c=k-2 and b= [k(k+1)]/3 +1.\n\nSo, for a=3, each k>=2 gives a solution.\n\nSo, for a=3, number of solutions per b is one for each such b.\n\nSo, from the patterns so far, for a=1,2,3, each a gives a sequence of b's where for each k, we have a solution.\n\nBut perhaps for higher a's, similar patterns emerge.\n\nBut let's see. Let's try a=4.\n\na=4.\n\nFrom a(b-1)=k(k+1), so 4(b-1)=k(k+1).\n\nThus,\n\nb= [k(k+1)]/4 +1.\n\nFor b to be integer, k(k+1) must be divisible by 4.\n\nSince k and k+1 are consecutive, one is even. To have their product divisible by 4, either k or k+1 must be divisible by 4, or one is divisible by 2 and the other by 2 as well. But since they are consecutive, only one can be even. So, to have k(k+1) divisible by 4, the even one must be divisible by 4.\n\nSo, either k \u22610 mod4 or k+1 \u22610 mod4.\n\nSo, k=0,3,4,7,8, etc.\n\nNow, the quadratic equation for c:\n\nc\u00b2 + (2*4 -1)c + (16 -4b)=0\n\nWhich is:\n\nc\u00b2 +7c + (16 -4b)=0\n\nThe discriminant D=49 -4*(16 -4b)=49 -64 +16b=16b -15.\n\nSo, sqrt(16b -15)=m must be integer.\n\nFrom earlier, b= [k(k +1)]/4 +1.\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2=16b -15=16*[k(k+1)/4 +1] -15=4k(k+1) +16 -15=4k(k+1)+1.\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2=4k(k+1)+1.\n\nAgain, as before, this is equal to (2k+1)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nm=2k+1.\n\nThus,\n\nFrom the quadratic equation,\n\nc = [ -7 \u00b1 m ] /2 = [ -7 \u00b1 (2k +1) ] /2.\n\nSo,\n\nc=( -7 +2k +1 )/2=(2k -6)/2=k-3.\n\nand\n\nc=( -7 -2k -1 )/2=(-2k -8)/2=-k -4.\n\nDiscard the negative solution, so c=k-3.\n\nc must be >=0, so k-3 >=0 =>k>=3.\n\nAlso, c <b= [k(k+1)]/4 +1.\n\nWhich is true for k>=3.\n\nSo, for a=4, each k>=3 where 4 divides k(k+1) gives a solution with c=k-3 and b= [k(k+1)]/4 +1.\n\nThus, for a=4, each such k gives a solution.\n\nSo, the pattern seems that for each a, when k >= a-1, we get a solution where c=k - (a-1).\n\nSo, generalizing, for each a, when k >=a-1, and a divides k(k+1), then we get a solution with c=k - (a-1).\n\nSo, for a given a, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k >=a-1 such that a divides k(k+1).\n\nSo, for each a, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of integers k >=a-1 where a divides k(k+1).\n\nSince k and k+1 are coprime, a must divide either k or k+1.\n\nSo, for a given a, the number of k's is equal to the number of k >=a-1 where k \u22610 mod a or k \u2261-1 mod a.\n\nSo, for each a, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such k's.\n\nBut for each a, the number of k's can vary, but perhaps for each a, there are infinitely many k's, but for each b, the number of a's contributing to it is limited.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, we can count the number of (a,c) pairs that satisfy the equation, which would be the number of a's for which there exists a k such that a divides k(k+1), and the corresponding c=k - (a-1) is less than b.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the number of solutions for b is one per k, but the same b can be generated by different a's and k's.\n\nSo, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we need to count the number of a's for which there exists a k such that:\n\n1. a divides k(k+1).\n\n2. b= [k(k+1)]/a +1.\n\n3. c=k - (a-1) < b.\n\nSo, for each a, we can find the k's that satisfy the above, and for each such k, we get a solution for b.\n\nBut since the same b can be generated by multiple a's, we need to find for each b, how many a's generate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the b's generated are unique, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as, for each a, the number of b's is infinite, but for each b, the number of a's that generate it is limited.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for small b's and see when it exceeds ten.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet's start with b=2.\n\nFor b=2, possible two-digit numbers are from 2 to 3 (since in base 2, two-digit numbers are 10_2=2 and 11_2=3).\n\nCheck each number:\n\nn=2: digits are 1 and 0. Sum=1+0=1. sqrt(2)=~1.414. Not equal.\n\nn=3: digits 1 and 1. Sum=2. sqrt(3)=~1.732. Not equal.\n\nSo, no b-eautiful numbers for b=2.\n\nb=3.\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 3: from 3 to 8 (since 10_3=3, 11_3=4, ..., 22_3=8).\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=3: digits 1,0. Sum=1. sqrt(3)=~1.732. Not equal.\n\nn=4: 1,1. Sum=2. sqrt(4)=2. Equal! So, 4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nn=5: 1,2. Sum=3. sqrt(5)=~2.236. Not equal.\n\nn=6: 2,0. Sum=2. sqrt(6)=~2.449. Not equal.\n\nn=7: 2,1. Sum=3. sqrt(7)=~2.645.

Not equal.\n\nn=9:2,1. Sum=3. sqrt(9)=3. Equal! So, 9 is 4-eautiful.\n\nn=10:2,2. Sum=4. sqrt(10)=~3.162. Not equal.\n\nn=11:2,3. Sum=5. sqrt(11)=~3.316. Not equal.\n\nn=12:3,0.

Not equal.\n\nSo, only one b-eautiful number for b=4.\n\nWait, but earlier for a=1, when b=4, let's see:\n\nFrom a=1, b= c\u00b2 +c +1.\n\nIf b=4, then c\u00b2 +c +1=4 =>c\u00b2 +c -3=0. Solutions c=(-1 \u00b1sqrt(13))/2, which are not integers. So, no solution for a=1 when b=4.\n\nBut from a=2, let's see:\n\na=2, b=(k\u00b2 +k +2)/2.\n\nSet this equal to 4:\n\n(k\u00b2 +k +2)/2=4 =>k\u00b2 +k +2=8 =>k\u00b2 +k -6=0.\n\nSolutions k=(-1 \u00b1sqrt(25))/2=(-1 \u00b15)/2.\n\nSo, k=2 or k=-3. So, k=2.\n\nThen, c=k-1=1.\n\nSo, n= a*b +c=2*4 +1=9, which is what we found.\n\nSimilarly, for a=3:\n\nb= [k(k+1)]/3 +1.\n\nSet equal to 4:\n\n[k(k+1)]/3 +1=4 =>k(k+1)=9.\n\nSolutions k=3 (3*4=12\u22609), k=2 (2*3=6\u22609), k=1 (1*2=2\u22609). So, no solution.\n\nThus, only a=2 gives a solution for b=4.\n\nSo, only one b-eautiful number.\n\nb=5.\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: from5 to24 (10_5=5, ..., 44_5=24).\n\nCheck each n:\n\nn=5:1,0.

No solution.\n\nThus, for b=9, two b-eautiful numbers:49 and64.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=36 was a solution. Let me check.\n\nn=36 in base9 is4*9 +0=36. So, a=4, c=0.\n\nSum=4+0=4. sqrt(36)=6. 4\u22606. So, not a solution.\n\nWait, but via the equation, for a=4:\n\nFrom a=4, b= [k(k+1)]/4 +1=9 =>k(k+1)=32. No solution.\n\nThus, only a=7 gives a solution for b=9: n=64.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=49 was a solution. Let me check.\n\nn=49 in base9:5*9 +4=49. So, a=5, c=4.\n\nSum=5+4=9. sqrt(49)=7. 9\u22607. So, not a solution.\n\nWait, but via the equation, for a=7, n=7*9 +1=64. Correct.\n\nThus, only one solution for b=9:64.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=49 was a solution, but it's not. So, only one solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier checks. Let me try to find all possible a and c for b=9.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nn =a*9 +c = (a +c)^2.\n\nSo,\n\na*9 +c =a\u00b2 +2ac +c\u00b2.\n\nRearranged:\n\na\u00b2 +2ac +c\u00b2 -9a -c=0.\n\nLet me try a=1:\n\n1 +2c +c\u00b2 -9 -c=0 =>c\u00b2 +c -8=0.

Solutions non-integer.\n\na=7:\n\n49 +14c +c\u00b2 -63 -c=0 =>c\u00b2 +13c -14=0. Solutions c=(-13 \u00b1sqrt(169 +56))/2=(-13 \u00b1sqrt(225))/2=(-13 \u00b115)/2.\n\nSo, c=(2)/2=1 or c=(-28)/2=-14. So, c=1.\n\nThus, n=7*9 +1=64. Correct.\n\na=8:\n\n64 +16c +c\u00b2 -72 -c=0 =>c\u00b2 +15c -8=0. Solutions non-integer.\n\nThus, only one solution for b=9:64.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=36 and49 were solutions, but they aren't. So, only n=64.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try a=5:\n\nFrom a=5, b=9.\n\nSo, a=5, b=9.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n5*9 +c = (5 +c)^2.\n\n45 +c =25 +10c +c\u00b2.\n\nRearranged:\n\nc\u00b2 +9c -20=0.\n\nSolutions c=(-9 \u00b1sqrt(81 +80))/2=(-9 \u00b1sqrt(161))/2. Not integer.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nThus, only one solution for b=9.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. It seems that for b=7, we had three solutions, but for higher b's, the number of solutions drops.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a pattern or find a way to compute the number of solutions for each b more efficiently.\n\nWait, earlier for a=1, each b of the form c\u00b2 +c +1 gives a solution. So, for each c, b increases quadratically.\n\nSimilarly, for a=2, b=(k\u00b2 +k +2)/2, which also increases quadratically.\n\nThus, as b increases, the number of a's that can generate it increases, leading to more b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps as b grows, the number of solutions increases.\n\nSo, to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten, we need to find b where multiple a's generate it.\n\nBut manually checking each b is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a formula for the number of solutions for each b.\n\nWait, from earlier, for each a, the number of solutions is determined by the number of k's such that a divides k(k+1), and c=k - (a-1) < b.\n\nBut since b is determined by a and k, perhaps for each a, the number of solutions is roughly proportional to the number of valid k's.\n\nBut perhaps for each a, the number of solutions is floor((b -1)/a).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of divisors of b-1, since a divides k(k+1), and b= [k(k+1)]/a +1.\n\nWait, not exactly. Because a divides k(k+1), but b is determined by a and k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write b-1 as [k(k+1)]/a.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each a, the number of solutions is floor(sqrt(4a(b-1)+1)), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the quadratic equation.\n\nFrom earlier, for each a, the number of solutions is the number of integer k's such that:\n\n1. a divides k(k+1).\n\n2. b= [k(k+1)]/a +1.\n\n3. c=k - (a-1) < b.\n\nBut since b= [k(k+1)]/a +1, c=k -a +1 < [k(k+1)]/a +1.\n\nWhich is always true for k >=a-1.\n\nThus, for each a, the number of solutions is the number of k's >=a-1 such that a divides k(k+1).\n\nBut since k and k+1 are coprime, a must divide either k or k+1.\n\nThus, for each a, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers k >=a-1 where k \u22610 mod a or k \u2261-1 mod a.\n\nSo, for each a, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such k's up to a certain limit.\n\nBut since k can be as large as needed, the number of solutions is infinite, but for each b, only certain a's will contribute.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can consider that for each a, there is exactly one k that gives a solution for a particular b.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of divisors of b-1 that are one less than a triangular number or something like that.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation:\n\nn = (a +c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nSo, n must be a perfect square, and the sum of its digits in base b must equal its square root.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of perfect squares n such that when expressed in base b, they are two-digit numbers, and the sum of the digits equals sqrt(n).\n\nThus, for each b, we can find all perfect squares n in [b, b^2 -1], because two-digit numbers in base b range from b to b^2 -1.\n\nSo, n must satisfy b <=n <=b^2 -1, and n must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me denote m = sqrt(n). So, m^2 =n, and m must satisfy sqrt(b) <=m <=sqrt(b^2 -1) ~b.\n\nSo, m ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b.\n\nFor each m in this range, check if m^2 can be expressed in base b as a two-digit number with digits a and c, such that a +c =m.\n\nSo, for each m from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b, check if m^2 can be written as a*b +c, where a and c are digits in base b (1<=a <b, 0<=c <b), and a +c =m.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b] such that m^2 can be expressed as a*b +c, with a +c =m.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is more manageable.\n\nLet me try this for b=13, as in the example.\n\nn=81=9^2.\n\nIn base13:81 /13=6 with remainder3. So, digits6 and3. Sum=9. Correct.\n\nSo, m=9.\n\nThus, for b=13, m ranges from ceil(sqrt(13))=4 to13.\n\nCheck each m from4 to13:\n\nm=4:16. In base13:1*13 +3=16. Sum=4. Correct. So,16 is 13-eautiful.\n\nm=5:25. In base13:1*13 +12=25. Sum=13. But 1+12=13\u22605. So, not.\n\nWait, but 1*13 +12=25. Sum=1+12=13\u22605. So, not a solution.\n\nWait, but 25 in base13 is 1C_13, where C represents12. Sum=1+12=13\u22605. So, not a solution.\n\nm=5:25. Next, check if 25 can be written as a*13 +c, with a +c=5.\n\nSo, a*13 +c=25, a +c=5.\n\nFrom a +c=5, c=5 -a.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\na*13 +5 -a=25 =>12a +5=25 =>12a=20 =>a=20/12=5/3. Not integer. So, no solution.\n\nThus, m=5: no solution.\n\nm=6:36. In base13:2*13 +10=36. Sum=2+10=12\u22606. Not a solution.\n\nCheck if 36 can be written as a*13 +c with a +c=6.\n\na +c=6 =>c=6 -a.\n\na*13 +6 -a=36 =>12a +6=36 =>12a=30 =>a=30/12=2.5. Not integer. No solution.\n\nm=7:49. In base13:3*13 +10=49. Sum=3+10=13\u22607. Not a solution.\n\nCheck if 49 can be written as a*13 +c with a +c=7.\n\nc=7 -a.\n\na*13 +7 -a=49 =>12a +7=49 =>12a=42 =>a=3.5. Not integer. No solution.\n\nm=8:64. In base13:4*13 +12=64. Sum=4+12=16\u22608. Not a solution.\n\nCheck if 64 can be written as a*13 +c with a +c=8.\n\nc=8 -a.\n\na*13 +8 -a=64 =>12a +8=64 =>12a=56 =>a=56/12=14/3. Not integer. No solution.\n\nm=9:81. As given, 6*13 +3=81. Sum=6+3=9. Correct.\n\nm=10:100. In base13:7*13 +9=100. Sum=7+9=16\u226010. Not a solution.\n\nCheck if 100 can be written as a*13 +c with a +c=10.\n\nc=10 -a.\n\na*13 +10 -a=100 =>12a +10=100 =>12a=90 =>a=7.5. Not integer. No solution.\n\nm=11:121. In base13:9*13 +4=121. Sum=9+4=13\u226011. Not a solution.\n\nCheck if 121 can be written as a*13 +c with a +c=11.\n\nc=11 -a.\n\na*13 +11 -a=121 =>12a +11=121 =>12a=110 =>a=110/12=55/6. Not integer. No solution.\n\nm=12:144. In base13:11*13 +1=144. Sum=11+1=12. Correct.\n\nThus, for b=13, two b-eautiful numbers:16 and144.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought only81 was, but according to this, both16 and144 are solutions.\n\nWait, 16 in base13 is13 +3=16. Sum=1+3=4. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\n144 in base13 is11*13 +1=144. Sum=11+1=12. sqrt(144)=12. Correct.\n\nThus, for b=13, two solutions.\n\nWait, but the problem states that81 is 13-eautiful, which is correct, but there's also16.\n\nThus, for b=13, two solutions.\n\nBut the problem asks for the least b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten. So, we need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such n's.\n\nGiven that for b=7, we had three solutions, and for higher b's, the number of solutions increases, perhaps we need to find when the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] that satisfy the conditions exceeds ten.\n\nBut manually checking each b is time-consuming. Perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] such that m^2 can be expressed as a*b +c, with a +c =m.\n\nThus, for each m, we can write m^2 =a*b +c, with a +c =m.\n\nFrom a +c =m, we have c=m -a.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nm^2 =a*b +m -a.\n\nRearranged:\n\na*b -a =m^2 -m.\n\na*(b -1) =m(m -1).\n\nThus,\n\na = [m(m -1)] / (b -1).\n\nSince a must be an integer between1 andb-1, [m(m -1)] must be divisible byb-1.\n\nThus, for each m, if [m(m -1)] is divisible byb-1, then a is integer, and c=m -a must be less thanb.\n\nThus, for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] such thatb-1 divides m(m -1).\n\nThus, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] whereb-1 divides m(m -1).\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the smallest b where the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] such thatb-1 divides m(m -1) exceeds ten.\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nSo, for each b, compute the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b] whereb-1 divides m(m -1).\n\nWe need to find the smallest b where this count >10.\n\nLet me try to find such b.\n\nLet me denote d =b-1.\n\nThus, d =b-1.\n\nWe need to find the smallest d+1 where the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d+1] such thatd divides m(m -1) exceeds ten.\n\nThus, for each d, find the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d+1] where d divides m(m -1).\n\nWe need the smallest d+1 where this count >10.\n\nSo, for d=1,2,3,..., compute the number of m's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d+1] where d divides m(m -1).\n\nWe need the smallest d+1 where this count >10.\n\nLet me try to compute this for d from1 upwards until we find the required b=d+1.\n\nLet's start with d=1:\n\nd=1.\n\nm ranges from ceil(sqrt(2))=2 to2.\n\nCheck if1 divides m(m-1).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when written in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, I should understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1. So the number n can be expressed as:\n\nn = a*b + c\n\nNow, the condition given is that the sum of the two digits (a + c) equals the square root of n. So,\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut n is a*b + c, so substituting, we get:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express b in terms of a and c. Let me try to group terms involving b:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b\n\nSo,\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a(a + 2c) + c(c - 1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to factor out a from the numerator:\n\n= a(a + 2c) + c^2 - c\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, (c^2 - c) must be a multiple of a.\n\nLet me note that a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. But since we're dealing with two-digit numbers in base b, c can be 0, but a has to be at least 1.\n\nWait, but if c is 0, then n = a*b. Then the sum of digits is a + 0 = a. So sqrt(n) = a. So n = a^2. So n = a*b = a^2. So b = a. But in that case, n would be a^2 = a*b, so b = a. But in that case, the digits are a and 0, which is allowed. So c=0 is possible.\n\nBut let's see. For each a and c, we can compute b as:\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer. Let's denote k = (c^2 - c)/a, where k is an integer.\n\nSo, c^2 - c = a*k\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). Since c and c-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, a must divide either c or c-1, but not necessarily both.\n\nSo, for each a, c can be chosen such that c(c-1) is a multiple of a.\n\nAlternatively, since c is a digit in base b, c must be less than b, which is greater than or equal to 2. So c can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nBut in this equation, we have a and c related through a*k = c(c-1). So perhaps for each a, I can find possible c's such that c(c-1) is divisible by a.\n\nWait, but a is also a digit, so a is from 1 to b-1, and since b is at least 2, a can be 1.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about the equation:\n\nn = a*b + c\n\nand\n\nsqrt(n) = a + c\n\nSo, n = (a + c)^2\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nWhich can be rearranged to:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nSo,\n\nb = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c]/a\n\n= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSo, same as before. So, for b to be integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, let me consider that (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, a divides c(c - 1). Since c and c -1 are coprime, a must be a product of factors of c and c-1, but given that a is a digit, which is less than b, perhaps a is a factor of either c or c -1.\n\nBut maybe it's better to consider for each a, find c such that c(c -1) is divisible by a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express c in terms of a. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n), so n = s^2.\n\nAlso, n = a*b + c.\n\nSo, s^2 = a*b + c.\n\nBut s = a + c, so substituting:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express b in terms of s and c:\n\nFrom s = a + c, so a = s - c.\n\nSubstituting into n = a*b + c = (s - c)*b + c.\n\nBut n = s^2, so:\n\ns^2 = (s - c)*b + c\n\nWhich is:\n\ns^2 = s*b - c*b + c\n\nRearranging:\n\ns^2 = s*b + c*(1 - b)\n\nThen, solving for b:\n\ns*b = s^2 - c*(1 - b)\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Let me try another approach.\n\nFrom s^2 = (s - c)*b + c, we can write:\n\ns^2 = s*b - c*b + c\n\nLet's collect terms with b:\n\ns^2 = b*(s - c) + c\n\nSo,\n\nb*(s - c) = s^2 - c\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = (s^2 - c)/(s - c)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= [s^2 - c]/[s - c]\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or see if it can be factored.\n\nNotice that s^2 - c = (s - c)(s + c) + (c^2 - c)\n\nWait, let me try:\n\n(s - c)(s + c) = s^2 - c^2\n\nSo, s^2 - c = (s - c)(s + c) + c^2 - c\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ (s - c)(s + c) + c^2 - c ] / (s - c )\n\n= s + c + [c^2 - c]/(s - c)\n\nSo,\n\nb = s + c + (c(c - 1))/(s - c)\n\nSince b must be integer, (c(c - 1))/(s - c) must be integer.\n\nBut s = a + c, and a = s - c.\n\nSo, s - c = a, which is positive because a is at least 1.\n\nSo, (c(c - 1))/a must be integer.\n\nWhich brings us back to the previous conclusion: a divides c(c - 1).\n\nSo, for each a, c must satisfy c(c - 1) is divisible by a.\n\nSo, perhaps for each a, I can find possible c's such that c(c - 1) mod a == 0, and then compute b accordingly.\n\nBut maybe it's better to fix a and c and compute b, then check if b is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and also that in base b, the number n has two digits, which requires that n >= b (since two digits in base b go from b to b^2 -1).\n\nWait, no. Actually, a two-digit number in base b is from b (which is 10_b) up to (b^2 -1) which is (b-1)(b-1)_b.\n\nSo, n must be between b and b^2 -1, inclusive.\n\nBut n is s^2, where s = a + c.\n\nAlso, since a is from 1 to b-1 and c is from 0 to b-1, s can range from 1 + 0 = 1 to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.\n\nSo, s^2 must be between 1^2 = 1 and (2b - 2)^2. But n must also be between b and b^2 -1.\n\nSo, for n to be a two-digit number in base b, s^2 must satisfy:\n\nb \u2264 s^2 \u2264 b^2 - 1\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b^2 - 1)\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 -1 ) is less than b, so s must be less than b.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSo, s must be less than b.\n\nBut s = a + c, and a can be up to b-1, c up to b-1, so s can be up to 2b - 2, but for n to be a two-digit number, s must be less than b. So, s < b.\n\nSo, s is in the range 1 \u2264 s < b.\n\nAlso, since n = s^2 \u2265 b, we have s^2 \u2265 b.\n\nSo,\n\ns \u2265 sqrt(b)\n\nBut s is an integer, so s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, s is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nFor each such s, we can find possible pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s and c(c - 1) is divisible by a.\n\nWait, but that's getting a bit abstract. Maybe I can approach this problem by considering possible s and a, c.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each base b, iterate over possible s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, and for each s, find the number of pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s, a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and c(c -1) is divisible by a.\n\nBut this might get complicated, especially since we need to find the smallest b where the total number of such n's (i.e., s^2) exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (a, c) such that a + c = s, and c(c - 1) is divisible by a, with s ranging as above.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to count them for each b, I can find a way to compute the number of valid (a, c) pairs for each b, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the number of such pairs for a given b.\n\nGiven b, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n\n- s must be such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, which it is if s^2 < b^2.\n\nWhich is always true because s < b, so s^2 < b^2.\n\nSo for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can find possible a and c such that a + c = s, a divides c(c -1), and a is at least 1, c is at least 0, and both a and c are less than b.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid (a, c) pairs is equal to the number of a's such that a divides c(c -1), where c = s - a.\n\nSo, for each s, let's express c as s - a, then c = s - a.\n\nSo, we have a divides (s - a)(s - a - 1).\n\nSo, a divides (s - a)(s - a - 1).\n\nLet me denote d = a.\n\nSo, d divides (s - d)(s - d -1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to d divides (s - d)(s - d -1).\n\nBut s - d = c, which is at least 0, so s - d >=0.\n\nWait, but c can be up to s -1, since a is at least 1.\n\nSo, for each s, a can range from 1 to s -1 (since c = s - a must be at least 0, so a <= s).\n\nBut also, a must be less than b, so a <= min(s -1, b -1).\n\nBut since s <= b -1, and a <= s -1, which is <= b - 2, so a is at most b-2.\n\nSo, for each s, a can range from 1 to min(s -1, b -1).\n\nBut since s can be up to b -1, a can be up to b-2.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid a's is equal to the number of divisors d of (s - d)(s - d -1), where d = a.\n\nWait, this seems a bit recursive. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that d must divide (s - d)(s - d -1).\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nd divides (s - d)(s - d -1)\n\nLet me rewrite this:\n\nLet me denote k = s - d.\n\nSo, d divides k(k - 1).\n\nBut k = s - d, so d divides (s - d)(s - d - 1).\n\nBut since d = a, and a is between 1 and s -1, k ranges from s -1 down to 1 as a increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as for each a, we have that a divides (s - a)(s - a -1).\n\nSo, for a given s, the number of a's such that a divides (s - a)(s - a -1) is equal to the number of a's in [1, s -1] where a divides (s - a)(s - a -1).\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I can try small values of b and see how many b-eautiful numbers there are for each b, then find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nLet's start with b = 2.\n\nFor b=2:\n\ns must satisfy sqrt(2) <= s < 2. Since s must be integer, s=2 is not less than 2, so s must be at least 2, but s <2 is not possible. So no solutions. So b=2 has 0 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nb=3:\n\ns must satisfy sqrt(3) \u22481.732 <= s <3. So s can be 2.\n\nSo s=2.\n\nThen, a + c =2.\n\nPossible a from 1 to 2 (since c = 2 -a must be >=0 and <3).\n\nSo a can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor each a, check if a divides c(c -1):\n\nCase 1: a=1, c=1.\n\nCheck if 1 divides 1*0=0. Yes, because any number divides 0.\n\nSo this is valid.\n\nSo n =1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2=1+1. So valid.\n\nCase 2: a=2, c=0.\n\nCheck if 2 divides 0*(-1)=0. Yes, 2 divides 0.\n\nSo n=2*3 +0=6. sqrt(6) is not integer. Wait, wait, no. Because n must be s^2. s=2, so n=4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, n = a*b + c = 2*3 +0=6. But s = a + c =2+0=2. So sqrt(n) should be 2, but sqrt(6) is not 2. So this is invalid.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, n = a*b + c =2*3 +0=6. s = a + c =2 +0=2. So sqrt(n) should be 2, but sqrt(6) is about 2.449, which isn't 2. So this is invalid.\n\nSo for a=2, c=0, n=6 is not equal to s^2=4. So this is not valid.\n\nSo only a=1, c=1 is valid. So for b=3, there's 1 b-eautiful number.\n\nSo count is 1.\n\nb=4:\n\ns must satisfy sqrt(4)=2 <=s <4. So s=2,3.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=2:\n\na can be from 1 to1 (since c=2 -a must be >=0, and a <=4-1=3, but s=2, so a <=1).\n\nSo a=1, c=1.\n\nCheck if 1 divides 1*0=0. Yes.\n\nn=1*4 +1=5. s=2, sqrt(5) \u22482.236\u22602. So invalid.\n\nWait, but n should be s^2=4. So 1*4 +1=5\u22604.

For example, when c(c-1) is a multiple of a, which is s - c.\n\nWait, perhaps when c(c-1) is divisible by a, which is s - c, so s - c divides c(c-1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n(s - c) divides c(c-1).\n\nBut s = a + c, so s - c = a.\n\nSo, a divides c(c-1).\n\nSo, for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors a of c(c-1), where a = s - c.\n\nBut since a is s - c, which is positive, and c is s - a, which is also positive.\n\nThis seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of for each possible c, find a's such that a divides c(c-1), and a + c is s, which is sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for a given a, the possible c's are such that c(c -1) is divisible by a, and c = s - a, where s = a + c.\n\nWait, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of for each a, c must satisfy c(c -1) \u2261 0 mod a.\n\nSo, for each a, c can be 0,1, or such that c \u22610 or 1 mod a.\n\nBut c is a digit in base b, so c < b.\n\nSo, for each a, c can be 0,1, a, a+1, 2a, 2a+1, etc., up to b-1.\n\nBut since c must be less than b, the possible c's are 0,1,a,a+1,2a,2a+1,... but ensuring c < b.\n\nBut this might not directly help.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, for each a and c, we have:\n\nb = (a + c)^2 - c / a\n\nSo, b must be integer.\n\nSo, for each a, c, compute b as (a + c)^2 - c divided by a, and if it's integer and b > c (since c < b), then it's a valid base.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to iterate over possible a and c, compute b, and count how many times each b occurs, then find the smallest b with count >10.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nWe can consider a from 1 upwards, and c from 0 upwards, compute b = ((a + c)^2 - c)/a, check if b is integer and b > c (since c < b), and then count for each b.\n\nWe need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nSo, let's list possible a and c, compute b, and count.\n\nLet me make a table.\n\nStart with a=1:\n\nc can be 0,1,2,...\n\nFor a=1, c must satisfy that 1 divides c(c-1), which it always does.\n\nSo for a=1, any c >=0.\n\nBut b must be integer and b > c.\n\nCompute b = (1 + c)^2 - c /1 = (1 + 2c + c^2 - c) = c^2 + c +1.\n\nSo, b = c^2 + c +1.\n\nWe need b > c.\n\nWhich is always true since c^2 +c +1 > c for c >=0.\n\nSo for a=1, c=0: b=0+0+1=1. But b must be >=2. So discard.\n\nc=1: b=1+1+1=3.\n\nSo for a=1, c=1: b=3. n=1*3 +1=4. Which is valid.\n\nc=2: b=4 +2 +1=7. So b=7.\n\nn=1*7 +2=9. Valid.\n\nc=3: b=9 +3 +1=13.\n\nn=1*13 +3=16.

Valid.\n\nSo for a=1, c from 1 to 10, we get b=3,7,13,21,31,43,57,73,91,111.\n\nEach of these b's will have at least one b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each of these b's, their count increases by 1.\n\nNow, a=2:\n\nFor a=2, c must satisfy 2 divides c(c-1).\n\nc(c-1) must be even, which it always is because either c or c-1 is even.\n\nSo for a=2, any c is allowed, as long as c < b.\n\nCompute b = (2 + c)^2 - c /2 = (4 +4c +c^2 -c)/2 = (c^2 +3c +4)/2.\n\nWe need this to be integer, so c^2 +3c +4 must be even.\n\nc^2 +3c is c(c +3). If c is even, c(c+3) is even. If c is odd, c+3 is even, so c(c+3) is even. So c^2 +3c is even, so c^2 +3c +4 is even +4= even. So yes, b is integer.\n\nAlso, b must be >c.\n\nSo for a=2, c can be 0,1,2,...\n\nCompute b for various c:\n\nc=0:\n\nb=(0 +0 +4)/2=4/2=2.\n\nBut b must be >c=0, which it is.

Wait, no, the highest counts are 5, which are for b=7,31,23,43,11.\n\nWait, but we need a b where the count is more than 10. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I didn't consider higher a's. Because so far, the maximum count is 5.\n\nBut the problem says to find the least integer b >=2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, perhaps the counts increase as a increases, but I only went up to a=10.\n\nWait, but for each a, the number of valid c's increases, which could lead to more b's with higher counts.\n\nBut this manual approach is time-consuming. Maybe I can look for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b is a perfect square, there are more solutions.\n\nWait, another approach: For a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (a, c) such that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c), and a and c are digits in base b.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can think of s = a + c, so s^2 = a*b + c.\n\nRearranged: s^2 = a*b + (s - a).\n\nSo,\n\ns^2 = a*(b -1) + s.\n\nRearranged:\n\na*(b -1) = s^2 - s.\n\nSo,\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result a must satisfy 1 <= a <= b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s such that:\n\n1. s is integer, 1 <= s <= b -1.\n\n2. (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1).\n\n3. a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is an integer, 1 <= a <= b -1.\n\n4. c = s - a is a digit in base b, i.e., 0 <= c <= b -1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid s's is equal to the number of divisors d of (s^2 - s) where d = b -1.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: For each b, let k = b -1.\n\nThen, a = (s^2 - s)/k.\n\nWe need a to be integer, 1 <= a <= k.\n\nAlso, c = s - a must be >=0 and <=b-1= k.\n\nSo, c = s - (s^2 -s)/k >=0.\n\nWhich is s - (s^2 -s)/k >=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by k:\n\ns*k - s^2 + s >=0.\n\ns(k +1) -s^2 >=0.\n\ns(k +1 - s) >=0.\n\nSince s >=1, we need k +1 - s >=0 => s <= k +1.\n\nBut s <=k, since s <b.\n\nSo, s can be up to k.\n\nSo, for each k, s ranges from 1 to k.\n\nBut a must be integer, so (s^2 - s) must be divisible by k.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of s in [1, k] such that k divides s(s -1).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: For each k, count the number of s in [1, k] such that k divides s(s -1).\n\nAnd for each such s, a = (s^2 -s)/k must satisfy 1 <= a <=k.\n\nAnd c = s -a must satisfy 0 <=c <=k.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of valid s's is equal to the number of s in [1,k] where k divides s(s-1), and a = (s^2 -s)/k is between 1 and k, and c = s -a is between 0 and k.\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nSo, to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10, we can express it as finding the smallest k+1 where the number of s in [1,k] such that k divides s(s-1), and a = (s^2 -s)/k is between 1 and k, and c = s -a is between 0 and k, is greater than 10.\n\nSo, let's denote f(k) as the number of valid s for base k+1.\n\nWe need to find the smallest k+1 such that f(k) >10.\n\nSo, let's compute f(k) for increasing k until we find f(k) >10.\n\nCompute f(k) for k=1,2,3,...:\n\nk=1:\n\ns can be 1.\n\nCheck if 1 divides 1*0=0.

Hmm, perhaps the discrepancy arises because this method counts only the s's where a is integer, but in the a-based approach, for a=1, c=2, we get b=7, which corresponds to s=3.\n\nBut according to this method, for k=6, s=3: a=(9-3)/6=1. So s=3 is counted, but also s=4 and s=6.\n\nWait, in the previous approach, for b=7, s can be 3,4,6, etc., but according to this method, for k=6, s=3,4,6 are valid, giving a=1,2,5, which are all <=6.\n\nSo f(6)=3.\n\nBut in the a-based approach, for b=7, we had three numbers:9,16,25, which correspond to s=3,4,5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the a-based approach, for b=7, we had:\n\nFrom a=1,c=2: s=3.\n\nFrom a=2,c=2: s=4.\n\nFrom a=3,c=1: s=4.\n\nWait, no, that might not align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discrepancy is because the a-based approach allows multiple a's for the same s, but the k-based approach counts each s once.\n\nWait, no, in the k-based approach, for each s, if a is valid, it counts once. So for k=6, s=3,4,6 are valid, each contributing one b-eautiful number.\n\nBut in the a-based approach, for b=7, we had three numbers:9,16,25, which correspond to s=3,4,5.\n\nWait, but s=5 for b=7: a=3, c=2.\n\nSo a=(25 -5)/6=20/6\u22483.333. Not integer. So s=5 is not counted in the k-based approach.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the k-based approach is more accurate, as it only counts s's where a is integer.\n\nSo, perhaps in the a-based approach, I was counting some s's where a is not integer, leading to incorrect counts.\n\nTherefore, the correct count for b=7 is f(6)=3, which corresponds to s=3,4,6.\n\nSo, for each k, f(k) is the number of valid s's, each contributing one b-eautiful number.\n\nThus, to find the smallest b where f(k) >10, we need to find the smallest k where f(k) >10.\n\nLooking back, up to k=20, the maximum f(k) is 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go higher.\n\nLet me try k=21:\n\nk=21:\n\ns=1-21.\n\ns=1: a=0.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is. \n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, in base b, n can be written as a two-digit number, say 'd1 d0' where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. That means d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the units place.\n2. The sum of these two digits (d1 + d0) is equal to the square root of n.\n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). \n\nSo, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. In base b, a two-digit number is d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. So, d1 can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero), and d0 can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nGiven that n = d1 * b + d0, and the sum of digits is d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = d1 + d0. Let's denote s = d1 + d0, so s must be a positive integer because both d1 and d0 are non-negative integers, and d1 is at least 1.\n\nTherefore, n = s\u00b2. So, substituting back, we have s\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0. But since d0 = s - d1 (because s = d1 + d0), we can substitute that into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1)\n=> s\u00b2 = d1 * (b - 1) + s\n=> d1 * (b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s\n=> d1 = (s\u00b2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer within that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can look for integers s such that s\u00b2 - s is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and d0 = s - d1 is also between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, for each base b, I can iterate over possible s and check if d1 is valid.\n\nBut since I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe it's better to find, for each b, the number of valid s that satisfy the conditions, and then find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.\n\nLet me formalize the steps:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n   a. For each possible s starting from 1 upwards:\n      i. Check if s\u00b2 - s is divisible by (b - 1). Let me denote k = (b - 1), so s\u00b2 - s must be divisible by k.\n      ii. If yes, compute d1 = (s\u00b2 - s) / k.\n      iii. Check if d1 is an integer between 1 and (b - 1), and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and (b - 1).\n      iv. If both d1 and d0 are valid, then this s contributes to a b-eautiful number.\n   b. Count how many such s exist for each b.\n   c. If the count exceeds 10, return this b as the answer.\n\nBut this approach might be computationally intensive if done naively, especially since I don't know how high b needs to go. Maybe I can find a mathematical relationship or constraints to limit the possible values of s and b.\n\nFirst, note that n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must satisfy b \u2264 n < b\u00b2. Because in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBut n is equal to s\u00b2, so s\u00b2 must satisfy b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2. Taking square roots, sqrt(b) \u2264 s < b. Since s is an integer, s ranges from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.\n\nWait, that's an important point. For each base b, the possible values of s are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. Because s\u00b2 must be at least b (since n is a two-digit number in base b, so n >= b) and less than b\u00b2 (so s\u00b2 < b\u00b2, so s < b).\n\nSo, for each b, s can be in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. That gives the possible s values for each b.\n\nAlso, since d1 must be at least 1 and at most b - 1, and d0 must be at least 0 and at most b - 1, we can derive some constraints on s and b.\n\nGiven that d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/ (b - 1), and d1 must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b - 1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid s is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting d1 is in [1, b - 1], and d0 is in [0, b - 1].\n\nWait, but since d0 = s - d1, and d0 must be between 0 and b - 1, so s - d1 >= 0 => d1 <= s. Also, s - d1 <= b - 1 => d1 >= s - (b - 1). But since d1 >=1, we have:\n\ns - (b - 1) <= d1 <= s\n\nBut since d1 is at least 1, so combining these, 1 <= d1 <= min(s, b - 1). But d1 is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1). So, for each s, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must be between 1 and min(s, b - 1).\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the possible bases b satisfy (b - 1) divides (s\u00b2 - s), and d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b - 1, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b - 1.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to consider each base b, and for each b, iterate over possible s and count the valid ones.\n\nBut since I don't know the upper limit for b, perhaps it's better to find a way to compute the number of s for each b.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1*(b - 1)\n\nWe can rewrite this as s\u00b2 - s = k*d1, where k = b - 1.\n\nBut since d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k, and d1 must be an integer, so k must divide s(s - 1). So, for each s, the possible k (which is b - 1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1).\n\nBut since k = b - 1, and b >=2, so k >=1.\n\nMoreover, since n = s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b, which implies that s\u00b2 < b\u00b2. So, s < b. Therefore, s <= b -1.\n\nBut k = b -1, so s <= k +1.\n\nWait, so for each s, the possible k's are the divisors of s(s - 1), where k >=1, and k +1 > s (since b = k +1, and s < b = k +1).\n\nWait, that might not hold. Let me think.\n\nWait, from n = s\u00b2 < b\u00b2, so s < b. So, s < k +1, which implies s <= k. So, for each s, k must be at least s.\n\nBut k is a divisor of s(s - 1). So, for each s, k must be a divisor of s(s -1) and k >= s.\n\nWait, but s(s -1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's even. So, for each s, the possible k's are the divisors of s(s -1) that are >= s.\n\nSo, for each s, let's find all k such that k divides s(s -1), and k >= s.\n\nEach such k would correspond to a base b = k +1, and for each such k, we can check if d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k is an integer between 1 and k, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and k.\n\nWait, but since k = b -1, and d1 must be <= b -1 = k, and d0 = s - d1 must be <= k.\n\nBut since d0 = s - d1, and d1 >=1, d0 <= s -1.\n\nBut since s <= k, d0 = s - d1 <= s -1 <= k -1, which is acceptable because d0 must be <= k.\n\nSimilarly, d0 >=0 implies that d1 <= s, which is already satisfied because d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k. Since k >= s, (s\u00b2 - s)/k <= (s\u00b2 - s)/s = s -1, so d1 <= s -1, which is less than s, so d0 = s - d1 >=1.\n\nWait, no, d0 could be zero if d1 = s. But wait, since k >= s, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k <= (s\u00b2 - s)/s = s -1. So, d1 <= s -1, so d0 = s - d1 >=1.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors k of s(s -1) such that k >= s, and d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k is an integer between 1 and k, and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and k.\n\nBut since k >= s, and d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k <= (s\u00b2 - s)/s = s -1, which is less than s, so d1 is automatically less than s, and since k >= s, d1 is <= s -1 < k, so d1 is <=k-1, which is within the required range.\n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 >= s - (s -1) = 1, so d0 >=1, which is acceptable because d0 can be zero, but in this case, it's at least 1. Wait, no, d0 could be zero if d1 = s, but since d1 <= s -1, d0 >=1. So, d0 is between 1 and s -1.\n\nWait, but the problem states that n is a two-digit number in base b, which allows d0 to be zero. So, in our case, d0 is at least 1, so that's fine.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid bases b is equal to the number of divisors k of s(s -1) such that k >= s, and d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k is an integer between 1 and k.\n\nBut since k divides s(s -1), d1 will be an integer, so we just need to ensure that k >= s.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s -1) that are >= s.\n\nEach such k corresponds to a base b = k +1, and for that base, s is a valid digit sum, so n = s\u00b2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nTherefore, for each s, we can find the number of bases b where s is a valid digit sum, which is equal to the number of divisors of s(s -1) that are >= s.\n\nBut our goal is, for each base b, count how many s's are valid for that b, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, for each base b, the number of valid s's is equal to the number of divisors k of s(s -1) where k = b -1 and k >= s.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this from the perspective of each s, and for each s, find all possible k's (which are divisors of s(s -1) and >= s), and then for each such k, increment the count for base b = k +1.\n\nThis way, we can accumulate the number of s's for each base b.\n\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each s starting from 1 upwards:\n   a. Compute m = s(s - 1).\n   b. Find all divisors k of m where k >= s.\n   c. For each such k, compute b = k + 1.\n   d. For each b, increment a counter by 1, since s contributes to a b-eautiful number for this b.\n\n2. Once we've processed enough s's, find the smallest b where the counter exceeds 10.\n\nBut how high do I need to go with s? Well, since for each s, the corresponding b is k +1, and k is a divisor of s(s -1). The maximum possible k for a given s is s(s -1), which would make b = s(s -1) +1, but that's a very high base. However, since we're looking for the smallest b, perhaps we can limit s to a reasonable number, say up to 100 or so, and see if any b's below a certain threshold have counts over 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the number of divisors k of m = s(s -1) that are >= s.\n\nSince m = s(s -1) = s\u00b2 - s, which factors into s and (s -1), which are coprime because they are consecutive integers.\n\nSo, the number of divisors of m is equal to the product of the number of divisors of s and the number of divisors of (s -1).\n\nBut we are interested in the number of divisors k of m such that k >= s.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of m that are >= s.\n\nBut since m = s(s -1), and s and s -1 are coprime, the divisors of m are products of the divisors of s and the divisors of s -1.\n\nSo, each divisor d of m can be written as d = a * b, where a divides s and b divides s -1.\n\nWe need to find the number of such d where d >= s.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of k's is equal to the number of pairs (a, b) where a | s, b | (s -1), and a*b >= s.\n\nEach such pair corresponds to a divisor k = a*b >= s.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of such pairs (a, b) where a*b >= s.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can note that for a given s, the maximum possible k is s(s -1), and the minimum k is s (since k must be >= s). But k must divide m = s(s -1), so the possible k's are the divisors of m in the range [s, m].\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of m that are >= s.\n\nSo, let's compute for each s, the number of divisors of m = s(s -1) that are >= s.\n\nThen, for each such divisor k, we can add to the count for base b = k +1.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, for each s starting from 1 upwards, compute m = s(s -1), find all its divisors, count how many are >= s, and for each such k, add 1 to the count for b = k +1.\n\nWe can keep a dictionary or an array to track the count for each base b.\n\nOnce we've processed enough s's, we can check which base has a count exceeding 10 and return the smallest such b.\n\nThis seems computationally feasible, especially since for small s, m isn't too large, and the number of divisors is manageable.\n\nLet me try to work through some small s and see how it goes.\n\nLet's start with s=1:\n\ns=1:\nm = 1*0 = 0. Hmm, but 0 has infinitely many divisors, which doesn't make sense. So, s must be at least 2.\n\ns=2:\nm=2*1=2. Divisors of 2 are 1,2.\nWe need k >=2. So, only k=2 is valid.\nSo, for k=2, b=3.\nSo, count[3] +=1.\n\ns=3:\nm=3*2=6. Divisors:1,2,3,6.\nk >=3: 3,6.\nSo, for k=3, b=4; k=6, b=7.\ncount[4] +=1; count[7] +=1.\n\ns=4:\nm=4*3=12.

Listing all divisors >=40 is tedious, but let's proceed.\n\nThe divisors of 1560 that are >=40:\n\n40,48,52,60,65,78,80, etc. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to list all:\n\nDivisors of 1560:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 26, 30, 39, 40, 52, 60, 65, 78, 120, 130, 156, 195, 260, 312, 390, 520, 780, 1560.\n\nSo, the divisors >=40:40,52,60,65,78,120,130,156,195,260,312,390,520,780,1560.\n\nThus, k=40: b=41; k=52: b=53; k=60: b=61; k=65: b=66; k=78: b=79; k=120: b=121; k=130: b=131; k=156: b=157; k=195: b=196; k=260: b=261; k=312: b=313; k=390: b=391; k=520: b=521; k=780: b=781; k=1560: b=1561.\ncount[41] +=1; count[53] +=1; count[61] +=1; count[66] +=1; count[79] +=1; count[121] +=1; count[131] +=1; count[157] +=1; count[196] +=1; count[261] +=1; count[313] +=1; count[391] +=1; count[521] +=1; count[781] +=1; count[1561] +=1.\n\nNow, updating counts for s=31 to s=40:\n\ns=31:\nb=32:1; b=63:1; b=94:1; b=156:1; b=187:1; b=311:1; b=466:1; b=931:1.\n\ns=32:\nb=33:1; b=63:1; b=125:1; b=249:1; b=497:1; b=993:1.\n\ns=33:\nb=34:1; b=45:1; b=49:1; b=67:1; b=89:1; b=133:1; b=177:1; b=265:1; b=353:1; b=529:1; b=1057:1.\n\ns=34:\nb=35:1; b=52:1; b=67:1; b=103:1; b=188:1; b=375:1; b=562:1; b=1123:1.\n\ns=35:\nb=36:1; b=71:1; b=86:1; b=120:1; b=171:1; b=239:1; b=596:1; b=1191:1.\n\ns=36:\nb=37:1; b=43:1; b=46:1; b=61:1; b=64:1; b=71:1; b=85:1; b=91:1; b=106:1; b=127:1; b=141:1; b=181:1; b=211:1; b=253:1; b=316:1; b=421:1; b=631:1; b=1261:1.\n\ns=37:\nb=38:1; b=75:1; b=112:1; b=149:1; b=223:1; b=445:1; b=667:1; b=1333:1.\n\ns=38:\nb=39:1; b=75:1; b=704:1; b=1407:1.\n\ns=39:\nb=40:1; b=58:1; b=79:1; b=115:1; b=248:1; b=495:1; b=742:1; b=1483:1.\n\ns=40:\nb=41:1; b=53:1; b=61:1; b=66:1; b=79:1; b=121:1; b=131:1; b=157:1; b=196:1; b=261:1; b=313:1; b=391:1; b=521:1; b=781:1; b=1561:1.\n\nNow, updating the counts:\n\nLooking for bases with counts >1:\n\nb=31:3\nb=43:3\nb=51:2\nb=79:2 +1 (from s=36) +1 (from s=40) =4\nb=85:2 +1 (from s=36) =3\nb=106:2 +1 (from s=36) =3\nb=121:2 +1 (from s=36) +1 (from s=40) =4\nb=36:1 +1 (from s=35) +1 (from s=36) =3\nb=46:1 (from s=36)\nb=61:2 +1 (from s=36) +1 (from s=40) =4\nb=64:1 (from s=36)\nb=66:1 (from s=40)\nb=71:1 +1 (from s=36) +1 (from s=40) =3\nb=86:1 (from s=35)\nb=91:1 (from s=36)\nb=127:1 +1 (from s=36) =2\nb=141:1 +1 (from s=36) =2\nb=181:1 (from s=36)\nb=253:1 +1 (from s=36) =2\nb=316:1 (from s=36)\nb=421:1 +1 (from s=36) =2\nb=631:1 (from s=36)\nb=1261:1 (from s=36)\nb=37:1 +1 (from s=36) =2\nb=43: already 3\nb=38:1 (from s=37)\nb=75:1 +1 (from s=32) +1 (from s=37) +1 (from s=38) =4\nb=112:1 (from s=37)\nb=149:1 (from s=37)\nb=223:1 (from s=37)\nb=445:1 (from s=37)\nb=667:1 (from s=37)\nb=1333:1 (from s=37)\nb=39:1 +1 (from s=38) +1 (from s=39) =3\nb=704:1 (from s=38)\nb=1407:1 (from s=38)\nb=40:1 +1 (from s=39) =2\nb=58:1 (from s=39)\nb=79: already 4\nb=115:1 (from s=39)\nb=248:1 (from s=39)\nb=495:1 (from s=39)\nb=742:1 (from s=39)\nb=1483:1 (from s=39)\nb=41:1 (from s=40)\nb=53:1 (from s=40)\nb=61: already 4\nb=66: already 1\nb=79: already 4\nb=121: already 4\nb=131:1 (from s=40)\nb=157:1 (from s=40)\nb=196:1 (from s=40)\nb=261:1 (from s=40)\nb=313:1 (from s=40)\nb=391:1 (from s=40)\nb=521:1 (from s=40)\nb=781:1 (from s=40)\nb=1561:1 (from s=40)\n\nSo, the updated counts:\n\nb=7:2\nb=11:2\nb=13:2\nb=15:2\nb=16:2\nb=19:2\nb=21:2\nb=23:2\nb=27:2\nb=29:2\nb=31:3\nb=34:2\nb=35:2\nb=36:3\nb=37:2\nb=38:1\nb=39:3\nb=40:2\nb=43:3\nb=46:1\nb=507:1\nb=51:2\nb=64:1\nb=66:1\nb=67:1\nb=70:1\nb=71:3\nb=75:4\nb=76:1\nb=78:1\nb=79:4\nb=85:3\nb=86:1\nb=88:1\nb=91:1\nb=93:1\nb=101:1\nb=106:3\nb=112:1\nb=115:1\nb=117:1\nb=118:1\nb=121:4\nb=127:2\nb=131:1\nb=139:1\nb=141:2\nb=146:1\nb=149:1\nb=151:1\nb=155:1\nb=157:1\nb=175:1\nb=181:1\nb=187:1\nb=190:1\nb=196:1\nb=201:1\nb=204:1\nb=211:1\nb=223:1\nb=232:1\nb=235:1\nb=239:1\nb=248:1\nb=253:2\nb=261:1\nb=277:1\nb=291:1\nb=301:1\nb=313:1\nb=316:1\nb=326:1\nb=352:1\nb=353:1\nb=375:1\nb=379:1\nb=391:1\nb=407:1\nb=421:2\nb=436:1\nb=445:1\nb=466:1\nb=495:1\nb=507:1\nb=521:1\nb=529:1\nb=553:1\nb=596:1\nb=601:1\nb=631:1\nb=667:1\nb=703:1\nb=704:1\nb=742:1\nb=757:1\nb=781:1\nb=813:1\nb=871:1\nb=931:1\nb=94:1\nb=993:1\nb=1057:1\nb=1123:1\nb=1191:1\nb=1261:1\nb=1333:1\nb=1407:1\nb=1483:1\nb=1561:1\n\nNow, looking for counts >10. The highest count so far is 4 for some bases like b=79, b=121, b=61, etc. Still, none have counts over 10. \n\nSo, I need to process more s's. This is getting tedious, but let's try to find a pattern or a way to compute when the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each base b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are >=s and equal to (b-1).\n\nBut perhaps another approach: For each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s where s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, and s = d1 + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b.\n\nGiven that n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b <= s^2 < b^2.\n\nWhich implies that s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s < b.\n\nBut s must be an integer, so s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nFor each such s, we have n = s^2 = d1*b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b (so 0 <= d0 < b, 1 <= d1 < b).\n\nAdditionally, d1 + d0 = s.\n\nSo, d0 = s - d1.\n\nSubstituting into n = d1*b + (s - d1) = s^2.\n\nSo, d1*b + s - d1 = s^2.\n\nRearranged: d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s.\n\nTherefore, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer within that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of valid s's is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b - 1.\n\nAlternatively, for each base b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 - s) that are equal to (b - 1), for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut perhaps it's better to find for each b, the number of s's that satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that for a given base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d0) such that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n) and n = d1*b + d0.\n\nBut n = (d1 + d0)^2.\n\nSo, (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d0, so s^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBut d0 = s - d1, so substituting:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n=> s^2 = d1*(b - 1) + s\n=> d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSo, same equation as before.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is the number of integers s where:\n\n1. s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]\n2. (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1)\n3. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1.\n\nSo, to find the smallest b where the number of such s's exceeds 10, I need to find when the count for b is >10.\n\nBut since processing each s is time-consuming, perhaps I can find a mathematical relationship or find that for certain bases, the number of s's increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s's for base b is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s) that equal (b -1). So, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s's where (s^2 -s) is a multiple of (b -1), and d1 is in the valid range.\n\nWait, but I'm going in circles.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to note that for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of solutions to d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1), where d1 is integer and 1 <= d1 <= b-1.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1), and (s^2 -s)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (b-1) divides (s^2 -s).\n\nThus, for each b, the count is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (s^2 -s) mod (b-1) == 0.\n\nWhich is equivalent to s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s \u2261 0 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nBecause s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b-1) implies that either s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nBut since s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], let's see what possible s can satisfy s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nCase 1: s \u22610 mod (b-1). Since s < b, the only possibility is s = b-1.\n\nCase 2: s \u22611 mod (b-1). Since s < b, the only possibility is s =1. But s must be >= ceil(sqrt(b)), so unless b <= (1 + sqrt(5))/2 \u22481.618, which isn't possible since b >=2, s=1 is less than ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWait, for b=2, sqrt(2)\u22481.414, so ceil(sqrt(2))=2. So, s=1 is less than 2, but s must be >=2. So, s=1 is not in the range.\n\nSo, for b >=2, s must be >=2, so s=1 is excluded.\n\nThus, the only possible s that satisfies s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1) in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] is s = b -1.\n\nBut wait, let's test this.\n\nTake b=3. Then, s must be in [2,2]. So, s=2.\n\nCheck if 2*1=2 is divisible by b-1=2. Yes, 2/2=1, which is d1=1, which is valid. So, s=2 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for b=4:\n\ns must be in [2,3].\n\nCheck s=2: 2*1=2, which is divisible by 3? No, 2 mod3=2.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 3. So, s=3 is valid.\n\nThus, for b=4, s=3 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for b=5:\n\ns must be in [3,4].\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 4? 6 mod4=2, no.\n\ns=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by4. 12/4=3, which is d1=3. Valid.\n\nSo, for b=5, only s=4 is valid.\n\nWait, but earlier when we processed s=4, we found that it contributes to b=5. So, this seems consistent.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier approach, for b=5, s=4 is the only valid s. But earlier, when I processed s=4, I had:\n\ns=4, m=12, divisors >=4:4,6,12.\n\nk=4: b=5; k=6: b=7; k=12: b=13.\n\nSo, s=4 contributes to b=5,7,13.\n\nWait, but according to this new approach, only s=b-1 is valid, which would be s=4 for b=5.\n\nBut in reality, s=4 can contribute to multiple bases where (b-1) divides 12.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier conclusion is incorrect.\n\nWait, the condition is s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). So, for a given s, any b where (b-1) divides s(s-1) will be valid.\n\nThus, for a given s, multiple b's can be valid, not just s+1.\n\nBut for a given b, the valid s's are those where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nBut since s < b, s can only be 0 or1 mod (b-1). So, s can be 0 or1, but s must be >=2 for b >=3.\n\nWait, for b=3, s=2 is allowed.\n\ns=2: 2 mod2=0, so s=2 is 0 mod (3-1)=2.\n\nSimilarly, for b=4, s=3 is 3 mod3=0.\n\nSo, in general, for each b, the only s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfies s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1) is s = b-1.\n\nBecause s must be less than b, so s can't be more than b-1. Thus, s= b-1 is 0 mod (b-1). The next possible s \u22611 mod (b-1) would be s=1, but s must be >= ceil(sqrt(b)) >=2 for b>=2.\n\nWait, for b=2, s must be >=2, but s=1 is not allowed. So, for b=2, s=2 is the only possible, but s=2: n=4, which is '10'_2, and digits sum to 1, which is not equal to sqrt(4)=2. So, no valid s for b=2.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor b=2, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(2))=2, 1], but 2 >1, so no s exists. Hence, no b-eautiful numbers for b=2.\n\nSimilarly, for b=3:\n\ns must be in [2,2], so s=2.\n\nCheck if 2*1=2 is divisible by 2: yes, so d1=1, which is valid.\n\nThus, n=4=10_3, digits sum 1+0=1, but sqrt(4)=2. So, this is invalid.\n\nWait, this contradicts. Earlier, when s=2, n=4, but 1+0=1 !=2. So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.\n\nWait, this suggests that even though s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), the resulting d1 and d0 may not satisfy d1 + d0 = s.\n\nWait, no, because d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1), and d0 = s -d1.\n\nSo, d1 + d0 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) + s - (s^2 -s)/(b-1) = s.\n\nSo, it must hold. But in the case of b=3, s=2:\n\nd1 = (4 -2)/2=1, d0=2 -1=1.\n\nSo, n=1*3 +1=4.\n\nBut in base 3, 4 is '11'_3, which has digits summing to 2, which is sqrt(4)=2. So, it is valid.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was '10'_3, but 1*3 +1=4, which is '11'_3. So, digits sum to 2, which is correct.\n\nSo, it is valid. So, for b=3, s=2 is valid.\n\nSo, going back, for each b, the only s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfies s \u22610 or1 mod (b-1) is s = b-1.\n\nBecause s must be less than b, so s cannot be 1 mod (b-1) except when s=1, which is less than ceil(sqrt(b)) for b >=2.\n\nThus, for each b >=2, the only s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfies s \u22610 mod (b-1) is s = b-1.\n\nAnd s =1 is not in the range for b >=2.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the only possible s is s = b -1.\n\nBut wait, let's test with b=4:\n\ns must be in [2,3].\n\ns=3: 3 mod3=0.\n\nSo, s=3 is valid.\n\nn=9=3^2=3*4 + 3=15? Wait, no. Wait, n=9 in base4 is 21_4, which is 2*4 +1=9. So, digits sum to 3, which is sqrt(9)=3. So, valid.\n\nBut earlier, when I processed s=3, I saw that it contributes to b=4 and b=7.\n\nWait, this suggests that for s=3, (s^2 -s)=6. So, divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.\n\nk >=3:3,6.\n\nThus, k=3: b=4; k=6: b=7.\n\nSo, s=3 contributes to both b=4 and b=7.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, for each b, the only s is s=b-1. But in this case, s=3 contributes to b=4 and b=7.\n\nThus, my earlier conclusion that only s =b-1 is valid for each b is incorrect.\n\nHence, my approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative approach: For each s, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors k of s(s -1) that are >=s, and then b =k +1.\n\nThus, for each s, it can contribute to multiple bases.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of b's with more than ten s's, we need to find how many times each b appears as k +1, where k is a divisor of s(s-1) >=s.\n\nThus, the count for each b is the number of s's where k =b -1 is a divisor of s(s-1) and k >=s.\n\nHence, the count for each b is equal to the number of s's where (b -1) divides s(s-1) and s <= b -1.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\nBut since (b -1) divides s(s -1), and s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) must divide either s or s-1.\n\nBecause s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor of s(s-1) must divide s or s-1.\n\nThus, (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) must divide s-1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that either:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod (b -1), which implies s = b -1 (since s < b)\n2. s \u22611 mod (b -1), which implies s =1 (but s >=2 for b >=2, so s=1 is invalid unless b=2, which has no s)\n\nWait, but s must be >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nThus, for each b, the only possible s that satisfies s \u22610 mod (b-1) is s =b -1, provided that b -1 >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSimilarly, s=1 is not in the range for b >=2.\n\nThus, for each b, the only possible s is s =b -1, provided that s >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWhich implies that b -1 >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWhich is true for b >=3, since for b=3: 2 >=2; b=4:3 >=2; etc.\n\nThus, for each b >=3, there is exactly one s, which is s =b -1, that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut wait, earlier examples contradict this. For example, when b=7:\n\ns=6: n=36=6^2.\n\nIn base7, 36 is 51_7, digits sum to 6, which is sqrt(36)=6. So, valid.\n\nBut when s=3, n=9=3^2, which in base7 is 12_7, digits sum to3, which is sqrt(9)=3. So, valid.\n\nThus, for b=7, both s=6 and s=3 are valid.\n\nSo, my earlier conclusion is incorrect. There can be multiple s's for a single b.\n\nTherefore, the earlier approach that for each s, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors k of s(s -1) that are >=s, and b=k +1, is correct.\n\nThus, for each s, multiple b's can be valid, and for each b, multiple s's can contribute.\n\nHence, the count for each b is the number of s's where k =b -1 is a divisor of s(s -1), and s <= b -1.\n\nBut since s <= b -1, and k =b -1, s must be <=k.\n\nBut since k divides s(s -1), and s <=k, then k divides s(s -1), and s <=k.\n\nGiven that s and s -1 are coprime, k must be a product of factors of s and s -1.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s) that are equal to (b -1), for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can think about when a base b has multiple s's.\n\nEach time a base b is a divisor of s(s -1) +1, for some s, it gets a count. So, the more s's that have (b -1) as a divisor of s(s -1), the higher the count for b.\n\nThus, to maximize the count for a base b, we need many s's such that (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\nWhich happens when (b -1) has many small factors, allowing multiple s's.\n\nThus, bases where (b -1) is a highly composite number will have more s's contributing to them.\n\nTherefore, to find the smallest b with count >10, we need (b -1) to have many small divisors, so that multiple s's satisfy (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\nThus, the minimal such b would be when (b -1) is a number with many divisors, such as 12, 24, 36, 60, etc.\n\nLooking back at our earlier counts, for b=31, the count was 3; for b=43, count was 3; for b=79, count was4; for b=121, count was4; for b=61, count was4.\n\nBut none exceeded 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go higher.

Perhaps I can find a pattern or mathematical shortcut.\n\nNotice that for each s, the number of bases it contributes to is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are >=s. Each such divisor k leads to a base b=k+1.\n\nThus, to have a base b with more than ten s's, (b-1) must have more than ten divisors of the form s(s-1), where s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nBut since s(s-1) is equal to (b-1)*d1, where d1 is a digit in base b, and d1 ranges from1 to b-1, for each s, (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s-1).\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that equal (b-1), for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this is equivalent to (b-1) divides s(s-1), and s <=b-1.\n\nGiven that s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1)=a*b, where a divides s and b divides s-1, for some s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this is still abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s's for a base b is equal to the number of pairs (a, b') where a*b' = (b-1), a divides s, b' divides s-1, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to b-1 - ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or1 mod (b-1).\n\nBut as earlier, only s=b-1 satisfies s \u22610 mod (b-1), and s=1 is less than ceil(sqrt(b)) for b >=2.\n\nThus, for each b, only s=b-1 is valid.\n\nBut earlier examples contradict this, as for b=7, s=3 and s=6 are valid.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for a base b, the number of s's is equal to the number of ways (b-1) can be expressed as a product of two integers a and b' where a <= s and b' <= s-1, for some s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps the only way to proceed is to continue processing s's until a base with count >10 is found.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I can note that the minimal b where (b-1) has at least 11 divisors, each corresponding to an s.\n\nBut (b-1) must have at least 11 divisors in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut the number of divisors of (b-1) increases as (b-1) becomes more composite.\n\nThe smallest number with at least 11 divisors is 60, which has 12 divisors.\n\nSo, if b-1=60, then b=61.\n\nCheck if b=61 has more than 10 s's.\n\nBut earlier, for s=30, m=30*29=870, which has divisors >=30:30,58, etc., leading to b=31, etc.\n\nBut for b=61, how many s's contribute?\n\nEach s where (s^2 -s) is divisible by60.\n\nSo, s(s -1) \u22610 mod60.\n\nWhich implies that s \u22610 or1 mod factors of60.\n\nBut since 60=2^2 *3 *5, s must be \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nThus, s must satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(61))=8,60] that satisfy these congruences.\n\nThe number of such s's is equal to the number of s in [8,60] where s \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nThis is a classic inclusion problem.\n\nThe total number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [8,60] such that s \u22610 or1 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60.\n\nWait, no, because the conditions are s \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nThis is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since 4,3,5 are coprime in pairs, the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies.\n\nEach combination of residues mod4, mod3, mod5 gives a unique residue mod60.\n\nEach s must satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, there are 2^3=8 possible combinations.\n\nEach combination corresponds to a unique residue mod60.\n\nThus, in the range [8,60], how many s satisfy each combination.\n\nFor each combination, the number of s is floor((60 - a)/60) +1, where a is the smallest s >=8 satisfying the combination.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions s in [8,60] is equal to the number of integers in this range congruent to any of the 8 possible residues mod60.\n\nSince 60 is the modulus, in each block of 60 numbers, there are 8 solutions.\n\nIn our case, the range is 8 to60, which is 53 numbers.\n\nNumber of complete blocks: 0, since 60 is the upper limit.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of residues in [8,60].\n\nEach residue occurs once every 60 numbers.\n\nThus, for each residue r in the 8 solutions, if r >=8 and <=60, it counts.\n\nBut since 60 is included, and r can be up to 59.\n\nThus, each of the 8 residues will have at least one solution in [8,60].\n\nBut some residues may be less than8, so we need to adjust.\n\nWait, but the residues are from0 to59.\n\nThus, the number of s's is equal to8, but some may be less than8.\n\nThus, subtract the number of residues less than8.\n\nEach residue r is between0 and59.\n\nSo, the number of residues >=8 is8 minus the number of residues <8.\n\nBut since each residue is unique mod60, and we have8 residues, it's possible that some are less than8.\n\nBut without knowing the exact residues, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s's is8.\n\nThus, for b=61, the count is8.\n\nBut earlier, for b=61, the count was already6 from s=30, s=45, s=50.\n\nBut perhaps more s's contribute.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nThe number of s's for b=61 is equal to the number of s in [8,60] where s(s-1) is divisible by60.\n\nWhich is equivalent to s \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nThus, s must be \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, s can be written as:\n\ns \u2261 a mod4, where a=0 or1,\n\ns \u2261 b mod3, where b=0 or1,\n\ns \u2261 c mod5, where c=0 or1.\n\nThus, each combination (a,b,c) gives a unique solution mod60.\n\nThere are8 combinations.\n\nEach combination corresponds to a unique residue mod60.\n\nThus, in the range [8,60], how many s satisfy each combination.\n\nFor each combination, the smallest s >=8 is:\n\nFor example:\n\nCase1: a=0,b=0,c=0: s\u22610 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5 => s\u22610 mod60.\n\nThus, s=60 is in [8,60].\n\nCase2: a=0,b=0,c=1: s\u22610 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod12, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=12k. 12k \u22611 mod5 => 12k mod5=2k \u22611 mod5 =>k\u22613 mod5.\n\nThus, s=12*3=36, which is in [8,60].\n\nCase3: a=0,b=1,c=0: s\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet s=20k (since 4 and5 are factors). 20k \u22611 mod3 =>20k mod3=2k \u22611 mod3 =>k\u22612 mod3.\n\nThus, s=20*2=40.\n\nCase4: a=0,b=1,c=1: s\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns=4k,\n\n4k \u22611 mod3 =>k\u22611 mod3,\n\n4k \u22611 mod5 =>4k\u22611 =>k\u22614^{-1} mod5 =>k\u22614 mod5.\n\nThus, k\u22611 mod3 and k\u22614 mod5.\n\nFind k:\n\nk=4 mod5,\n\nk=1 mod3.\n\nPossible k: 4, 14, 24, 34, 44.\n\nCheck k=4: 4*4=16 <8? No, s=16 is >=8.\n\nWait, s=4k, so k=4: s=16.\n\nThus, s=16 is a solution.\n\nCase5: a=1,b=0,c=0: s\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns=1 mod4,\n\ns=0 mod3,\n\ns=0 mod5.\n\nThus, s=15 mod60?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if when you write it in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nLet me try to break this down. First, let me understand what a two-digit number in base b looks like. In base 10, a two-digit number is something like 10a + b, where a is the tens digit and b is the units digit. Similarly, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like a * b + c, where a is the digit in the b's place and c is the digit in the units place.\n\nSo, for a number n to be b-eautiful, n must be expressible as a two-digit number in base b, which is a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a must be between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of the two digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. But n is also equal to a * b + c. So, putting that together, sqrt(a * b + c) = a + c.\n\nWait, that seems a bit tricky. Let me write that equation out:\n\nsqrt(n) = a + c\nn = (a + c)^2\nBut n is also a * b + c, so:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of a and c, but both a and c are digits in base b, so they have constraints. Let me try to rearrange this equation.\n\nLet me subtract a * b + c from both sides:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a * b - c = 0\n\nExpanding (a + c)^2:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)a + c^2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in a. Maybe I can solve for a in terms of c and b.\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, a = [-(2c - b) \u00b1 sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c^2 - c))]/2\n\nLet me compute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c)\n= 4c^2 -4bc + b^2 -4c^2 +4c\n= (-4bc + b^2) +4c\n= b^2 -4bc +4c\n\nSo, D = b^2 -4bc +4c\n\nHmm, for a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square, and the resulting a must be a positive integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, maybe I can find another way.\n\nWait, let's go back. We have:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n(a + c)^2 - c = a * b\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a, because the right side is a * b.\n\nAlternatively, (a + c)^2 - c = a * b.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\n= a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b\n\nWhich brings me back to the same quadratic. Maybe I can instead express b in terms of a and c.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nSince b has to be an integer, this expression must evaluate to an integer. So, [ (a + c)^2 - c ] must be divisible by a.\n\nLet me compute (a + c)^2 - c:\n\n= a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\n\nSo, [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a = [a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)] / a\n\n= a + 2c + [c(c -1)] / a\n\nSo, for this to be an integer, [c(c -1)] must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of c(c -1). But since a is at least 1 and at most b-1, which is larger, but c is between 0 and b-1.\n\nWait, c can be 0? Let me check. In base b, the digits can be 0 in the units place, but the first digit a can't be 0 because it's a two-digit number.\n\nSo, c can be 0, but if c is 0, then the expression becomes [a + 0]^2 = a*b + 0 \u2192 a^2 = a*b \u2192 a = b. But a is a digit in base b, so a must be less than b. Therefore, a can't be equal to b. So, if c is 0, then a^2 = a*b \u2192 a = b, which is impossible. So c cannot be 0? Wait, but wait, if c is 0, then n = a*b + 0 = a*b, and sqrt(n) = a + 0 = a, so sqrt(a*b) = a \u2192 a*b = a^2 \u2192 b = a, which is impossible because a < b. Therefore, c cannot be zero. So c must be at least 1.\n\nSo, c is between 1 and b-1.\n\nSo, back to a being a divisor of c(c -1). Since a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 1 and b-1, perhaps I can find a in terms of c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can fix c and find possible a's.\n\nLet me try to think about small values of c.\n\nCase 1: c =1.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(a +1)^2 = a*b +1\n\nExpanding:\n\na^2 + 2a +1 = a*b +1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\na^2 + 2a = a*b\n\nDivide both sides by a (since a \u22600):\n\na + 2 = b\n\nSo, b = a + 2\n\nBut since a is a digit in base b, a must be less than b. Since b = a + 2, a can be from 1 to b-1, but b is a +2, so a can be from 1 to (a+2)-1 = a+1. Which is always true for a \u22651.\n\nSo, for c=1, b = a +2, and a can be any integer from 1 to b-2.\n\nBut since a must be at least 1, and b must be at least a+2.\n\nBut wait, for each a, there's a corresponding b, but I think in this problem, for a given base b, we need to find all possible a and c such that the condition holds.\n\nWait, no, the problem is, for a given b, how many n's are b-eautiful. So for each b, we need to find all pairs (a,c) with 1 \u2264a \u2264b-1 and 0 \u2264c \u2264b-1, but as we saw, c can't be 0, so c is from 1 to b-1, such that (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.\n\nSo, for each b, we can iterate through possible a and c to find how many such pairs exist.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b is time-consuming. Maybe we can find a formula or a way to parameterize.\n\nLet me try to find the equation again:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a b + c\n\nRearranging:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a b\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\na^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in a. So, for each c, this equation must have integer solutions a.\n\nThe discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant D is:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4 *1*(c^2 - c)\n= 4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c\n= b^2 -4b c +4c\n\nSo, D must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me denote D = k^2, so:\n\nb^2 -4b c +4c = k^2\n\nHmm, this is a Diophantine equation in terms of b and c, with k being some integer.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can manipulate it.\n\nLet me try to rearrange:\n\nb^2 -4b c +4c = k^2\n\nLet me factor:\n\nb^2 -4b c +4c = k^2\n= b^2 -4c b +4c = k^2\n\nHmm, perhaps completing the square in terms of b.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nb^2 -4c b = k^2 -4c\n\nNow, the left side can be written as:\n\nb^2 -4c b + (2c)^2 - (2c)^2 = (b - 2c)^2 - 4c^2\n\nSo,\n\n(b - 2c)^2 -4c^2 = k^2 -4c\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n(b - 2c)^2 - k^2 = 4c^2 -4c\n\nWhich can be factored as:\n\n[(b - 2c) -k][(b - 2c) +k] = 4c(c -1)\n\nSo, the product of two integers equals 4c(c -1). Let me denote:\n\nLet me set:\n\nM = (b - 2c) -k\nN = (b - 2c) +k\n\nSo, M * N = 4c(c -1)\n\nAlso, since M + N = 2(b - 2c), which must be even, so M and N must be both even or both odd. But since their product is 4c(c-1), which is divisible by 4, both M and N must be even.\n\nSo, let me set M = 2m and N = 2n, so:\n\n(2m)(2n) = 4c(c -1)\n=> 4mn =4c(c -1)\n=> mn = c(c -1)\n\nAlso, from M and N:\n\nM = 2m = (b -2c) -k\nN = 2n = (b -2c) +k\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2m + 2n = 2(b -2c)\n=> m +n = b -2c\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n2n -2m = 2k\n=> n -m =k\n\nSo, we have:\n\nm +n = b -2c\n\nn -m =k\n\nAnd mn = c(c -1)\n\nSo, we have a system where m and n are positive integers (since M and N are positive? Wait, not necessarily, because b could be less than 2c, but let's see.\n\nWait, b is the base, so it's at least 2, and c is between 1 and b-1.\n\nSo, 2c can be up to 2(b-1). So, if 2c > b, then b -2c is negative.\n\nBut in that case, M = (b -2c) -k could be negative, which might complicate things.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nWe have mn = c(c-1). So, m and n are positive integers (assuming c(c-1) is positive, which it is for c \u22652, but for c=1, c(c-1)=0, which would make mn=0, which would mean either m or n is zero, but then from m +n = b -2c, if c=1, then m +n = b -2, which is at least 2 -2=0 (if b=2). So, possible, but maybe let's consider c=1 separately.\n\nWait, when c=1, mn=0, so either m=0 or n=0. Let's see:\n\nIf m=0, then from m +n = b -2c, n = b -2c.\n\nBut n is also equal to (from N = 2n = (b-2c) +k) but since m=0, N=2n = (b -2c) +k.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since mn = c(c -1), which is a product of two consecutive integers, which is c^2 -c. So, m and n are factors of c(c-1).\n\nSo, m and n are positive integers such that m *n = c(c-1). So, possible pairs (m,n) are the factor pairs of c(c-1).\n\nEach such pair (m,n) gives us:\n\nm +n = b -2c\nn -m =k\n\nSo, for each factor pair (m,n) of c(c-1), we can compute b = m +n +2c.\n\nBut since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and c is between 1 and b-1.\n\nWait, but c is between 1 and b-1, so for each c, we can find possible factor pairs (m,n) of c(c-1), compute b as m +n +2c, and check whether c < b.\n\nBut this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe I can find for each c, the possible values of m and n, compute b, and then count the number of valid (a,c) pairs for each b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of c and m.\n\nWait, from the quadratic equation, once we have m and n, and hence b, we can find a.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to find a different approach.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a b + c\n\nLet me consider that (a + c)^2 must be greater than or equal to a^2, since c is at least 1.\n\nBut a b + c is equal to a*(b) + c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a b + c\n=> (a + c)^2 - c = a b\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 - c must be divisible by a.\n\nLet me denote s = a + c. Then:\n\ns^2 - c = a b\n\nBut s = a + c \u2192 c = s -a\n\nSubstituting:\n\ns^2 - (s -a) = a b\ns^2 -s +a = a b\n\nSo,\n\na b = s^2 -s +a\n=> a(b -1) = s^2 -s\n\nSo,\n\na = (s^2 -s)/(b -1)\n\nSince a must be an integer, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\nSo, (b -1) divides (s^2 -s) = s(s -1).\n\nThus, b -1 is a divisor of s(s-1). So, for each possible s, b can be written as:\n\nb = (s(s -1)/k) +1, where k is a positive divisor of s(s -1).\n\nBut s is equal to a + c, and a and c are digits in base b, so a is at least 1, and c is at least 1, so s is at least 2.\n\nAlso, since a < b and c < b, s = a + c < b + b = 2b.\n\nBut b is at least 2, so s is at least 2 and less than 2b.\n\nWait, but s is a + c, which is between 2 and 2b -2.\n\nWait, this seems a bit too broad. Maybe I can consider possible values of s and k.\n\nLet me think: For each s starting from 2 upwards, find all possible divisors k of s(s -1), then set b = (s(s -1)/k) +1, and then check whether a = (s^2 -s)/ (b -1) = (s(s -1))/k is an integer between 1 and b -1, and c = s - a is between 1 and b -1.\n\nBut this might be a feasible approach.\n\nSo, for each s starting from 2:\n\n1. Compute s(s -1).\n\n2. Find all positive divisors k of s(s -1).\n\n3. For each divisor k, compute b = (s(s -1)/k) +1.\n\n4. Compute a = s(s -1)/k.\n\n5. Check if a is between 1 and b -1.\n\n6. Compute c = s -a.\n\n7. Check if c is between 1 and b -1.\n\nIf all conditions are satisfied, then (a,c) is a valid pair for base b, contributing to the count of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSo, the number of valid (a,c) pairs for each b is the number of s and k that satisfy these conditions.\n\nThis seems systematic. So, perhaps I can iterate over s, compute the possible k, find b, and then count the number of valid pairs per b.\n\nBut since I'm trying to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10, maybe I can compute for each b, the number of solutions, and find the smallest b where the count is more than 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to find, for each s, how many b's can be formed, and for each such b, increment the count.\n\nBut this might be more efficient.\n\nWait, let me think of s as starting from 2 upwards, and for each s, for each k divisor of s(s-1), compute b and a, and then check if a and c are valid digits in base b.\n\nIf yes, then b has a solution, so we can count that as one b-eautiful number for that base.\n\nWait, but for each s, each divisor k will give a different b, and for each such b, we can have a solution. So, for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1). But not all of them will satisfy the condition that a and c are valid digits.\n\nWait, but for each s, each divisor k of s(s-1) gives a different b, and for each such b, we can have a solution (a,c). So, each s can potentially contribute multiple b's with a count of 1 each.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can instead find for each b, how many (a,c) pairs satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find that for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1), but each such b would have exactly one solution (a,c).\n\nWait, but actually, for each s, each divisor k gives a unique b, and for each such b, you get exactly one (a,c) pair. So, each s can contribute multiple b's, each with one count.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1). But not all of them would satisfy a < b and c < b.\n\nBut perhaps this can help me find for each b, how many s's contribute to it.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this differently. For each s, each of its divisors k gives a possible b. So, for each s, I can compute all possible b's, and for each such b, note that it has one more b-eautiful number.\n\nThus, I can iterate s from 2 upwards, compute all possible b's from s, and for each b, keep a count of how many times it appears. Then, once I find a b where the count exceeds 10, I can return that as the answer.\n\nThis seems manageable, but it's a bit of work.\n\nLet me start with small s.\n\ns=2:\n\ns(s-1) = 2*1=2.

Let's check how many solutions each b has now.\n\nLooking back, before s=36, the counts were:\n\nb=7:4\n\nb=13:4\n\nb=16:4\n\nb=19:2\n\nb=21:2\n\nb=22:2\n\nb=23:2\n\nb=25:2\n\nb=29:2\n\nb=31:2\n\nb=33:1\n\nAfter s=36:\n\nb=36:1\n\nb=31:3\n\nb=29:3\n\nb=22:3\n\nb=21:3\n\nb=19:3\n\nSo, now b=21,22,29,31 have 3 each.\n\nBut the problem asks for the least b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10. So, we need to find the smallest b with count >10.\n\nBut so far, the maximum count is 4 for b=7, and some others have 3.\n\nWe need to find when a base has more than 10 solutions. So, perhaps I need to go further.\n\nBut this is getting really time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, for each s, we're adding 1 to certain b's. The number of times a b is incremented depends on the number of factor pairs (k, s(s-1)/k) such that a and c are valid.\n\nBut to get a count over 10, the b must be involved in many such factor pairs. So, perhaps b=48?\n\nWait, but I don't know. Maybe I can think of when s is such that s(s-1) has a lot of divisors. For example, s=48, s(s-1)=48*47=2256. But the number of divisors depends on the prime factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 48, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 24, but in our earlier counts, b=24 only had 1.\n\nWait, perhaps b=60.\n\nBut this approach is too tedious. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nLooking back, the equation is:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n(a + c)^2 - c = a*b\n\nWhich is:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (a,c) where 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, and (a + c)^2 - c is divisible by a, and the quotient is b.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (a,c) such that (a + c)^2 \u2261 c mod a.\n\nBut this is equivalent to:\n\n(a + c)^2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nc^2 + 2ac + a^2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nBut mod a, a^2 \u22610, 2ac \u22610, so:\n\nc^2 \u2261 c mod a\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nc^2 - c \u22610 mod a\n\nSo,\n\nc(c -1) \u22610 mod a\n\nWhich means that a divides c(c -1).\n\nSince a and c are digits in base b, which is at least 2, and a <b, c <b.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of pairs (a,c) with 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, such that a divides c(c-1).\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (a,c) where a divides c(c-1), with a <b and c <b.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each b, count the number of pairs (a,c) where 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, and a divides c(c-1).\n\nWe need to find the smallest b such that this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nSo, for each b, compute the number of (a,c) pairs where a divides c(c-1), a <b, c <b.\n\nLet me try to compute this for small b:\n\nb=2:\n\na can be 1.\n\nc can be 1.\n\nCheck if 1 divides 1*0=0. Yes.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nb=3:\n\na can be 1,2.\n\nc can be 1,2.\n\nFor a=1:\n\nc=1: 1 divides 1*0=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nc=2: 1 divides 2*1=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor a=2:\n\nc=1: 2 divides 1*0=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nc=2: 2 divides 2*1=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, total count=4.\n\nWait, but earlier, for b=3, we had two solutions. Hmm, seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, in the original problem, n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b +c, and sqrt(n) = a +c.\n\nSo, n must be a perfect square, as sqrt(n) is integer.\n\nBut in my earlier approach, I was counting all (a,c) where a divides c(c-1), but not necessarily that n is a perfect square.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n\nn is b-eautiful if:\n\n1. n has exactly two digits in base b: so n = a*b + c, with 1 \u2264a <b, 0 \u2264c <b.\n\n2. The sum of the two digits, a + c, equals sqrt(n).\n\nSo, sqrt(n) must be integer, so n must be a perfect square.\n\nThus, n = (a + c)^2.\n\nBut also, n = a*b +c.\n\nThus, (a + c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nWhich is the equation we started with.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of pairs (a,c) with 1 \u2264a <b, 0 \u2264c <b, such that (a + c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nBut in my previous approach, I considered c starting from 1, but c can be 0 as well. Wait, but when c=0, then n = a*b, and sqrt(n) = a + 0 = a.\n\nThus, n must be a^2, so a*b = a^2 \u2192 b =a, which is impossible since a <b. So, c cannot be 0. So, c must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of pairs (a,c) with 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, such that (a + c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n(a + c)^2 -c = a*b.\n\nSo, b = [(a + c)^2 -c]/a.\n\nWhich must be integer.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (a,c) where 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, and a divides (a + c)^2 -c.\n\nThis is a stricter condition than just a dividing c(c-1). So, my previous approach was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should compute for each b, the number of pairs (a,c) where 1 \u2264a <b, 1 \u2264c <b, and a divides (a + c)^2 -c.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the equation:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nLet me denote s = a + c, so s must be at least 2 (since a and c are at least 1) and at most 2b -2 (since a <b and c <b).\n\nThen, s^2 = a*b + c.\n\nBut c = s -a.\n\nSo, s^2 = a*b + (s -a)\n\n=> s^2 = a*b +s -a\n\n=> s^2 -s = a*(b -1)\n\nSo, a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1)\n\nSince a must be integer, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\nAlso, since a <b, (s^2 -s)/(b -1) <b.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s such that:\n\n2 \u2264s \u22642b -2,\n\n(b -1) divides (s^2 -s),\n\nand a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) is integer with 1 \u2264a <b.\n\nThus, for each b, we can iterate s from 2 to 2b-2, check if (b-1) divides (s^2 -s), and if so, check if a is within range.\n\nThis seems more systematic.\n\nSo, the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of integers s in [2, 2b -2] such that (b -1) divides (s^2 -s), and a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) is in [1, b -1).\n\nThus, let's compute for each b starting from 2, the number of such s.\n\nLet me try b=2:\n\ns ranges from 2 to 2*2-2=2.\n\ns=2:\n\nCheck if (2-1)=1 divides 2^2 -2=4-2=2. Yes.\n\na=(4-2)/1=2.\n\nBut a must be <2. So, a=2 is invalid.\n\nThus, count=0.\n\nBut earlier, for b=2, we thought c=1, a=1, but that would require n=1*2 +1=3, sqrt(3) is not integer. Wait, but in the problem statement, n must be a perfect square.\n\nWait, for b=2, let's see:\n\nn must be two-digit in base 2, so n is between 2 and 3 (since in base 2, two-digit numbers are 10_2=2 and 11_2=3).\n\nCheck if any of these are perfect squares.\n\n2 is not a perfect square.\n\n3 is not a perfect square.\n\nThus, b=2 has zero solutions.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought for s=2, a=2, c=0, but c can't be zero. So, correct count is zero.\n\nSimilarly, for b=3:\n\ns ranges from 2 to 4.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=2:\n\nCheck if 2 divides 4 -2=2. Yes.\n\na=(4-2)/2=1.\n\na=1 <3 \u2192 yes.\n\nc=s -a=2 -1=1 <3 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, valid. So, one solution.\n\ns=3:\n\nCheck if 2 divides 9 -3=6. Yes.\n\na=6/2=3. But a must be <3. So, invalid.\n\ns=4:\n\nCheck if 2 divides 16 -4=12. Yes.\n\na=12/2=6. a=6 <3? No. Invalid.\n\nThus, only s=2 gives a valid solution. So, count=1.\n\nBut earlier, for b=3, I thought there were two solutions, but that was incorrect because when c=0, which is invalid. So, correct count is 1.\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nFor b=3, two-digit numbers are 10_3=3, 11_3=4, 12_3=5.\n\nCheck which are perfect squares:\n\n3: no\n\n4: yes, sqrt(4)=2. Digits are 1 and 1, sum=2. So, yes. So, n=4 is 11_3, a=1, c=1, sum=2.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nThus, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for b=4:\n\ns ranges from 2 to 6.\n\ns=2:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 4-2=2. 2/3 not integer. So, no.\n\ns=3:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 9-3=6. Yes.\n\na=6/3=2 <4 \u2192 yes.\n\nc=3-2=1 <4 \u2192 yes.\n\nValid. So, count=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 16-4=12. Yes.\n\na=12/3=4. a=4 <4? No. Invalid.\n\ns=5:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 25-5=20. 20/3 not integer. No.\n\ns=6:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 36-6=30. Yes.\n\na=30/3=10 <4? No.\n\nThus, only s=3 gives a solution. So, count=1.\n\nBut earlier, for b=4, I thought there were two solutions. Let me check.\n\nIn base 4, two-digit numbers are 10_4=4, 11_4=5, 12_4=6, 13_4=7.\n\nCheck which are perfect squares:\n\n4: yes, sqrt(4)=2. Digits sum 1+3=4\u22602. Wait, no.\n\nWait, 4 in base 4 is 10_4, digits 1 and 0. Sum is 1, which is sqrt(4)=2. Not equal. So, invalid.\n\n5: not a square.\n\n6: not a square.\n\n7: not a square.\n\nSo, actually, no solutions for b=4. Wait, but earlier in the s=4 case, I thought s=4 gave a=4, but that was invalid. So, perhaps the count is zero.\n\nWait, let me recast.\n\nWait, for b=4:\n\nn must be a two-digit number in base 4, so n= a*4 +c, 1 \u2264a <4, 0 \u2264c <4.\n\nAlso, sqrt(n)=a +c must be integer.\n\nSo, n must be a perfect square.\n\nPossible n: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nCheck which are perfect squares:\n\n4: yes, sqrt(4)=2.\n\nDigits: a=1, c=0. Sum=1+0=1\u22602. So, invalid.\n\n9: yes, sqrt(9)=3.\n\nn=9 in base 4 is 21_4, since 2*4 +1=9.\n\nDigits sum 2+1=3. So, yes. So, n=9 is 21_4, a=2, c=1. Sum=3.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nThus, for b=4, there is one solution.\n\nWait, but according to the s approach:\n\ns = a +c.\n\nFor n=9, a=2, c=1. So, s=3.\n\nCheck if (s^2 -s) is divisible by b-1=3.\n\ns=3: 9-3=6, 6/3=2=a. So, valid. Thus, count=1.\n\nSo, the count is 1, not zero.\n\nThus, my earlier approach was correct, but the manual checking was wrong.\n\nThus, for b=4, count=1.\n\nSo, now, let's try to compute counts for b=2 to, say, b=24, to see when the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut this is time-consuming, but let's proceed.\n\nb=2:\n\ns=2:\n\nCheck if 1 divides 4-2=2.

According to the problem, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nThe example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, a two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c.\n\nBut since n is a two-digit number in base b, it's equal to a*b + c, so sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let's collect like terms:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b\n\nSo, a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\n\nThen, solving for b:\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, a must divide (c^2 - c).\n\nAlternatively, (c^2 - c) mod a should be zero.\n\nHmm, that's an important point. So, for given a and c, a must divide (c^2 - c). So, perhaps I can write this as:\n\nc(c - 1) must be divisible by a.\n\nWhich is another way of saying that a divides c(c - 1).\n\nBut a is a digit in base b, so a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.\n\nWait, but since n is a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate over possible a and c, compute whether a divides c(c - 1), and then compute b using the formula above, check if it's an integer, and then check if it's equal to the base we're considering.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables a and c, and for each a and c, compute b, and then count how many such b's would allow this to happen, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b (10_b) and b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1).\n\nSo, n is in [b, b^2 -1].\n\nAlso, sqrt(n) is equal to a + c, so sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, n is a perfect square, say k^2, where k is an integer. Then, the condition becomes:\n\nk = a + c\n\nand\n\nk^2 = a*b + c\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. k = a + c\n2. k^2 = a*b + c\n\nFrom equation 1, c = k - a.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\nk^2 = a*b + (k - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk^2 = a*b + k - a\n\nRearranging:\n\na*b = k^2 - k + a\n\nThen,\n\na*b = a + k^2 - k\n\nFactor a on the left:\n\na*(b) = a + k^2 - k\n\nSubtract a from both sides:\n\na*(b - 1) = k^2 - k\n\nSo,\n\na = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, for given k and b, a is determined by this equation.\n\nBut a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b -1) divides (k^2 - k).\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express this as:\n\nb - 1 = (k^2 - k)/a\n\nSince a must be a positive integer, and b must be an integer greater than 1 (since b >=2), then (k^2 - k) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, for each possible k, and for each possible a that divides (k^2 - k), we can compute b as:\n\nb = 1 + (k^2 - k)/a\n\nBut then, since b must be at least greater than the maximum digit in n's base-b representation. Since n is two digits in base b, the maximum digit is b-1. So, in the digits a and c, a must be less than b, and c must be less than b.\n\nFrom equation 1, c = k - a. So, c must be >=0, which gives k - a >= 0 => a <=k.\n\nAnd since a is at least 1, so a ranges from 1 to min(k, b-1). But since b is 1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a must be <= k.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: for each k, and each a that divides (k^2 -k), compute b as (k^2 -k)/a +1, and then check if a is <= b-1 and c =k -a is <=b-1.\n\nBecause a must be a digit in base b, so a <= b-1, and c must be <=b-1.\n\nSo, for each k, I can iterate over possible a's that divide (k^2 -k), compute b, and then check if a <=b-1 and c =k -a <=b-1.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, then n =k^2 is a b-eautiful number for that b.\n\nSo, for each k, I can find possible b's where k^2 is b-eautiful.\n\nBut since the problem is to find the smallest b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I need to find for each b, the number of k's such that there exists a and c where k =a +c, n=k^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, count how many k's satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more efficient to think in terms of k. For each k, how many b's can it contribute to.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: For each k, find all possible a's that divide (k^2 -k), and then compute b for each a, and then check if a <= b-1 and c =k -a <=b-1.\n\nEach such valid b would have a corresponding n =k^2 which is b-eautiful.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of valid b's is the number of a's that divide (k^2 -k) and satisfy a <= k, and when b is computed, a <=b-1 and c <=b-1.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to iterate over possible k's and find all possible b's that can be formed from them.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, since b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a divides (k^2 -k), then a is a divisor of k^2 -k.\n\nSo, for each k, the possible a's are the positive divisors of (k^2 -k).\n\nBut since a must be <=k (because c =k -a >=0 implies a <=k), and a must be >=1.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of divisors of (k^2 -k) that are <=k.\n\nEach such a will give a corresponding b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nThen, for each such b, n =k^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each k, each valid a gives a b, and each such b will have at least one b-eautiful number (n=k^2).\n\nBut the problem is to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers is more than ten.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as, for each b, count how many k's are such that there exists a and c as per the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate over k, compute all possible b's that can be formed from each k, and for each b, keep a count of how many k's contribute to it.\n\nOnce a b's count exceeds ten, I can note the smallest such b.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each k starting from 1 upwards:\n   a. Compute m =k^2 -k\n   b. Find all divisors a of m where 1 <=a <=k\n   c. For each such a:\n      i. Compute b =1 + m/a\n      ii. Check if a <=b-1 and c =k -a <=b-1\n      iii. If both conditions are satisfied, increment the count for this b\n2. After processing each k, check if any b has a count >10. If so, return the smallest such b.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of k and a.\n\nGiven that:\n\nb = 1 + (k^2 -k)/a\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nb = (k^2 -k +a)/a = (k(k-1) +a)/a = k(k-1)/a +1\n\nSo, b = 1 + k(k-1)/a\n\nSince a divides k(k-1), let's denote d =a. Then, d is a divisor of k(k-1).\n\nSo, for each k, d can be any divisor of k(k-1) where d <=k.\n\nEach such d will give a b =1 + (k(k-1))/d.\n\nThen, for each such b, we need to ensure that:\n\na =d <=b-1\n\nand\n\nc =k -d <=b-1.\n\nSince a =d, which is <=k, and b is 1 + (k(k-1))/d, which is at least 1 + (k(k-1))/k =1 + (k-1) =k.\n\nSo, b >=k.\n\nTherefore, a =d <=k <=b-1? Wait, because b >=k, so b-1 >=k-1.\n\nBut a =d, which is <=k.\n\nSo, if b >=k, then b-1 >=k-1, but a =d could be up to k.\n\nSo, a =d could be equal to k, which would require that k <=b-1.\n\nWhich would mean that b >=k+1.\n\nBut since b =1 + (k(k-1))/d, and d divides k(k-1), when d=k, then:\n\nb =1 + (k(k-1))/k =1 + (k-1) =k.\n\nSo, b=k in this case.\n\nBut then, a =k, and c =k -a =0.\n\nSo, c=0, which is allowed.\n\nBut then, b=k, and a=k, which would require that a <=b-1, which is k <=k-1, which is not possible.\n\nSo, when d=k, the condition a <=b-1 is violated because a=k and b=k, so b-1=k-1 <k.\n\nTherefore, d=k is not allowed.\n\nSo, d must be less than or equal to k-1.\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nIf d=k, then b=1 + (k(k-1))/k =1 + (k-1) =k.\n\nSo, a=k, which is equal to b, but a must be less than b because in base b, digits go up to b-1. So, a can't be equal to b.\n\nTherefore, d must be <=k-1.\n\nSo, for each k, d is a divisor of k(k-1) where 1 <=d <=k-1.\n\nSo, for each k, the possible d's are the divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nEach such d gives a b=1 + (k(k-1))/d.\n\nThen, for each such b, the number of k's that can contribute to it is the number of d's that generate that b.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of valid d's (divisors of k(k-1) <=k-1), and each such b can be counted as having one more b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to iterate k from 2 upwards (since for k=1, n=1, which is a single-digit number in base 2, so it's not two-digit), and for each k, compute all possible b's by finding the divisors d of k(k-1) where d <=k-1, compute b=1 + (k(k-1))/d, and for each such b, increment a count.\n\nOnce a b's count exceeds 10, we can return the smallest such b.\n\nSo, let's start with k=2.\n\nk=2:\n\nk(k-1) =2*1=2.\n\nDivisors of 2 are 1,2.\n\nBut d must be <=k-1=1, so d=1.\n\nSo, d=1:\n\nb=1 + (2*1)/1=3.\n\nSo, b=3.\n\nCheck a=d=1 <=b-1=2? Yes.\n\nc=k -a=2-1=1 <=b-1=2? Yes.\n\nSo, for k=2, b=3 is a valid base with one b-eautiful number: n=4.\n\nSo, in our count, b=3 now has 1.\n\nk=3:\n\nk(k-1)=3*2=6.\n\nDivisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.\n\nd must be <=k-1=2, so d=1,2.\n\nFor d=1:\n\nb=1 +6/1=7.\n\nCheck a=1 <=6? Yes.\n\nc=3-1=2 <=6? Yes.\n\nSo, b=7 gets a count.\n\nFor d=2:\n\nb=1 +6/2=4.\n\nCheck a=2 <=3? Yes.\n\nc=3-2=1 <=3? Yes.\n\nSo, b=4 gets a count.\n\nSo, k=3 contributes to b=7 and b=4.\n\nNow, b=4 has 1, b=7 has 1.\n\nk=4:\n\nk(k-1)=4*3=12.\n\nDivisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nd must be <=3 (k-1=3).\n\nSo, d=1,2,3.\n\nd=1:\n\nb=1 +12/1=13.\n\na=1 <=12? Yes.\n\nc=4-1=3 <=12? Yes.\n\nb=13 gets a count.\n\nd=2:\n\nb=1 +12/2=7.\n\na=2 <=6? Yes.\n\nc=4-2=2 <=6? Yes.\n\nb=7 gets a count.\n\nd=3:\n\nb=1 +12/3=5.\n\na=3 <=4? Yes.\n\nc=4-3=1 <=4? Yes.\n\nb=5 gets a count.\n\nSo, for k=4, b=13,7,5 each get a count.\n\nNow, counts:\n\nb=3:1\n\nb=4:1\n\nb=5:1\n\nb=7:2\n\nb=13:1\n\nk=5:\n\nk(k-1)=5*4=20.\n\nDivisors of 20: 1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\nd must be <=4.\n\nSo, d=1,2,4.\n\nd=1:\n\nb=1 +20/1=21.\n\na=1 <=20? Yes.\n\nc=5-1=4 <=20? Yes.\n\nb=21 gets a count.\n\nd=2:\n\nb=1 +20/2=11.\n\na=2 <=10? Yes.\n\nc=5-2=3 <=10? Yes.\n\nb=11 gets a count.\n\nd=4:\n\nb=1 +20/4=6.\n\na=4 <=5? Yes.\n\nc=5-4=1 <=5?

looking at the counts, I see that b=11 has 3 now, and b=16 has 2, etc.\n\nBut we're looking for the first b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nI notice that as k increases, the number of possible divisors increases, so higher k's might contribute more to certain b's.\n\nBut maybe I should proceed further with higher k's.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute the number of b's for each k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nEach such divisor d gives a unique b=1 + k(k-1)/d.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of such divisors.\n\nBut the problem is that each b can be generated by multiple k's, so we need to count how many times each b is generated across all k's.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming to compute manually for each k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a mathematical relationship.\n\nLet me consider that for each k, the number of possible d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nWhich is the same as the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nBut since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime.\n\nSo, the number of divisors of k(k-1) is equal to the product of the number of divisors of k and k-1.\n\nBut for each k, the number of d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each k, the number of such d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nBut since k and k-1 are coprime, each divisor of k(k-1) can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides k and d2 divides k-1.\n\nSo, the total number of divisors is (number of divisors of k) * (number of divisors of k-1).\n\nBut the number of divisors <=k-1 is equal to the number of such d1*d2 <=k-1.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of possible d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nWhich is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are <=k-1.\n\nSince k and k-1 are coprime, any divisor d of k(k-1) can be written as d = a*b, where a divides k and b divides k-1.\n\nSo, to have d <=k-1, we need a*b <=k-1.\n\nBut since a divides k and b divides k-1, and k and k-1 are coprime.\n\nSo, for each a dividing k, and b dividing k-1, such that a*b <=k-1.\n\nSo, the number of such (a,b) pairs is equal to the number of d's.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each k, the maximum possible d is k-1, so the minimum possible b is 1 + (k(k-1))/(k-1) =1 +k.\n\nSo, the minimum b for a given k is k+1, and the maximum b is 1 + (k(k-1))/1 =k^2 -k +1.\n\nWait, but for each k, the possible b's are between k+1 and k^2 -k +1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the fact that for each b, the number of k's that can contribute to it is equal to the number of ways that b can be expressed as 1 + (k(k-1))/d, where d is a divisor of k(k-1) and d <=k-1.\n\nBut this seems too abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as for each b, the number of k's where k(k-1) is divisible by (b-1), and d = (k(k-1))/(b-1) is an integer <=k-1.\n\nWait, because from earlier:\n\nb =1 + (k(k-1))/d.\n\nSo, (b-1) = (k(k-1))/d.\n\nWhich implies that d = (k(k-1))/(b-1).\n\nSo, for a given b, the possible k's are those where (b-1) divides k(k-1), and d = (k(k-1))/(b-1) is an integer <=k-1.\n\nWhich means that k(k-1) must be a multiple of (b-1), and d must be <=k-1.\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k >=2 such that (b-1) divides k(k-1), and (k(k-1))/(b-1) <=k-1.\n\nWhich simplifies to k(k-1) <= (k-1)(b-1).\n\nDividing both sides by (k-1) (since k>=2, k-1 >=1, so division is allowed):\n\nk <= b-1.\n\nSo, for a given b, the possible k's are integers where k <= b-1, and (b-1) divides k(k-1).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each b, count the number of integers k where 2 <=k <=b-1, and (b-1) divides k(k-1).\n\nEach such k will contribute a b-eautiful number n=k^2.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's in [2, b-1] such that (b-1) divides k(k-1).\n\nThus, our problem is to find the smallest b >=2 such that the number of integers k in [2, b-1] where (b-1) divides k(k-1) is greater than 10.\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nSo, now, for each b, compute the number of k in [2, b-1] such that (b-1) divides k(k-1).\n\nLet me denote m =b-1.\n\nSo, for each m >=1 (since b >=2), we need to find the number of k in [2, m] such that m divides k(k-1).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the smallest m+1 such that the number of k in [2, m] where m divides k(k-1) is >10.\n\nThus, our goal is to find the smallest m where the count of k's in [2, m] with m |k(k-1) is >10, and then the answer is m+1.\n\nSo, let's try to compute this for m starting from 1 upwards.\n\nWait, but m starts from 1 (b=2).\n\nFor each m, count the number of k's in [2, m] such that m divides k(k-1).\n\nLet's compute this for m from 1 upwards until we find the first m where the count exceeds 10.\n\nLet me start:\n\nm=1:\n\nk ranges from 2 to 1, which is invalid.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b^1 to b^2 - 1. So, the number n can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c is at least 0 and at most b-1.\n\nThe condition for b-eautiful is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) has to be an integer (because a and c are integers, their sum is also an integer), n must be a perfect square. Let's denote k = sqrt(n). So, k is an integer, and n = k^2.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\nn = a*b + c = k^2\nand\na + c = k\n\nSo, substituting c from the second equation into the first, we get:\na*b + (k - a) = k^2\nSimplify that:\na*b + k - a = k^2\nFactor out a:\na*(b - 1) + k = k^2\nThen, solving for a:\na*(b - 1) = k^2 - k\nSo,\na = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (inclusive), the expression (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nLet me write down the key equations again for clarity:\n\n1. n = a*b + c = k^2\n2. a + c = k\n3. Therefore, a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nSo, for each base b, we can find possible k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and a is within 1 to b-1. Also, since n must be a two-digit number in base b, we have:\n\nb \u2264 n < b^2\nWhich means:\nb \u2264 k^2 < b^2\n\nSo, sqrt(b) \u2264 k < b\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think. Because n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b^2 - 1. So, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1), which is approximately b.\n\nSo, k must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k < b.\n\nBut since k is an integer, the possible k's are from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(b - 1). Because if k is equal to b, then n = b^2, which is a three-digit number in base b (since it's 100_b), so k must be less than b.\n\nSo, for each base b, k can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.\n\nNow, for each b, we can iterate over possible k's in that range and check if (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if a is within 1 to b-1.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the smallest b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I need to find for each b, how many k's satisfy these conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, but perhaps there's a pattern or formula we can derive.\n\nLet me see. From equation 3:\na = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nWe can write this as:\na = k(k - 1)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide k(k - 1). So, (b - 1) | k(k - 1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1).\n\nAlternatively, since (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), and k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide the product of two coprimes, which implies that (b - 1) must be a product of factors each dividing one of the numbers.\n\nSo, since k and k - 1 are coprime, the factors of (b - 1) must be entirely in k or entirely in k - 1.\n\nWait, that is, (b - 1) can be written as d * e, where d divides k and e divides k - 1, and since k and k - 1 are coprime, d and e must be coprime as well.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of divisors.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, (b - 1) must divide k(k - 1). So, for each k in the range, we can check if (b - 1) divides k(k - 1). If it does, then a is an integer, and we can compute a.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to fix k and see for which b's the condition holds.\n\nWait, that might be more efficient. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we fix k. Then, for (b - 1) to divide k(k - 1), (b - 1) must be a divisor of k(k - 1). So, for each k, the possible values of (b - 1) are the divisors of k(k - 1). Then, b = d + 1, where d is a divisor of k(k - 1).\n\nBut also, we have constraints on b because k must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)) and less than b.\n\nWait, let's see. If we fix k, then for each divisor d of k(k - 1), we can set b = d + 1. Then, we need to check whether k is in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1].\n\nWait, but k must be less than b, so since b = d + 1, k < d + 1.\n\nAlso, k must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)) = ceil(sqrt(d + 1)).\n\nSo, for each k, we can find all d's such that d divides k(k - 1), and then set b = d + 1, and check if k >= ceil(sqrt(b)) and k < b.\n\nBut this seems a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to iterate over k and see for which b's the conditions hold.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the number of possible k's for each b.\n\nWait, the problem is to find the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful numbers (i.e., the number of k's) is more than 10. So, perhaps instead of iterating for each b, I can find for each k, all possible b's that can be formed, and then for each b, count how many k's it has.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the number of solutions as a function of b and find when it exceeds 10.\n\nWait, let me think about the equation a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). Since a must be at least 1 and at most b - 1, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nWhich implies:\n\nb - 1 \u2264 k^2 - k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nSo,\n\nk^2 - k \u2265 b - 1\n\nand\n\nk^2 - k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nSo, from the first inequality,\n\nk^2 - k - (b - 1) \u2265 0\n\nWhich is a quadratic in k: k^2 -k - (b-1) \u2265 0\n\nSolving for k,\n\nk \u2265 [1 + sqrt(1 + 4(b - 1))]/2\n\nSimilarly, from the second inequality,\n\nk^2 -k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nk^2 -k - (b - 1)^2 \u2264 0\n\nSolving for k,\n\nk \u2264 [1 + sqrt(1 + 4(b - 1)^2)]/2\n\nBut this seems a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for b such that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), and a is in the range [1, b - 1].\n\nBut perhaps another angle: for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d = b - 1, and k < b, and k >= sqrt(b).\n\nWait, yes, because b = d + 1, and d divides k(k - 1).\n\nSo, for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d + 1 > k (since b = d + 1 > k) and d + 1 <= k^2 (since b <= k^2, because n = k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, so b <= k^2 < b^2. Wait, no, n is two-digit in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. So, k^2 is between b and b^2 - 1.\n\nSo, b <= k^2 < b^2.\n\nWhich implies that k^2 >= b, so b <= k^2.\n\nAnd k^2 < b^2, so k < b.\n\nSo, for each k, the possible b's are those where b = d + 1, where d is a divisor of k(k - 1), and b must satisfy k < b <= k^2.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d + 1 > k and d + 1 <= k^2.\n\nSo, for each k, count the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) where d > k - 1 and d <= k^2 - 1.\n\nWait, but d = b - 1, so d > k - 1 implies b = d + 1 > k.\n\nAnd d <= k^2 - 1, so b <= k^2.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of b's is the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d > k - 1 and d <= k^2 - 1.\n\nBut since d divides k(k - 1), which is k^2 - k, the maximum possible d is k^2 - k. So, the upper bound d <= k^2 - 1 is automatically satisfied because k^2 - k <= k^2 - 1 for k >= 2.\n\nSo, the condition simplifies to d > k - 1.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d > k - 1.\n\nBut since d divides k(k - 1), and d > k - 1, then d must be a divisor of k(k - 1) greater than k - 1.\n\nBut let's think about the divisors of k(k - 1). Since k and k - 1 are coprime, the number of divisors is equal to the product of the number of divisors of k and the number of divisors of k - 1.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the divisors of k(k - 1) can be paired as (d, k(k - 1)/d). So, for each divisor d less than sqrt(k(k - 1)), there's a corresponding divisor greater than sqrt(k(k - 1)).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, the number of divisors d of k(k - 1) such that d > k - 1 is equal to the number of divisors less than or equal to k(k - 1)/(k - 1) = k.\n\nWait, because for each d > k - 1, the corresponding co-divisor is e = k(k - 1)/d, which must be less than or equal to k.\n\nSo, the number of such d's is equal to the number of e's that are divisors of k(k - 1) and e <= k.\n\nTherefore, for each k, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors e of k(k - 1) such that e <= k.\n\nSo, for each k, count the number of divisors e of k(k - 1) where e <= k.\n\nThen, for each such e, b = d + 1 = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nIf d is a divisor of k(k - 1) and d > k - 1, then e = k(k - 1)/d is a divisor less than or equal to k.\n\nBecause d > k - 1 implies e = (k(k - 1))/d < (k(k - 1))/(k - 1) ) = k.\n\nSo, e < k.\n\nSo, the number of such d's is equal to the number of e's which are divisors of k(k - 1) and e < k.\n\nWait, but e can be equal to k? Let's see: if e = k, then d = (k(k - 1))/k = k - 1. But d must be > k - 1, so e can't be equal to k because that would make d = k - 1, which is not > k - 1. So, e must be less than k.\n\nTherefore, the number of d's is equal to the number of e's which are divisors of k(k - 1) and e < k.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors e of k(k - 1) where e < k.\n\nSo, the number of b's per k is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) less than k.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit abstract, but maybe we can proceed.\n\nSo, for each k, count the number of e's which are divisors of k(k - 1) and less than k. Then, each such e gives a b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1.\n\nBut for each k, how many such e's are there?\n\nWell, the number of such e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) less than k.\n\nBut let's think about the divisors of k(k - 1). Since k and k - 1 are coprime, the number of divisors of k(k - 1) is equal to the product of the number of divisors of k and the number of divisors of k - 1.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the divisors of k(k - 1) can be written as d = d1 * d2, where d1 divides k and d2 divides k - 1.\n\nSo, to find the number of e's less than k, we can consider all pairs (d1, d2) such that d1*d2 < k, d1 divides k, d2 divides k - 1.\n\nHmm, maybe that's a way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each k, the number of e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) less than k. So, for each k, the number of such e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) that are less than k.\n\nSo, for example, if k is a prime number, then k(k - 1) has factors 1, k - 1, k, and k(k - 1). So, the divisors less than k are 1 and k - 1. So, for a prime k, the number of e's is 2.\n\nBut wait, k(k - 1) for prime k would have (k is prime) so k-1 is composite unless k=3, where k-1=2 which is prime. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let's take k=4. Then k(k - 1) = 4*3=12. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The divisors less than 4 are 1,2,3. So, three divisors. So, number of e's is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5, k(k - 1)=20. Divisors less than 5 are 1,2,4. So, three divisors.\n\nWait, so for k=4 and k=5, we have 3 e's each.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the number of e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) less than k.\n\nSo, let's make a table for small k:\n\nk | k(k-1) | Divisors of k(k-1) | Divisors <k | Number of e's\n---|-------|-------------------|------------|------------\n2 | 2*1=2 | 1,2               | 1          | 1\n3 | 3*2=6 | 1,2,3,6           | 1,2        | 2\n4 | 4*3=12|1,2,3,4,6,12       |1,2,3       |3\n5 |5*4=20 |1,2,4,5,10,20      |1,2,4       |3\n6 |6*5=30 |1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30|1,2,3,5     |4\n7 |7*6=42 |1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42|1,2,3,6     |4\n8 |8*7=56 |1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56|1,2,4,7     |4\n9 |9*8=72 |1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72 |1,2,3,4,6,8 |6\n10|10*9=90|1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90 |1,2,3,5,6,9 |6\n\nSo, for k=2, number of e's is 1.\n\nk=3: 2 e's.\n\nk=4:3\n\nk=5:3\n\nk=6:4\n\nk=7:4\n\nk=8:4\n\nk=9:6\n\nk=10:6\n\nWait, so for each k, the number of e's is increasing as k increases, but not always.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k - 1) that are less than k.\n\nNow, for each such e, we get a b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1.\n\nBut we need to make sure that b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1 > k, because earlier we had that b must be greater than k.\n\nWait, since e < k, then k(k - 1)/e > k(k - 1)/k = k - 1.\n\nSo, k(k - 1)/e >= k(k - 1)/(k - 1) ) = k.\n\nWait, no, because e < k, so k(k - 1)/e > k(k - 1)/(k) ) = (k - 1).\n\nBut since e can be as small as 1, k(k - 1)/e can be as large as k(k - 1). So, b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1 can be as large as k(k - 1) + 1.\n\nWait, but earlier we have that b must be <= k^2 because n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which requires that b <= k^2.\n\nBut for b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1, we have:\n\n(k(k - 1)/e) + 1 <= k^2\n\nSo,\n\nk(k - 1)/e <= k^2 - 1\n\nMultiply both sides by e:\n\nk(k - 1) <= (k^2 -1)e\n\nSo,\n\nk(k - 1) <= e(k^2 - 1)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk(k - 1) <= e(k^2 - 1)\n\nDivide both sides by k:\n\n(k - 1) <= e(k - 1/k)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that for each e < k, we can compute b and see if it's <= k^2.\n\nBut given that e < k, then b = (k(k - 1)/e) + 1.\n\nLet me check for k=2:\n\nk=2, e=1.\n\nb = (2*1)/1 +1 = 3.\n\nCheck if b <= k^2=4: yes.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, e=1,2.\n\ne=1: b= (3*2)/1 +1=7. 7 <=9: yes.\n\ne=2: b= (3*2)/2 +1=3+1=4. 4 <=9: yes.\n\nSo, for k=3, b=7 and 4.\n\nWait, but for b=4, let's see: n = a*b + c = k^2=9.\n\na = (9 -3)/ (4 -1) = 6/3=2.\n\nSo, a=2, c=k - a=3 -2=1.\n\nSo, n=2*4 +1=9, which is correct.\n\nYes, so both b=4 and 7 are valid.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4, e=1,2,3.\n\ne=1: b= (4*3)/1 +1=13.\n\nCheck if 13 <=16: yes.\n\ne=2: b=(12)/2 +1=6 +1=7.\n\nCheck 7 <=16: yes.\n\ne=3: b=12/3 +1=4 +1=5.\n\nCheck 5 <=16: yes.\n\nSo, for k=4, we have b=13,7,5.\n\nEach of these bases will have a corresponding n=16 (k=4) as a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each k, we can find multiple b's, each contributing one b-eautiful number (n=k^2) in that base.\n\nBut the problem is that for a given b, how many k's are there such that n=k^2 is b-eautiful. Because each k can contribute to multiple b's, but each b can have multiple k's.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each k can contribute to multiple b's, but each b can have multiple k's. So, for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's such that (b - 1) divides k(k - 1), and a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1.\n\nSo, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we need to find the number of k's where k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], and (b -1) divides k(k -1), and a is in [1, b -1].\n\nBut given that a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1), which is equal to k(k -1)/(b -1). So, since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide k(k -1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of such k's.\n\nSo, our task is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to iterate b from 2 upwards, for each b compute the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and stop when this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut this might take a while manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that (b -1) divides k(k -1). So, since k and k -1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of factors each dividing either k or k -1.\n\nTherefore, (b -1) can be expressed as d * e, where d divides k and e divides k -1, and d and e are coprime.\n\nBut since (b -1) = d * e, and k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], perhaps we can model the number of k's as the number of ways to write (b -1) as a product of two coprime factors d and e, where d divides k and e divides k -1, with k in the specified range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to k and greater than or equal to ... Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since (b -1) divides k(k -1), and k and k -1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k -1.\n\nTherefore, the number of such k's is equal to the number of ways to factor (b -1) into two coprime factors d and e, such that d divides k and e divides k -1, with k >= ceil(sqrt(b)) and k < b.\n\nBut since d and e are coprime, the number of such factorizations is 2^{number of prime factors of (b -1)}.\n\nWait, but not exactly, because the order matters.\n\nWait, for example, if (b -1) has m distinct prime factors, then the number of ways to write (b -1) as a product of two coprime factors d and e is 2^{m}, since each prime factor can go to d or e.\n\nBut in our case, since d and e are positive integers greater than 0, and d*e = (b -1), the number of such factorizations is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1).\n\nBut wait, for each prime factor, it can be assigned to d or to e, so yes, 2^{m} possibilities.\n\nBut in our case, since d divides k and e divides k -1, and k and k -1 are coprime, each such factorization corresponds to a unique k.\n\nBut we also have constraints that k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nSo, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of such factorizations where k = (d * something) and k -1 = (e * something else), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of such factorizations, provided that k = d * t and k -1 = e * s, where t and s are integers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set d = gcd(k, b -1) and e = (b -1)/d, which must divide k -1.\n\nBut since k and k -1 are coprime, d and e must be coprime as well.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b -1), if d divides k and e = (b -1)/d divides k -1, then k must satisfy:\n\nk \u2261 0 mod d\n\nand\n\nk \u2261 1 mod e\n\nBecause k -1 must be divisible by e.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can solve the system:\n\nk \u2261 0 mod d\n\nk \u2261 1 mod e, where e = (b -1)/d\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), since d and e are coprime (as (b -1) is d*e and d and e are coprime), there exists a unique solution modulo d*e = b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b -1), there's exactly one solution k modulo (b -1). But k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nSo, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) for which the corresponding k from CRT lies in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that the solution k to the system:\n\nk \u2261 0 mod d\n\nk \u2261 1 mod ((b -1)/d)\n\nlies in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nSo, the number of k's is equal to the number of such divisors d.\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we can:\n\n1. Find all divisors d of (b -1).\n\n2. For each d, compute e = (b -1)/d.\n\n3. Use CRT to find k \u2261 0 mod d and k \u22611 mod e.\n\n4. Check if the solution k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\n5. Count the number of such k's.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming. Perhaps we can find a pattern or find when the number of divisors of (b -1) is high enough.\n\nWait, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) for which the solution k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1]. So, the more divisors (b -1) has, the more possible k's, but each k must satisfy the range condition.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of k's, (b -1) should have many divisors, and for each d, the corresponding k should lie in the required range.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal b where (b -1) has more than 10 divisors, but considering that each d may or may not produce a k in the required range.\n\nWait, but the number of k's is not exactly equal to the number of divisors, because some divisors may lead to k's outside the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut if (b -1) has a lot of divisors, say t divisors, then potentially up to t k's could be possible.\n\nBut we need to ensure that for each d, the corresponding k is within the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d, the minimal solution k is d, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, let's try with an example.\n\nTake b=13. Then, b-1=12.\n\nDivisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each d, compute e=12/d.\n\nThen, solve k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod e.\n\nLet's compute k for each d:\n\nd=1, e=12.\n\nk \u22610 mod 1 (always true)\n\nk \u22611 mod 12\n\nSo, k=13 is the smallest solution, but since k must be <13, no solution here.\n\nWait, but k must be <b=13, so k=13 is invalid.\n\nd=2, e=6.\n\nk \u22610 mod 2\n\nk \u22611 mod 6\n\nFind k such that k=2m and k=6n +1.\n\nSo, 2m=6n +1 \u2192 2m \u22611 mod6 \u2192 m\u2261 (1)/2 mod3. But 2*2=4\u2261-2\u22614 mod6, 2*4=8\u22612 mod6, etc. Wait, perhaps better to solve:\n\nFind k \u22610 mod2 and k\u22611 mod6.\n\nFind k \u22611 mod6.\n\nBut k must be even. So, k=6n +1 must be even. 6n is even, 6n+1 is odd. So, no solution.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, solving k \u22610 mod2 and k\u22611 mod6.\n\nLet me write k=6n +1.\n\nBut 6n +1 must be even. 6n is even, 6n +1 is odd. So, no solution. So, no k for d=2.\n\nd=3, e=4.\n\nk \u22610 mod3\n\nk\u22611 mod4\n\nFind k.\n\nSolutions: k=3m, 3m \u22611 mod4 \u2192 3m \u22611 mod4 \u2192 m\u22613^{-1} *1 mod4.\n\nSince 3*3=9\u22611 mod4, so inverse of 3 mod4 is 3.\n\nThus, m\u22613 mod4. So, m=4t +3.\n\nThus, k=3*(4t +3)=12t +9.\n\nNow, k must be <13, so t=0: k=9.\n\nCheck if k=9 is in [ceil(sqrt(13))=4,12]. Yes, 9 is in [4,12]. So, k=9 is a solution.\n\nd=4, e=3.\n\nk\u22610 mod4\n\nk\u22611 mod3.\n\nFind k.\n\nLet k=4m.\n\n4m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 m \u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3).\n\nSo, m=3t +1.\n\nThus, k=4*(3t +1)=12t +4.\n\nk must be <13. So, t=0: k=4.\n\nCheck if k=4 is in [4,12]. Yes.\n\nt=1: k=16, which is >=13, invalid.\n\nSo, k=4 is a solution.\n\nd=6, e=2.\n\nk\u22610 mod6\n\nk\u22611 mod2.\n\nBut k\u22610 mod6 implies k is even, and k\u22611 mod2 implies k is odd. Contradiction. So, no solution.\n\nd=12, e=1.\n\nk\u22610 mod12\n\nk\u22611 mod1 (always true)\n\nSo, k=12, but k must be <13, so k=12.\n\nCheck if k=12 is in [4,12]. Yes.\n\nSo, for b=13, the k's are 4,9,12.\n\nWait, that's three k's. But earlier, when I considered k=4,9,12, each would have contributed to b=13.\n\nWait, but earlier when we considered k=4, we had b=5,7,13.\n\nSimilarly, for k=9, let's see:\n\nk=9, b-1 must divide 9*8=72. So, b-1 can be any divisor of 72 greater than 8 (since k=9 must be <b).\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, back to b=13. The number of k's is 3: 4,9,12.\n\nSo, for b=13, there are 3 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut we need to find the smallest b where the number of k's exceeds 10.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find a b where (b -1) has a lot of divisors, and the corresponding k's fall into the required range.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of k's for a given b is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d <= (b -1)/2 and the corresponding k is in the range.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) where d <= k and k < b.\n\nWait, but without a clear pattern, perhaps it's better to look for b where (b -1) is highly composite, i.e., has a large number of divisors.\n\nSo, let's consider highly composite numbers for (b -1).\n\nFor example, b -1=24, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nSo, for b=25, let's compute the number of k's.\n\nCompute for each d in divisors of 24:\n\nd=1, e=24.\n\nk \u22610 mod1, k\u22611 mod24.\n\nSolution: k=24t +1.

So, k=24 is valid.\n\nSo, for b=25, the valid k's are 9,16,24.\n\nWait, that's three k's.\n\nWait, but I thought (b -1)=24 has 8 divisors, but only 3 of them lead to valid k's.\n\nHmm, so maybe the number of k's isn't directly tied to the number of divisors, but to the number of divisors that lead to k in the required range.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to note that for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d <= (b -1)/2 and the solution k from CRT is in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut without a clear formula, perhaps it's better to look for a b where (b -1) has many small factors, leading to multiple k's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each k, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors e of k(k -1) less than k.\n\nSo, for k, the number of e's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k -1) less than k.\n\nSo, for each k, we can compute the number of e's, and then for each e, b = (k(k -1)/e) +1.\n\nThen, for each such b, we can count how many k's contribute to it.\n\nBut this is a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think that for a given b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d <= (b -1)/2 and the corresponding k from CRT is in the range.\n\nBut again, without a clear pattern, perhaps it's better to proceed by testing specific b's.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that the number of k's increases as (b -1) becomes more composite.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called \"b-eautiful\" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.\n\nFirst, the problem says that for a given integer b (which is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. The first condition is that when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. The second condition is that the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nHmm, okay. So, for example, 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 and 3, right? Because 6*13 + 3 = 81, and 6 + 3 is 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.\n\nThe question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these two conditions.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let's represent the two-digit number in base b. A two-digit number in base b would be something like 'ab' in base b, where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, in this context, the digits are in base b, so the actual value would be a*b + c, where a and c are the digits. Wait, no, the digits themselves can't be equal to the base. So, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c < b. But since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So, a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, the number n in base 10 is equal to a*b + c. The sum of the digits is a + c. The condition given is that a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c.\n\nBut since n = a*b + c, we can substitute that into the equation. So, sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\nsqrt(a*b + c) = a + c\n\nIf I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\na*b + c = a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\na^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of a and c. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. Let me group terms:\n\na^2 + (2*c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in a. Maybe I can solve for a in terms of c and b. Let's treat a as the variable and c and b as parameters.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, a = [ -(2*c - b) \u00b1 sqrt( (2*c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c^2 - c) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\n(2*c - b)^2 - 4*(c^2 - c) = 4*c^2 -4*b*c + b^2 -4*c^2 +4*c = (-4*b*c) + b^2 +4*c\n\nSo, discriminant D = b^2 -4*b*c +4*c\n\nHmm, so for a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square, and the entire expression must yield an integer value.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me go back to the equation:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nLet me denote s = a + c. Then, the equation becomes:\n\na*b + c = s^2\n\nBut s = a + c, so c = s - a.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\na*b + (s - a) = s^2\n\nSimplify:\n\na*b + s - a = s^2\n\nFactor a:\n\na*(b - 1) + s = s^2\n\nThen,\n\na*(b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nSo,\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be a positive integer (since it's the first digit of a two-digit number in base b), the right side must be an integer. So, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).\n\nAlso, since a must be less than b (because it's a digit in base b), we have:\n\n1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1\n\nSimilarly, c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1\n\nSo, 0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b - 1\n\nBut since a is at least 1, s must be at least 1 + 0 = 1, but since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s can be from 1 upwards.\n\nWait, but let's think about the possible values of s.\n\ns = a + c, and since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1.\n\nBut also, n = a*b + c must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) = s, so n must be s^2.\n\nSo, s^2 must be equal to a*b + c, which is the number in base 10.\n\nBut we also have that s = a + c.\n\nSo, combining these, we get:\n\ns^2 = a*b + c = a*b + (s - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ns^2 = a*b + s - a\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nSo, from this, we can write:\n\na*b = s^2 - s + a\n\nSo,\n\na*(b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSo, since a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).\n\nAlso, since a must be at least 1 and at most b - 1, let's write that:\n\n1 \u2264 (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nSo, that gives us:\n\n(b - 1) \u2264 s^2 - s \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nWait, because (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1 implies s^2 - s \u2264 (b - 1)^2.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's the right way to look at it. Alternatively, maybe for each s, we can find possible b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each base b, we can find all possible s and a that satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the minimal b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, for each b, count the number of n's that satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as for each b, find all pairs (a, c) such that:\n\n1. a is in 1 to b-1\n2. c is in 0 to b-1\n3. a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\nWhich implies that a*b + c must be a perfect square, s^2, where s = a + c.\n\nSo, for each b, we can iterate over possible s, and then find a such that a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), and then check if c = s - a is within 0 to b-1.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a way to parameterize it.\n\nLet me consider that for each s, a must be equal to (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). So, since a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide (s^2 - s). So, (b - 1) | (s(s - 1)).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of possible s is equal to the number of divisors of (s(s-1)) that equal (b - 1). But I'm not sure that's the right way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s, we can find the corresponding b.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently. Let's fix s and then express b in terms of a and s.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSo,\n\nb - 1 = (s^2 - s)/a\n\nSo,\n\nb = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nSince b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by a, and the result plus 1 must be an integer >= 2.\n\nBut a is a positive integer less than b, which is at least 2, so a can be 1, 2, ..., up to b-1. But since a must divide (s^2 - s), which is s(s - 1), a must be a divisor of s(s - 1).\n\nSo, for each s, the possible a's are the positive divisors of s(s - 1), and then b is given by (s^2 - s)/a + 1.\n\nBut wait, since a must be less than b, let's see:\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nAnd since a < b, we have:\n\n(s^2 - s)/(b - 1) < b\n\nWhich implies:\n\ns^2 - s < b*(b - 1)\n\nBut b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1, so substituting:\n\ns^2 - s < [ (s^2 - s)/a + 1 ] * [ (s^2 - s)/a ]\n\nHmm, that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, we can find all possible a's that divide s(s-1), then compute b, and check if a is less than b and c = s - a is a valid digit (i.e., 0 <= c < b).\n\nWait, that might be a feasible approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each s starting from 1 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute s(s - 1).\n\n   b. Find all positive divisors a of s(s - 1).\n\n   c. For each such a, compute b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1.\n\n   d. Check if a < b (since a is a digit, it must be less than the base).\n\n   e. Also, check if c = s - a is between 0 and b - 1.\n\n   f. If both conditions are satisfied, then (a, c) is a valid pair for base b, meaning n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\n2. For each base b, count how many such n's exist. Once we find a b where the count exceeds 10, that's our answer.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can try small s and see what happens.\n\nLet me start with s=1:\n\ns=1:\n\ns(s-1) = 1*0 = 0. So, the divisors are only 1? Wait, but 0 can't be divided. Hmm, maybe s starts from 2.\n\nWait, for s=1, a would be (1^2 -1)/(b-1) = 0/(b-1) = 0. But a can't be zero because it's the first digit. So, s=1 is invalid.\n\ns=2:\n\ns(s-1) = 2*1 = 2. Divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n\nFor a=1:\n\nb = (4 - 2)/1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nCheck a < b: 1 < 3, yes.\n\nc = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nCheck c < b: 1 < 3, yes.\n\nSo, n = 2^2 =4. Is 4 in base 3 equal to 11? 1*3 +1=4. Yes, and 1+1=2, which is sqrt(4). So, 4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nFor a=2:\n\nb = (4 - 2)/2 + 1 = (2)/2 +1=1 +1=2.\n\nCheck a < b: 2 < 2? No. So, invalid.\n\nSo, only one n for s=2, which is 4 in base 3.\n\ns=3:\n\ns(s-1)=3*2=6. Divisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\na=1:\n\nb=(9 -3)/1 +1=6+1=7.\n\na=1 <7, yes.\n\nc=3-1=2 <7, yes.\n\nn=9.\n\nIn base 7, 9 is 12 (1*7 +2=9). 1+2=3, sqrt(9)=3. So, 9 is 7-eautiful.\n\na=2:\n\nb=(9-3)/2 +1=6/2 +1=3+1=4.\n\na=2 <4, yes.\n\nc=3-2=1 <4, yes.\n\nn=9.\n\nIn base4, 9 is 21 (2*4 +1=9). 2+1=3, sqrt(9)=3. So, 9 is 4-eautiful.\n\na=3:\n\nb=(9-3)/3 +1=6/3 +1=2+1=3.\n\na=3 <3? No. Invalid.\n\na=6:\n\nb=(9-3)/6 +1=6/6 +1=1+1=2.\n\na=6 <2? No. Invalid.\n\nSo, for s=3, we get two n's: 9 in base4 and base7.\n\nWait, but in base7, 9 is 12, and in base4 it's 21. So, two different bases. So, for each s, multiple bases can be found.\n\nBut in our problem, we're looking for for each base b, how many n's exist.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, we can track the number of n's.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but let's proceed.\n\ns=4:\n\ns(s-1)=4*3=12. Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\na=1:\n\nb=(16-4)/1 +1=12+1=13.\n\nc=4-1=3 <13, yes.\n\nn=16.\n\nIn base13, 16 is 13 +3=16, which is 13*1 +3=16. 1+3=4, sqrt(16)=4. So, 16 is 13-eautiful.\n\na=2:\n\nb=(16-4)/2 +1=12/2 +1=6+1=7.\n\nc=4-2=2 <7, yes.\n\nn=16.\n\nIn base7, 16 is 2*7 +2=16. 2+2=4, sqrt(16)=4. So, 16 is 7-eautiful.\n\na=3:\n\nb=(16-4)/3 +1=12/3 +1=4 +1=5.\n\nc=4-3=1 <5, yes.\n\nn=16.\n\nIn base5, 16 is 3*5 +1=16. 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4. So, 16 is 5-eautiful.\n\na=4:\n\nb=(16-4)/4 +1=12/4 +1=3 +1=4.\n\nc=4-4=0 <4, yes.\n\nn=16.\n\nIn base4, 16 is 100, which is a three-digit number, but wait, 16 in base4 is 100, which has three digits, so it doesn't qualify. So, this is invalid because we need exactly two digits. So, n must be a two-digit number in base b, meaning n must be at least b (since the smallest two-digit number is 10 in base b, which is b in decimal), and less than b^2.\n\nWait, n is s^2, so for n to be a two-digit number in base b, we must have b \u2264 n < b^2.\n\nSo, for s=4, n=16.\n\nWe have to check if n is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nSo, when a=4, b=4, n=16. In base4, 16 is 100, which is three digits. So, invalid. So, discard this case.\n\na=6:\n\nb=(16-4)/6 +1=12/6 +1=2 +1=3.\n\nc=4-6= -2. Wait, c can't be negative. So, invalid.\n\na=12:\n\nb=(16-4)/12 +1=12/12 +1=1 +1=2.\n\nc=4-12= -8. Also invalid.\n\nSo, for s=4, we have three valid bases: 13,7,5.\n\nEach of these bases has n=16 as a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each of these bases, their count increases by one.\n\nSimilarly, for s=5:\n\ns=5:\n\ns(s-1)=5*4=20. Divisors:1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\na=1:\n\nb=(25 -5)/1 +1=20 +1=21.\n\nc=5-1=4 <21, yes.\n\nn=25.\n\nIn base21, 25 is 1*21 +4=25. 1+4=5, sqrt(25)=5.

So, base43 is only added in s=15.\n\nSo, base43:1.\n\nSimilarly, base45: s=12.\n\nBase46: s=10.\n\nBase49: s=16.\n\nBase53: s=13.\n\nBase56: s=11.\n\nBase57: s=8.\n\nBase61: s=16.\n\nBase67: s=12.\n\nBase69: s=17.\n\nBase71: s=15.\n\nBase73: s=9.\n\nBase79: s=13.\n\nBase81: s=16.\n\nBase91: s=10.\n\nBase92: s=14.\n\nBase106: s=15.\n\nBase121: s=16.\n\nBase133: s=12.\n\nBase137: s=17.\n\nBase157: s=13.\n\nBase183: s=14.\n\nBase211: s=15.\n\nBase241: s=16.\n\nBase273: s=17.\n\nSo, now, for each base, the number of times it's been added is:\n\nBase3:1\n\nBase4:1\n\nBase5:1\n\nBase6:1\n\nBase7:2\n\nBase8:1\n\nBase9:1\n\nBase10:1\n\nBase11:3\n\nBase12:1\n\nBase13:3\n\nBase14:1\n\nBase15:2\n\nBase16:3\n\nBase17:1\n\nBase18:1\n\nBase19:2\n\nBase21:1\n\nBase22:1\n\nBase23:2\n\nBase25:2\n\nBase27:2\n\nBase29:1\n\nBase31:3\n\nBase34:1\n\nBase35:1\n\nBase36:1\n\nBase37:1\n\nBase40:1\n\nBase41:1\n\nBase43:1\n\nBase45:1\n\nBase46:1\n\nBase49:1\n\nBase53:1\n\nBase56:1\n\nBase57:1\n\nBase61:1\n\nBase67:1\n\nBase69:1\n\nBase71:1\n\nBase73:1\n\nBase79:1\n\nBase81:1\n\nBase91:1\n\nBase92:1\n\nBase106:1\n\nBase133:1\n\nBase137:1\n\nBase157:1\n\nBase183:1\n\nBase211:1\n\nBase241:1\n\nBase273:1\n\nLooking through this, the highest count is 3 for bases 11,13,31.\n\nSo, base11:3\n\nbase13:3\n\nbase31:3\n\nSo, each of these has 3 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut we need a base with more than 10. So, clearly, we need to go higher with s.\n\nBut up to s=17, the maximum is 3. So, perhaps I need to find a base that is hit multiple times as s increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the base that is a multiple of many numbers will have more n's.\n\nWait, perhaps if a base is a multiple of several s(s-1), it can be expressed as (s^2 - s)/a +1 for multiple s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if a base is such that it can be expressed as (s^2 - s)/a +1 for many different s and a.\n\nBut this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, for each s, the number of bases added is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are less than s.\n\nWait, for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are less than s, because a must be less than b, and b = (s^2 - s)/a +1. So, to have b > a, we need (s^2 -s)/a +1 > a.\n\nWhich implies (s^2 - s)/a > a -1.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given base b, the number of n's is equal to the number of pairs (a,c) such that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c) and n is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nBut perhaps, for a base b, the number of possible s's is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s) that equal (b -1). So, for each s, if (b -1) divides (s^2 -s), then a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) must be an integer, and c = s -a must be a valid digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for bases that are one more than a number with many factors, as that would allow for multiple s's.\n\nWait, but in the earlier cases, bases like 31 had three n's because it was a result for s=6, s=10, s=15.\n\nWait, let's see what's special about 31.\n\nFor s=6, a=2: b=(36 -6)/2 +1=15 +1=16. Wait, no, s=6, a=6: b=(36 -6)/6 +1=5 +1=6. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently.\n\nEach time a base is added, it's because for some s, (b -1) divides (s^2 -s).\n\nSo, for base b, the number of n's is equal to the number of s's where (b -1) divides (s^2 -s).\n\nSo, (b -1) | s(s -1).\n\nSo, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than some value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each s, (b -1) must divide s(s-1). So, for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b -1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s such that s \u2261 0 or 1 mod factors of (b -1).\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1), but that's not exactly correct.\n\nWait, no. Because s(s-1) must be divisible by (b -1). So, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can have s \u2261 0 or 1 mod d, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d dividing (b -1), there exists an s such that s \u2261 0 or 1 mod d. So, the number of possible s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1), but each s must be greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of possible s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1), but considering that s must be at least 2 and such that c is non-negative.\n\nWait, this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of a specific example.\n\nTake base b=31.\n\nWe saw that for s=6, a=6: but wait, a=6, b= (36 -6)/6 +1=5 +1=6, which is less than a=6, so invalid. So, in s=6, a=2: b=(36 -6)/2 +1=15 +1=16. So, 16 is a base that was added for s=6.\n\nWait, but for base31, when does it get added?\n\nLooking back, s=6: a=6 was invalid because b=6, which is not greater than a=6. So, s=6, a=2: b=16.\n\ns=10: a=10: b= (100 -10)/10 +1=9 +1=10. So, a=10, b=10. c=10 -10=0, which is valid, but n=100 in base10 is 100, which is three digits. So, invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier, for s=10, a=10 was invalid because n became three digits.\n\nWait, so when does base31 get added?\n\nLooking back, s=10: a=10 was invalid because n became three digits, but for a=6: b=(100 -10)/6 +1=15 +1=16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, for s=10, a=10 is invalid, but a=6:\n\nb=(100 -10)/6 +1=15 +1=16.\n\nSo, a=6, c=10 -6=4.\n\nIn base16, n=100 is 6*16 +4=100. 6+4=10, which is sqrt(100)=10. So, valid.\n\nSo, base16 gets n=100 added.\n\nWait, but base31 was added for s=6 and s=10.\n\nWait, no, base31 was added for s=6 when a=2: b=16.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nGiven that for each base b, the number of n's is equal to the number of s's where (b -1) divides s(s-1). So, the number of such s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) times 2, but only for s >=2.\n\nWait, but not exactly, because s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, (b -1) must divide either s or s-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can have s = d or s = d +1.\n\nBut s must be at least 2, so d must be at least 2 or d +1 >=2.\n\nWait, so the number of s's is equal to the number of positive divisors of (b -1), because for each divisor d, s can be d or d +1.\n\nBut s must be such that s >=2, and c = s - a must be non-negative and less than b.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key.\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of possible s's is equal to the number of positive divisors of (b -1), because for each divisor d of (b -1), s can be d or d +1.\n\nBut we have to ensure that:\n\n1. s >=2.\n\n2. a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) must be an integer.\n\n3. c = s - a must satisfy 0 <= c < b.\n\nSo, for each d | (b -1), we can set s = d or s = d +1, and check if a and c are valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible s's is at most 2 * number of divisors of (b -1).\n\nBut some of these may not satisfy the conditions, so the actual number could be less.\n\nBut to maximize the number of n's for a base, we need to maximize the number of divisors of (b -1), so that we have more s's.\n\nTherefore, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need (b -1) to have a large number of divisors, preferably more than 5, since each divisor can potentially give two s's, but considering overlaps and validity.\n\nWait, but let's test this.\n\nTake b=31, so b-1=30, which has divisors 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nSo, 8 divisors. So, potentially, 16 s's, but many will be invalid.\n\nBut for each d in divisors, s=d and s=d+1.\n\nSo, for d=1: s=1 (invalid, since s must be at least 2), s=2.\n\nd=2: s=2, s=3.\n\nd=3: s=3, s=4.\n\nd=5: s=5, s=6.\n\nd=6: s=6, s=7.\n\nd=10: s=10, s=11.\n\nd=15: s=15, s=16.\n\nd=30: s=30, s=31.\n\nSo, for each of these s's, we can compute a and c.\n\nBut many will result in a >=b or c >=b.\n\nSo, let's see how many are valid.\n\nFor b=31:\n\nb-1=30.\n\nd=1: s=2.\n\na=(4 -2)/30=2/30=1/15. Not integer. Invalid.\n\nd=2: s=2.\n\nSame as above.\n\nd=2: s=3.\n\na=(9 -3)/30=6/30=1/5. Not integer.\n\nd=3: s=3.\n\na=(9 -3)/30=6/30=1/5. Not integer.\n\nd=3: s=4.\n\na=(16 -4)/30=12/30=2/5. Not integer.\n\nd=5: s=5.\n\na=(25 -5)/30=20/30=2/3. Not integer.\n\nd=5: s=6.\n\na=(36 -6)/30=30/30=1.\n\nc=6 -1=5 <31, yes.\n\nSo, n=36 is 1*31 +5=36. 1+5=6. Valid.\n\nd=6: s=6.\n\na=1, as above.\n\nd=6: s=7.\n\na=(49 -7)/30=42/30=7/5. Not integer.\n\nd=10: s=10.\n\na=(100 -10)/30=90/30=3.\n\nc=10 -3=7 <31, yes.\n\nn=100 is 3*31 +7=100. 3+7=10. Valid.\n\nd=10: s=11.\n\na=(121 -11)/30=110/30=11/3. Not integer.\n\nd=15: s=15.\n\na=(225 -15)/30=210/30=7.\n\nc=15 -7=8 <31, yes.\n\nn=225 is 7*31 +8=225. 7+8=15. Valid.\n\nd=15: s=16.\n\na=(256 -16)/30=240/30=8.\n\nc=16 -8=8 <31, yes.\n\nn=256 is 8*31 +8=256. 8+8=16. Valid.\n\nd=30: s=30.\n\na=(900 -30)/30=870/30=29.\n\nc=30 -29=1 <31, yes.\n\nn=900 is 29*31 +1=900. 29+1=30. Valid.\n\nd=30: s=31.\n\na=(961 -31)/30=930/30=31.\n\nc=31 -31=0 <31, yes.\n\nn=961 is 31*31 +0=961. 31+0=31. But n=961 in base31 is 31^2=961, which is 100 in base31, a three-digit number. So, invalid.\n\nSo, for b=31, the valid s's are s=6,10,15,16,30.\n\nSo, 5 n's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when s=6,10,15, etc., base31 was added, but according to this, only 5 n's.\n\nBut earlier, when I was listing for s=6,10,15,16, etc., I saw that base31 was added for s=6, s=10, s=15, s=16.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the base and the s.\n\nWait, when s=6, a=6: b=(36 -6)/6 +1=5 +1=6. So, n=36 is 6-eautiful.\n\nBut when s=6, a=2: b=(36 -6)/2 +1=15 +1=16. So, n=36 is 16-eautiful.\n\nSimilarly, when s=10, a=3: b=(100 -10)/3 +1=30 +1=31. So, n=100 is 31-eautiful.\n\nSo, in this case, base31 is added once for s=10.\n\nSimilarly, for s=15, a=7: b=(225 -15)/7 +1=210/7 +1=30 +1=31. So, n=225 is 31-eautiful.\n\nAnd for s=16, a=8: b=(256 -16)/8 +1=240/8 +1=30 +1=31. So, n=256 is 31-eautiful.\n\nAnd for s=30, a=29: b=(900 -30)/29 +1=870/29 +1=30 +1=31. So, n=900 is 31-eautiful.\n\nSo, in total, base31 is added four times: s=10,15,16,30.\n\nSo, four n's.\n\nBut earlier, when I was listing the counts, I thought base31 had three n's. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, in any case, for base31, the number of n's is four.\n\nBut we need a base with more than ten n's. So, we need a base where (b -1) has a lot of divisors, so that multiple s's can be formed.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of n's for base b is equal to the number of s's such that (b -1) divides s(s-1), and a and c are valid.\n\nTherefore, to get more than ten n's, we need (b -1) to have many divisors, preferably more than five, so that multiple s's can be formed.\n\nThe number of divisors of (b -1) is maximized when (b -1) is a number with many factors, such as a highly composite number.\n\nSo, the next highly composite numbers after 30 are 36, 48, 60, etc.\n\nSo, let's try b=37 (b-1=36), which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36.\n\nSo, 9 divisors.\n\nSo, for each divisor d, s=d or d+1.\n\nSo, possible s's:\n\nd=1: s=1 (invalid), s=2.\n\nd=2: s=2, s=3.\n\nd=3: s=3, s=4.\n\nd=4: s=4, s=5.\n\nd=6: s=6, s=7.\n\nd=9: s=9, s=10.\n\nd=12: s=12, s=13.\n\nd=18: s=18, s=19.\n\nd=36: s=36, s=37.\n\nSo, total s's to check: 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,12,13,18,19,36,37.\n\nNow, for each s, compute a and c.\n\nBut this will take time.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nb=37, b-1=36.\n\ns=2:\n\na=(4 -2)/36=2/36=1/18.

So, invalid.\n\nSo, for b=37, the valid s's are s=9 and s=36.

So, invalid.\n\nSo, for b=61, valid s's are s=16,21,60. So, three n's.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that for each divisor d of (b-1), s can be d or d+1, but only if a is an integer and c is valid.\n\nTherefore, the number of n's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where either s=d or s=d+1 results in a being integer and c valid.\n\nThus, to maximize the number of n's, we need a base where (b-1) is such that for many of its divisors d, both s=d and s=d+1 result in a being integer and c valid.\n\nBut this seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a base where (b-1) is a multiple of many small numbers, so that for many s's, (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of n's for base b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1), but only those where a and c are valid.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider that a must be less than b, and c must be less than b.\n\nGiven that a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1), and c = s - a.\n\nSo, c = s - (s^2 -s)/(b -1).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nc = [s*(b -1) - s^2 + s]/(b -1) = [s*b - s - s^2 + s]/(b -1) = [s*b - s^2]/(b -1) = s*(b - s)/(b -1)\n\nSo, c must be an integer, and 0 \u2264 c < b.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set s = d or s = d +1, and check if c is integer and less than b.\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a base b, the number of n's is equal to the number of ways to write (b -1) as a product of two numbers, which correspond to a and s - a.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation a + c = sqrt(a*b + c) as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\na^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c.\n\nRearranged:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in a. For a to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nDiscriminant D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c^2 - c) = 4c^2 -4b*c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c = b^2 -4b*c +4c.\n\nSo, D must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me denote D = k^2.\n\nSo,\n\nb^2 -4b*c +4c = k^2.\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation. Perhaps for each c, we can find b such that this holds.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set c = t, and express b in terms of t.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as:\n\nb^2 -4b*t +4t = k^2.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nb^2 -4b*t +4t -k^2=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in b:\n\nb^2 -4t*b + (4t -k^2)=0.\n\nThe discriminant for this quadratic must be a perfect square:\n\n(4t)^2 -4*1*(4t -k^2) = 16t^2 -16t +4k^2.\n\nWhich must be a perfect square.\n\nThis is getting too involved.\n\nPerhaps it's better to look for a base where b-1 is a factorial number, as factorial numbers have many divisors.\n\nLet me try b=721 (b-1=720).\n\n720 has many divisors: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,24,30,36,40,48,60,72,80,90,120,144,180,240,360,720.\n\nSo, 30 divisors.\n\nThus, possible s's:2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,24,30,31,36,40,48,60,72,80,90,120,144,180,240,360,720,721.\n\nNow, compute a and c for each s.\n\nThis is going to take a lot of time, but let me try a few.\n\ns=2:\n\na=(4 -2)/720=2/720=1/360.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals sqrt(81) which is 9.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let's break down what each condition implies.\n\nFirst, if a number n has exactly two digits in base b, then in base 10, n can be expressed as:\nn = a * b + c\nwhere a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, right? So a is at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Let's write that down:\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut n is a * b + c, so substituting:\na + c = sqrt(a * b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet's rearrange the equation:\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor or rearrange terms to find a relation between a, c, and b.\n\nLet me group terms:\na^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0\n\nI notice that a^2 - a*b can be written as a(a - b), and c^2 - c is c(c - 1). So:\n\na(a - b) + 2ac + c(c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe another approach: Let's express b in terms of a, c, and the equation.\n\nFrom the equation:\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\nLet's solve for b:\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\nb = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a\n\nSimplify numerator:\n(a^2 + 2ac + c^2) - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c\nSo:\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor this differently. Let me see:\n\nDivide each term by a:\nb = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer (base is integer), (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer. So a must divide (c^2 - c).\n\nBut a and c are digits in base b, so a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for integer solutions where a divides (c^2 - c). So (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, (c^2 - c) mod a = 0.\n\nAlternatively, c(c - 1) must be divisible by a.\n\nGiven that a is at least 1, and c is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAnother approach: Let me define k = a + c. Then, from the equation, k = sqrt(n), so n = k^2.\n\nBut n is also a*b + c, so:\nk^2 = a*b + c\n\nBut k = a + c, so substituting:\nk^2 = a*b + (k - a)\n\nBecause c = k - a.\n\nSo, k^2 = a*b + k - a\n\nLet me rearrange:\na*b = k^2 - k + a\n\nFactor a:\na*b = a + (k^2 - k)\nSo, a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k\n\nThus,\nb = 1 + (k^2 - k)/a\n\nSo, since b must be an integer, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by a. So, a must divide (k^2 - k) = k(k - 1).\n\nTherefore, for each k, possible a's are the divisors of k(k - 1).\n\nBut a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1, and since b is determined by a and k, we need to find a such that b is an integer greater than a.\n\nWait, so for each k, a can be any divisor of k(k - 1), but also, since a is a digit in base b, it must be less than b. But since b is 1 + (k^2 - k)/a, which depends on a, it's a bit of a loop.\n\nPerhaps it's better to fix k and find possible a's and then compute b.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\n1. For a given k, find all possible a's that divide k(k - 1).\n2. For each a, compute b = 1 + (k^2 - k)/a.\n3. Check if in this base b, a and c are valid digits. Since c = k - a, c must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAdditionally, since in base b, a must be a valid digit, which means a < b. Similarly, c must be a valid digit, so c < b.\n\nSo, for each k, I can iterate through possible a's that divide k(k - 1), compute b, and then check if a < b and c = k - a < b.\n\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Now, let's think about what k can be.\n\nSince n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which means:\nb \u2264 n < b^2\nBut n = k^2, so:\nb \u2264 k^2 < b^2\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\nsqrt(b) \u2264 k < b\n\nSo, for each base b, k must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k < b.\n\nBut since b is at least 2, and k is an integer, k can start from 2 upwards.\n\nWait, but we're looking for bases b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten. So, perhaps for each b, I need to find how many k's exist such that the above conditions are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parameterize in terms of k.\n\nLet me think: For each k, what possible bases b can make the number k^2 a two-digit number in base b, with digits a and c where a + c = k.\n\nSo, for each k, find the possible b's such that:\n- k^2 is a two-digit number in base b. That is, b \u2264 k^2 < b^2.\n- a and c = k - a are digits in base b, so a < b and c < b.\n\nBut since a is a digit, a must be at least 1 (since it's the leading digit). So a \u2265 1 and a \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSimilarly, c = k - a must be \u2265 0 and \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each k, let's find the possible a's (divisors of k(k - 1)), compute b, and check whether a and c are less than b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as for each k, find all bases b such that:\n\n1. b \u2264 k^2 < b^2\n2. a divides k(k - 1)\n3. a < b\n4. c = k - a < b\n\nSo, the steps I can take are:\n\nFor k from 2 upwards:\n\n- Compute the possible a's that divide k(k - 1)\n- For each a, compute b = 1 + (k^2 - k)/a\n- Check if b is an integer (which it will be because a divides k(k - 1))\n- Check if a < b\n- Check if c = k - a < b\n- Also, check if b \u2264 k^2 < b^2, but since b is computed as 1 + (k^2 - k)/a, perhaps this is automatically satisfied.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe have n = k^2, which must be a two-digit number in base b, so:\nb \u2264 n < b^2 \u2192 b \u2264 k^2 < b^2.\n\nBut from b = 1 + (k^2 - k)/a, let's see:\n\nSince a is a positive integer, and k(k - 1) is positive, then b is at least 1 + (k^2 - k)/(k(k - 1)) = 1 + (k^2 - k)/(k^2 - k) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, for each k, the minimal possible b is 2, and the maximal possible b is when a is as small as possible.\n\nWait, a can't be smaller than 1, but a must divide k(k - 1). So, the minimal a is 1, leading to the maximal b.\n\nWait, if a=1, then b = 1 + (k^2 - k)/1 = k^2 - k +1.\n\nBut then, for n = k^2 to be a two-digit number in base b, we need b \u2264 k^2 < b^2.\n\nSo, with a=1, b = k^2 -k +1.\n\nIs k^2 < (k^2 -k +1)^2?\n\nLet's compute (k^2 -k +1)^2:\n\n= (k^2 -k)^2 + 2(k^2 -k) +1\n\n= k^4 - 2k^3 +k^2 + 2k^2 -2k +1\n\n= k^4 - 2k^3 +3k^2 -2k +1\n\nCompare to k^2.\n\nSince for k \u22652, k^4 -2k^3 +3k^2 -2k +1 is much larger than k^2, so n =k^2 < b^2 is satisfied.\n\nBut we also need b \u2264 k^2.\n\nSo, b = k^2 -k +1 \u2264 k^2.\n\nWhich is true because k^2 -k +1 \u2264 k^2 for k \u22651.\n\nSo, for each k, a=1 gives a valid b=k^2 -k +1, but we need to check if c =k -a =k -1 <b.\n\nSince b =k^2 -k +1, and c =k -1.\n\nWe need k -1 <k^2 -k +1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\nk -1 <k^2 -k +1\n\u2192 0 <k^2 -2k +2\nWhich is always true because k^2 -2k +2 = (k-1)^2 +1 \u22651.\n\nSo, for a=1, it's always valid.\n\nSimilarly, for a=k(k -1), which is the maximum possible a, we have:\n\nb =1 + (k^2 -k)/(a) =1 + (k^2 -k)/(k(k -1)) =1 + (k(k -1))/(k(k -1)))=1 +1=2.\n\nSo, b=2.\n\nThen, c=k - a.\n\nBut a=k(k-1), so c= k -k(k -1)=k -k^2 +k=2k -k^2.\n\nWait, but c must be non-negative and less than b=2.\n\nSo, 2k -k^2 \u22650 \u2192k^2 -2k \u22640 \u2192k(k -2) \u22640 \u2192k \u22642.\n\nSince k is a positive integer \u22652, so k=2.\n\nSo, for k=2, a=2*(2-1)=2.\n\nBut in base b=2, a=2 is invalid because in base 2, digits can only be 0 or 1. So a=2 is invalid in base 2.\n\nWait, so when a=k(k-1), for k \u22653, a is too big for the base b=2.\n\nHence, for k \u22653, a=k(k-1) is not a valid digit in base b=2. So, for these cases, a=k(k-1) would not be a valid digit.\n\nTherefore, for each k, a can be any divisor of k(k -1), but a must satisfy a < b and c =k -a <b.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each k starting from 2 upwards, compute all possible a's that divide k(k -1).\n2. For each a, compute b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n3. Check if a < b and c =k -a <b.\n4. If both conditions are satisfied, then n=k^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n5. For each base b, count how many such n's exist (i.e., how many k's satisfy the above for that b).\n6. Find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems like a plan. Now, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, another approach: for each b, find all possible pairs (a, c) such that a + c = sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c.\n\nBut n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 -1.\n\nSo, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nSo, a + c is between sqrt(b) and b.\n\nBut a and c are digits, so a is between 1 and b-1, c between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, a + c can be from 1+0=1 to (b-1)+(b-1)=2b-2.\n\nBut since a + c must be equal to sqrt(n), which is between sqrt(b) and b.\n\nSo, a + c must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b.\n\nWait, but a + c is integer because a and c are integers.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible values of k = a + c are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b.\n\nFor each k in that range, we can find the possible a's such that a divides k(k -1), as before.\n\nBut perhaps another way: for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of k's such that there exists a divisor a of k(k -1) with a < b and c =k -a <b.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, count the number of k's such that:\n\n1. k is an integer, ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 k \u2264 b.\n2. There exists a divisor a of k(k -1) such that a < b and k -a <b.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b, and for each k, check if k(k -1) has a divisor a such that a <b and k -a <b.\n\nBut this seems a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, but I need to find the minimal b where the number of such k's exceeds 10. So, perhaps I can start testing bases starting from 2 upwards, and for each base, count the number of k's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\nFor each base b starting from 2:\n\n1. Determine the range of k: k must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 b, because n =k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b \u2264k^2 <b^2 \u2192 sqrt(b) \u2264k <b.\n\nBut since k must be integer, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(b -1). Wait, because k must be less than b, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nWait, no: n =k^2 must be less than b^2, so k^2 <b^2 \u2192k <b. Since k is integer, k can be up to b-1.\n\nBut also, n must be at least b, so k^2 \u2265b \u2192k \u2265sqrt(b).\n\nSo, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nBut for each k in that range, I need to check if there exists a divisor a of k(k-1) such that a <b and k -a <b.\n\nWait, but a must be a divisor of k(k -1), so a can be any of the divisors of k(k -1).\n\nBut for each a, compute b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a. Wait, no, that was from earlier. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given b, and k, the a is determined by the equation a = (k^2 - c)/b, but c =k -a. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think again about the equation:\n\nFrom the condition that a + c = k, and n = a*b + c =k^2.\n\nSo, a*b + c =k^2.\n\nBut c =k -a, so substituting:\n\na*b +k -a =k^2 \u2192a*(b -1) +k =k^2 \u2192a*(b -1) =k^2 -k \u2192a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)\n\nSince a must be an integer, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\nSo, for a given b and k, if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), then a is an integer.\n\nMoreover, a must be a digit in base b, so a <b.\n\nAlso, c =k -a must be a digit in base b, so c <b.\n\nSo, for each base b, and each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). Then check if a <b and c =k -a <b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, then n=k^2 is b-eautiful.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and a and c are digits in base b.\n\nThis seems manageable. So, to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, I can iterate b from 2 upwards, and for each b, count the number of k's in the specified range satisfying the conditions.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). Since a must be a positive integer less than b, and c =k -a must also be less than b.\n\nSo, for each b, I can iterate k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute a, then check a <b and c <b.\n\nAlternatively, since (k^2 -k) =k(k-1), so for a given b, (k(k-1)) must be divisible by (b -1). So, (b -1) must be a divisor of k(k-1).\n\nSo, for each b, (b -1) must divide k(k-1) for some k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nThus, the number of k's for a given b is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides k(k-1).\n\nBut (b -1) divides k(k-1). So, for each k, (b -1) must be a factor of k(k-1).\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, I can find the number of k's in the range where (b -1) divides k(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, since (k) and (k-1) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b -1) must divide the product k(k-1), but since k and k-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of factors from k and k-1.\n\nSo, perhaps (b -1) can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides k and d2 divides k-1, and d1 and d2 are coprime.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, since (k and k-1 are coprime), the factors of (b -1) must be entirely in k or entirely in k-1.\n\nWait, no. Because (b -1) can have factors that are in both k and k-1, but since k and k-1 are coprime, their greatest common divisor is 1.\n\nSo, the factors of (b -1) must be entirely in k or entirely in k-1. So, for each k, either:\n\n- (b -1) divides k, or\n- (b -1) divides (k -1)\n\nBut wait, since (b -1) divides k(k -1) and k and k-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of k-1.\n\nBut since they are coprime, (b -1) must be equal to d * e, where d divides k and e divides k-1, and d and e are coprime.\n\nBut this might not directly help. Maybe it's easier to think for each b, count the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of this, I can note that for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of multiples of factors of (b -1) in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to write a table for small b's and see how the count goes.\n\nLet me start with small b's.\n\nb=2:\nCompute k from ceil(sqrt(2))=2 to 1. Wait, 2-1=1, so k must be between 2 and 1, which is impossible. So, no k's. So, 0 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nb=3:\nk ranges from ceil(sqrt(3))=2 to 2 (since b-1=2). So, k=2.\n\nCheck if (b -1)=2 divides k(k -1)=2*1=2. Yes, 2 divides 2.\n\nCompute a=(k^2 -k)/(b -1) = (4 - 2)/2=1.\n\nCheck a <b: 1<3, yes.\n\nc=k -a=2-1=1 <3, yes.\n\nSo, n=2^2=4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nThus, b=3 has 1 b-eautiful number.\n\nb=4:\nk ranges from ceil(sqrt(4))=2 to 3.\n\nk=2:\nCheck if 3 divides 2*1=2. 3 does not divide 2.

I'm noticing that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is either 1 or 3. But the problem asks for a base where there are more than ten, so we need to go higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a different approach. Since for each b, the number of k's is tied to the number of divisors of (b -1). Because for each k, (b -1) must divide k(k -1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of k -1. But since they are coprime, (b -1) must be the product of a divisor of k and a divisor of k-1, which are coprime.\n\nAlternatively, since (b -1) must divide k(k -1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d \u2264k and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as follows:\n\nGiven that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be of the form d * e, where d divides k and e divides k -1, and d and e are coprime.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set e = (b -1)/d. Then, we can solve for k such that d divides k and e divides k -1.\n\nWhich implies:\n\nk \u22610 mod d\n\nk \u22611 mod e\n\nSince d and e are coprime (because (b -1) =d*e and d and e are coprime factors), by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo d*e.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of (b -1), where d and e=(b-1)/d are coprime, there exists a unique k modulo (b -1) that satisfies k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod e.\n\nBut since k must be in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], we can have multiple solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of such divisors d where the solution k is within the range.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d \u2264k and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of solutions.\n\nWait, since (b -1) must divide k(k -1), and k is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of multiples of the factors of (b -1) in that range.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I can think about the number of solutions for each b as the number of pairs (d, e) such that d*e =b -1, d divides k, e divides k -1, and k is in the range.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can instead note that for each divisor d of (b -1), there's a corresponding k.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach: For a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to saying that k \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1). But since k <b, the only possible k's are 0 or 1, but k must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWait, no. Because (b -1) divides k(k -1), but k can be larger than (b -1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to b -1.\n\nWait, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d \u2264k and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1, with k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to find a pattern or find a formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of ways to write (b -1) as a product of two coprime integers d and e, and then find k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod e, within the range.\n\nBut this seems complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nTake b=13, so b-1=12.\n\nThe divisors d of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each d, e=12/d.\n\nThen, for each d, solve k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod e.\n\nFor d=1, e=12:\n\nk \u22610 mod 1 \u2192 always true.\n\nk \u22611 mod 12 \u2192k=1,13,25,...\n\nBut k must be in [4,12]. So, k=13 is beyond 12. So, no solution.\n\nd=2, e=6:\n\nk \u22610 mod 2.\n\nk \u22611 mod 6.\n\nSolutions: k \u22614 mod 6.\n\nIn [4,12], k=4,10.\n\nCheck if these satisfy k \u22610 mod 2 and k \u22611 mod 6.\n\nk=4: 4 mod 6=4\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nk=10: 10 mod 6=4\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nSo, no solutions for d=2.\n\nd=3, e=4:\n\nk \u22610 mod 3.\n\nk \u22611 mod 4.\n\nFind k such that k \u22610 mod3 and k\u22611 mod4.\n\nSolutions: k=9, which is in [4,12].\n\nCheck: 9 mod3=0, 9 mod4=1. Yes.\n\nSo, k=9 is a solution.\n\nd=4, e=3:\n\nk \u22610 mod4.\n\nk \u22611 mod3.\n\nFind k in [4,12].\n\nSolutions: k=4, 10.\n\nCheck:\n\nk=4: 4 mod3=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nk=10:10 mod3=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, k=4 and 10.\n\nBut wait, for d=4 and e=3, we have k=4 and k=10.\n\nBut earlier, when d=3 and e=4, we found k=9.\n\nSo, in total, for b=13, we have k=4,9,10.\n\nBut earlier, when I checked b=13, I found k=4,9,12.\n\nWait, discrepancy here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, for d=4, e=3, solving k\u22610 mod4 and k\u22611 mod3.\n\nThe solutions are k \u22614 mod12 and k\u226110 mod12.\n\nSo, in [4,12], k=4 and 10.\n\nBut when I checked earlier for b=13, k=10 didn't work because a was not integer.\n\nWait, let me recheck.\n\nFor b=13, k=10:\n\nCheck if 12 divides 10*9=90. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5, which is not integer. So, a is not integer. So, k=10 is invalid.\n\nSo, even though k=10 satisfies the congruence, it doesn't lead to an integer a. So, it's invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps not all solutions to the congruence give valid a's.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of k's is not directly equal to the number of solutions to the congruence, but only those where (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1).\n\nWait, but (b -1) divides k(k -1), which is exactly what we're checking.\n\nSo, for b=13, k=4,9,10,12.\n\nWait, but when I checked earlier, k=10 didn't work because a was not integer.\n\nWait, that suggests that not all k's that satisfy (b -1) divides k(k -1) lead to integer a's. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1), which is exactly what we're checking.\n\nSo, for b=13, k=4: (16 -4)=12, which is divisible by 12. So, a=1.\n\nk=9: (81 -9)=72, which is divisible by 12. a=6.\n\nk=10: (100 -10)=90, which is divisible by 12? 90/12=7.5, which is not integer. Wait, but earlier I thought (b -1)=12 divides k(k -1)=90. But 12 does not divide 90 because 90/12=7.5.\n\nWait, but 12 divides 90? No, because 12*7=84, 12*8=96. So, 90 is not a multiple of 12.\n\nWait, so why did I earlier think that (b -1)=12 divides k(k -1)=90? It doesn't. So, there must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, when b=13, k=10:\n\nCheck if 12 divides 10*9=90. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5, which is not integer. So, 12 does not divide 90. So, k=10 is invalid.\n\nThus, for b=13, only k=4 and 9 are valid. So, n=16 and 81 are 13-eautiful. Wait, but earlier I thought k=12 was valid.\n\nWait, for k=12:\n\nCheck if 12 divides 12*11=132. Yes.\n\nCompute a=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11.\n\nCheck a <13: yes.\n\nc=12 -11=1 <13: yes.\n\nSo, n=144 is 13-eautiful.\n\nThus, for b=13, k=4,9,12 are valid.\n\nBut when I used the congruence approach, I found k=4,9,10, but k=10 is invalid because a is not integer. So, the congruence approach includes some invalid k's.\n\nThus, perhaps the number of valid k's is less than or equal to the number of solutions to the congruence.\n\nThis complicates things because I can't directly use the number of solutions to the congruence.\n\nSo, perhaps the only way is to proceed step by step for each b and count the valid k's.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking back, I noticed that for b=7, there were 3 b-eautiful numbers. Similarly, for b=11,13,15,19, there were 3 each. For other b's, only 1.\n\nSo, perhaps when (b -1) has multiple factors, the number of k's increases.\n\nWait, for b=7, b-1=6, which has factors 1,2,3,6.\n\nSimilarly, for b=11, b-1=10, factors 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor b=13, b-1=12, factors 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of k's increases as the number of factors of (b -1) increases.\n\nThus, to get more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need a b where (b -1) has many factors, leading to many k's.\n\nBut how many?\n\nWait, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can have a k. But not all k's are valid because a must be less than b and c must be less than b.\n\nBut perhaps the number of k's is roughly equal to the number of divisors of (b -1).\n\nSo, to get more than ten k's, (b -1) must have more than ten divisors. Because each divisor d could correspond to a k.\n\nWait, but in reality, for each divisor d, there's a corresponding k, but not all k's are in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nSo, perhaps if (b -1) has many small factors, the number of k's increases.\n\nSo, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers, (b -1) must be a number with many small factors, so that multiple k's fall into the required range.\n\nThe smallest number with more than ten divisors is 24, which has 8 divisors. Wait, no, 12 has 6 divisors, 16 has 5, 18 has 6, 20 has 6, 24 has 8, 28 has 6, 30 has 8, 36 has 9, 40 has 8, 42 has 8, 48 has 10, 60 has 12.\n\nAh, 48 has 10 divisors, 60 has 12.\n\nSo, perhaps when (b -1) is 60, which has 12 divisors, leading to 12 k's.\n\nBut wait, earlier, for b=13, (b-1)=12 had 6 divisors, but only 3 k's were valid. So, perhaps the number of k's is about half the number of divisors.\n\nThus, to get more than ten k's, (b -1) must have more than 20 divisors, perhaps?\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the number of k's in terms of the number of divisors of (b -1).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I can instead note that the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d \u2264k and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1, with k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set k =d + m*(b -1), but since k must be less than b, m=0, so k=d.\n\nBut k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nSo, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264d \u2264b -1.\n\nBut this is only considering d as a divisor, not e=(b -1)/d.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) where d \u2265ceil(sqrt(b)) and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that this manual approach is too time-consuming and think of a different strategy.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given k, the number of bases b where k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of divisors of k(k -1). Because for each divisor a of k(k -1), b is determined as 1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nBut each such b must satisfy b >a and c=k -a <b.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of bases b where k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a <b and k -a <b.\n\nBut this seems like a different angle.\n\nSo, for each k, the number of bases b where k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of a's that divide k(k -1), and satisfy a <b and k -a <b.\n\nBut b is 1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nSo, substituting b:\n\na <1 + (k^2 -k)/a \u2192 a^2 <k^2 -k +a \u2192a^2 -a -k^2 +k <0.\n\nSimilarly, k -a <1 + (k^2 -k)/a \u2192(k -a)*a <k^2 -k +a \u2192k a -a^2 <k^2 -k +a \u2192k a -a^2 -k^2 +k -a <0.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of a's that divide k(k -1) and satisfy a < (k^2 -k)/a +1 and k -a < (k^2 -k)/a +1.\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to find a formula, I can note that for each k, the number of bases b where k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a <b and k -a <b, where b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nThus, for each k, the number of such a's is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a < (k^2 -k)/a +1 and k -a < (k^2 -k)/a +1.\n\nBut this is still complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for a given k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a < sqrt(k^2 -k) +1.\n\nBecause b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a must be greater than a, so:\n\n1 + (k^2 -k)/a >a \u2192(k^2 -k)/a >a -1 \u2192k^2 -k >a(a -1).\n\nBut this is still not straightforward.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should try to find a b where (b -1) has many factors, leading to many k's.\n\nLooking back, when b=60, b-1=59, which is prime. So, only two divisors, leading to 1 or 2 k's.\n\nWait, but 59 is prime, so only two divisors:1 and59.\n\nBut k must be in [ceil(sqrt(60))=8,59].\n\nSo, for d=1, e=59:\n\nk \u22610 mod1 (always true).\n\nk\u22611 mod59.\n\nSo, k=1,60,... But k must be \u22658 and \u226459. So, k=60 is beyond. So, no solution.\n\nFor d=59, e=1:\n\nk\u22610 mod59.\n\nk\u22611 mod1 (always true).\n\nSo, k=59.\n\nCheck if 59 is in [8,59]. Yes.\n\nCompute a=(59^2 -59)/59= (3481 -59)/59=3422/59=58.\n\nCheck a <60: yes.\n\nc=59 -58=1 <60: yes.\n\nSo, n=59^2=3481 is 60-eautiful.\n\nThus, b=60 has 1 b-eautiful number.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a b where (b -1) is a highly composite number, like 24, 36, 60, etc.\n\nLet's try b=37, so b-1=36.\n\n36 has divisors:1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36.\n\nFor each d in divisors, solve k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod (36/d).\n\nLet's go through each d:\n\nd=1, e=36:\n\nk\u22610 mod1 \u2192 always true.\n\nk\u22611 mod36 \u2192k=1,37,73,...

I'm not finding a base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been missing something. Let me go back to the original equation:\n\nk = a + c\n\nn = a*b + c =k^2\n\nSo, a*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nExpanding:\n\na*b + c =a^2 + 2ac + c^2\n\nRearranged:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 -a*b -c =0\n\nThis can be written as:\n\na^2 -a*b + 2ac + c^2 -c =0\n\nAlternatively, grouping terms:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 =a*b +c\n\nWhich is:\n\n(a + c)^2 =a*b +c\n\nBut since k =a +c, this is k^2 =a*b +c.\n\nBut c =k -a, so:\n\nk^2 =a*b +k -a\n\nWhich rearranged to:\n\na*b =k^2 -k +a\n\nThen:\n\nb = (k^2 -k +a)/a = (k^2 -k)/a +1\n\nSo, b must be an integer, so (k^2 -k) must be divisible by a.\n\nThus, a must be a divisor of (k^2 -k).\n\nBut a is a digit in base b, so a <b.\n\nAlso, c =k -a must be a digit in base b, so c <b.\n\nBut since b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a <b, we have:\n\na <1 + (k^2 -k)/a \u2192a^2 <k^2 -k +a \u2192a^2 -a -k^2 +k <0.\n\nWhich is a quadratic in a:\n\na^2 -a - (k^2 -k) <0.\n\nThe roots of the equation a^2 -a - (k^2 -k)=0 are:\n\na = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4(k^2 -k))]/2.\n\nSince a must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\na = [1 + sqrt(4k^2 -4k +1)]/2 = [1 + (2k -1)]/2 =k.\n\nSo, the inequality a^2 -a -k^2 +k <0 holds when a <k.\n\nThus, a must be less than k.\n\nBut a is a digit, so a <b.\n\nBut since b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a <k, we have:\n\nb =1 + (k^2 -k)/a >1 + (k^2 -k)/(k -1) =1 + [k(k -1)]/(k -1) =1 +k.\n\nThus, b >k +1.\n\nBut since k <b, from earlier (as n=k^2 <b^2 \u2192k <b), this is consistent.\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of (k^2 -k) less than k.\n\nThus, for each k, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of (k^2 -k) less than k.\n\nEach such a gives a base b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nMoreover, c =k -a must be less than b.\n\nBut since b =1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a <k, let's see:\n\nc =k -a.\n\nWe need c <b \u2192k -a <1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nMultiply both sides by a (positive):\n\na(k -a) <a +k^2 -k.\n\nExpand left side:\n\nak -a^2 <a +k^2 -k.\n\nRearrange:\n\nak -a^2 -a <k^2 -k.\n\nFactor left side:\n\na(k -a -1) <k^2 -k.\n\nBut since a <k, and k \u22652, the left side is positive.\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k -1) less than k.\n\nBecause k^2 -k =k(k -1).\n\nThus, for each k, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k -1) less than k.\n\nEach such a gives a base b=1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nMoreover, c =k -a must be less than b.\n\nBut since b=1 + (k(k -1))/a, and a <k, let's see:\n\nc =k -a.\n\nWe need c <b \u2192k -a <1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na(k -a) <a +k(k -1).\n\nExpand:\n\nak -a^2 <a +k^2 -k.\n\nRearrange:\n\nak -a^2 -a <k^2 -k.\n\nFactor left side:\n\na(k -a -1) <k^2 -k.\n\nBut this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) less than k, such that c =k -a <b.\n\nBut since b=1 + (k(k -1))/a, and a <k, c =k -a must be less than 1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) less than k, such that a divides k(k -1) and c =k -a <1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nBut this is too involved.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should consider that the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers is 210, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: For a base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's such that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and a=(k^2 -k)/(b -1) is an integer less than b, and c=k -a is less than b.\n\nThus, the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and a=(k^2 -k)/(b -1) <b, and c=k -a <b.\n\nBut this is still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d \u2264k and (b -1)/d \u2264k -1, for some k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should conclude that the minimal b is 210, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's 121, but I found only 7 k's.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

So, 2 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that for each k, the number of bases b where k^2 is b-eautiful is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a <b and c=k -a <b, where b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nThus, for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of a's dividing k(k -1) with a <b and c <b.\n\nBut since b=1 + (k^2 -k)/a, and a <k (from earlier), let's see:\n\nc =k -a.\n\nWe need c <b \u2192k -a <1 + (k^2 -k)/a.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na(k -a) <a +k^2 -k.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nak -a^2 <a +k^2 -k.\n\nRearranged:\n\nak -a^2 -a <k^2 -k.\n\nFactor left side:\n\na(k -a -1) <k^2 -k.\n\nBut since a <k, and k \u22652, this inequality may hold.\n\nBut this doesn't directly help.\n\nGiven the time I've spent without finding a base with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I think the minimal such b is 210, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's 121, but I only found 7 k's there.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) such that a <k, and c=k -a <b=1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nBut since a <k, c=k -a \u22651.\n\nAnd b=1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nSo, c <b \u2192k -a <1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na(k -a) <a +k(k -1).\n\nWhich is:\n\nak -a^2 <a +k^2 -k.\n\nRearranged:\n\nak -a^2 -a <k^2 -k.\n\nFactor left side:\n\na(k -a -1) <k^2 -k.\n\nBut since a <k, and k \u22652, the left side is positive.\n\nThus, for each a dividing k(k -1) with a <k, we can check if a(k -a -1) <k^2 -k.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the problem asks for the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, and I haven't found any up to b=121, I'll assume that the minimal b is 210.\n\nBut I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 121, but I only found 7 k's there.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the number of b-eautiful numbers increases as (b -1) has more factors. So, for b-1=120, which has many factors, but I only found 7 k's. Maybe for b-1=60, which has 12 factors, but I only found 3 k's.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b is 210, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each k, the number of bases b is equal to the number of divisors a of k(k -1) less than k, such that a divides k(k -1) and c=k -a <b=1 + (k(k -1))/a.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. I'll assume that the minimal b is 210, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's 121, but I only found 7 k's there.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting for b=121. Let me recount.\n\nFor b=121, the valid k's are:\n\nFrom d=8, e=15: k=16.\n\nFrom d=10, e=12: k=25.\n\nFrom d=15, e=8: k=25.\n\nFrom d=20, e=6: k=25,81,105.\n\nFrom d=40, e=3: k=40.\n\nFrom d=60, e=2: no.\n\nFrom d=120, e=1: k=120.\n\nSo, unique k's are:16,25,40,61,81,105,120.\n\nThat's 7 k's.\n\nThus, b=121 has 7 b-eautiful numbers.\n\nTo get more than ten, I need to find a b where (b -1) has more than ten factors, leading to more k's.\n\nThe smallest number with more than ten factors is 60 (12 factors), but when b=61, I found only 3 k's.\n\nWait, perhaps b=121 is the minimal with 7 k's, but I need more than ten. So, I need to find a b where (b -1) has many factors.\n\nThe next highly composite number after 120 is 180.\n\nLet me try b=181, b-1=180.\n\nDivisors of 180:1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,12,15,18,20,30,36,45,60,90,180.\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1, e=180:\n\nk\u22610 mod1.\n\nk\u22611 mod180.\n\nk=1,181,...

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called \"b-eautiful\" numbers. Hmm, let me try to understand what that means. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nWait, okay, let me break that down. So, if n is a two-digit number in base b, that means in base 10, n is equal to a times b plus c, where a and c are the two digits. But in base b, each digit has to be less than b, right? So a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c < b. But since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So a is at least 1 and less than b, and c can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of these two digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. But n is also equal to a*b + c. So putting that together, sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. \n\nLet me write that equation down: sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get a*b + c = (a + c)^2. Expanding the right side, that becomes a^2 + 2ac + c^2. So, moving everything to one side, we have a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me rearrange it: a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0. Hmm, perhaps factor some terms. Let's see, a^2 - a*b + 2ac + c^2 - c = 0. Maybe group terms with a and c. \n\nAlternatively, maybe write it as a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0. That's a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for each base b, we can consider a as a variable, and c as another variable, but both are digits in base b, so a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.\n\nThe problem asks for the least integer b \u2265 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, for each base b, we need to find all possible pairs (a, c) that satisfy the equation a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0, where a and c are digits in base b, and then count how many such n exist for each b. Once we find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten, that's our answer.\n\nHmm, okay. So perhaps for each b, we can iterate through possible c values and solve for a, checking if a is an integer within the allowed range.\n\nLet me consider the quadratic equation in a:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, the solutions for a are:\n\na = [ -(2c - b) \u00b1 sqrt( (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c) ) ] / 2\n\nSimplify the discriminant D:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c)\n= 4c^2 -4bc + b^2 -4c^2 +4c\n= (-4bc + b^2 +4c)\n= b^2 -4bc +4c\n= b^2 -4c(b -1)\n\nSo, D = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1).\n\nFor a to be an integer, D must be a perfect square. Let's denote D = k\u00b2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 -4c(b -1) = k\u00b2.\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n4c(b -1) = b\u00b2 - k\u00b2.\n\nThen, 4c = (b\u00b2 - k\u00b2)/(b -1).\n\nHmm, that might be useful. Let me factor the numerator:\n\nb\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = (b -k)(b +k).\n\nSo, 4c = (b -k)(b +k)/(b -1).\n\nBut since 4c must be an integer, the right-hand side must be an integer. So, (b -k)(b +k) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express (b -k)(b +k) as (b\u00b2 - k\u00b2), so we have 4c = (b\u00b2 - k\u00b2)/(b -1).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(b\u00b2 - k\u00b2)/(b -1) = [ (b -1)(b +1) + (1 - k\u00b2) ] / (b -1). Wait, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perform polynomial division:\n\nDivide b\u00b2 -k\u00b2 by b -1.\n\nLet me think: when you divide b\u00b2 by b -1, the first term is b, since b*(b -1) = b\u00b2 -b. Then, subtract that from b\u00b2 -k\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 -k\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 -b) = b -k\u00b2.\n\nNow, divide b -k\u00b2 by b -1. The next term is 1, since 1*(b -1) = b -1. Subtract that:\n\n(b -k\u00b2) - (b -1) = 1 -k\u00b2.\n\nSo, the division gives:\n\nb\u00b2 -k\u00b2 = (b -1)(b +1) + (1 -k\u00b2).\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, note that (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2) = (b -k)(b +k). So, for (b -1) to divide this product, either (b -1) divides (b -k) or (b -1) divides (b +k), or (b -1) shares a common factor with both.\n\nBut since b and k are positive integers, and k < b (since sqrt(n) = a + c, and n = ab + c. Let's see, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is at most (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. So sqrt(n) is at most sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) < b. So, a + c = sqrt(n) < b. Since a is at least 1, c can be up to b-1. So, a + c can be up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b -2. Wait, but sqrt(n) is less than b, so a + c must be less than b. So, a + c < b. Hmm, so k = a + c must be less than b.\n\nSo, k < b. So, k can be from 1 to b-1.\n\nWait, but in the equation, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1). So, k\u00b2 = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1). Let me see:\n\nSince k\u00b2 must be positive, so b\u00b2 -4c(b -1) >0.\n\nWhich implies that 4c(b -1) < b\u00b2.\n\nSo, c < b\u00b2/(4(b-1)).\n\nHmm, since c is an integer between 0 and b-1, so c can only be up to floor( (b\u00b2 -1)/(4(b-1)) ).\n\nWait, let me compute that. Let me compute (b\u00b2)/(4(b-1)):\n\n= (b\u00b2) / (4b -4)\n= [b(b -4 +4)] / (4b -4)\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Let me compute for some small b to see.\n\nFor example, when b=2:\n\n(b\u00b2)/(4(b-1)) = 4/(4*1)=1. So c <1, but c is at least 0, so c=0.\n\nBut for b=2, let's see if any solutions exist.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let's think about the equation:\n\n4c = (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2)/(b -1)\n\nSo, 4c must be an integer, so (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2) must be divisible by (b -1). So, (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2) mod (b-1) must be zero.\n\nBut b\u00b2 mod (b -1): Since b \u22611 mod (b-1), so b\u00b2 \u22611\u00b2=1 mod (b-1). Similarly, k\u00b2 mod (b-1) is just k\u00b2 mod (b-1). So,\n\n(b\u00b2 -k\u00b2) mod (b-1) = (1 -k\u00b2) mod (b-1). For this to be zero, we must have 1 -k\u00b2 \u22610 mod (b-1), which implies that k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nSo, k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1). That is, k \u2261\u00b11 mod (b-1). But since k is less than b, as we established earlier, because a + c =k <b.\n\nTherefore, k must be either 1 or b-2, because 1 and -1 mod (b-1) are the same as 1 and b-2, respectively.\n\nWait, let me think: if k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1), then k \u22611 or -1 mod (b-1). Since k is less than b, the possible k values are 1 and b-1. But wait, b-1 is equal to k, but earlier we saw that k must be less than b, so k can be 1 or b-1. But wait, if k =b-1, then since a +c =k <b, k can be up to b-1, but in that case, a +c =b-1, which is allowed because a and c are digits in base b, so their sum can be up to 2b-2, but in our case, since n is a two-digit number, and n =ab +c, and sqrt(n)=a +c, which is less than b. So, k must be less than b, so k can be up to b-1.\n\nBut if k =b-1, then a +c =b-1, which is possible.\n\nBut wait, if k=1, then a +c=1. Since a is at least 1, that would mean a=1 and c=0. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, let me test this for b=2. For b=2, possible k is 1 or 1 (since b-1=1). So, k=1.\n\nThen, 4c = (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2)/(b-1) = (4 -1)/(1) =3. So, 4c=3, which implies c=3/4. But c must be an integer between 0 and 1 (since b=2). So, no solution for c here. So, for b=2, no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's go back to the equation:\n\n4c = (b\u00b2 -k\u00b2)/(b -1)\n\nFor b=2, (4 -k\u00b2)/(1) =4 -k\u00b2. So, 4c =4 -k\u00b2. Since k can be 1, then 4c=4-1=3. So, c=3/4, which is not an integer. So, no solution. So, b=2 has no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for b=3, let's see. Possible k are 1 and 2, since 2 is b-1=2.\n\nFirst, k=1:\n\n4c=(9 -1)/(2)=8/2=4. So, 4c=4 => c=1. So c=1.\n\nThen, a is given by the quadratic equation: a^2 + (2c -b)a + (c^2 -c)=0.\n\nPlugging in b=3, c=1:\n\na\u00b2 + (2*1 -3)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 -a +0=0 \u2192 a(a -1)=0. So, a=0 or a=1. But a must be at least 1, so a=1.\n\nSo, n = a*b +c =1*3 +1=4. Check if 1+1=2=sqrt(4). Yes, correct. So, n=4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nNow, check k=2 for b=3:\n\n4c=(9 -4)/(2)=5/2=2.5. Not integer. So, c=2.5/4=0.625, which is not integer. So, no solution for k=2.\n\nThus, for b=3, there's only one b-eautiful number: 4.\n\nMoving on to b=4. Possible k are 1 and 3.\n\nFirst, k=1:\n\n4c=(16 -1)/(3)=15/3=5. So, 4c=5 \u2192 c=5/4. Not integer.\n\nk=3:\n\n4c=(16 -9)/(3)=7/3\u22482.333. Not integer. So, no solutions for b=4.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 4c=(b\u00b2 -k\u00b2)/(b -1). For b=4, k=3:\n\n(16 -9)/(3)=7/3. Not integer. So, no solution.\n\nSimilarly, k=1: (16 -1)/(3)=15/3=5. 4c=5 \u2192 c=1.25. Not integer.\n\nSo, b=4 has no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nHmm, maybe b=5.\n\nPossible k=1 and 4.\n\nk=1:\n\n4c=(25 -1)/(4)=24/4=6. So, c=6/4=1.5. Not integer.\n\nk=4:\n\n4c=(25 -16)/(4)=9/4=2.25. Not integer.\n\nNo solutions for b=5.\n\nWait, maybe I should try k=2 or other values, but earlier reasoning said k must be 1 or b-1 because k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1). Wait, but perhaps that's not the case. Maybe there are other k that satisfy k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1). For example, if b-1 is composite, then there could be other k's where k\u00b2 \u22611 mod (b-1). So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was incomplete.\n\nWait, for example, if b-1=6, then possible k could be 1,5,7, etc., but since k <b=7, possible k=1,5. So, for b=7, k could be 1 or 6. Let me check that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that for each modulus m =b-1, the solutions to k\u00b2 \u22611 mod m are k \u2261\u00b11 mod m. But since k is less than b, which is m+1, the possible k's are 1 and m, which is b-1.\n\nWait, but for example, when m=5, which is b=6, then k\u00b2 \u22611 mod 5. The solutions are k \u22611 or 4 mod5. So, for b=6, possible k are 1 and 4, because 4=5-1. So, for b=6, m=5, so k=1 and 4.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial conclusion was correct, that k must be 1 or b-1.\n\nWait, so in that case, for each b, the possible k values are 1 and b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, I can compute c for k=1 and k=b-1, and see if c is integer and within the allowed range.\n\nSo, let's formalize this approach.\n\nFor each base b \u22652:\n\n1. Compute for k=1:\n\n   4c = (b\u00b2 -1\u00b2)/(b -1) = (b\u00b2 -1)/(b -1) = (b -1)(b +1)/(b -1) = b +1.\n\n   So, 4c = b +1 \u2192 c = (b +1)/4.\n\n   For c to be integer, (b +1) must be divisible by 4. So, b \u22613 mod4.\n\n   So, when b \u22613 mod4, c=(b+1)/4 is integer.\n\n   Then, check if c is within 0 \u2264c <b.\n\n   Since b \u22652, and c=(b+1)/4, let's see for b=3: c=(4)/4=1, which is okay. For b=7: c=(8)/4=2, which is okay. For b=11: c=12/4=3, which is okay. So, yes, c is within range.\n\n   Then, for each such b, we can compute a from the quadratic equation.\n\n   The quadratic equation for a is:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2c -b)a + (c\u00b2 -c) =0.\n\n   Let's plug in c=(b+1)/4.\n\n   So, a\u00b2 + [2*(b+1)/4 - b]a + [ ((b+1)/4)^2 - (b+1)/4 ] =0.\n\n   Simplify:\n\n   Let's compute each coefficient:\n\n   2c = 2*(b+1)/4 = (b+1)/2.\n\n   So, (2c -b) = (b+1)/2 -b = (b+1 -2b)/2 = (-b +1)/2.\n\n   Similarly, c\u00b2 = (b+1)^2 /16.\n\n   So, c\u00b2 -c = (b\u00b2 +2b +1)/16 - (b+1)/4.\n\n   Let me compute that:\n\n   = (b\u00b2 +2b +1)/16 - (4b +4)/16\n   = [b\u00b2 +2b +1 -4b -4]/16\n   = [b\u00b2 -2b -3]/16.\n\n   So, the quadratic equation becomes:\n\n   a\u00b2 + [ (-b +1)/2 ] a + (b\u00b2 -2b -3)/16 =0.\n\n   Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:\n\n   16a\u00b2 + 8(-b +1)a + (b\u00b2 -2b -3) =0.\n\n   Let me write this as:\n\n   16a\u00b2 + (-8b +8)a + (b\u00b2 -2b -3) =0.\n\n   Now, let's compute the discriminant of this quadratic equation in a:\n\n   D = [(-8b +8)]^2 -4*16*(b\u00b2 -2b -3).\n\n   Compute term by term:\n\n   (-8b +8)^2 = 64b\u00b2 - 128b +64.\n\n   4*16*(b\u00b2 -2b -3) =64*(b\u00b2 -2b -3) =64b\u00b2 -128b -192.\n\n   So, D = (64b\u00b2 -128b +64) - (64b\u00b2 -128b -192) =64b\u00b2 -128b +64 -64b\u00b2 +128b +192.\n\n   Simplify:\n\n   64b\u00b2 -64b\u00b2 =0.\n\n   -128b +128b=0.\n\n   64 +192=256.\n\n   So, D=256.\n\n   So, sqrt(D)=16.\n\n   Therefore, the solutions are:\n\n   a = [8b -8 \u00b116]/(2*16) = [8b -8 \u00b116]/32.\n\n   Simplify numerator:\n\n   For the positive case: 8b -8 +16=8b +8=8(b +1).\n\n   So, a=8(b +1)/32 = (b +1)/4.\n\n   For the negative case:8b -8 -16=8b -24=8(b -3).\n\n   So, a=8(b -3)/32 = (b -3)/4.\n\n   Now, a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.\n\n   So, let's check both possibilities.\n\n   First, a=(b +1)/4.\n\n   For a to be integer, since b \u22613 mod4, let's write b=4k +3 for some integer k \u22650.\n\n   So, b=4k+3.\n\n   Then, a=(4k+3 +1)/4=(4k+4)/4=k+1.\n\n   So, a=k+1.\n\n   Now, a must be \u2264b-1=4k+2.\n\n   Since k+1 \u22644k+2 \u2192 1 \u22643k +1 \u2192 0 \u22643k \u2192k \u22650, which is always true.\n\n   Also, a must be \u22651, which is true since k \u22650 \u2192 a \u22651.\n\n   So, a=k+1 is valid.\n\n   Now, let's check the other solution: a=(b -3)/4.\n\n   Since b=4k+3, then a=(4k+3 -3)/4=4k/4=k.\n\n   So, a=k.\n\n   Now, a must be \u22651, so k\u22651.\n\n   Also, a must be \u2264b-1=4k+2.\n\n   Since k \u22644k+2 \u2192 0 \u22643k +2 \u2192 true for k \u22650.\n\n   So, both solutions are possible, but a must be a positive integer, so k must be at least 1 for the second solution.\n\n   Wait, but let's check if both solutions are valid.\n\n   For each solution, we need to check if a and c are valid digits in base b, i.e., a \u2208 [1, b-1], c \u2208 [0, b-1].\n\n   So, for the first solution, a=(b +1)/4, which for b=4k+3 is a=k+1, which is \u2264b-1=4k+2.\n\n   For example, when b=3 (k=0), a=1, which is valid.\n\n   When b=7 (k=1), a=2, which is valid.\n\n   For the second solution, a=k, which for b=4k+3, a=k.\n\n   So, when k=1, b=7, a=1.\n\n   When k=2, b=11, a=2.\n\n   So, both are valid as long as a \u2264b-1.\n\n   Now, let's compute c for each case.\n\n   For the first solution, c=(b +1)/4.\n\n   For the second solution, c=(b +1)/4 as well, because we're still using k=1.\n\n   Wait, no, in the second case, we're using the same c as in the first case because we're still solving for k=1. Wait, no, in the second solution, we're using the same c value as in the first case, because both solutions come from the same k=1 case.\n\n   Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\n   Wait, for each k, we have two possible a's, but the same c. So, for each k, there might be two possible a's, leading to two possible n's.\n\n   But wait, let's take an example. For b=7, which is 4*1 +3=7.\n\n   So, k=1.\n\n   First solution: a=(7 +1)/4=2.\n\n   c=(7 +1)/4=2.\n\n   So, a=2, c=2.\n\n   Then, n = a*b +c=2*7 +2=16.\n\n   Check: a +c=4, sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\n   Second solution: a=(7 -3)/4=1.\n\n   c=2, same as before.\n\n   So, a=1, c=2.\n\n   Then, n=1*7 +2=9.\n\n   Check: a +c=3, sqrt(9)=3. Correct.\n\n   So, for b=7, we have two solutions: n=9 and n=16.\n\n   So, that's two b-eautiful numbers for b=7.\n\n   Similarly, for b=11 (k=2):\n\n   First solution: a=(11 +1)/4=3.\n\n   c=(11 +1)/4=3.\n\n   n=3*11 +3=36. sqrt(36)=6, a +c=6. Correct.\n\n   Second solution: a=(11 -3)/4=2.\n\n   c=3.\n\n   n=2*11 +3=25. sqrt(25)=5, a +c=5. Correct.\n\n   So, two solutions for b=11.\n\n   Wait, but for b=3, k=0:\n\n   a=(3 +1)/4=1.\n\n   c=1.\n\n   n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, a +c=2. Correct.\n\n   Second solution: a=(3 -3)/4=0. But a must be \u22651, so this solution is invalid. So, only one solution for b=3.\n\n   So, for b=3, only one solution. For b=7 and b=11, two solutions each.\n\n   Now, let's check k=b-1. So, for each b, compute 4c=(b\u00b2 - (b-1)^2)/(b -1).\n\n   Compute (b\u00b2 - (b-1)^2)=b\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 -2b +1)=2b -1.\n\n   So, 4c=(2b -1)/(b -1).\n\n   Let me compute that.\n\n   4c=(2b -1)/(b -1).\n\n   Let's perform the division:\n\n   2b -1 = 2*(b -1) +1.\n\n   So, (2b -1)/(b -1) = 2 + 1/(b -1).\n\n   So, 4c=2 + 1/(b -1).\n\n   Therefore, 4c must be an integer, so 1/(b -1) must be an integer. But 1/(b -1) is integer only when b -1=1, i.e., b=2.\n\n   So, for b=2:\n\n   4c=(4 -1)/(1)=3. So, c=3/4, which is not integer. So, no solution for k=b-1 except when b=2, which doesn't give an integer c.\n\n   Therefore, for k=b-1, only possible when b=2, which doesn't yield a valid c. So, no solutions for k=b-1 except when b=2, which doesn't work. So, in general, for b\u22653, only k=1 gives possible solutions.\n\n   Wait, but earlier for b=7, we had two solutions when k=1. So, perhaps for each b\u22613 mod4, we have two solutions when k=1, except when the second solution a=(b-3)/4 is less than 1, which only happens when b=3.\n\n   So, for b=3, only one solution. For b=7, two solutions. For b=11, two solutions, and so on.\n\n   Now, let's consider the other case where k=1 and b\u22613 mod4, giving us c=(b+1)/4, and two possible a's when a=(b+1)/4 and a=(b-3)/4, provided a is \u22651.\n\n   So, for each b\u22613 mod4 and b\u22657, we get two b-eautiful numbers. For b=3, only one.\n\n   Now, let's check for other k values beyond 1 and b-1, but earlier I thought that only k=1 and k=b-1 satisfy k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1). But perhaps that's not the case when b-1 is composite.\n\n   Wait, let me test for b=5, which is 4+1, so b-1=4. So, possible k where k\u00b2\u22611 mod4 are k=1 and k=3, because 1\u00b2=1\u22611 mod4 and 3\u00b2=9\u22611 mod4.\n\n   So, for b=5, possible k=1 and 3.\n\n   Let's compute for k=1:\n\n   4c=(25 -1)/(4)=24/4=6 \u2192 c=6/4=1.5, not integer.\n\n   For k=3:\n\n   4c=(25 -9)/(4)=16/4=4 \u2192 c=1.\n\n   So, c=1.\n\n   Now, plug into the quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2c -b)a + (c\u00b2 -c)=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 + (2*1 -5)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 -3a=0 \u2192 a(a-3)=0 \u2192 a=0 or a=3.\n\n   a=3 is valid, since a=3 <5.\n\n   So, n=3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4, a +c=4. Correct.\n\n   So, for b=5, k=3 gives a solution. So, that's another solution.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought that for b=5, there were no solutions, but that's not the case. So, my initial approach was incomplete because I didn't consider other k values beyond 1 and b-1 when b-1 is composite.\n\n   So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all possible k where k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1). For each such k, compute c and check if it's integer.\n\n   So, for each base b, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of solutions to k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1). The number of such k's depends on the factors of b-1.\n\n   For example, if b-1 is a prime p, then the solutions are k\u22611 and k\u2261p-1 mod p. So, for each prime p, two solutions.\n\n   If b-1 is a composite number with multiple factors, there might be more solutions.\n\n   So, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers increases as the number of possible k's increases.\n\n   So, for each base b, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of solutions to k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1). Each such k can lead to a valid c, provided c is integer and within the allowed range, and a is integer and within range.\n\n   So, the problem is to find the smallest b\u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten.\n\n   So, perhaps for bases where b-1 has many factors, the number of possible k's increases, leading to more b-eautiful numbers.\n\n   Let me try to find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions.\n\n   The number of solutions to k\u00b2\u22611 mod m is given by the number of square roots of 1 modulo m. For m=1, trivial. For m=2, two solutions: k=1. For m=prime p>2, two solutions: k=1 and k=p-1. For m being a power of 2, more solutions exist. For example, m=4, solutions are k=1 and 3. For m=8, solutions are k=1,3,5,7. So, for m=2^k, there are 2^(k-1) solutions.\n\n   For composite m, the number of solutions can be more. For example, m=6: solutions are k=1,5 because 1\u00b2=1 mod6, 5\u00b2=25\u22611 mod6.\n\n   Wait, but 5 is equivalent to -1 mod6, so yes.\n\n   So, in general, the number of solutions to k\u00b2\u22611 mod m is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\n   Wait, no, that's not accurate. For example, m=12=2^2*3. The number of solutions is 4: k=1,5,7,11.\n\n   So, for m=12, which has two distinct prime factors, the number of solutions is 4=2^2.\n\n   Similarly, m=15=3*5, solutions are k=1,4,11,14.\n\n   So, four solutions, which is 2^2.\n\n   So, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^d, where d is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\n   Wait, but for m=9=3^2, the solutions are k=1 and 8, which is two solutions, so 2^1, which is consistent with d=1.\n\n   For m=8=2^3, the solutions are k=1,3,5,7, which is four solutions, 2^2, but d=1 (only one prime factor, 2). Hmm, that contradicts the earlier idea.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions depends on the exponents in the prime factorization. For m=2^k, the number of solutions is 2^(k) for k\u22653, but for m=2, it's 1 solution, and for m=4, two solutions.\n\n   Wait, maybe a better approach is to realize that for each prime power p^e in the factorization of m, the number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod p^e is:\n\n   - For p odd: 2 solutions: 1 and -1.\n\n   - For p=2:\n\n     - e=1: 1 solution.\n\n     - e=2: 2 solutions.\n\n     - e\u22653: 4 solutions.\n\n   So, the total number of solutions modulo m is the product of the number of solutions modulo each prime power in the factorization of m.\n\n   Therefore, if m factors into primes as m=2^e * p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pn^en, then the number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod m is:\n\n   - 1 if e=0.\n\n   - 2 if e=1.\n\n   - 4 if e\u22652.\n\n   And for each odd prime pi, it contributes a factor of 2.\n\n   So, the total number of solutions is:\n\n   If m is odd: 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\n   If m is even:\n\n   - If m has 2^1 as a factor, then 2^(k), where k is the number of distinct odd prime factors.\n\n   - If m has 2^e with e\u22652, then 4*2^(k), where k is the number of distinct odd prime factors.\n\n   So, for example:\n\n   m=6=2*3: e=1, number of solutions=2^(1)=2.\n\n   m=12=2^2*3: e=2, so 4*2^(1)=8 solutions.\n\n   Wait, but earlier for m=12, I found four solutions: 1,5,7,11. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\n   Wait, no, for m=12, let's compute x\u00b2\u22611 mod12.\n\n   x=1: 1\u22611.\n\n   x=5:25\u22611.\n\n   x=7:49\u22611.\n\n   x=11:121\u22611.\n\n   So, four solutions, not eight. So, my earlier formula might be incorrect.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is:\n\n   For m=2^e * product of odd primes.\n\n   - If e=0: number of solutions=2^k.\n\n   - If e=1: number of solutions=2^(k).\n\n   - If e\u22652: number of solutions=4*2^(k).\n\n   But for m=12=2^2*3, e=2, k=1, so 4*2^1=8, but actual solutions are four. So, that's incorrect.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's:\n\n   For m=2^e, number of solutions:\n\n   - e=0:1.\n\n   - e=1:1.\n\n   - e=2:2.\n\n   - e\u22653:4.\n\n   Then, for each odd prime pi, each contributes a factor of 2.\n\n   So, total solutions= (number for 2^e) * product over pi of 2.\n\n   So, for m=12=2^2*3:\n\n   Number of solutions=2 (from 2^2) *2 (from 3^1)=4, which matches.\n\n   For m=8=2^3:\n\n   Solutions=4.\n\n   For m=6=2^1*3:\n\n   Solutions=1 (from 2^1) *2 (from3^1)=2.\n\n   For m=15=3*5:\n\n   Solutions=2*2=4.\n\n   For m=9=3^2:\n\n   Solutions=2.\n\n   For m=25=5^2:\n\n   Solutions=2.\n\n   For m=100=2^2*5^2:\n\n   Solutions=2 (from 2^2) *2 (from5^2)=4.\n\n   So, the formula seems to hold.\n\n   Therefore, the number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod m is:\n\n   Let m=2^e * (product of odd primes^f_i).\n\n   Then:\n\n   - If e=0: number of solutions=2^k, where k is the number of distinct odd primes.\n\n   - If e=1: number of solutions=2^k.\n\n   - If e\u22652: number of solutions=4 * 2^k.\n\n   So, for each base b, m=b-1.\n\n   The number of possible k's is equal to the number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1).\n\n   Each such k can lead to a possible c, provided that 4c=(b\u00b2 -k\u00b2)/(b -1) is integer, and c is within 0 \u2264c <b.\n\n   So, for each b, the maximum number of possible k's is as per the above formula.\n\n   Now, for each k, we can compute c and a, and check if they are integers and within range.\n\n   Now, the problem is to find the smallest b\u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten.\n\n   So, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of valid (a,c) pairs that satisfy the equation, which depends on the number of k's and whether the resulting c and a are valid.\n\n   So, perhaps for b where b-1 has many factors, especially with multiple distinct primes, the number of possible k's increases, leading to more b-eautiful numbers.\n\n   Let me try to find a pattern.\n\n   Let me list some bases and compute the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\n   For b=2: no solutions.\n\n   b=3:1 solution.\n\n   b=4: no solutions.\n\n   b=5: Let's compute.\n\n   m=4=2^2. So, number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod4 is 2: x=1,3.\n\n   So, possible k=1,3.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(25 -1)/4=24/4=6 \u2192c=6/4=1.5, not integer.\n\n   k=3:\n\n   4c=(25 -9)/4=16/4=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   So, c=1.\n\n   Then, quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -5)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -3a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=3.\n\n   a=3 is valid.\n\n   So, n=3*5 +1=16.\n\n   So, one solution for b=5.\n\n   Wait, but earlier I thought there was another solution when k=3, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\n   Wait, for k=3, c=1, a=3.\n\n   So, n=3*5 +1=16.\n\n   Also, for k=1, no solution.\n\n   So, only one solution for b=5.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I need to check more bases.\n\n   Let's try b=6.\n\n   m=5, which is prime. So, number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod5 is 2: k=1,4.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(36 -1)/5=35/5=7 \u2192c=7/4=1.75, not integer.\n\n   k=4:\n\n   4c=(36 -16)/5=20/5=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   So, c=1.\n\n   Then, quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -6)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -4a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=4.\n\n   a=4 is valid.\n\n   So, n=4*6 +1=25.\n\n   Check: a +c=5, sqrt(25)=5. Correct.\n\n   So, only one solution for b=6.\n\n   Now, b=7.\n\n   m=6=2*3.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod6 is 4: k=1,5,7,11. Wait, but since b=7, k must be <7, so possible k=1,5.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(49 -1)/6=48/6=8 \u2192c=2.\n\n   Then, quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (4 -7)a + (4 -2)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -3a +2=0 \u2192(a-1)(a-2)=0 \u2192a=1 or 2.\n\n   Both a=1 and a=2 are valid.\n\n   So, two solutions: n=1*7 +2=9 and n=2*7 +2=16.\n\n   For k=5:\n\n   4c=(49 -25)/6=24/6=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Then, quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -7)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -5a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=5.\n\n   a=5 is valid.\n\n   So, n=5*7 +1=36.\n\n   Check: a +c=6, sqrt(36)=6. Correct.\n\n   So, for b=7, three solutions: n=9,16,36.\n\n   Wait, that's three solutions. So, for b=7, number of b-eautiful numbers is three.\n\n   Wait, but earlier when I considered only k=1, I found two solutions. But with k=5, I found another solution. So, total three.\n\n   So, for b=7, three solutions.\n\n   Let me check b=8.\n\n   m=7, prime. So, number of solutions=2: k=1,6.\n\n   For k=1:\n\n   4c=(64 -1)/7=63/7=9 \u2192c=9/4=2.25, not integer.\n\n   For k=6:\n\n   4c=(64 -36)/7=28/7=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -8)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -6a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=6.\n\n   a=6 is valid.\n\n   So, n=6*8 +1=49.\n\n   Check: a +c=7, sqrt(49)=7.

Correct.\n\n   So, for b=25, three solutions:81,256,576.\n\n   Wait, but when k=7, we got two solutions, and when k=23, one solution. So, total three.\n\n   Hmm, seems like for each base b where m=b-1 has multiple factors, we get more solutions, but not exceeding three so far.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I need to find a base where m=b-1 has many factors, leading to more k's, each possibly contributing a solution.\n\n   Let me try b=105.\n\n   m=104=8*13.\n\n   Wait, 104=8*13=2^3*13.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod104:\n\n   Since 104=8*13, and 8=2^3.\n\n   For 8: solutions x=1,3,5,7.\n\n   For 13: solutions x=1,12.\n\n   So, total solutions=4*2=8.\n\n   So, possible k=1,3,5,7,12,14,16,18, etc., but limited to k<105.\n\n   Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the actual solutions.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that for m=2^3*13, the number of solutions is 4 (from 2^3) *2 (from13)=8.\n\n   So, eight possible k's.\n\n   For each k, compute c and check if it's integer.\n\n   Let's proceed.\n\n   For b=105, m=104.\n\n   Number of solutions=8.\n\n   Let me list them: k=1,3,5,7,13,15,17,19, etc. Wait, perhaps better to compute them.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to realize that for each solution x mod8 and x mod13, we can find x mod104 using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\n   But perhaps it's too time-consuming.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try smaller bases where m has more factors.\n\n   Let me try b=105.\n\n   Wait, perhaps it's too big. Let me try b=25, which I did earlier, but only got three solutions.\n\n   Alternatively, let me try b=16, which had three solutions.\n\n   Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\n   From the earlier examples, it seems that for each base b where m=b-1 has t solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod m, we can get up to t solutions, but often only a subset of them yield integer c and a.\n\n   However, from the examples, even when m has multiple solutions, the number of valid (a,c) pairs doesn't exceed three or four.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try b=33.\n\n   m=32=2^5.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod32: x=1,3,5,7,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31.\n\n   Wait, no, actually, for m=2^e, the number of solutions is 4 when e\u22653.\n\n   So, for m=32=2^5, number of solutions=4.\n\n   So, possible k=1,3,5,7, etc., but let's compute the actual solutions.\n\n   Wait, no, for m=32, the solutions are x=1,3,5,7,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31. But that can't be right because x\u00b2\u22611 mod32.\n\n   Let me compute x\u00b2 mod32 for x=1 to 31:\n\n   x=1:1.\n\n   x=3:9.\n\n   x=5:25.\n\n   x=7:49 mod32=17.\n\n   x=9:81 mod32=17.\n\n   x=11:121 mod32=25.\n\n   x=13:169 mod32=9.\n\n   x=15:225 mod32=1.\n\n   x=17:289 mod32=1.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute x=15:15\u00b2=225. 225/32=7*32=224, remainder 1. So, 225\u22611 mod32.\n\n   Similarly, x=17:17\u00b2=289. 289-9*32=289-288=1. So, 289\u22611 mod32.\n\n   Similarly, x=19:19\u00b2=361. 361-11*32=361-352=9. So, 361\u22619 mod32.\n\n   Hmm, so the solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod32 are x=1,15,17, etc.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I should compute all x where x\u00b2\u22611 mod32.\n\n   Let me compute x from 1 to 16 (since mod32 is symmetric around 16):\n\n   x=1:1.\n\n   x=15:225\u22611.\n\n   x=17:289\u22611.\n\n   x=31:961\u22611.\n\n   Wait, no, 31\u00b2=961. 961 mod32: 32*30=960, so 961\u22611.\n\n   So, solutions are x=1,15,17,31 mod32.\n\n   So, four solutions.\n\n   So, for b=33, m=32, solutions k=1,15,17,31.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(1089 -1)/32=1088/32=34 \u2192c=34/4=8.5, not integer.\n\n   k=15:\n\n   4c=(1089 -225)/32=864/32=27 \u2192c=27/4=6.75, not integer.\n\n   k=17:\n\n   4c=(1089 -289)/32=800/32=25 \u2192c=25/4=6.25, not integer.\n\n   k=31:\n\n   4c=(1089 -961)/32=128/32=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -33)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -31a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=31.\n\n   a=31 is valid.\n\n   So, n=31*33 +1=1024.\n\n   Check: a +c=32, sqrt(1024)=32. Correct.\n\n   So, only one solution for b=33.\n\n   Hmm, seems like even with more factors, the number of solutions doesn't increase beyond three or four.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I need to find a base where m has multiple factors, leading to more solutions.\n\n   Let me try b=105.\n\n   m=104=8*13.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod104: since 8 and13 are coprime, the number of solutions is 4 (from8) *2 (from13)=8.\n\n   So, possible k=1,3,5,7,12,14,16,18, etc.\n\n   Let me compute for each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1)/104=11024/104=106 \u2192c=106/4=26.5, not integer.\n\n   k=3:\n\n   4c=(11025 -9)/104=11016/104=105.923, not integer.\n\n   k=5:\n\n   4c=(11025 -25)/104=11000/104=105.769, not integer.\n\n   k=7:\n\n   4c=(11025 -49)/104=10976/104=105.538, not integer.\n\n   k=12:\n\n   4c=(11025 -144)/104=10881/104\u2248104.625, not integer.\n\n   k=14:\n\n   4c=(11025 -196)/104=10829/104\u2248104.125, not integer.\n\n   k=16:\n\n   4c=(11025 -256)/104=10769/104\u2248103.55, not integer.\n\n   k=18:\n\n   4c=(11025 -324)/104=10701/104\u2248102.89, not integer.\n\n   Hmm, none of these give integer c. Only when k=103:\n\n   Wait, k must be less than b=105, but let's compute for k=103:\n\n   4c=(11025 -10609)/104=416/104=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -105)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -103a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=103.\n\n   a=103 is valid.\n\n   So, n=103*105 +1=10816.\n\n   Check: a +c=104, sqrt(10816)=104.

Maybe I need to find a base where m=b-1 is such that many k's give integer c and a.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps for b where m=b-1 is a product of multiple distinct primes, leading to more k's, but each k leading to one solution.\n\n   Let me try b=35.\n\n   m=34=2*17.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod34: x=1,3,5,9,15,19,21,25,27,33.\n\n   Wait, no, let me compute properly.\n\n   For m=34=2*17.\n\n   Solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod2: x=1.\n\n   Solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod17: x=1,16.\n\n   So, using Chinese Remainder Theorem, the solutions mod34 are:\n\n   x \u22611 mod2 and x\u22611 mod17 \u2192x=1.\n\n   x\u22611 mod2 and x\u226116 mod17 \u2192x=16+17k where k is even? Wait, no, better to compute:\n\n   For x\u22611 mod2 and x\u22611 mod17: x=1.\n\n   For x\u22611 mod2 and x\u226116 mod17: solve x=17m +16. To satisfy x\u22611 mod2: 17m +16 \u2261m +0 \u22611 mod2 \u2192m\u22611 mod2. So, m=2k+1 \u2192x=17*(2k+1)+16=34k +33. So, x\u226133 mod34.\n\n   Similarly, for x\u22611 mod2 and x\u22611 mod17: x=1.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list the solutions:\n\n   The solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod34 are x=1,33, etc.\n\n   Let me compute x=1:1\u00b2=1.\n\n   x=33:33\u00b2=1089. 1089 mod34: 34*32=1088, so 1089\u22611 mod34.\n\n   Are there more solutions?\n\n   Let me check x=3:9\u22619\u22601.\n\n   x=5:25\u226125\u22601.\n\n   x=9:81\u226181-2*34=81-68=13\u226113\u22601.\n\n   x=15:225\u2261225-6*34=225-204=21\u226121\u22601.\n\n   x=19:361\u2261361-10*34=361-340=21\u226121\u22601.\n\n   x=21:441\u2261441-12*34=441-408=33\u226133\u22601.\n\n   x=25:625\u2261625-18*34=625-612=13\u226113\u22601.\n\n   x=27:729\u2261729-21*34=729-714=15\u226115\u22601.\n\n   So, only x=1 and x=33 satisfy x\u00b2\u22611 mod34.\n\n   So, for b=35, m=34, number of solutions=2.\n\n   For each k=1,33:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(1225 -1)/34=1224/34=36 \u2192c=36/4=9.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (18 -35)a + (81 -9)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -17a +72=0 \u2192(a-8)(a-9)=0 \u2192a=8 or9.\n\n   Both valid.\n\n   So, n=8*35 +9=289 and 9*35 +9=324.\n\n   Check:8+9=17, sqrt(289)=17;9+9=18, sqrt(324)=18.

Correct.\n\n   So, for b=35, three solutions:289,324,1156.\n\n   Hmm, same as before.\n\n   Let me try b=21, which had three solutions.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the maximum number of solutions per base is around three or four. So, to get more than ten solutions, perhaps the base needs to be such that m=b-1 has many factors, leading to many k's, each contributing a solution.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions increases when m is highly composite.\n\n   Let me try b=105, but earlier I only found one solution.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think differently.\n\n   From the earlier analysis, for each k where k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1), we can compute c and a. For each valid (a,c), we get a solution.\n\n   The number of solutions depends on the number of valid k's and whether c is integer.\n\n   Now, the problem is to find the smallest b where the number of solutions exceeds ten.\n\n   So, perhaps for bases where m=b-1 is such that many k's lead to integer c and a, the number of solutions increases.\n\n   Let me try to find a base where m has many factors, leading to many k's.\n\n   Let me try b=105.\n\n   m=104=8*13.\n\n   As before, number of solutions=4 (from8) *2 (from13)=8.\n\n   So, possible k's=8.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1)/104=11024/104=106 \u2192c=26.5, not integer.\n\n   k=3:\n\n   4c=(11025 -9)/104=11016/104=105.923, not integer.\n\n   k=5:\n\n   4c=(11025 -25)/104=11000/104=105.769, not integer.\n\n   k=7:\n\n   4c=(11025 -49)/104=10976/104=105.538, not integer.\n\n   k=12:\n\n   4c=(11025 -144)/104=10881/104\u2248104.625, not integer.\n\n   k=14:\n\n   4c=(11025 -196)/104=10829/104\u2248104.125, not integer.\n\n   k=16:\n\n   4c=(11025 -256)/104=10769/104\u2248103.55, not integer.\n\n   k=18:\n\n   4c=(11025 -324)/104=10701/104\u2248102.89, not integer.\n\n   k=20:\n\n   4c=(11025 -400)/104=10625/104\u2248102.16, not integer.\n\n   k=22:\n\n   4c=(11025 -484)/104=10541/104\u2248101.35, not integer.\n\n   k=24:\n\n   4c=(11025 -576)/104=10449/104\u2248100.47, not integer.\n\n   k=26:\n\n   4c=(11025 -676)/104=10349/104\u224899.51, not integer.\n\n   k=28:\n\n   4c=(11025 -784)/104=10241/104\u224898.56, not integer.\n\n   k=30:\n\n   4c=(11025 -900)/104=10125/104\u224897.35, not integer.\n\n   k=32:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1024)/104=10001/104\u224896.16, not integer.\n\n   k=34:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1156)/104=9869/104\u224894.94, not integer.\n\n   k=36:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1296)/104=9729/104\u224893.5, not integer.\n\n   k=38:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1444)/104=9581/104\u224892.12, not integer.\n\n   k=40:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1600)/104=9425/104\u224890.625, not integer.\n\n   k=42:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1764)/104=9261/104\u224889.05, not integer.\n\n   k=44:\n\n   4c=(11025 -1936)/104=9089/104\u224887.34, not integer.\n\n   k=46:\n\n   4c=(11025 -2116)/104=8909/104\u224885.66, not integer.\n\n   k=48:\n\n   4c=(11025 -2304)/104=8721/104\u224883.85, not integer.\n\n   k=50:\n\n   4c=(11025 -2500)/104=8525/104\u224881.96, not integer.\n\n   k=52:\n\n   4c=(11025 -2704)/104=8321/104\u224880.01, which is 80.01, not integer.\n\n   Wait, 8321/104=80.0096, which is approximately 80, but not exactly.\n\n   Let me compute 104*80=8320, so 8321-8320=1 \u21928321=104*80 +1 \u21928321/104=80 +1/104\u224880.0096.

Wait, no, 19*21=399, plus1=400.\n\n   So, n=400.\n\n   So, three solutions:25,256,400.\n\n   So, three solutions.\n\n   Let me try b=105, but it's too time-consuming. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of solutions per base is limited, and the problem requires a base where m=b-1 has many factors, leading to multiple solutions.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions per base is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each base b where m=b-1 has t solutions, the number of b-eautiful numbers is t, but in practice, it's less due to non-integer c.\n\n   So, to find a base with more than ten solutions, perhaps m=b-1 needs to have many solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod m, and each solution leads to a valid c and a.\n\n   So, perhaps the smallest such b is when m is a product of many small primes, leading to many solutions.\n\n   Let me try m=24=2^3*3.\n\n   So, b=25.\n\n   Number of solutions=4 (from8) *2 (from3)=8.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(625 -1)/24=624/24=26 \u2192c=6.5, not integer.\n\n   k=5:\n\n   4c=(625 -25)/24=600/24=25 \u2192c=6.25, not integer.\n\n   k=7:\n\n   4c=(625 -49)/24=576/24=24 \u2192c=6.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (12 -25)a + (36 -6)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -13a +30=0 \u2192(a-10)(a-3)=0 \u2192a=3 or10.\n\n   Both valid.\n\n   So, n=3*25 +6=81 and 10*25 +6=256.\n\n   k=11:\n\n   4c=(625 -121)/24=504/24=21 \u2192c=5.25, not integer.\n\n   k=13:\n\n   4c=(625 -169)/24=456/24=19 \u2192c=4.75, not integer.\n\n   k=17:\n\n   4c=(625 -289)/24=336/24=14 \u2192c=3.5, not integer.\n\n   k=19:\n\n   4c=(625 -361)/24=264/24=11 \u2192c=2.75, not integer.\n\n   k=23:\n\n   4c=(625 -529)/24=96/24=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -25)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -23a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=23.\n\n   a=23 is valid.\n\n   So, n=23*25 +1=576.\n\n   So, three solutions:81,256,576.\n\n   Hmm, same as before.\n\n   Wait, perhaps the maximum number of solutions per base is three. So, how can we get more than ten solutions? Maybe the initial assumption is wrong, and the number of solutions per base is limited, but I must have made a mistake.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering that for each base b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1), but I'm not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions increases when m=b-1 is such that many k's satisfy k\u00b2\u22611 mod m and lead to integer c and a.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for each base b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write n as a two-digit number in base b, with digits a and c, such that a +c=sqrt(n)=sqrt(ab +c).\n\n   Let me try to find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions.\n\n   From the earlier analysis, for each base b, the number of solutions seems to be up to three or four, but to find a base with more than ten solutions, perhaps I need to find a base where m=b-1 has many factors, leading to many k's that satisfy k\u00b2\u22611 mod m and result in integer c and a.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions per base increases as the base increases, but from the examples, it's not clear.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires a base where m=b-1 is a factorial, leading to many factors.\n\n   Let me try b=121.\n\n   m=120=2^3*3*5.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod120:\n\n   Since 120=8*3*5.\n\n   For 8: solutions x=1,3,5,7.\n\n   For3: solutions x=1,2.\n\n   For5: solutions x=1,4.\n\n   So, using Chinese Remainder Theorem, the total number of solutions is 4 (from8) *2 (from3) *2 (from5)=16.\n\n   So, 16 solutions.\n\n   For each k, compute c and check if it's integer.\n\n   Let me proceed:\n\n   For b=121, m=120.\n\n   For each k where k\u00b2\u22611 mod120:\n\n   Let me list the possible k's:\n\n   The solutions are combinations of x\u22611 mod8, x\u2261\u00b11 mod3, x\u2261\u00b11 mod5.\n\n   So, possible k's are:\n\n   1, 119,\n\n   3, 117,\n\n   5, 115,\n\n   7, 113,\n\n   13, 107,\n\n   17, 103,\n\n   19, 101,\n\n   23, 97,\n\n   29, 91,\n\n   31, 89,\n\n   37, 83,\n\n   41, 79,\n\n   43, 77,\n\n   47, 73,\n\n   53, 67,\n\n   59, 61.\n\n   Wait, that's 16 solutions.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(14641 -1)/120=14640/120=122 \u2192c=122/4=30.5, not integer.\n\n   k=119:\n\n   4c=(14641 -14161)/120=480/120=4 \u2192c=1.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (2*1 -121)a + (1 -1)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -119a=0 \u2192a=0 or a=119.\n\n   a=119 is valid.\n\n   So, n=119*121 +1=14400.\n\n   Check: a +c=120, sqrt(14400)=120.

So, total solutions:1+2+2=5.\n\n   Wait, that's five solutions. So, for b=121, there are five b-eautiful numbers.\n\n   Hmm, but I need more than ten. So, perhaps I need to find a base where m=b-1 has many solutions, and each leads to a valid c and a.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the smallest such b is 225, but I'm not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\n   From the earlier analysis, each solution comes from a k where k\u00b2\u22611 mod (b-1), and for each such k, we get up to two solutions (a,c). So, the number of solutions per base is roughly twice the number of k's.\n\n   To get more than ten solutions, we need at least six k's, each giving two solutions, but that's unlikely.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions increases as the number of factors of m increases.\n\n   Let me try b=105, which I tried earlier, but only found one solution.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 105, but I'm not sure.\n\n   Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem differently. The number of solutions per base is limited, and the problem asks for the smallest b where the count exceeds ten. From the earlier examples, it seems that the maximum number of solutions per base is around five, so perhaps the answer is 105, but I'm not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 121, which had five solutions, but that's still less than ten.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to find a base where m=b-1 has many factors, leading to many k's and solutions.\n\n   Let me try b=21, which had three solutions.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 105, but I'm not certain.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 225.\n\n   Let me try b=225.\n\n   m=224=2^5*7.\n\n   Number of solutions to x\u00b2\u22611 mod224:\n\n   Since 224=32*7.\n\n   For32: solutions x=1,3,5,7,15,17,19,21, etc.\n\n   For7: solutions x=1,6.\n\n   So, total solutions=8 (from32) *2 (from7)=16.\n\n   For each k:\n\n   k=1:\n\n   4c=(50625 -1)/224=50624/224=226 \u2192c=226/4=56.5, not integer.\n\n   k=3:\n\n   4c=(50625 -9)/224=50616/224=226.036, not integer.\n\n   k=5:\n\n   4c=(50625 -25)/224=50600/224=226.071, not integer.\n\n   k=7:\n\n   4c=(50625 -49)/224=50576/224=225.8, not integer.\n\n   k=15:\n\n   4c=(50625 -225)/224=50400/224=225 \u2192c=225/4=56.25, not integer.\n\n   k=17:\n\n   4c=(50625 -289)/224=50336/224=224.75, not integer.\n\n   k=19:\n\n   4c=(50625 -361)/224=50264/224=224.4, not integer.\n\n   k=21:\n\n   4c=(50625 -441)/224=50184/224=224.027, not integer.\n\n   k=23:\n\n   4c=(50625 -529)/224=50096/224=223.6, not integer.\n\n   k=25:\n\n   4c=(50625 -625)/224=50000/224\u2248223.214, not integer.\n\n   k=27:\n\n   4c=(50625 -729)/224=49896/224\u2248222.75, not integer.\n\n   k=29:\n\n   4c=(50625 -841)/224=49784/224=222.2857, not integer.\n\n   k=31:\n\n   4c=(50625 -961)/224=49664/224=221.75, not integer.\n\n   k=33:\n\n   4c=(50625 -1089)/224=49536/224=221.25, not integer.\n\n   k=35:\n\n   4c=(50625 -1225)/224=49400/224\u2248220.714, not integer.\n\n   k=37:\n\n   4c=(50625 -1369)/224=49256/224=220. 49256/224=220.\n\n   So, c=220/4=55.\n\n   Quadratic equation:\n\n   a\u00b2 + (110 -225)a + (55\u00b2 -55)=0 \u2192a\u00b2 -115a + (3025 -55)=a\u00b2 -115a +2970=0.\n\n   Compute discriminant:115\u00b2 -4*1*2970=13225 -11880=1345.\n\n   sqrt(1345)\u224836.68, not integer.
