      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Hmm, let me try to parse it out.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along x because the positive term is with x\u00b2.\n\nNow, the problem says there are four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola such that ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals cross there.\n\nI remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, is that true? No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, they intersect at 90 degrees.\n\nSo, the rhombus has its center at the origin, and its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.\n\nNow, the question is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, I think BD is one of the diagonals, and they want the supremum of BD\u00b2, but not necessarily attainable. So, the maximum BD\u00b2 possible, but we're supposed to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or perhaps the minimum? Wait, no, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, but maybe not. Wait, perhaps it's the minimum possible BD\u00b2? Or perhaps it's the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, no, think again. If you have a number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, and M is the greatest such number. So, M would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, the greatest lower bound. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than M, and M is the largest such number.\n\nSo, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the minimum BD\u00b2, but I think not, because the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum.\n\nWait, actually, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum. Because if BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily small, then the greatest lower bound would be zero. But maybe in this case, BD\u00b2 has a lower bound above zero because the points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum BD\u00b2, and the question is about the infimum, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's think. Let's try to model the problem.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, and the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if we denote the diagonals as AC and BD, then they intersect at the origin, and each diagonal is bisected by the other.\n\nSo, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D is (-p, -q).\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in the hyperbola, the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, each of these points satisfies x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let's assign coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that diagonal AC is along some line, and BD is along another line perpendicular to AC.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, maybe the diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Wait, but that's only for a square, which is a special case of a rhombus. But in this case, the diagonals need not be along the coordinate axes.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes unless the rhombus is a square. So, in our case, the diagonals can be at any angle, as long as they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, let me try to parametrize the points.\n\nLet\u2019s denote points A and C as (a, b) and (-a, -b), respectively. Similarly, points B and D as (c, d) and (-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. So, OA is vector (a, b), and OB is vector (c, d). Then, since diagonals are AC and BD, vectors AC = (-2a, -2b), and BD = (-2c, -2d). But wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2a, -2b). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2c, -2d).\n\nWait, but actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vector AC is C - A = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is D - B = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d).\n\nSince AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 4ac + 4bd = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, the condition is ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations from the hyperbola, and another equation from the perpendicularity of the diagonals: ac + bd = 0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD.\n\nBD is from point B to D, which is (-2c, -2d). So, the length of BD is sqrt[ (-2c)^2 + (-2d)^2 ] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 is (2 sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nSo, our goal is to find inf{ BD\u00b2 } = inf{4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)} where c and d satisfy c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1 and ac + bd = 0, with a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express a and b in terms of c and d, using the condition ac + bd = 0.\n\nFrom ac + bd = 0, we can express a = (-bd)/c, assuming c \u2260 0. Or, if c = 0, then we have bd = 0, but then if c=0, from hyperbola equation, c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1, so -d\u00b2/24 =1, which is impossible because d\u00b2 is non-negative. So, c cannot be zero. Similarly, d cannot be zero because if d=0, then from c\u00b2/20 =1, c=\u00b1\u221a20, but then from ac + bd=0, if d=0, we have a*c =0, so a=0, but then from a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1, with a=0, we get -b\u00b2/24=1, which is impossible. So, neither c nor d can be zero.\n\nSo, we can express a = (-bd)/c.\n\nThen, plugging into the hyperbola equation for point A:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSubstituting a = (-bd)/c:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2) / c\u00b2 ] /20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(b\u00b2 d\u00b2) / (20 c\u00b2) - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, we can also express c\u00b2 and d\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation for point B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nLet me write that as c\u00b2 = 20(1 + d\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = 20 + (20 d\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 d\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) d\u00b2.\n\nSo, 1/c\u00b2 = 1 / [20 + (5/6)d\u00b2] = 1 / [ (120 +5 d\u00b2)/6 ] = 6 / (120 +5 d\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, let me denote d\u00b2 as t. Let t = d\u00b2, so t >0.\n\nThen, c\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) t.\n\nSo, 1/c\u00b2 = 6 / (120 +5t).\n\nSimilarly, let's substitute back into the equation for point A.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (d\u00b2)/(20 c\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1.\n\nExpressed in terms of t:\n\nb\u00b2 [ t/(20 c\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1.\n\nBut c\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)t, so:\n\nb\u00b2 [ t/(20*(20 + (5/6)t)) - 1/24 ] =1.\n\nLet me compute t/(20 c\u00b2):\n\nt/(20 c\u00b2) = t/(20*(20 + (5/6)t)) = t/(400 + (50/6)t) = t/(400 + (25/3)t).\n\nSimilarly, 1/24 is just 1/24.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets is:\n\n[ t/(400 + (25/3)t) - 1/24 ].\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (3t)/(1200 + 25t) - 1/24 ].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to get a common denominator.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the entire expression:\n\n[ t/(400 + (25/3)t) - 1/24 ].\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nt/(400 + (25/3)t) - 1/24.\n\nTo combine these terms, let's find a common denominator. The denominators are (400 + (25/3)t) and 24.\n\nLet me multiply numerator and denominator of the first term by 3 to eliminate the fraction in the denominator:\n\n[ (3t)/(1200 +25t) - 1/24 ].\n\nNow, the denominators are 1200 +25t and 24.\n\nLet me factor out 25 from the first denominator: 25(48 + t).\n\nWait, 25t + 1200 =25(t + 48).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n[ 3t/(25(t +48)) - 1/24 ].\n\nNow, common denominator is 25*24(t +48) = 600(t +48).\n\nSo, rewrite each term:\n\n3t/(25(t +48)) = (3t *24)/(600(t +48)) =72t/(600(t +48)).\n\nSimilarly, 1/24 =25(t +48)/(600(t +48)).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see:\n\nThe second term is 1/24, which can be written as 25(t +48)/(600(t +48)).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n[72t -25(t +48)] / [600(t +48)].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n72t -25t - 1200 =47t -1200.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets is:\n\n(47t -1200)/(600(t +48)).\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have:\n\nb\u00b2 * (47t -1200)/(600(t +48)) =1.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = [600(t +48)] / (47t -1200).\n\nBut since b\u00b2 must be positive, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, 47t -1200 >0, since t>0.\n\nSo, 47t >1200 => t>1200/47 \u224825.5319.\n\nSo, t must be greater than approximately 25.5319.\n\nSo, t > 1200/47.\n\nSo, that's a condition on t.\n\nNow, let me recall that BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) =4(c\u00b2 +t).\n\nBut c\u00b2 is 20 + (5/6)t, so:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(20 + (5/6)t + t) =4*(20 + (11/6)t) =80 + (44/6)t =80 + (22/3)t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 + (22/3) t.\n\nSo, since t>1200/47, BD\u00b2 is a function of t, and we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nSo, we can think of BD\u00b2 as a function of t, and we can find its minimal value given the constraints.\n\nSo, we have BD\u00b2(t) =80 + (22/3) t.\n\nBut t must satisfy t>1200/47, and also, we have b\u00b2 = [600(t +48)] / (47t -1200).\n\nSince b\u00b2 must be positive, and we already have t>1200/47, so that's satisfied.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find the minimal BD\u00b2, which would correspond to the minimal t.\n\nSo, the minimal t is just above 1200/47, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47).\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let's see.\n\nWait, actually, t must satisfy another condition: from point A's hyperbola equation, which is a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut we've already used that condition to get the expression for b\u00b2 in terms of t. So, perhaps the minimal t is 1200/47, but that would require b\u00b2 to be zero, which is impossible because then a\u00b2/20 =1, which is possible, but b=0 is not acceptable because then the point A would be on the vertex, but then the rhombus would collapse.\n\nWait, but if t approaches 1200/47 from above, then b\u00b2 approaches zero.\n\nBut b can't be zero because that would mean point A is (a, 0), which lies on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 =1, so a=\u00b12\u221a5. Then, point B would be (c, d), and from ac + bd=0, with b=0, we have a c=0. But a=\u00b12\u221a5\u22600, so c=0. But earlier we saw that c=0 is impossible because it leads to a contradiction in the hyperbola equation. So, t cannot be exactly 1200/47, but it can approach that value.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47) as t approaches 1200/47 from above.\n\nSo, let me compute that limit.\n\nCompute 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47).\n\nFirst, compute (22/3)*(1200/47):\n\n22*1200 =26400,\n\n26400 / (3*47) =26400 /141.\n\nCompute 26400 \u00f7141.\n\nLet me compute 141*187=141*(180+7)=141*180=25380, 141*7=987; total 25380+987=26367.\n\n26400-26367=33.\n\nSo, 141*187=26367, remainder 33.\n\nSo, 26400/141=187 +33/141=187 +11/47\u2248187.234.\n\nSo, 22/3*(1200/47)=26400/141\u2248187.234.\n\nThen, 80 +187.234\u2248267.234.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 267.234 as t approaches 1200/47 from above.\n\nBut is this the minimal BD\u00b2? Or is there a lower BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, actually, as t increases, BD\u00b2 increases as well because BD\u00b2 is linear in t with a positive coefficient (22/3\u22487.333). So, BD\u00b2 is minimized when t is minimized, which is t approaching 1200/47.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is just above 267.234, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 267.234... But wait, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as approaching ~267.234, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, which is 267.234, but it's approached but not reached. So, the infimum is 267.234, but BD\u00b2 can't actually be less than that because t can't be less than 1200/47.\n\nWait, no, because as t approaches 1200/47, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47)=80 + (26400/141)=80 + 187.234=267.234. So, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 267.234 but cannot be less than that because t can't be less than 1200/47.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be larger than that, right? So, BD\u00b2 has a minimum value of approximately 267.234, and it can go to infinity as t increases. So, the infimum is 267.234, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to that.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 267.234, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 267.234. But since 267.234 is the infimum, which is not attained, but for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum. Because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than infimum, and the infimum is the greatest such lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 267.234, but we need to express it as an exact fraction.\n\nWait, let's compute 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47).\n\n22/3 *1200/47= (22 *1200)/(3*47)= (26400)/(141).\n\n26400 \u00f7141: Let me compute 141*187=26367, remainder 33, as before.\n\nSo, 26400/141=187 +33/141=187 +11/47.\n\nSo, 80 +187 +11/47=267 +11/47.\n\nSo, 267 +11/47=267.234 approx.\n\nSo, 267 +11/47 is the exact value.\n\nSo, 11/47 is approximately 0.234.\n\nSo, the exact value is 267 +11/47, which can be written as (267*47 +11)/47.\n\nCompute 267*47:\n\n267*40=10680,\n\n267*7=1869,\n\nTotal=10680+1869=12549.\n\nAdd 11: 12560.\n\nSo, 267 +11/47=12560/47.\n\nWait, 47*267=12549, and 12549+11=12560.\n\nYes, so 12560/47.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 12560/47 as t approaches 1200/47.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 12560/47.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12560/47.\n\nBut let me confirm if this is correct.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\nWe had BD\u00b2 =80 + (22/3)t.\n\nWe found that t must be greater than 1200/47.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is when t approaches 1200/47, so BD\u00b2 approaches 80 + (22/3)*(1200/47)=80 + (26400/141)=80 + 187 +11/47=267 +11/47=12560/47.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is greater than 12560/47 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12560/47.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nBut let me compute 12560 divided by 47 to confirm.\n\n47*267=12549, as above.\n\n12560-12549=11.\n\nSo, 12560/47=267 +11/47, which is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 12560/47.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 12560/47 is reducible.\n\n47 is a prime number. 12560 \u00f747: 47*267=12549, 12560-12549=11, so 12560=47*267 +11, which is as above. So, 12560/47=267 +11/47, which is the simplest form.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12560/47, which is approximately 267.234.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12560/47, which is 267 and 11/47.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are perpendicular. Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on the hyperbola.\n\nWe denote the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) as \\((a, b)\\), \\((c, d)\\), \\((-a, -b)\\), and \\((-c, -d)\\), respectively. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero, leading to the condition \\(ac + bd = 0\\).\n\nUsing the hyperbola equation for points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1.\n\\]\n\nWe aim to find \\(BD^2\\). The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}\\), so:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2).\n\\]\n\nTo express \\(c^2\\) and \\(d^2\\) in terms of a single variable, we let \\(t = d^2\\). From the hyperbola equation for \\(B\\), we find:\n\\[\nc^2 = 20 + \\frac{5}{6}t.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(t\\) into the expression for \\(BD^2\\), we get:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4\\left(20 + \\frac{5}{6}t + t\\right) = 80 + \\frac{22}{3}t.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the condition \\(ac + bd = 0\\) to relate \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\). Substituting \\(a = -\\frac{bd}{c}\\) into the hyperbola equation for \\(A\\), we derive:\n\\[\nb^2 = \\frac{600(t + 48)}{47t - 1200}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\(b^2\\) to be positive, \\(t > \\frac{1200}{47}\\). Thus, the minimal value of \\(t\\) is just above \\(\\frac{1200}{47}\\), leading to the minimal \\(BD^2\\) approaching:\n\\[\nBD^2 = 80 + \\frac{22}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1200}{47} = \\frac{12560}{47}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{12560}{47}}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\nSince the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes and the origin, this makes sense. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric as well, perhaps as (u, v) and (-u, -v). But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, if A and C are two opposite vertices, and B and D are the other two, then AC and BD are the diagonals.\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the axes. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D must lie on the hyperbola, and since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of these points must satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet A = (a, b), so C = (-a, -b) because the origin is the midpoint.\n\nSimilarly, let B = (c, d), so D = (-c, -d).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the diagonals are perpendicular in a rhombus, the product of their slopes should be -1.\n\nWait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.\n\nLet me think in terms of vectors. The vector AC is from A to C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). But wait, no, AC is from A to C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). But wait, AC is from (a,b) to (-a,-b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from (c,d) to (-c,-d), which is (-2c, -2d). Wait, no, BD is from B to D, which is (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d).\n\nBut for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. So, the dot product of AC and BD vectors should be zero.\n\nWait, no, actually, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, their vectors are AC = C - A = (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD = D - B = (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). So, the vectors are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). Their dot product should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0 => 4ac + 4bd = 0 => ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition: ac + bd = 0.\n\nAlso, all four points A, B, C, D must lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting A into the hyperbola equation: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for B: c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nNow, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between B and D. Wait, no, BD is the length of the diagonal BD, which is the distance between B and D. Since B is (c, d) and D is (-c, -d), the distance BD is sqrt[( -c - c )\u00b2 + ( -d - d )\u00b2] = sqrt[(-2c)\u00b2 + (-2d)\u00b2] = sqrt[4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is [2*sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombuses, and then take the greatest number less than that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2. So, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombuses.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the greatest lower bound, and we need to find that.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given that (c, d) lies on the hyperbola c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1, and with the condition ac + bd = 0, where (a, b) is another point on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but since A and B are adjacent vertices of the rhombus, the sides AB, BC, etc., must have the same length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the rhombus as two intersecting lines through the origin, with points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to parametrize points on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me recall that hyperbola parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), but that's for the right-hand hyperbola. Alternatively, using hyperbola coordinates, another parametrization is (a cosh t, b sinh t). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, perhaps I can model the points as being along lines through the origin. So, suppose that points A and C lie along a line through the origin with some slope m, and points B and D lie along another line through the origin with slope n, such that m*n = -1 because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nWait, because the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes should multiply to -1.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the line AC has slope ( -b - b )/( -a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a. Similarly, the line BD has slope ( -d - d )/( -c - c ) = (-2d)/(-2c) = d/c. For them to be perpendicular, (b/a)*(d/c) = -1.\n\nSo, (b d)/(a c) = -1. But earlier, we had ac + bd = 0. Hmm, so combining these, let's see.\n\nFrom ac + bd = 0, we have ac = -bd. So, substituting into the slope condition: (b/a)*(d/c) = (b d)/(a c) = (b d)/( -b d ) = -1. So that's consistent. So, the two conditions are consistent.\n\nSo, the key conditions are:\n\n1. a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n3. ac + bd = 0\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express c and d in terms of a and b, or find a relationship between them.\n\nFrom condition 3: ac + bd = 0 => c = (-b d)/a.\n\nWait, but then we can substitute this into condition 2.\n\nSo, substituting c = (-b d)/a into condition 2:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n=> [ ( (-b d)/a )\u00b2 ] /20 - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n=> (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - d\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nLet me factor out d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 = 1 / [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nHmm, but I need to relate this to the hyperbola equation for point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me denote that as equation 1:\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 => Let's write this as (a\u00b2)/20 = 1 + (b\u00b2)/24 => a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 b\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nNow, let's substitute a\u00b2 into the expression for d\u00b2.\n\nWe have:\n\nd\u00b2 = 1 / [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nLet me compute (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2):\n\n= b\u00b2 / [20*(20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6)]\n\n= b\u00b2 / [400 + (100 b\u00b2)/6 ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) = b\u00b2 / (400 + (50 b\u00b2)/3 ) = [ b\u00b2 ] / [ (1200 + 50 b\u00b2)/3 ] = (3 b\u00b2) / (1200 + 50 b\u00b2 )\n\nSo, (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) = 3 b\u00b2 / (1200 + 50 b\u00b2 )\n\nThus, the expression inside the brackets for d\u00b2 becomes:\n\n3 b\u00b2 / (1200 + 50 b\u00b2 ) - 1/24\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2 = 1 / [ 3 b\u00b2 / (1200 + 50 b\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\nFirst, compute 3 b\u00b2 / (1200 + 50 b\u00b2 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n3 b\u00b2 / [ 50 b\u00b2 + 1200 ] = 3 b\u00b2 / [ 50 (b\u00b2 + 24) ]\n\n= (3/50) * b\u00b2 / (b\u00b2 + 24 )\n\nSo, denominator becomes:\n\n(3/50) * (b\u00b2)/(b\u00b2 +24) - 1/24\n\nTo combine these, let's find a common denominator.\n\nLet me write both terms over 1200 (which is 50*24):\n\n= [ (3/50)*(b\u00b2)/(b\u00b2 +24) *24 - (1/24)*50 ] / 1200\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute:\n\nLet me denote t = b\u00b2.\n\nThen, the denominator is:\n\n(3/50)*(t)/(t +24) - 1/24\n\n= [ (3 t ) / (50 (t +24) ) ] - [ 1 /24 ]\n\nTo combine them, let's get a common denominator, which is 50*24*(t +24) = 1200 (t +24 )\n\nSo,\n\n= [ (3 t ) *24 - 50 (t +24) ] / [ 1200 (t +24) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n3t *24 = 72 t\n\n50(t +24) = 50 t + 1200\n\nSo, numerator = 72 t - 50 t - 1200 = 22 t - 1200\n\nThus, the denominator becomes:\n\n[22 t -1200 ] / [ 1200 (t +24) ]\n\nSo, d\u00b2 is reciprocal of this:\n\nd\u00b2 = [1200 (t +24) ] / (22 t -1200 )\n\nBut wait, the denominator in d\u00b2 is the denominator computed above. So,\n\nd\u00b2 = 1 / [ (3 b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1 / [ (22 t -1200 ) / (1200 (t +24) ) ] = [1200 (t +24) ] / (22 t -1200 )\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = 1200 (t +24 ) / (22 t -1200 )\n\nBut t = b\u00b2, which is positive because it's a square.\n\nAlso, the denominator 22 t -1200 must not be zero, so t \u2260 1200/22 \u224854.545. Also, the denominator must be positive because d\u00b2 is positive. So,\n\n22 t -1200 >0 => t > 1200/22 \u224854.545.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 > 54.545.\n\nNow, since a\u00b2 is 20 + (5 t)/6, from earlier.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 20 + (5 t)/6.\n\nNow, let's recall that from the hyperbola equation, a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must satisfy a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWhich we already used.\n\nSo, back to BD\u00b2, which is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2).\n\nWe have c in terms of b and d: c = (-b d)/a.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2.\n\nWe can write c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = d\u00b2 (b\u00b2/a\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(d\u00b2 (b\u00b2/a\u00b2 +1 )) =4 d\u00b2 (b\u00b2/a\u00b2 +1 )\n\nBut a\u00b2 =20 + (5 t)/6 = 20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, b\u00b2/a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 / (20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6 ) = [6 b\u00b2 ] / (120 +5 b\u00b2 ) = (6 b\u00b2)/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nSo, b\u00b2/a\u00b2 +1 = [6 b\u00b2 +5 b\u00b2 +120 ] / (5 b\u00b2 +120 ) = (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =4 d\u00b2 * (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nBut d\u00b2 is given by 1200 (t +24 ) / (22 t -1200 ), where t =b\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting d\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [1200 (b\u00b2 +24 ) / (22 b\u00b2 -1200 ) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [1200 (b\u00b2 +24 ) / (22 b\u00b2 -1200 ) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n4 * 1200 =4800.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4800 * [ (b\u00b2 +24 ) / (22 b\u00b2 -1200 ) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or simplify the terms.\n\nFirst, let's note that 22 b\u00b2 -1200 = 2*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSimilarly, 5 b\u00b2 +120 =5(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nWait, no, 5 b\u00b2 +120 =5(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nBut 11 b\u00b2 +120 is 11 b\u00b2 +120.\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLooking at the two fractions:\n\n[(b\u00b2 +24 ) / (22 b\u00b2 -1200 ) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]\n\nLet me write 22 b\u00b2 -1200 as 2*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nAnd 5 b\u00b2 +120 =5(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nSo,\n\n[(b\u00b2 +24 ) / (2*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5*(b\u00b2 +24 )) ]\n\nNotice that (b\u00b2 +24 ) cancels out in numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n[1 / (2*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )) ] * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) /5 ]\n\nSo, combining:\n\n= [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) ] / [ 2*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )*5 ]\n\n= (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / [10*(11 b\u00b2 -600 ) ]\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4800 * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / (10*(11 b\u00b2 -600 )) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4800 /10 =480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 * (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / (11 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 * [ (11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / (11 b\u00b2 -600 ) ]\n\nLet me denote s =11 b\u00b2.\n\nSince b\u00b2 > 54.545, s =11 b\u00b2 > 600.\n\nSo, s >600.\n\nExpress BD\u00b2 in terms of s:\n\nBD\u00b2 =480*(s +120)/(s -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(s +120)/(s -600 )\n\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(s +120)/(s -600 )\n\nWe can write (s +120)/(s -600 ) as [ (s -600) +720 ] / (s -600 )=1 + 720/(s -600 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*[1 +720/(s -600 ) ]=480 + (480*720)/(s -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 + (345600)/(s -600 )\n\nSince s>600, (s -600 )>0, so the second term is positive. So, BD\u00b2 is greater than 480.\n\nBut we are to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, so we need to minimize BD\u00b2.\n\nSince BD\u00b2=480 + 345600/(s -600 ), and s>600, the minimal value occurs when (s -600 ) is as large as possible, which would make the second term as small as possible. Wait, no, actually, the second term is 345600/(s -600 ). So, as s increases, (s -600 ) increases, making the second term decrease, thus making BD\u00b2 approach 480 from above.\n\nWait, but s can't go to infinity because b\u00b2 is related to a\u00b2 via the hyperbola equation. So, s is 11 b\u00b2, but we must ensure that a\u00b2 is positive as well.\n\nWait, a\u00b2=20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, as b\u00b2 increases, a\u00b2 increases as well, but for the hyperbola, any real b\u00b2 is allowed as long as a\u00b2 is positive, which it always is because b\u00b2 is positive.\n\nBut we need to check if there's any upper limit on s. Since b\u00b2 can be as large as possible, s can approach infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach 480.\n\nBut is 480 the infimum of BD\u00b2? Because as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. But can BD\u00b2 actually be equal to 480? No, because s can't be infinity. So, 480 is the lower bound, but not attainable.\n\nWait, but let me think again. We have BD\u00b2=480 + 345600/(s -600 ). So, as s approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 480, but it's not attainable. So, the infimum is 480.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, the infimum is 480, meaning that BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than that. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 480, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 480, but can be as close to 480 as desired.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm if BD\u00b2 can actually approach 480.\n\nBecause s approaches infinity, which would require b\u00b2 to approach infinity, but on the hyperbola, as b\u00b2 increases, a\u00b2 also increases.\n\nBut does this cause any issues?\n\nWait, let me think about the parametrization. As b\u00b2 increases, point A moves further along the hyperbola, and so does point B, but as long as the condition ac + bd=0 is satisfied, it's possible.\n\nBut let me check if there's a lower bound higher than 480. Maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I should use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal BD\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 )\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1. c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1\n\n2. ac + bd=0, where a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut this seems complicated with multiple variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express c and d in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom condition 2: ac + bd=0 => c= (-b d)/a.\n\nSubstitute into constraint 1:\n\nc\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24=1 => [ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] /20 - d\u00b2/24=1 => (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) - d\u00b2/24=1\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1.\n\nSo, d\u00b2=1/[ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point A: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1 => a\u00b2=20(1 + b\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, a\u00b2=20 + (5 b\u00b2)/6.\n\nSubstituting into d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2=1/[ (b\u00b2)/(20*(20 +5 b\u00b2/6 )) -1/24 ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n= [ (b\u00b2)/(400 + (50 b\u00b2)/6 ) -1/24 ]\n\n= [ (6 b\u00b2)/(1200 +50 b\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]\n\n= [ (6 b\u00b2 *24 - (1200 +50 b\u00b2 )) / ( (1200 +50 b\u00b2 ) *24 ) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n6b\u00b2*24=144 b\u00b2\n\n1200 +50 b\u00b2 remains as is.\n\nSo, numerator=144 b\u00b2 -1200 -50 b\u00b2=94 b\u00b2 -1200.\n\nSo, denominator of d\u00b2 becomes:\n\n(94 b\u00b2 -1200 ) / [ (1200 +50 b\u00b2 ) *24 ]\n\nThus,\n\nd\u00b2= [ (1200 +50 b\u00b2 ) *24 ] / (94 b\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nSo, d\u00b2= [24(1200 +50 b\u00b2 ) ] / (94 b\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator:24*50=1200, so 24*(1200 +50 b\u00b2 )=24*50*(24 + b\u00b2 )=1200*(24 +b\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, 24*(1200 +50 b\u00b2 )=24*1200 +24*50 b\u00b2=28,800 +1200 b\u00b2.\n\nDenominator:94 b\u00b2 -1200.\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= (28,800 +1200 b\u00b2 )/(94 b\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1200(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nDenominator: 94 b\u00b2 -1200=2*(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2= [1200(b\u00b2 +24 ) ]/[2*(47 b\u00b2 -600 ) ]=600(b\u00b2 +24 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nThus, d\u00b2=600(b\u00b2 +24 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )=4*( (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )\n\nWait, no, from earlier, BD\u00b2=4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 )\n\nBut c= (-b d)/a, so c\u00b2= b\u00b2 d\u00b2 /a\u00b2.\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2= d\u00b2 (b\u00b2 /a\u00b2 +1 )\n\nFrom a\u00b2=20 +5 b\u00b2/6, so b\u00b2 /a\u00b2= b\u00b2 / [20 +5 b\u00b2/6 ]= (6 b\u00b2 )/[120 +5 b\u00b2 ]=6 b\u00b2/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nSo, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2= d\u00b2 [6 b\u00b2/(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) +1 ]=d\u00b2 [ (6 b\u00b2 +5 b\u00b2 +120 ) / (5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]=d\u00b2 (11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*d\u00b2*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nBut d\u00b2=600(b\u00b2 +24 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nSubstituting:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(600(b\u00b2 +24 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 ))*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(5 b\u00b2 +120 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4*600=2400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=2400*(b\u00b2 +24 )*(11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / [ (47 b\u00b2 -600 )(5 b\u00b2 +120 ) ]\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n\n(b\u00b2 +24 )*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )= (b\u00b2 +24 )*11(b\u00b2 +120/11 )\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nDenominator:\n\n(47 b\u00b2 -600 )(5 b\u00b2 +120 )= (47 b\u00b2 -600 )*5(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nWait, 5*(b\u00b2 +24 ) is part of it.\n\nSo, denominator=5*(47 b\u00b2 -600 )*(b\u00b2 +24 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=2400*(b\u00b2 +24 )*(11 b\u00b2 +120 ) / [5*(47 b\u00b2 -600 )*(b\u00b2 +24 ) ]\n\nCancel (b\u00b2 +24 ) from numerator and denominator:\n\nBD\u00b2=2400*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/[5*(47 b\u00b2 -600 ) ]\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n2400/5=480.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nLet me denote s =b\u00b2.

Alternatively, perhaps 64627200=2209*29240.\n\nWait, regardless, the fraction is 64627200/24299= (64627200)/(11*47\u00b2 )= (64627200/47\u00b2 )/11=29240/11\u22482658.18.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (5280/47 ) + [29240/11 ]/(k -600/47 )\n\nWait, I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier, perhaps it's better to proceed differently.\n\nLet me consider that BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nLet me denote s = b\u00b2.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nTo find the minimum of BD\u00b2, we can take the derivative with respect to s and set it to zero.\n\nLet me set f(s)= (11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(s):\n\nf\u2019(s)= [11*(47 s -600 ) -11 s *47 ]/(47 s -600 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11*(47 s -600 ) -47*11 s = 11*47 s -11*600 -47*11 s = -6600.\n\nSo, f\u2019(s)= -6600/(47 s -600 )\u00b2.\n\nSince s>600/47\u224812.766, the denominator is positive, so f\u2019(s) is negative. So, f(s) is decreasing for s>600/47.\n\nThus, as s increases, f(s) decreases. So, BD\u00b2=480*f(s ) is also decreasing as s increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs as s approaches infinity, which would make f(s ) approach 11/47, because as s\u2192\u221e, (11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\u224811/47.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11/47 )= (480*11)/47=5280/47\u2248112.3404.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it approached 480, but now this suggests it approaches 5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in substitution.\n\nWait, let me retrace.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nAs s\u2192\u221e, (11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\u224811/47.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*(11/47 )=5280/47\u2248112.3404.\n\nBut earlier, I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but that must have been a miscalculation.\n\nSo, actually, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/47\u2248112.34 as s increases.\n\nBut wait, let me check my substitution again.\n\nWait, no, earlier I had BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nBut in a prior step, I had another expression for BD\u00b2=480*(11 b\u00b2 +120 )/(47 b\u00b2 -600 )\n\nWait, no, s was defined as 11 b\u00b2 earlier, but in this substitution, s is b\u00b2. So, perhaps confusion in variable substitution.\n\nWait, in the latest substitution, I set s =b\u00b2, so BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 )\n\nTherefore, as s\u2192\u221e, BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(11/47 )=5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered s=11 b\u00b2, I thought of s approaching infinity leading BD\u00b2 approaching 480. But that was a different substitution.\n\nSo, actually, in this substitution, s=b\u00b2, and as s increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier conclusion when I had BD\u00b2 approaching 480. So, I must have made a mistake in substitution earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47\u2248112.34, which is approximately 112.34. But since we're dealing with exact fractions, 5280/47 is exact.\n\nWait, but 5280 \u00f747.\n\n47*112=5264.\n\n5280-5264=16.\n\nSo, 5280/47=112 +16/47=112.3404...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/47 from above as s increases.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but that was because of a substitution where s=11 b\u00b2, which led to a different limit.\n\nSo, this suggests that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, approximately 112.34, and it's the infimum.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, if f(s )=(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 ) is decreasing for s>600/47, then as s increases, f(s ) decreases, approaching 11/47.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=480*f(s ) approaches 480*(11/47 )=5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nBut since s can be as large as possible, BD\u00b2 can get as close as desired to 5280/47, but never less than that.\n\nWait, but wait, is 5280/47 the minimal BD\u00b2? Because as s increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 5280/47.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, which is approximately 112.34.\n\nBut wait, I thought earlier that BD\u00b2 approaches 480. There must be confusion in substitution.\n\nWait, in the first substitution, I had s=11 b\u00b2, which led to BD\u00b2 approaching 480. But in the second substitution, s=b\u00b2, leading to BD\u00b2 approaching 5280/47.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in substitution.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nIn the first approach, I set s=11 b\u00b2, which led to BD\u00b2=480*(s +120 )/(s -600 ) which approaches 480 as s\u2192\u221e.\n\nBut in the second approach, I set s=b\u00b2, leading to BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 ), which approaches 5280/47.\n\nBut which one is correct?\n\nWait, the second approach was after correctly substituting c and d in terms of a and b, leading to BD\u00b2=480*(11 s +120 )/(47 s -600 ).\n\nSo, that seems more accurate.\n\nBut let's check with specific values.\n\nSuppose b\u00b2=600/47\u224812.766.\n\nThen, s=b\u00b2=600/47.\n\nWait, but s must be greater than 600/47\u224812.766, since denominator 47 s -600 must be positive.\n\nAt s=600/47, denominator becomes zero, which is undefined.\n\nAs s approaches 600/47 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs s increases beyond that, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nWait, but wait, 5280/47 is approximately 112.34, but 480 is much larger.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, and it's the infimum.\n\nBut let me check with specific numbers.\n\nSuppose b\u00b2=100.\n\nThen, s=100.\n\nCompute BD\u00b2=480*(11*100 +120 )/(47*100 -600 )=480*(1100 +120 )/(4700 -600 )=480*1220/4100.\n\nCompute 1220/4100=0.29756.\n\nSo, 480*0.29756\u2248142.829.\n\nWhich is greater than 112.34.\n\nIf I take b\u00b2=1000.\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11*1000 +120 )/(47*1000 -600 )=480*(11120 )/(47000 -600 )=480*11120/46400.\n\nSimplify:\n\n11120/46400=1112/4640=278/1160=139/580\u22480.239655.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*0.239655\u2248115.83.\n\nCloser to 112.34.\n\nIf I take b\u00b2=10,000.\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11*10000 +120 )/(47*10000 -600 )=480*(110120 )/(470000 -600 )=480*110120/469400.\n\n110120/469400\u22480.2347.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u2248480*0.2347\u2248112.656.\n\nCloser to 112.34.\n\nIf I take b\u00b2=1,000,000.\n\nBD\u00b2\u2248480*(11*1e6 )/(47*1e6 )=480*11/47\u2248480*0.234\u2248112.32.\n\nSo, as b\u00b2 increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/47\u2248112.34.\n\nThus, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 5280/47.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 5280/47.\n\nBut let me check if 5280/47 is indeed the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, 5280 divided by 47 is exactly 112 and 16/47, which is approximately 112.3404.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, and it's the infimum.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. Since BD\u00b2 can approach 5280/47 from above, but never goes below it, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 5280/47.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number must be less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, so the greatest lower bound is 5280/47. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 5280/47.\n\nBut wait, 5280/47 is approximately 112.34. So, any number less than 112.34 would not be the greatest, because 112.34 is the infimum.\n\nWait, no. The infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the infimum itself, since it's the largest number that is still less than or equal to all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 approaches 5280/47 from above, so BD\u00b2 is always greater than 5280/47. Therefore, 5280/47 is the infimum, and it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 5280/47.\n\nBut let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors and inner products.\n\nLet me denote points A and B as vectors a and b from the origin.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, a\u00b7b=0.\n\nBut wait, no, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are vectors from A to C and from B to D. Wait, earlier we found that ac + bd=0, which is the condition for perpendicularity.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to model the rhombus as a parallelogram with perpendicular diagonals.\n\nBut perhaps not necessary now.\n\nGiven the above analysis, I think the minimal BD\u00b2 is 5280/47, so the answer is 5280/47.\n\nBut let me compute 5280 divided by 47.\n\n47*112=5264.\n\n5280-5264=16.\n\nSo, 5280/47=112 +16/47=112.340425533...\n\nSo, the exact value is 5280/47.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 5280/47.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus $ABCD$ on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and we aim to find the greatest real number less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombuses.\n\n1. **Conditions for the Rhombus**:\n   - Points $A = (a, b)$ and $C = (-a, -b)$ lie on the hyperbola.\n   - Points $B = (c, d)$ and $D = (-c, -d)$ also lie on the hyperbola.\n   - The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular, leading to the condition $ac + bd = 0$.\n\n2. **Hyperbola Equations**:\n   - For point $A$: $\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1$.\n   - For point $B$: $\\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1$.\n\n3. **Expression for $BD^2$**:\n   - The length of diagonal $BD$ is $2\\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}$, so $BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)$.\n   - Using the condition $ac + bd = 0$, we express $c$ in terms of $d$ and substitute into the hyperbola equation for $B$.\n\n4. **Simplification and Substitution**:\n   - After substituting and simplifying, we find that $BD^2$ can be expressed in terms of $b^2$ as $BD^2 = 480 \\cdot \\frac{11b^2 + 120}{47b^2 - 600}$.\n   - Analyzing this expression, we determine that as $b^2$ approaches infinity, $BD^2$ approaches $\\frac{5280}{47} \\approx 112.34$.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The infimum of $BD^2$ is $\\frac{5280}{47}$, which is the greatest lower bound for all such rhombuses.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombuses is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{5280}{47}}$.",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that's less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yeah, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So they intersect at right angles. Okay, that's good to remember.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola as well. The hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. So, the vertices are at (\u00b1\u221a20, 0), which is approximately (\u00b14.472, 0).\n\nNow, the rhombus is formed by four points on this hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal is a line passing through the origin. Also, since the diagonals bisect each other, each vertex of the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric across the origin as well.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily the axes, but they can be any two perpendicular lines through the origin. So, the diagonals could be at any angle, as long as they are perpendicular. So, maybe the rhombus can be rotated in such a way that the diagonals are not aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\nBut given that all four points lie on the hyperbola, perhaps there's a relationship between the slopes of the diagonals and the points where they intersect the hyperbola.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, their slopes would be negative reciprocals of each other. Suppose one diagonal has a slope m, then the other would have a slope -1/m.\n\nLet me parametrize the points. Since the diagonals pass through the origin, points A and C lie along one diagonal, and points B and D lie along the other diagonal. Let's denote the coordinates of A as (a, ma), since it lies on a line with slope m through the origin. Similarly, point C would be (-a, -ma). Similarly, point B can be (b, (-1/m)b), since it's on the other diagonal with slope -1/m, and point D would be (-b, (1/m)b).\n\nWait, let me think. If diagonal AC has slope m, then points A and C are (a, ma) and (-a, -ma). Similarly, diagonal BD has slope -1/m, so points B and D are (b, (-1/m)b) and (-b, (1/m)b). That makes sense because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, plugging point A into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(a\u00b2)/20 - ( (ma)\u00b2 )/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, plugging in point B:\n\n(b\u00b2)/20 - ( (-b/m)\u00b2 )/24 = 1.\n\nWait, because point B is (b, (-1/m)b). So, plugging into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(b\u00b2)/20 - ( ( (-1/m b )\u00b2 ) /24 ) = 1.\n\nSo, that would be (b\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSo, both points A and B lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates must satisfy these equations.\n\nLet me write these equations again.\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFor point B: (b\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2) = 1.\n\nI can factor these equations.\n\nFor point A: a\u00b2 [1/20 - m\u00b2/24] = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: b\u00b2 [1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)] = 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, a\u00b2 is equal to 1 divided by [1/20 - m\u00b2/24], and similarly, b\u00b2 is 1 divided by [1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)].\n\nWait, but we can write this as:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / [ (1/20) - (m\u00b2 /24) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = 1 / [ (1/20) - (1/(24 m\u00b2)) ]\n\nHmm, but for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 to be real numbers, the denominators must be positive. So,\n\n(1/20) - (m\u00b2 /24) > 0, and\n\n(1/20) - (1/(24 m\u00b2)) > 0.\n\nSo, let's solve for m\u00b2 in these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n1/20 - m\u00b2/24 > 0\n\n=> m\u00b2/24 < 1/20\n\n=> m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5 = 1.2\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) > 0\n\n=> 1/(24 m\u00b2) < 1/20\n\n=> 24 m\u00b2 > 20\n\n=> m\u00b2 > 20/24 = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333\n\nSo, m\u00b2 must be greater than 5/6 and less than 6/5.\n\nSo, 5/6 < m\u00b2 < 6/5.\n\nWhich is approximately 0.8333 < m\u00b2 < 1.2.\n\nSo, m can be any real number such that its square is in that interval. So, m can be between sqrt(5/6) and sqrt(6/5), approximately between 0.9129 and 1.0954.\n\nOkay, so that gives us the range of possible slopes m for the diagonals.\n\nNow, the problem asks for BD\u00b2. Wait, BD is one of the diagonals. Wait, BD is the diagonal connecting points B and D. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, BD is the other diagonal.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the two diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is the diagonal with slope m, and BD is the diagonal with slope -1/m.\n\nSo, the length of diagonal AC is the distance between points A and C, which are (a, ma) and (-a, -ma). The distance between them is sqrt[ (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (ma - (-ma))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2a)\u00b2 + (2ma)\u00b2 ] = 2a sqrt(1 + m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, the length of BD is the distance between points B and D, which are (b, (-1/m)b) and (-b, (1/m)b). So, the distance is sqrt[ (b - (-b))\u00b2 + ( (-1/m b) - (1/m b) )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2b)^2 + ( (-2/m b) )^2 ] = 2b sqrt(1 + (1/m\u00b2)).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is [2b sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 is [2a sqrt(1 + m\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 (1 + m\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, I think the problem is asking for BD\u00b2, so I need to find BD\u00b2 in terms of m.\n\nBut let's see, from the earlier equations, I have expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2.\n\nFrom point A:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - m\u00b2/24] = 1 / [ (6 - 5m\u00b2)/120 ] = 120 / (6 -5 m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from point B:\n\nb\u00b2 = 1 / [1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)] = 1 / [ (12 m\u00b2 -5 ) / (240 m\u00b2) ) ] = 240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 4b\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2).\n\nPlugging in b\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * [240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ) ] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify this expression.\n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + 1/m\u00b2) = (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 ) ] * (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe m\u00b2 in the numerator cancels with the m\u00b2 in the denominator.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 * 240 * (m\u00b2 +1 ) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nWhich is BD\u00b2 = 960 * (m\u00b2 +1 ) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of m\u00b2. Let's denote t = m\u00b2.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = 960 (t +1 ) / (12 t -5 )\n\nWe need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD\u00b2 for t in (5/6, 6/5).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or is it the supremum? Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, right? Because it's the greatest number that is below all BD\u00b2 values.\n\nWait, let me think. If I have multiple rhombi, each with their own BD\u00b2. We're to find the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2. So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 as t varies in (5/6, 6/5). Because the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose BD\u00b2 can take a range of values. The minimal BD\u00b2 is the smallest possible value of BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the minimal BD\u00b2. Because if you pick any number less than that, it would be less than all BD\u00b2. But if you pick the minimal BD\u00b2, it's equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, so it's not less than all. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the infimum, which is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum. Because the infimum is the greatest lower bound. So, if I have BD\u00b2 >= k for all rhombi, then k is the infimum.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which is the infimum.\n\nSo, let's find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 as t varies between 5/6 and 6/5.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2 = 960 (t +1 ) / (12 t -5 )\n\nLet me denote f(t) = 960 (t +1 ) / (12 t -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(t) for t in (5/6, 6/5).\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t, set it equal to zero, and solve for t.\n\nBut before that, let me simplify f(t):\n\nf(t) = 960 (t +1) / (12 t -5 )\n\nLet me compute the derivative f\u2019(t):\n\nf\u2019(t) = 960 [ (1)(12 t -5 ) - (t +1)(12) ] / (12 t -5 )\u00b2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= 960 [ (12 t -5 ) - 12(t +1) ] / (12 t -5 )\u00b2\n\n= 960 [12 t -5 -12 t -12 ] / (12 t -5 )\u00b2\n\n= 960 [ (-17) ] / (12 t -5 )\u00b2\n\n= -960 *17 / (12 t -5 )\u00b2\n\nSo, f\u2019(t) is negative for all t in (5/6, 6/5), because the denominator is positive (since 12t -5 > 0 when t >5/12, which is certainly true here as t >5/6 \u22480.8333).\n\nSo, f(t) is decreasing on (5/6, 6/5). Therefore, the minimal value occurs at the right end of the interval, which is t =6/5.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Since f(t) is decreasing, as t increases, f(t) decreases. So, the maximum value of f(t) is at t=5/6, and the minimal value is at t=6/5.\n\nWait, but wait, when t approaches 5/6 from the right, 12 t -5 approaches 12*(5/6) -5 = 10 -5 =5, so it's positive. At t=6/5, 12*(6/5) -5= 72/5 -25/5=47/5=9.4.\n\nSo, f(t) is decreasing from t=5/6 to t=6/5, so f(t) is largest at t=5/6, and smallest at t=6/5.\n\nThus, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(6/5).\n\nSo, let's compute f(6/5):\n\nf(6/5) = 960 ( (6/5) +1 ) / (12*(6/5) -5 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(6/5 +1) = (6/5 +5/5)=11/5.\n\nDenominator:\n\n12*(6/5) -5 = (72/5) -25/5=47/5.\n\nSo, f(6/5) = 960*(11/5) / (47/5 ) = 960*(11/5)*(5/47) = 960*(11)/47.\n\nSimplify 960/47.\n\nWell, 47*20=940, 960-940=20, so 960=47*20 +20, which is 47*20 +20=20*(47+1)=20*48=960.\n\nWait, wait, 47*20=940, 960=940+20, so 960=47*20 +20=20*(47 +1)=20*48.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 47*20=940, 960-940=20, so 960=47*20 +20=20*(47 +1)=20*48=960. So, 960=20*48.\n\nWait, but 48=47 +1, so 960=20*(47 +1)=20*47 +20=940 +20=960. So, 960/47= (20*47 +20)/47=20 +20/47=20 + (20/47).\n\nSo, 960/47=20 +20/47\u224820.4255.\n\nSo, f(6/5)= (960 *11)/47= (960/47)*11=20.4255 *11\u2248224.68.\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n960 divided by 47:\n\n47*20=940, 960-940=20, so 960=47*20 +20.\n\nSo, 960/47=20 +20/47=20 + (20/47).\n\nSo, 960/47=20 +20/47.\n\nSo, 960*11= (960)*(10 +1)=9600 +960=10560.\n\n10560 divided by47.\n\nLet me compute 47*224=47*(200 +24)=47*200 +47*24=9400 + 1128=10528.\n\n10560 -10528=32.\n\nSo, 10560=47*224 +32.\n\nSo, 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\nSo, 32/47\u22480.6809.\n\nSo, 224 +0.6809\u2248224.6809.\n\nSo, f(6/5)=224 +32/47.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 224 +32/47.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 224 +32/47.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because when t approaches 5/6 from above, what happens to BD\u00b2?\n\nAt t approaching 5/6 from above, denominator 12t -5 approaches 12*(5/6) -5=10 -5=5, so f(t)=960*(t+1)/(12t-5).\n\nSo, when t approaches 5/6, (t+1) approaches 5/6 +1=11/6\u22481.8333.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches 960*(11/6)/5=960*(11)/(6*5)=960*11/30= (960/30)*11=32*11=352.\n\nSo, as t approaches 5/6, f(t) approaches 352.\n\nAnd as t approaches 6/5, f(t) approaches 224 +32/47\u2248224.68.\n\nSo, since f(t) is decreasing from 352 down to approximately 224.68 as t increases from 5/6 to 6/5, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 224 +32/47.\n\nWait, but let me compute 32/47 exactly. 32 divided by47 is approximately 0.68085.\n\nSo, 224.68085.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as approximately224.68, and as large as 352.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 224 +32/47.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be this minimal BD\u00b2, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to this value.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can take. Because for any number less than that, it's not a lower bound, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, no, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to some value, then that value is the infimum, and any number less than that would not be a lower bound. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum.\n\nWait, but the infimum is 224 +32/47, which is approximately224.68. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 224 +32/47, but since it's attainable, it's actually the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's check if BD\u00b2 can actually reach that value. When t approaches 6/5 from below, f(t) approaches 224 +32/47.\n\nBut when t=6/5, is that allowed? Because t must be less than 6/5, since m\u00b2 approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nWait, no, the interval for t is (5/6,6/5). So, t approaches 6/5, but doesn't reach it, because t must be less than6/5.\n\nWait, but earlier, we found that t must be in (5/6,6/5). So, t can approach 6/5 but can't equal it, because when t=6/5, 12t-5=47/5, which is positive, but let's check the original equations.\n\nWait, when t approaches 6/5, then in the expression for a\u00b2, which is 120/(6-5t).\n\nWait, no, wait, when t approaches 6/5 from below, 6-5t approaches 6 -5*(6/5)=6-6=0. So, a\u00b2 approaches infinity, which would make point A go off to infinity, which isn't practical.\n\nWait, no, wait, no, a\u00b2=120/(6-5t). So, when t approaches6/5, 6-5t approaches0 from above, because t is approaching6/5 from below, so 6-5t approaches0 from positive side, making a\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when t approaches5/6 from above, 12t-5 approaches5 from above, so in the expression for b\u00b2, which is 240 t\u00b2/(12t\u00b2 -5), wait, no, wait, b\u00b2=240 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )=240 t/(12t -5 ). So, when t approaches5/6 from above, 12t-5 approaches5, so b\u00b2 approaches240*(5/6)/5=240*(5/6)/5=240*(1/6)=40.\n\nSo, as t approaches5/6 from above, b\u00b2 approaches40, which is finite, and a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, when t approaches6/5, a\u00b2 approaches infinity, but b\u00b2 approaches?\n\nLet me compute b\u00b2 when t approaches6/5:\n\nb\u00b2=240 t/(12 t -5 ). When t=6/5, 12t-5=12*(6/5)-5=72/5 -25/5=47/5.\n\nSo, b\u00b2=240*(6/5)/(47/5)=240*(6/5)*(5/47)=240*6/47=1440/47\u224830.638.\n\nSo, as t approaches6/5, b\u00b2 approaches1440/47\u224830.638, and a\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches f(t)=960*(t +1)/(12t-5 )=960*(6/5 +1)/(12*(6/5)-5)=960*(11/5)/(47/5)=960*(11/5)*(5/47)=960*11/47=10560/47\u2248224.6809.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches this value as t approaches6/5 from below.\n\nBut since t can't reach6/5, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to this value but never actually reach it.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 10560/47, which is approximately224.6809.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but let me check: 10560 divided by47.\n\nI think earlier calculation showed that 47*224=10528, and 10560-10528=32, so 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\nSo, 32/47 is approximately0.6809, so 224.6809.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 approaches this value but never actually reaches it, the infimum is 10560/47, and it's the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut let me confirm the calculation.\n\nWait, f(t)=960*(t+1)/(12t-5).\n\nAt t=6/5, f(t)=960*(6/5 +1)/(12*(6/5)-5)=960*(11/5)/(47/5)=960*11/47=10560/47.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47, which is approximately224.6809.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10560/47, which is an integer?\n\nWait, 10560 divided by47.\n\nWait, 47*224=10528, as before, and 10560-10528=32, so 10560=47*224 +32, so 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\nBut 32/47 is a fraction, so the answer is 10560/47, which is the exact value.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can approach 10560/47 but never be less than it, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but 10560/47 is approximately224.6809. So, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 10560/47, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 10560/47, but since BD\u00b2 can be as close as desired to 10560/47, it's the infimum.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that's the infimum.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 10560/47, which is approximately224.6809.\n\nBut let me check if this is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier I thought f(t) is decreasing, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is at t=6/5, but since t cannot reach6/5, the minimal BD\u00b2 is the limit as t approaches6/5 from below, which is 10560/47.\n\nSo, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.\n\nWait, earlier, I computed f(t)=960*(t +1)/(12t -5).\n\nThen, f\u2019(t)= -960*17/(12t -5 )\u00b2, which is negative. So, f(t) is decreasing on the interval.\n\nSo, the minimal value is at the right end of the interval, which is t approaching6/5.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10560/47, which is approximately224.6809.\n\nBut the problem asks for an integer, as the final answer is within \\boxed{}.\n\nWait, wait, 10560 divided by47.\n\nWait, 47*224=10528, 10560-10528=32, so 10560=47*224 +32, so 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\nSo, 10560/47 is not an integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 960*(t+1)/(12t-5) when t=6/5.\n\nt=6/5: t+1=6/5 +5/5=11/5.\n\n12t-5=12*(6/5) -5=72/5 -25/5=47/5.\n\nSo, f(t)=960*(11/5)/(47/5)=960*(11/5)*(5/47)=960*11/47.\n\n960*11=10560.\n\nSo, 10560/47.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can reduce this fraction.\n\nLet me see, 47 is a prime number.\n\nDoes 47 divide into 10560?\n\nWell, 47*224=10528, as before, and 10560-10528=32, so no, it doesn't divide evenly.\n\nSo, 10560/47 is the exact value.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, which is 10560/47.\n\nWait, but the problem might expect an integer, but 10560/47 is approximately224.68, which is not an integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the initial setup.\n\nWe had points A(a, ma), B(b, -b/m), etc., lying on the hyperbola.\n\nPlugging into hyperbola equation:\n\nFor A: a\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo, a\u00b2=1/(1/20 -m\u00b2/24)=1/( (6 -5m\u00b2)/120 )=120/(6 -5m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, for B: b\u00b2/20 - (b\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2)=1.\n\nSo, b\u00b2=1/(1/20 -1/(24 m\u00b2))=1/( (12 m\u00b2 -5)/24 m\u00b2 )=24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4b\u00b2 (1 +1/m\u00b2 )=4*(24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ))*( (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n4*24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ) * (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2= 96 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )*(m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2=96 (m\u00b2 +1 )/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nWait, earlier I wrote BD\u00b2=960*(t +1)/(12t -5 ), but now I'm getting 96*(t +1)/(12t -5 ).\n\nWait, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the constants?\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nFrom point A: a\u00b2=120/(6-5m\u00b2).\n\nFrom point B: b\u00b2=24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4b\u00b2 (1 +1/m\u00b2 )=4*(24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ))*(1 +1/m\u00b2 )\n\n=4*(24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ))*( (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2 )\n\n=4*24 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )*(m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2\n\n=96 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )*(m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2\n\n=96 (m\u00b2 +1 )/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nAh, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought BD\u00b2 was 960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ). It's actually 96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nBecause 4*24=96, not 960.\n\nSo, that changes everything.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nSo, f(t)=96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 960, but it's 96.\n\nSo, let's recast the problem with f(t)=96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nSo, with t in (5/6,6/5).\n\nCompute f(t) at t=5/6 and t=6/5.\n\nAt t=5/6:\n\nf(5/6)=96*(5/6 +1)/(12*(5/6)-5 )=96*(11/6)/(10 -5 )=96*(11/6)/5=96*(11)/(6*5)=96*11/30= (96/30)*11= (16/5)*11=176/5=35.2.\n\nWait, that can't be right because BD\u00b2 is a squared distance, which for a hyperbola should be larger.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me compute f(t)=96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nAt t=5/6:\n\nt=5/6.\n\nt+1=5/6 +6/6=11/6.\n\n12t-5=12*(5/6)-5=10-5=5.\n\nSo, f(5/6)=96*(11/6)/5=96*(11)/(6*5)=96*11/30= (96/30)*11= (16/5)*11=176/5=35.2.\n\nWait, but that seems small for a BD\u00b2 on a hyperbola. Let me check.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, so the vertices are at x=\u00b1\u221a20\u2248\u00b14.472.\n\nIf BD is a diagonal, perhaps its length could be around that.\n\nWait, but let me check when t approaches6/5.\n\nAt t=6/5, t+1=6/5 +5/5=11/5.\n\n12t-5=12*(6/5)-5=72/5 -25/5=47/5.\n\nSo, f(t)=96*(11/5)/(47/5)=96*(11/5)*(5/47)=96*11/47=1056/47\u224822.468.\n\nWait, that's even smaller.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when t approaches5/6, BD\u00b2 approaches35.2, and when t approaches6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches22.468.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought BD\u00b2 was 960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ), I had BD\u00b2 approaching224.68 and 352, but that was a mistake. The correct BD\u00b2 is 96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ), which is much smaller.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let me go back to the beginning.\n\nThe points are A(a, ma), B(b, -b/m), C(-a, -ma), D(-b, b/m).\n\nWait, no, point D should be (-b, (1/m)b ), because the diagonal BD has slope -1/m.\n\nWait, no, wait: The diagonal BD has slope -1/m, so points B and D lie on this line.\n\nWait, point B is (b, y), and point D is (-b, y'), and since the diagonal passes through the origin with slope -1/m, then y' = (-1/m)*(-b)=b/m.\n\nSo, point D is (-b, b/m).\n\nSo, BD is the distance between (b, -b/m) and (-b, b/m).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (b - (-b))\u00b2 + ( (-b/m) - (b/m) )\u00b2= (2b)^2 + ( -2b/m )\u00b2=4b\u00b2 +4b\u00b2/m\u00b2=4b\u00b2(1 +1/m\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThen, from point B lying on the hyperbola:\n\nb\u00b2/20 - ( (-b/m )\u00b2 )/24=1.\n\nWhich is b\u00b2/20 - (b\u00b2/m\u00b2 )/24=1.\n\nWhich is b\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 )=1.\n\nSo, factoring b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [1/20 -1/(24 m\u00b2 ) ]=1.\n\nSo, b\u00b2=1/[1/20 -1/(24 m\u00b2 ) ]=1/[ (12 m\u00b2 -5 )/(240 m\u00b2 ) ]=240 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4b\u00b2(1 +1/m\u00b2 )=4*(240 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ))*(1 +1/m\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, that's 4*(240 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ))*( (m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2 )=4*240 m\u00b2/(12 m\u00b2 -5 )*(m\u00b2 +1)/m\u00b2= 960*(m\u00b2 +1 )/(12 m\u00b2 -5 ).\n\nWait, so earlier I had 960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ), but in the correction, I thought it was 96*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ). But that was incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct expression is BD\u00b2=960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ).\n\nSo, that brings me back to the initial calculation where BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/47\u2248224.68.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nBut when I recompute f(t)=960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ), with t in (5/6,6/5).\n\nAt t=5/6:\n\nf(5/6)=960*(5/6 +1)/(12*(5/6) -5 )=960*(11/6)/(10 -5 )=960*(11/6)/5=960*(11)/(6*5)=960*11/30= (960/30)*11=32*11=352.\n\nAt t=6/5:\n\nf(6/5)=960*(6/5 +1)/(12*(6/5) -5 )=960*(11/5)/(72/5 -25/5 )=960*(11/5)/(47/5 )=960*(11/5)*(5/47 )=960*11/47=10560/47\u2248224.6809.\n\nSo, with f(t)=960*(t +1 )/(12t -5 ), which is decreasing as t increases from5/6 to6/5.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/47\u2248224.6809.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/47.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 can approach 10560/47 from above, the infimum is 10560/47, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut let me confirm that 10560/47 is indeed the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nYes, because as t approaches6/5, BD\u00b2 approaches10560/47, and for all t in (5/6,6/5), BD\u00b2>10560/47.\n\nSo, 10560/47 is the minimal value, and thus the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut let me compute 10560 divided by47 exactly.\n\n47*224=47*(200+24)=9400+1128=10528.\n\n10560-10528=32.\n\nSo, 10560=47*224 +32.\n\nSo, 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\n32/47 is approximately0.6809.\n\nSo, 10560/47\u2248224.6809.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 10560/47 but never less than it, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10560/47.\n\nBut the problem asks for an integer. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's a real number, not necessarily integer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user wrote: \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So, perhaps it's expecting an exact fraction, which is 10560/47.\n\nBut let me check if this fraction can be simplified.\n\n47 is a prime number. 10560 \u00f747.\n\nAs computed earlier, 47*224=10528, 10560-10528=32.\n\nSo, 10560=47*224 +32, so 10560/47=224 +32/47.\n\nSo, it cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, the exact value is 10560/47, which is approximately224.6809.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{10560}{47}}.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 10560/47, which is the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the answer is 10560/47.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus formed by points \\( A, B, C, D \\) on the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, that's a square. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's right. Let me confirm: a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So yes, they intersect at right angles.\n\nSo, given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so each diagonal is split into two equal parts by the origin.\n\nSo, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then the opposite point C is such that the midpoint of AC is the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v).\n\nWait, but wait, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then points A and C are opposite, and B and D are opposite. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and similarly for B and D.\n\nBut then, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on. Alternatively, another approach is that since the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe we can use the properties of the hyperbola and the rhombus to find the conditions on the points.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think in terms of coordinates. Let me suppose that point A is (x, y) on the hyperbola. Then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (u, v), and point D is (-u, -v). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, if AC has a slope of (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, BD has a slope of (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1, so yv = -ux.\n\nHmm, that's one condition. Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides should be equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C. Let's write that down.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2]\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2]\n\nSo, setting AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2:\n\n(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: (u\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2) + (v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2)\nRight: (x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2)\n\nSet them equal:\n\nu\u00b2 - 2ux + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - 2vy + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ux + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2vy + v\u00b2\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: u\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ux - 2vy\nRight: u\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2ux + 2vy\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = 4ux + 4vy\n\nSo, 4ux + 4vy = 0 => ux + vy = 0.\n\nBut from earlier, we had yv = -ux. So, substituting, since ux = -yv, then:\n\n(-yv)x + vy = 0 => -xyv + vy = 0 => vy(-x + 1) = 0.\n\nHmm, so either vy = 0 or (-x +1) = 0.\n\nCase 1: vy = 0.\n\nIf vy = 0, then either v=0 or y=0.\n\nIf v=0, then from the hyperbola equation, since B is (u, 0), plugging into the hyperbola equation: u\u00b2/20 - 0 =1 => u\u00b2=20 => u=\u00b1\u221a20=\u00b12\u221a5.\n\nSimilarly, if y=0, then point A is (x,0), so x\u00b2/20=1 => x=\u00b12\u221a5. But then point C is (-x, 0). But in this case, if y=0, then from the first condition, yv = -ux => 0 = -ux => u=0. But if u=0, then point B is (0, v), which must lie on the hyperbola. So, 0 - v\u00b2/24 =1 => v\u00b2 = -24, which is impossible. So, y cannot be zero because that would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, vy=0 implies v=0.\n\nSo, if v=0, then point B is (\u00b12\u221a5, 0), and point D is ( \u22132\u221a5, 0). So, the rhombus would have points A, C on the hyperbola and points B, D on the x-axis. But wait, points A and C would be (x, y) and (-x, -y), but in this case, points B and D are on the x-axis, so maybe this is a degenerate case where the rhombus is actually a line segment along the x-axis? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe points A and C are on the y-axis, but since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, it doesn't pass through the y-axis because x\u00b2 can't be negative. So, the points A and C can't be on the y-axis, but they can be on the x-axis.\n\nWait, if point A is (2\u221a5, 0), then point C is (-2\u221a5, 0). Then points B and D would be (2\u221a5, 0) and (-2\u221a5, 0), but that would make all four points the same as A and C, which doesn't form a rhombus. So perhaps this case isn't valid, meaning that the only possibility is that (-x +1)=0, so x=1.\n\nWait, but that would mean that x=1. So, from the earlier condition, we have x=1.\n\nSo, if x=1, then from the hyperbola equation, 1\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 => 1/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 => -y\u00b2/24=19/20 => y\u00b2= - (19/20)*24= - (19*24)/20 = - (456)/20 = -22.8, which is impossible because y\u00b2 can't be negative. So, this suggests that this case leads to a contradiction, meaning that our assumption that AB=BC leads us only to the case where either v=0 or x=1, but both lead to contradictions, which suggests that perhaps my initial approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, perhaps I can parameterize the points using hyperbola parameters.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, let me use that. So, let me let point A be (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6.\n\nSo, point A is (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8), and point C is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, the other diagonal BD must be perpendicular to AC. So, the slope of AC is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-2\u221a6 tan\u03b8 - 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)/(-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 - 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8) = (-4\u221a6 tan\u03b8)/(-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8) = (\u221a6 tan\u03b8)/(\u221a5 sec\u03b8) = (\u221a6 /\u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nBecause tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8 and sec\u03b8=1/cos\u03b8, so tan\u03b8/sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8.\n\nSo, the slope of AC is (\u221a6 /\u221a5) sin\u03b8.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the slope of BD must be the negative reciprocal. So, slope of BD is -\u221a5/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8).\n\nBut BD is the other diagonal, so it passes through the origin and has slope m = -\u221a5/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8). So, points B and D lie on this line.\n\nLet me denote point B as (u, v) which lies on BD, so v = m u = [-\u221a5/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8)] u.\n\nSince B is on the hyperbola, we have u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSubstituting v:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ ( (-\u221a5/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8) ) u )\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nSimplify:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) u\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nCompute the second term:\n\n[5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) * u\u00b2 ] /24 = 5 u\u00b2/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * 24) = 5 u\u00b2/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - 5 u\u00b2/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) =1\n\nFactor out u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] =1\n\nLet me compute the expression in the brackets:\n\n1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100)/(20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8)\n\nWait, let me find a common denominator:\n\nThe common denominator is 20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\n(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) - (100)/(20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100]/(20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nu\u00b2 [ (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100) / (20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] =1\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 = [20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 )\n\nSimilarly, since 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 must not be zero, and also, the denominator must be positive for u\u00b2 to be positive.\n\nSo,\n\n144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100 > 0 => sin\u00b2\u03b8 > 100/144 = 25/36 => |sin\u03b8| > 5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 >5/6 or sin\u03b8 < -5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be in the range where |sin\u03b8| >5/6.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 \u22655/6 or sin\u03b8 \u2264 -5/6.\n\nOkay, now, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, we can relate points A and B.\n\nBut I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the length of the diagonal BD. Since BD is from point B(u, v) to D(-u, -v). So, the length BD is sqrt[ (-u - u)^2 + (-v - v)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-2u)^2 + (-2v)^2 ] = sqrt[4u\u00b2 +4v\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, I need to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Since v = m u = (-\u221a5/(\u221a6 sin\u03b8)) u, so v\u00b2 = (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) u\u00b2.\n\nThus, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 [1 + 5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4 u\u00b2 [1 +5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nBut from earlier, we have u\u00b2 = [20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8]/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100).\n\nSo, substitute u\u00b2 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)] * [1 +5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 +5/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8)\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)] * [ (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ]\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 4 * 20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 4*20*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 80*144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 11520 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nDenominator: (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)\n\nNext, multiply by (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)/(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8):\n\nSo, numerator becomes 11520 sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)\n\nDenominator becomes (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100) * 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = [11520 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nWe can factor out 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 11520 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5) = 11520 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 * (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)\nDenominator: 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100) = 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)\n\nSo, 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cancels out:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [11520 (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)\n\nSimplify 11520 / 144: 11520 \u00f7 144 = 80. Because 144 * 80 = 11520.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [80 (6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100)\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 80*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5) = 80*6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 80*5 = 480 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +400\n\nDenominator: 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100 = 4*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nWait, 144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100 = 4*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nWait, 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 = (6 sin\u03b8)^2 -5^2 = (6 sin\u03b8 -5)(6 sin\u03b8 +5)\n\nSo, denominator: 4*(6 sin\u03b8 -5)(6 sin\u03b8 +5)\n\nNumerator: 480 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +400 = 80*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5) = 80*5 + 80*6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 400 + 480 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWait, perhaps factor numerator:\n\n480 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +400 = 80*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5) = 80*5*( (6/5) sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 ). Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100] = [80*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [4*(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)] = [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25]\n\nHmm, maybe that's better.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25]\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [ (6 sin\u03b8)^2 -5^2 ) ]\n\nWhich is [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [ (6 sin\u03b8 -5)(6 sin\u03b8 +5) ) ]\n\nNow, perhaps I can perform some substitution here.\n\nLet me set t = 6 sin\u03b8. Since |sin\u03b8| >5/6, so t =6 sin\u03b8 => |t| >5.\n\nSo, t >5 or t < -5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n[20*(t\u00b2 +5)] / [t\u00b2 -25]\n\nBecause 6 sin\u03b8 = t, so 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = t\u00b2/6? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 6 sin\u03b8 = t => sin\u03b8 = t/6.\n\nSo, 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =6*(t\u00b2/36) = t\u00b2/6.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Maybe better to keep t =6 sin\u03b8.\n\nWait, if t=6 sin\u03b8, then sin\u03b8 = t/6, so 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =6*(t\u00b2/36)= t\u00b2/6.\n\nWait, so 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 = t\u00b2/6 +5 = (t\u00b2 +30)/6.\n\nSimilarly, t\u00b2 -25 is just t\u00b2 -25.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [20*( (t\u00b2 +30)/6 ) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [20*(t\u00b2 +30)/6 ] / (t\u00b2 -25) = [ (20/6)(t\u00b2 +30) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 ) = [ (10/3)(t\u00b2 +30) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nWhich is:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (10/3) * (t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25)\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (10/3) * [ (t\u00b2 -25 +55) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nBecause 30 = -25 +55.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = (10/3) * [1 + 55/(t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\nHmm, that might be helpful.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (10/3) * [1 + 55/(t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\nNow, since t\u00b2 >25 (because |t|>5), so t\u00b2 -25>0. Let me denote s = t\u00b2 -25, so s>0.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = (10/3) * [1 + 55/s ] = (10/3) * [ (s +55)/s ] = (10/3)*(s +55)/s.\n\nWhich is (10/3)*(1 +55/s )\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of s, which is t\u00b2 -25, and s>0.\n\nWait, but s can be any positive real number because t\u00b2 can be any number greater than 25. So, s can range from just above 0 to infinity.\n\nSo, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, that is, the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2 as s approaches certain limits.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, which is the minimum if it's attainable, otherwise the limit.\n\nSo, let's see. Let me write BD\u00b2 as a function of s:\n\nBD\u00b2(s) = (10/3)*(1 +55/s ) = (10/3) + (550)/(3s)\n\nSince s>0, as s approaches 0 from the right, BD\u00b2(s) approaches infinity. As s approaches infinity, BD\u00b2(s) approaches 10/3.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 10/3, approached as s approaches infinity.\n\nBut wait, can s actually approach infinity? Let's see.\n\ns = t\u00b2 -25, where t=6 sin\u03b8, and |t|=|6 sin\u03b8|>5, so t can be any real number with |t|>5. So, t can approach infinity, making s approach infinity.\n\nSo, as t approaches infinity, s approaches infinity, and BD\u00b2 approaches 10/3.\n\nBut does BD\u00b2 ever actually attain 10/3? No, because s can't be infinity, but it can get arbitrarily close. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 10/3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 10/3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let me see if there's a lower value.\n\nWait, when s approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 10/3. When s approaches zero from the right, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, 10/3 is the minimum value, but since s can't be infinity, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 10/3.\n\nWait, so the infimum is 10/3, meaning that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 10/3 but never less than that. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10/3.\n\nWait, but let me check for s=25, which would correspond to t\u00b2=50, t=\u221a50\u22487.07.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should double-check my earlier steps for any algebraic errors.\n\nWait, going back, when I expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of t, I had BD\u00b2 = (10/3)*(t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25). Let me compute this when t approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, t\u00b2 dominates, so (t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25) approaches 1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 10/3.\n\nSimilarly, when t approaches 5 from above, t\u00b2 approaches 25 from above, so denominator approaches 0, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal value is 10/3, which is the limit as t approaches infinity.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10/3.\n\nWait, but 10/3 is approximately 3.333. Let me just confirm if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-examine.\n\nI had:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25]\n\nWhich I expressed in terms of t=6 sin\u03b8, leading to:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (10/3)*(t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWait, but let's compute t\u00b2:\n\nt =6 sin\u03b8, so t\u00b2=36 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = t\u00b2/6.\n\nWait, earlier I think I messed up the substitution. Let me redo that.\n\nWait, from t=6 sin\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 = t/6.\n\nSo, 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =6*(t\u00b2/36)= t\u00b2/6.\n\nSo, 6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5 = t\u00b2/6 +5 = (t\u00b2 +30)/6.\n\nAnd 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25 = t\u00b2 -25.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = [20*(6 sin\u00b2\u03b8 +5)] / [36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25] = [20*( (t\u00b2 +30)/6 ) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nWhich is [20*(t\u00b2 +30)/6 ] / (t\u00b2 -25 ) = [ (20/6)*(t\u00b2 +30) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 ) = (10/3)*(t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (10/3)*(t\u00b2 +30)/(t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nLet me express this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (10/3)*[ (t\u00b2 -25 +55) ] / (t\u00b2 -25 ) = (10/3)*[1 +55/(t\u00b2 -25)]\n\nSo, as t approaches infinity, t\u00b2 -25 approaches infinity, so 55/(t\u00b2 -25) approaches zero, making BD\u00b2 approach (10/3)*1 =10/3.\n\nSo, yes, 10/3 is the infimum.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 10/3.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number is 10/3, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 10/3, and 10/3 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that this is indeed the case. Let me pick a specific value of \u03b8 where t is large and see what BD\u00b2 is.\n\nFor example, let me take \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 =1, so t=6*1=6.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 = (10/3)*(6\u00b2 +30)/(6\u00b2 -25) = (10/3)*(36 +30)/(36 -25) = (10/3)*(66)/(11) = (10/3)*6 =20.\n\nHmm, that's 20, which is larger than 10/3.\n\nWait, but when t is very large, say t=1000, then BD\u00b2\u2248 (10/3)*(1000\u00b2)/(1000\u00b2) =10/3.\n\nSo, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 10/3.\n\nSo, 10/3 is the lower bound, and BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 10/3 as desired by choosing t sufficiently large, but it can't be less than 10/3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 10/3.\n\nSo, the final answer is 10/3, which is approximately 3.333333.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can write this as a fraction.\n\n10/3 is already in its simplest form, so the answer is 10/3.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with vertices on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), where the diagonals intersect at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are parameterized as \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\((-2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, -2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\), respectively. Similarly, points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are parameterized using a different parameter due to the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\n2. **Slope Condition**: The slope of diagonal \\(AC\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\sin\\theta\\). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slope of \\(BD\\) is \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{6} \\sin\\theta}\\).\n\n3. **Coordinates of \\(B\\)**: Point \\(B\\) lies on the hyperbola and on the line with slope \\(-\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{6} \\sin\\theta}\\). Substituting \\(B = (u, v)\\) into the hyperbola equation and solving for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) yields expressions for \\(u^2\\) and \\(v^2\\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**: Using the coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(D\\), the length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is calculated as \\(2\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}\\). Substituting the expressions for \\(u^2\\) and \\(v^2\\) leads to a formula for \\(BD^2\\) in terms of \\(\\theta\\).\n\n5. **Simplification**: By substituting \\(t = 6 \\sin\\theta\\), the expression for \\(BD^2\\) is simplified to \\(\\frac{10}{3} \\left(1 + \\frac{55}{t^2 - 25}\\right)\\). As \\(t\\) approaches infinity, \\(BD^2\\) approaches \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\), meaning \\(BD^2\\) can be made arbitrarily close to \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) but never less than it. Therefore, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{10}{3}}\\)",
