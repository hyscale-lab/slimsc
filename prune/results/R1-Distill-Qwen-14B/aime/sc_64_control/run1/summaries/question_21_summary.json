      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81, which is 13-eautiful because 81 is written as 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it. So, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nHmm, so my goal is to find the smallest base b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's formalize what a two-digit number in base b looks like. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like d1 * b + d0, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. Both d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d0 \u2264 b-1. But since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero; otherwise, it would be a single-digit number. So d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe sum of these two digits is d1 + d0, and this sum must equal the square root of n. But n is equal to d1*b + d0. So, we have the equation:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can rearrange the equation differently. Let me group terms with b:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d0 = d1*b\n\nSo, solving for b:\n\nb = (d1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d0) / d1\n\nWait, since b must be an integer, this expression must result in an integer. So, (d1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d0) must be divisible by d1.\n\nAlternatively, I can write this as:\n\nb = d1 + 2*d0 + (d0\u00b2 - d0)/d1\n\nHmm, but (d0\u00b2 - d0) must be divisible by d1. Let me denote that term as k, so:\n\n(d0\u00b2 - d0) = k*d1, where k is an integer.\n\nBut since d0 and d1 are digits in base b, which is at least 2, d0 can be from 0 to b-1, and d1 is from 1 to b-1.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's denote s = d1 + d0. Then, we have s = sqrt(n), so n = s\u00b2. But n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So:\n\nd1*b + d0 = s\u00b2\n\nBut s = d1 + d0, so substituting:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. Let me rearrange it:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nExpanding the square:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think of this as a quadratic in d1:\n\nd1\u00b2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0\u00b2 - d0) = 0\n\nYes, that's a quadratic equation in terms of d1. For integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me compute the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant D = (2*d0 - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(d0\u00b2 - d0)\n\nExpanding D:\n\n= (4*d0\u00b2 - 4*b*d0 + b\u00b2) - 4*d0\u00b2 + 4*d0\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4*d0\u00b2 -4b*d0 + b\u00b2 -4d0\u00b2 +4d0\n\n= (-4b d0 +4d0) + (b\u00b2)\n\n= 4d0*(1 - b) + b\u00b2\n\nSo, D = 4d0*(1 - b) + b\u00b2\n\nThis discriminant must be a perfect square because d1 must be an integer. Let me write that as:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4d0*(b -1) must be a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, D = b\u00b2 -4d0*(b -1) = k\u00b2 for some integer k.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to express it differently. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, from the equation d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0\n\nSo,\n\nb = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0] / d1\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= (d1\u00b2 + 2d1 d0 + d0\u00b2 - d0) / d1\n\n= d1 + 2d0 + (d0\u00b2 - d0)/d1\n\nSo, for b to be integer, (d0\u00b2 - d0) must be divisible by d1.\n\nWhich gives us that d1 divides (d0\u00b2 - d0). So, d1 | (d0\u00b2 - d0). Which can be written as:\n\nd0\u00b2 \u2261 d0 mod d1\n\nWhich is the same as d0(d0 -1) \u2261 0 mod d1.\n\nSo, d1 must divide d0(d0 - 1). Since d0 is a digit in base b, which is less than b, and d1 is also less than b.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can consider possible values of d0 and d1, and for each possible d1, find d0 such that d1 divides d0(d0 -1), and then compute b.\n\nBut since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be in the range [b, b\u00b2 - 1]. Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1.\n\nBut n is equal to s\u00b2, where s is the sum of the digits, which is d1 + d0.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2, which must lie between b and b\u00b2 -1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1\n\nWhich implies that s\u00b2 \u2265 b and s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1.\n\nSo, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). But sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just a bit less than b, so s must be less than b.\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since b is at least 2, sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b. For example, when b=2, sqrt(3) \u22481.732 <2. When b=3, sqrt(8)=2.828 <3, etc.\n\nSo, s must be an integer in [sqrt(b), b-1]. Because s is an integer, so s can range from the ceiling of sqrt(b) up to b-1.\n\nWait, but s is also equal to d1 + d0, which are digits in base b, so d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, so s is at least 1 and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But since n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is at most b\u00b2 -1, so s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, so s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) <b. Therefore, s must be less than b. So, s can be from 1 up to b-1, but actually, n must be a two-digit number, so n must be at least b, which is s\u00b2 \u2265b, so s \u2265 sqrt(b). Therefore, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.\n\nBut I think perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about for a given base b, how many two-digit numbers in base b are b-eautiful.\n\nEach such number is n = d1*b + d0, with d1 from 1 to b-1, d0 from 0 to b-1, and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, n = (d1 + d0)^2.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d0) where d1 is from 1 to b-1, d0 is from 0 to b-1, and (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible s = d1 + d0, we can check if s\u00b2 = d1*b + d0, with d1 and d0 being digits in base b.\n\nSo, perhaps for each base b, we can iterate over possible s, from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, and for each s, check if there exist digits d1 and d0 such that d1 + d0 = s and d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2.\n\nLet me express d0 in terms of d1 and s: d0 = s - d1.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s\u00b2\n\nd1*(b -1) + s = s\u00b2\n\nThen:\n\nd1*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nSo:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer in [1, b-1].\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s (where ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b-1) such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the quotient (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is an integer d1 between 1 and b-1.\n\nAdditionally, once d1 is found, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 is in [1, b-1], and d0 = s - d1 is also in [0, b-1].\n\nSo, to find the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we can:\n\n1. Iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n2. For each s, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If it is, compute d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n3. Check if d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1.\n4. Then, compute d0 = s - d1 and check if d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n5. If all conditions are met, then this pair (d1, d0) corresponds to a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute the number of such s that satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur task is to find the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of b-eautiful numbers is more than ten.\n\nSo, perhaps I can write down for each base b starting from 2, compute the number of b-eautiful numbers, and stop when I find a b with more than ten.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me see if I can find a pattern or a mathematical way to compute the number without checking each base one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express this condition in terms of s and b.\n\nWe have d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (s\u00b2 - s) must be a multiple of (b -1), and the result of division must be within 1 to b-1.\n\nSo, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1), so (b-1) divides (s(s -1)).\n\nSo, (b -1) | s(s -1).\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, (b -1) must divide the product s(s -1), but since s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) must be a product of factors from s and s-1.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each s, we can find all possible (b -1) that divide s(s -1), and then for each such (b -1), check if the corresponding d1 is within 1 to b-1, and d0 = s - d1 is within 0 to b-1.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe it's better to fix a base b and compute the number of s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of (b -1) as a divisor of s(s -1). So, for a given s, (b -1) can be any divisor of s(s -1), and then b = (divisor) +1.\n\nBut then, for each s, the possible b's would be d +1, where d divides s(s -1). But since we're looking for the smallest b where the count exceeds ten, perhaps we can find the number of s for each b.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for some small b to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me start with b=2.\n\nFor b=2:\n\nWe need two-digit numbers in base 2, which are 10_2 (2), 11_2 (3). So, n can be 2 or 3.\n\nCheck if for n=2: digits are 1 and 0. Sum is 1+0=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, not integer. So not b-eautiful.\n\nn=3: digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(3)\u22481.732, not integer. So, no b-eautiful numbers for b=2.\n\nSo count is 0.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 3: from 10_3 (3) to 22_3 (8). So n can be 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=3: digits 1,0. Sum=1. sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Not integer.\n\nn=4: digits 1,1. Sum=2. sqrt(4)=2. So 1+1=2, which equals sqrt(4)=2. So yes, 4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nn=5: digits 1,2. Sum=3. sqrt(5)\u22482.236. Not integer.\n\nn=6: digits 2,0. Sum=2. sqrt(6)\u22482.449. Not integer.\n\nn=7: digits 2,1. Sum=3. sqrt(7)\u22482.645. Not integer.\n\nn=8: digits 2,2. Sum=4. sqrt(8)\u22482.828.

Count=1.\n\nWait, that's only one. Hmm.\n\nb=5:\n\nn ranges from 5 (10_5) to 24 (44_5).\n\nWe need s = d1 + d0, and s\u00b2 = n.\n\nSo, s can be from ceil(sqrt(5))=3 to 4 (since b=5, s must be \u22644).\n\nSo, s=3 and s=4.\n\nFor s=3:\n\nCheck if 3\u00b2 = 9 is in [5,24], which it is.\n\nSo, 9 must be expressible as d1*5 + d0, with d1 + d0=3.\n\nSo, d1 can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nBut d0 =3 -d1.\n\nCheck:\n\nd1=1: d0=2. So n=1*5 +2=7. But 7\u22609. So no.\n\nd1=2: d0=1. n=2*5 +1=11\u22609.\n\nd1=3: d0=0. n=3*5 +0=15\u22609.\n\nSo, no solution for s=3.\n\ns=4:\n\nn=16.\n\nCheck if 16 can be written as d1*5 +d0, with d1 +d0=4.\n\nSo, d1 can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nd0=4 -d1.\n\nCheck:\n\nd1=1: d0=3. n=1*5 +3=8\u226016.\n\nd1=2: d0=2. n=2*5 +2=12\u226016.\n\nd1=3: d0=1. n=3*5 +1=16. Yes! So, 16 is 41_5 (since 3*5 +1=16). So, 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4. So yes, 16 is 5-eautiful.\n\nd1=4: d0=0. n=4*5 +0=20\u226016.\n\nSo, only s=4 gives a solution. So, count=1.\n\nWait, so for b=5, count is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check all n from 5 to 24.\n\nWait, n=5: digits 1,0. Sum=1. sqrt(5)\u22482.236. No.\n\nn=6:1,1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a b-eautiful number as a positive integer n that has exactly two digits when expressed in base b. These two digits must sum up to the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI think the first step is to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like d1 * b + d0, where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. Both d1 and d0 have to be less than b, right? Because in any base, the digits go from 0 to one less than the base. But since n is a positive integer, d1 can't be zero, so d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1, and d0 can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, the number n can be written as n = d1 * b + d0. The condition given is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Let me write that down:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me do that.\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 = d1*b + d0\n\nHmm, so that's a quadratic equation in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to make it easier to handle.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor anything or perhaps express it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can treat this as a quadratic equation in d1 or d0. Let's try treating it as a quadratic in d1.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nd1\u00b2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0\u00b2 - d0) = 0\n\nSo, this is a quadratic in d1. For each possible d0, I can solve for d1. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant D of this quadratic equation is:\n\nD = (2*d0 - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (d0\u00b2 - d0)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nD = (4*d0\u00b2 - 4*b*d0 + b\u00b2) - (4*d0\u00b2 - 4*d0)\n= 4*d0\u00b2 -4b d0 + b\u00b2 -4d0\u00b2 +4d0\n= (-4b d0 +4d0) + b\u00b2\n= 4d0(1 - b) + b\u00b2\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. So, D must be a perfect square for d1 to be an integer. Let me write that as:\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4d0(b -1) = k\u00b2, where k is some integer.\n\nWait, that's the discriminant, so it must be non-negative as well. So, b\u00b2 -4d0(b -1) >= 0.\n\nHmm, let's see. So, for each base b, I can iterate over possible d0 values (from 0 to b-1), compute D, check if it's a perfect square, and then find if d1 is an integer in the valid range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = d1*b + d0, and d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d0. Then, s = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d0). So, squaring both sides, we get s\u00b2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, substitute that in:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n\nBecause d0 = s - d1. So,\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*(b - 1) + s\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer in that range.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can iterate over possible s and see if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if d1 is in the valid range.\n\nBut s is equal to d1 + d0. Since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, s can be as small as 1 (if d1=1, d0=0). The maximum s would be when d1 and d0 are both maximum, so d1 = b-1, d0 = b-1, so s_max = 2b - 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, n is a two-digit number, so n is between b and b\u00b2 - 1. So, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1), which is roughly between b^0.5 and b.\n\nBut s is sqrt(n), so s is in that interval.\n\nSo, s is between 1 and roughly 2b (but not exactly, as sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is slightly less than b). So, s can be up to about b.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to iterate over possible s values and see what b's make d1 an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, we can find the possible b's such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 must be at least 1, (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) >= 1, so s\u00b2 - s >= b - 1.\n\nAnd since d1 <= b-1, (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) <= b -1, so s\u00b2 - s <= (b -1)^2.\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting a bit too abstract. Let's think about the equation:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 is a positive integer, (s\u00b2 - s) must be a multiple of (b -1). So, b -1 must be a divisor of s\u00b2 - s.\n\nSo, for each s, the possible b's are such that b -1 divides s\u00b2 - s. Therefore, b = (s\u00b2 - s)/k + 1, where k is a positive integer that divides s\u00b2 - s.\n\nBut b must be at least 2, so (s\u00b2 - s)/k + 1 >= 2 => (s\u00b2 - s)/k >= 1 => k <= s\u00b2 - s.\n\nMoreover, since d1 = k, because d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) = k, and d1 must be <= b -1.\n\nSo, k <= (s\u00b2 - s)/k + 1 - 1 => k <= (s\u00b2 - s)/k => k\u00b2 <= s\u00b2 - s => k <= sqrt(s\u00b2 - s).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think about possible s. Since s is sqrt(n), and n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b and b\u00b2 - 1. So, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). Let's approximate sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) as roughly b - 1/(2b). So, s can be from roughly sqrt(b) up to just under b.\n\nBut s must be an integer because d1 and d0 are digits, so s is an integer. So, s ranges from 2 up to b-1, perhaps? Let's see, for b=2, n can be 10_2=2, and sqrt(2) is about 1.414, which is not an integer, so no solution. For b=3, n can be 10_3=3, sqrt(3) \u22481.732, no. 11_3=4, sqrt(4)=2. So, 2 = 1 + 1, so 11_3 is 4, which is 2^2, so 4 is 3-eautiful. So, s=2.\n\nWait, so in general, for each b, s can range from 2 up to, I think, floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Let's compute that.\n\nsqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is approximately b - 1/(2b), so the floor is b -1. So, s can be from 2 up to b -1.\n\nSo, for each b, s can be 2,3,...,b-1.\n\nFor each s, can we find a d1 and d0 such that d1 + d0 = s, and n = d1*b + d0 = s\u00b2.\n\nBecause n = s\u00b2, right? Because s = sqrt(n), so n = s\u00b2.\n\nSo, n = s\u00b2 = d1*b + d0, and d1 + d0 = s.\n\nTherefore, d0 = s - d1.\n\nSo, substituting into n:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*b + (s - d1) = d1*(b -1) + s\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nd1*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nSo, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the quotient must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of s's (from 2 to b-1) that satisfy this condition will give the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSo, for each b, count the number of s in [2, b-1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the quotient is between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 must be an integer, (b-1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s). So, for each b, we can factor (s\u00b2 - s) and see if (b-1) is a divisor.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of this as for each s, we can find possible b's such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). Then, for each such b, s is a possible value.\n\nWait, but we're looking for the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b. So, for each b, the number of such s's is equal to the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nThus, our task is to find the smallest b such that the number of s's in [2, b-1] where (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1, is greater than 10.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find a pattern or find a way to compute the number of solutions for each b.\n\nLet me try to compute for small b's and see how it goes.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\ns can be from 2 to 1. Wait, since b=2, s can be up to 1, but 2>1, so no solutions. So, no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nb=3:\n\ns ranges from 2 to 2 (since b-1=2). So, s=2.\n\nCheck if (2\u00b2 -2) = 2 is divisible by (3-1)=2. Yes, 2/2=1. So, d1=1, d0=2 -1=1. So, n=1*3 +1=4, which is 2\u00b2. So, 4 is 3-eautiful. So, count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\ns can be 2,3.\n\nFor s=2: (4-2)=2. b-1=3. 2 not divisible by 3. So, no.\n\ns=3: (9-3)=6. 6 divisible by 3. So, d1=6/3=2. Check if d1 <=3: yes. d0=3-2=1. So, n=2*4 +1=9, which is 3\u00b2. So, count=1.\n\nb=4: count=1.\n\nb=5:\n\ns ranges 2,3,4.\n\ns=2: 4-2=2. 2 divided by 4? 2/4=0.5, not integer. No.\n\ns=3: 9-3=6. 6/4=1.5, not integer. No.\n\ns=4: 16-4=12. 12/4=3. d1=3, which is <=4. d0=4-3=1. So, n=3*5 +1=16=4\u00b2. So, count=1.\n\nb=5: count=1.\n\nb=6:\n\ns=2,3,4,5.\n\ns=2: 4-2=2. 2/5=0.4, nope.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. 6/5=1.2, nope.\n\ns=4:16-4=12. 12/5=2.4, nope.\n\ns=5:25-5=20. 20/5=4. d1=4, which is <=5. d0=5-4=1. n=4*6 +1=25=5\u00b2. So, count=1.\n\nb=6: count=1.\n\nHmm, so far, each base only has one b-eautiful number. That's not enough. Let's try higher bases.\n\nb=7:\n\ns=2,3,4,5,6.\n\ns=2:4-2=2. 2/6\u22480.333, no.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. 6/6=1. So, d1=1, d0=2. n=1*7 +2=9=3\u00b2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.\n\nThe problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. The task is to find the least integer b (b >= 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that are b-eautiful. Let's break down what it means for a number to be b-eautiful.\n\nFirst, when the number n is written in base b, it must have exactly two digits. That means in base b, n is of the form d1*d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, each digit must satisfy 0 <= d1, d2 < b.\n\nThe value of n in base 10 is then d1*b + d2. So n = d1*b + d2.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of the digits, d1 + d2, must equal the square root of n. So, we have the equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(n)\n\nBut since n is d1*b + d2, we can substitute that in:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nHmm, let's rearrange this equation to group like terms:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of d1 and d2. But since both d1 and d2 are integers between 0 and b-1 (with d1 >=1), maybe I can find constraints or possible values that satisfy this equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this equation differently. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d2. Then, from the equation, s = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d2). Squaring both sides, s^2 = d1*b + d2.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d2, substituting that in, we have:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nBut we can also express d2 as s - d1. So substituting d2 into the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n\nSimplify that:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + s - d1\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\ns^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)\n\nSo, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So for each s, d1 must be equal to (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). But d1 has to be an integer because it's a digit in base b. So (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 must be at least 1 and less than b.\n\nSimilarly, since d2 = s - d1, d2 must also be between 0 and b-1. So we have constraints on d1 and d2.\n\nLet me summarize the key points:\n\n1. n is a two-digit number in base b: n = d1*b + d2, where d1 >=1, d2 >=0, and d1, d2 < b.\n\n2. s = d1 + d2 = sqrt(n) => n = s^2.\n\n3. Therefore, s^2 = d1*b + d2.\n\n4. From 3, s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1) => s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1) => d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).\n\n5. So d1 must be an integer, and 1 <= d1 < b.\n\n6. Also, d2 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 <= d2 < b.\n\nSo, for a given base b, I can iterate over possible s values and see if d1 comes out as integer within the required range, and then check d2.\n\nBut my goal is to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such n (i.e., more than ten s that satisfy these conditions).\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each base b, I can find the possible s values that satisfy the equation d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). Then, for each s, check if d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and d2 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 and d2 are digits in base b, their sum s must satisfy s = d1 + d2 <= (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. Also, since n = s^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b and b^2 -1.\n\nSo, n = s^2 must satisfy b <= s^2 <= b^2 -1.\n\nSo, s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1). Since s is an integer, s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 -1) is approximately b - 0.5, so the maximum integer s is b - 1.\n\nSo s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1.\n\nWait, but that might not always be true. Let me check for some small b.\n\nTake b=2: two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 10_2=2 to 11_2=3. So n can be 2 or 3.\n\nSo s must be sqrt(2) \u22481.414, so s=2? Wait, but n is 2 or 3, so s can be 2 or 3, but n=2 would require s= sqrt(2), which is not integer. Similarly, n=3, s=sqrt(3)\u22481.732, which is not integer. So actually, for b=2, there are no b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example is n=81, which is 63 in base 13, so 6+3=9=sqrt(81). So n must be a perfect square because s is an integer (since d1 and d2 are integers, their sum is integer, so s must be integer, hence n must be a perfect square).\n\nSo n must be a perfect square, and n is a two-digit number in base b. So n = s^2, where s is an integer.\n\nThus, for each base b, the possible s values are integers such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 -1.\n\nSo, s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(b^2 -1). Let's take b=13, as in the example. Then sqrt(13^2 -1)=sqrt(168)=12.96, so s can be up to 12, which is b-1.\n\nSo for each b, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.\n\nBut for each s in this range, we can compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b-1). Then, check if d1 is an integer, and whether 1<=d1 <b and 0<=d2=s-d1 <b.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits (i.e., 1<=d1 <b, 0<=d2 <b).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Compute the range of s: s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), s_max = b-1.\n\n   b. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n      i. Compute (s^2 - s). Check if it's divisible by (b-1). If not, skip.\n\n      ii. If divisible, compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b-1).\n\n      iii. Check if 1 <= d1 < b. If not, skip.\n\n      iv. Compute d2 = s - d1. Check if 0 <= d2 <b. If not, skip.\n\n      v. If all conditions are met, count this s as a valid b-eautiful number.\n\n   c. After checking all s, if the count is >10, return this b.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest b where the number of valid s is more than ten.\n\nNow, this seems computationally intensive if done manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a quadratic in s or find a relation between b and s.\n\nWait, let's revisit the equation: d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be a multiple of (b-1). So, (s^2 - s) \u2261 0 mod (b-1). So, s(s-1) \u2261 0 mod (b-1).\n\nSo, either s \u2261 0 mod (b-1), or s \u2261 1 mod (b-1), or (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, and b >=2, let's think about possible values.\n\nIf s = b-1, then s = b-1. Then, s(s-1) = (b-1)(b-2). So, (b-1)(b-2) must be divisible by (b-1), which it is. So d1 = ( (b-1)(b-2) ) / (b-1) ) = b-2. Then d2 = s - d1 = (b-1) - (b-2) = 1. So d1 = b-2, d2=1. So n = (b-2)*b +1 = b(b-2) +1 = b^2 - 2b +1 = (b-1)^2. So n = (b-1)^2.\n\nWhich makes sense because n is a two-digit number in base b, and n = (b-1)^2. So the digits are (b-2, 1) in base b. For example, in base 13, n=12^2=144, but wait, 144 in base 13 is 108, which is 1*13^2 + 0*13 +8, but wait, that's three digits. Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is (b-1)^2, which is (b-1)^2 = (b-1)*b - (b-1) + 0? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Let's compute n in base b. For d1 = b-2 and d2 =1, n is (b-2)*b +1 = b^2 -2b +1 = (b-1)^2.\n\nBut in base b, (b-1) is represented as '10' (since b is the base, so b-1 is one less than the base). So (b-1)^2 in base b is 10^2, which is 100, but that's three digits. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, (b-1)^2 is equal to (b^2 -2b +1). So, when written in base b, that's 1*b^2 -2b +1. But since it's a two-digit number, it must be less than b^2. So, (b-1)^2 must be less than b^2. Which it is, because (b-1)^2 = b^2 - 2b +1 < b^2.\n\nWait, but 1*b^2 -2b +1 is not a two-digit number in base b. Because a two-digit number in base b is up to (b^2 -1). But (b-1)^2 is less than b^2, but is it less than b^2? Yes, but when written in base b, how is it represented?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the digits.\n\nWait, let's take b=13 as in the example. Then (b-1)^2=144. 144 in base 13 is 6*13 + 3 = 81, which is incorrect because 6*13 is 78, plus 3 is 81, which is 9^2. Wait, that's the example given, but (b-1)^2 is 144, which in base 13 is 6*13 + 3=81, which is (b-4)^2? Wait, no, 13-4=9, 9^2=81.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in base b, the two-digit number is d1*d2, which is d1*b + d2. So n = d1*b + d2.\n\nBut n is also s^2, where s = d1 + d2.\n\nSo, for s = b-1, n = (b-1)^2. But n must be a two-digit number in base b, which is less than b^2. So, (b-1)^2 < b^2, which is true, but (b-1)^2 is greater than or equal to b when?\n\nWhen (b-1)^2 >= b.\n\nWhich is when b^2 -2b +1 >= b => b^2 -3b +1 >=0.\n\nSolving b^2 -3b +1 >=0.\n\nThe roots of the equation b^2 -3b +1=0 are [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9-4)]/2 = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(5)]/2 \u2248 (3\u00b12.236)/2.\n\nSo approximately, (3+2.236)/2 \u22482.618, and (3-2.236)/2\u22480.382. So for b >=3, b^2 -3b +1 >=0.\n\nThus, for b >=3, (b-1)^2 >= b, so n=(b-1)^2 is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nWait, but for b=3, (b-1)^2=4, which is 11 in base 3, which is two digits. So that works.\n\nBut for b=2, (b-1)^2=1, which is 1 in base 2, which is one digit, so n=1 is a single digit, so it's not a two-digit number in base 2.\n\nSo, for b >=3, (b-1)^2 is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nBut wait, in base b, (b-1) is represented as '10', so (b-1)^2 is '100', which is three digits. Wait, that contradicts what I just said.\n\nWait, no. Wait, (b-1)^2 in base 10 is (b^2 -2b +1). To represent this in base b, let's see:\n\nDivide by b: (b^2 -2b +1)/b = b -2 + 1/b. So the first digit is b-2, remainder is 1.\n\nSo, (b-1)^2 in base b is (b-2)*b +1, which is written as 'd1 d2' where d1 = b-2 and d2=1.\n\nSo, for example, in base 13: (13-2)=11, so d1=11, d2=1, which is written as 'B1' in base 13 (if using letters for digits beyond 9). But in the example, n=81 is 63 in base 13, which is different.\n\nWait, but in the example, n=81 is 63 in base 13, which is 6*13 +3=81. So s=6+3=9, and sqrt(81)=9. So that works.\n\nBut for s=b-1, which is 12 in base 13, n=(12)^2=144. But 144 in base 13 is 11*13 +1=143 +1=144, which is 'B1' in base 13. So digits d1=11, d2=1. So s=11+1=12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So that works as well.\n\nSo, for each b >=3, s = b-1 is a valid case, giving n=(b-1)^2, which is a two-digit number in base b, with digits d1=b-2, d2=1.\n\nSimilarly, s can take other values as well.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is at least one, from s=b-1.\n\nBut the problem asks for bases where there are more than ten such numbers.\n\nSo, the plan is to iterate b from 2 upwards, for each b, compute the number of valid s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think about the equation again:\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\nb -1 = (s^2 - s)/d1\n\nSo, b = (s^2 - s)/d1 +1\n\nBut since b must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by d1.\n\nBut d1 is between 1 and b-1, and s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, b must be equal to (s^2 - s)/d1 +1, where d1 is a divisor of (s^2 - s).\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of s and d1.\n\nGiven s and d1, b is determined as (s^2 -s)/d1 +1.\n\nBut for each b, we can have multiple s and d1 pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as for each s, the possible b's are of the form b = (s^2 -s)/d1 +1, where d1 divides (s^2 -s), and d1 is between 1 and b-1.\n\nBut since b must be greater than d1, and d1 >=1, so b >=2.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think for each s, and find all possible b's that satisfy the equation.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each s, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by (b-1), so (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s-1).\n\nSo, for each s, the possible (b-1) values are the divisors of s(s-1). Then, b = d +1, where d is a positive divisor of s(s-1).\n\nBut since b must be at least 2, d can be 1 or more.\n\nBut we also have constraints:\n\n1. d = b-1 must be >=1, so b >=2.\n\n2. For each b, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut since s and b are related, perhaps we can find for each s, the possible b's, and then count for each b how many s's are valid.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can fix s and find possible b's.\n\nWait, but I need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten. So, perhaps I can iterate b from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute the number of valid s's.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps for a given b:\n\n1. Compute s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\n2. Compute s_max = b -1.\n\n3. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Compute (s^2 -s). If this is not divisible by (b-1), skip.\n\n   b. Compute d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1).\n\n   c. Check if 1 <= d1 < b.\n\n   d. Compute d2 = s - d1.\n\n   e. Check if 0 <= d2 < b.\n\n   f. If all conditions are met, count this s as valid.\n\n4. After all s are processed, if the count >10, return b.\n\nSo, the idea is to implement this for each b starting from 2, until we find the smallest b with count>10.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express the number of solutions for a given b.\n\nNote that for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) such that d = b-1, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], and d1 = (s^2 -s)/d is in [1, b-1), and d2 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits.\n\nBut this is still abstract.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation again:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nBut d2 = s - d1, so:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1) => s^2 - s = d1*(b -1)\n\nSo, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWhich implies that (b -1) divides (s^2 -s).\n\nSo, for each s, the possible b's are (s^2 -s)/d1 +1, where d1 is a positive integer that divides (s^2 -s), and d1 <= s (since d1 = (s^2 -s)/d1 +1, but I'm not sure).\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the number of b's that can be formed is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s). Because for each divisor d of (s^2 -s), b = (s^2 -s)/d +1.\n\nBut then, for each s, we can find multiple b's.\n\nBut since we need to find the smallest b where the number of solutions exceeds ten, perhaps we can look for s's that have many divisors, leading to many b's.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for a fixed s, the number of b's that can be formed is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s). So, if s(s-1) has many divisors, then for each divisor d, b = (s^2 -s)/d +1.\n\nBut since we're looking for the smallest b with many solutions, perhaps s should be chosen such that s(s-1) has many factors.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each s, the equation d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) must be an integer, and d1 must be <= s, since d1 + d2 = s and d2 >=0.\n\nSo, d1 <= s.\n\nThus, (s^2 -s)/(b-1) <=s => s^2 -s <= s*(b-1) => s^2 -s <= s*b -s => s^2 <= s*b => s <= b.\n\nBut s <= b-1, which is already the case.\n\nSo, not much help.\n\nWait, but d1 must be at least 1, so (s^2 -s)/(b-1) >=1 => s^2 -s >= b-1.\n\nSo, b <= s^2 -s.\n\nBut s <= b-1, so substituting, b <= (b-1)^2 - (b-1) = b^2 -3b +2.\n\nSo, b <= b^2 -3b +2 => 0 <= b^2 -4b +2.\n\nSolving b^2 -4b +2 >=0.\n\nThe roots are [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16-8)]/2 = [4 \u00b1 2*sqrt(2)]/2 = 2 \u00b1 sqrt(2). So approximately, 2 -1.414\u22480.586 and 2+1.414\u22483.414.\n\nSo for b >=4, the inequality holds. So for b>=4, s^2 -s >=b-1.\n\nBut for b=3, let's check: s can be 2 (since ceil(sqrt(3))=2). Then s=2, s^2 -s=2. b-1=2. So 2 >=2, which holds.\n\nSo, for b=3, it's okay.\n\nBut for b=2, s_min=2 (since sqrt(2)\u22481.414, ceil is 2), but s_max=1, which is impossible. So no solutions for b=2.\n\nSo, for b>=3, s starts at ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, going back, perhaps I can find for each b, the number of s's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b is time-consuming. Maybe I can look for a pattern or find a way to compute the number of solutions for each b.\n\nWait, perhaps I can note that for each s, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors of (s^2 -s) that are less than or equal to s(s-1).\n\nWait, no, because b = (s^2 -s)/d1 +1, and d1 must be <=s.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think that for each s, the possible b's are of the form (s^2 -s)/d1 +1, where d1 is a divisor of (s^2 -s) and d1 <=s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for a given s, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors d of (s^2 -s) such that d <= s(s-1).\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nPerhaps I can try to compute the number of solutions for small b's and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me try b=3:\n\ns_min = ceil(sqrt(3))=2.\n\ns_max=2.\n\nSo s=2.\n\nCompute (s^2 -s)=4-2=2.\n\nb-1=2.\n\nSo d1=2/2=1.\n\nCheck 1<=1<3: yes.\n\nd2=2-1=1.\n\nCheck 0<=1<3: yes.\n\nSo n=1*3 +1=4, which is 2^2.

Count=3.\n\nHmm, not many.\n\nWait, but in the example, 81 is 63 in base13, which corresponds to s=9.\n\nSo, for b=13, count=3.\n\nWait, but I thought the example was 81=63_13, which is s=9.\n\nSo, count=3 for b=13.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a b where s can take many values. Maybe when s is around sqrt(b), and (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a small number, say 12, which is 12, but 12 has many factors, so s(s-1) must be multiples of 12.\n\nWait, but for b=13, b-1=12, which has factors 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nSo, for each s in 4 to12, check if 12 divides s(s-1).\n\ns=4: 4*3=12: yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20: no.\n\ns=6:6*5=30: 30/12=2.5:

yes.\n\nSo, only s=4,9,12 are valid, as before.\n\nSo, count=3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a base where b-1 is a number with many small factors, so that s(s-1) can be divisible by b-1 for many s's.\n\nFor example, if b-1=24, which has many factors, then s(s-1) must be divisible by 24.\n\nSo, for s=5:5*4=20: not divisible by24.\n\ns=6:6*5=30:30/24=1.25: no.\n\ns=7:7*6=42:42/24=1.75:

enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a b-1 that is a factorial or something with many small factors.\n\nFor example, b-1=24 is 2^3*3.\n\nBut perhaps b-1=360, which has many factors.\n\nBut that would make b=361, which is way too big, and we need the smallest b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b-1=60, which has many factors.\n\nLet me try b=61.\n\nb=61, b-1=60.\n\ns ranges from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 up to60.\n\nFor each s, check if s(s-1) is divisible by60.\n\nSo, s(s-1) must be divisible by60.\n\n60=2^2*3*5.\n\nSo, s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so one is even, one is odd.\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by60, one of them must be divisible by4, one divisible by3, and one divisible by5.\n\nSo, possible cases:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by4, s-1 divisible by3 and5.\n\nOr:\n\n- s divisible by5, s-1 divisible by4 and3.\n\nOr:\n\n- s divisible by3, s-1 divisible by4 and5.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are consecutive, they are coprime.\n\nSo, to have s(s-1) divisible by60, one of them must be divisible by4, another by3, and another by5.\n\nSo, possible scenarios:\n\n1. s divisible by4, s-1 divisible by3 and5 (i.e., 15).\n\nSo s \u22611 mod15, and s \u22610 mod4.\n\nFind s such that s

\u2261-1 mod4 =>3k\u22613 mod4 =>k\u22611 mod4.\n\nSo k=4m +1.\n\nThus, s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m +16.\n\nSo s=16,76,136,... but since s <=60, s=16.\n\nSo s=16 is a solution.\n\n2. s divisible by5, s-1 divisible by4 and3.\n\ns \u22610 mod5.\n\ns-1 \u22610 mod12 (since 4 and3 are coprime).\n\nSo s \u22611 mod12.\n\nSo find s \u22610 mod5 and s \u22611 mod12.\n\nLet s=12k +1.\n\nWe need 12k +1 \u22610 mod5 =>12k \u2261-1 mod5 =>12 mod5=2, so 2k \u2261-1 mod5 =>2k\u22614 mod5 =>k\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo k=5m +2.\n\nThus, s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m +25.\n\nBut s<=60, so s=25.\n\n3. s divisible by3, s-1 divisible by4 and5.\n\ns \u22610 mod3.\n\ns-1 \u22610 mod20.\n\nSo s \u22611 mod20.\n\nAnd s \u22610 mod3.\n\nFind s such that s\u22611 mod20 and s\u22610 mod3.\n\nLet s=20k +1.\n\n20k +1 \u22610 mod3 =>20k \u2261-1 mod3 =>20 mod3=2, so 2k \u2261-1 mod3 =>2k\u22612 mod3 =>k\u22611 mod3.\n\nSo k=3m +1.\n\nThus, s=20*(3m+1)+1=60m +21.\n\nBut s<=60, so s=21.\n\nSo, for b=61, the possible s's are

That can't be.\n\nWait, no, wait. n= d1*b +d2=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut s=96, so sqrt(n)=96.\n\nSo n=96^2=9216, but 76*121 +20=9236\u22609216.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, s=96: s^2=96^2=9216.\n\nBut n= d1*b +d2=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut 9236\u22609216.\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\nWait, so my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, because n must equal s^2.\n\nSo, n= d1*b +d2= s^2.\n\nBut from the equation, s^2 = d1*b +d2.\n\nBut d2= s -d1.\n\nSo, s^2 = d1*b + (s -d1).\n\nWhich rearranges to s^2 -s =d1*(b-1).\n\nSo, for s=96, b=121, b-1=120.\n\ns^2 -s=96^2 -96=9216 -96=9120.\n\nd1=9120/120=76.\n\nSo, n=76*121 + (96 -76)=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut s^2=9216\u22609236.\n\nSo, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.\n\nWait, no, because n must equal s^2.\n\nSo, if s=96, then n=96^2=9216.\n\nBut according to the equation, n= d1*b +d2=76*121 +20=9236.\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps s=96 is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nThe equation is s^2 = d1*b +d2.\n\nBut d2= s -d1.\n\nSo, s^2 =d1*b + s -d1.\n\nRearranged: s^2 -s =d1*(b -1).\n\nSo, d1= (s^2 -s)/(b-1).\n\nSo, for s=96, b=121:\n\nd1=(96^2 -96)/120=(9216-96)/120=9120/120=76.\n\nd2=96-76=20.\n\nSo, n=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut s^2=96^2=9216\u22609236.\n\nSo, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, s=96 is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, that's strange.\n\nBut according to the equation, s^2 -s must equal d1*(b-1).\n\nWhich is true:96^2 -96=9120=76*120=76*(121-1).\n\nSo, the equation holds.\n\nBut then, why is n=9236\u226096^2?\n\nBecause n= d1*b +d2=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut s^2=96^2=9216.\n\nSo, this is a problem.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, n must be equal to s^2.\n\nSo, in this case, n=9236\u226096^2.\n\nThus, s=96 is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, so what's wrong here?\n\nAh, because in the equation, we have s^2 =d1*b +d2.\n\nBut d2= s -d1.\n\nSo, substituting, s^2 =d1*b + s -d1.\n\nWhich rearranges to s^2 -s =d1*(b -1).\n\nSo, the equation holds, but n must equal s^2.\n\nBut in this case, n= d1*b +d2= s^2.\n\nBut when I computed it, it didn't hold.\n\nWait, no, because n= d1*b +d2=76*121 +20=9216 +20=9236.\n\nBut s^2=96^2=9216.\n\nSo, 9236\u22609216.\n\nThus, this is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, no, because the equation is derived from n= s^2.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute.\n\ns=96, b=121.\n\nd1=(96^2 -96)/(121-1)=(9216 -96)/120=9120/120=76.\n\nd2=96 -76=20.\n\nn=76*121 +20=76*120 +76 +20=9120 +96=9216.\n\nWait, wait, 76*121=76*(120+1)=76*120 +76=9120 +76=9196.\n\nThen, 9196 +20=9216.\n\nAh! I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, n=76*121 +20=9196 +20=9216=96^2.\n\nSo, it's valid.\n\nSo, s=96 is valid.\n\nSo, my earlier mistake was in calculating 76*121.\n\nSo, s=96 is

or15.\n\nFor example, s divisible by5, s-1 divisible by48 (16*3).\n\nSo, s \u22611 mod48 and s \u22610 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22611 mod48 and s \u22610 mod5.\n\nLet s=48k +1.\n\nWe need 48k +1 \u22610 mod5 =>48k \u2261-1 mod5 =>48 mod5=3, so 3k \u2261-1 mod5 =>3k\u22614 mod5 =>k\u22613 mod5.\n\nSo k=5m +3.\n\nThus, s=48*(5m +3)+1=240m +145.\n\ns<=240: s=145.\n\nCheck s=145:145*144=20880.20880/240=87:

n=87*241 +58=21007 +58=21065.\n\nBut s^2=145^2=21025.\n\nSo, 21065\u226021025.\n\nThus, invalid.\n\nSo, s=145 is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, s^2 -s=145^2 -145=21025 -145=20880.\n\nd1=20880/240=87.\n\nd2=145-87=58.\n\nn=87*241 +58=21007 +58=21065.\n\nBut s^2=21025\u226021065.\n\nSo, this is invalid.\n\nThus, s=145 is not a valid solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find s such that s(s-1) is divisible by240, but also ensuring that n= s^2= d1*b +d2.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the number of solutions for a given b as the number of divisors of (s^2 -s) that are equal to (b-1).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation s^2 -s =d1*(b-1).\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s's where (s^2 -s) mod (b-1)=0, and d1 and d2 are in the required ranges.\n\nBut without a formula, it's hard to compute for each b.\n\nPerhaps I can look for a pattern in the number of solutions as b increases.\n\nFrom the earlier examples:\n\nb=3:1\n\nb=4:1\n\nb=5:1\n\nb=6:1\n\nb=7:3\n\nb=8:1\n\nb=9:1\n\nb=10:1\n\nb=11: ?\n\nWait, let me

example, b-1=240 is highly composite.\n\nBut earlier for b=241, count=5.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b-1=120.\n\nFor b=121, count=6.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of

ranges from ceil(sqrt(211))=15 up to210.\n\ns(s-1) must be divisible by210.\n\n210=2*3*5*7.\n\nSo, s and s-1 must cover these factors.\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one must be divisible by2, another by3, another by5, another by7.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by210, but that's only possible for s=211, which is beyond s_max=210.\n\nThus, no solutions except s=210:210*209=43890.\n\n43890/210=210: yes.\n\nd1=210.\n\nd2=210-210=0.\n\nn=210*211 +0=44310.\n\nBut s=210:210^2=44100\u226044310.\n\nThus, invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps no solutions for b=211.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to find b with many factors, I can think of b where b-1 is a multiple of many small numbers, allowing s(s-1) to be divisible by b-1 for many s's.\n\nFor example, b-1=240, which is divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,8, etc.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, for b=241, count=5.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of b=

Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the equation s^2 -s =d1*(b-1).\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s's where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits.\n\nSo, if I can find a b where b-1 has many small factors, then s(s-1) can be divisible by b-1 for many s's.\n\nFor example, if b-1=240, which has factors 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,16,20,24,30,40,48,60,80,120,240.\n\nSo, for each s, if s or s-1 is divisible by a factor of 240, then s(s-1) is divisible by 240.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are consecutive, one must be even, one must be divisible by3, one by5, etc.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of b= 241, but earlier count=5.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of b= 121, but count=6.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of b= 361, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of b= 120 +1=121, but count=6.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of b= 241, but count=5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of b= 361, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of b= 120*2 +1=241, but count=5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of b= 120*3 +1=361.\n\nb=361:\n\ns_min=19.\n\ns_max=360.\n\ns=19:\n\n19*18=342.\n\n342/360=0.95: no.\n\ns=20:\n\n20*19=380.\n\n380/360\u22481.055: no.\n\ns=21:\n\n21*20=420.\n\n420/360=1.166: no.\n\ns=22:\n\n22*21=462.\n\n462/360\u22481.283: no.\n\ns=23:\n\n23*22=506.\n\n506/360\u22481.405: no.\n\ns=24:\n\n24*23=552.\n\n552/360=1.533: no.\n\ns=25:\n\n25*24=600.\n\n600/360=1.666: no.\n\ns=26:\n\n26*25=650.\n\n650/360\u22481.805: no.\n\ns=27:\n\n27*26=702.\n\n702/360=1.95: no.\n\ns=28:\n\n28*27=756.\n\n756/360=2.1: no.\n\ns=29:\n\n29*28=812.\n\n812/360\u22482.255: no.\n\ns=30:\n\n30*29=870.\n\n870/360=2.416: no.\n\ns=31:\n\n31*30=930.\n\n930/360=2.583: no.\n\ns=32:\n\n32*31=992.\n\n992/360\u22482.755: no.\n\ns=33:\n\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nThe problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. They even gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nMy task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So I need to find the smallest base where there are over ten numbers that satisfy these conditions.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, understanding what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be of the form a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, n can be written as n = a*b + c, where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. Also, the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, putting this together, we have:\n\nsqrt(n) = a + c\n\nBut since n = a*b + c, we can substitute that into the equation:\n\nsqrt(a*b + c) = a + c\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\na*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can write it as:\n\na^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Since a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, maybe I can find conditions on c and b such that this quadratic has integer solutions for a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation differently. Let's see.\n\nStarting from:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2\n\nLet me move all terms to one side:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, maybe factor it differently. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can write:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me subtract a*b from both sides:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a*b = c\n\nWhich gives:\n\nc = (a + c)^2 - a*b\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should express c in terms of a and b, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = c + a*b\n\nLet me denote s = a + c. Then the equation becomes:\n\ns^2 = c + a*b\n\nBut s = a + c, so c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:\n\ns^2 = (s - a) + a*b\n\nSimplify:\n\ns^2 = s - a + a*b\n\nRearranged:\n\ns^2 - s = a*(b - 1)\n\nSo, s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)\n\nHmm, this seems interesting. So, for given s, a must be such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and a is equal to (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). But a must be a positive integer, and also, since a is a digit in base b, a must be \u2264 b-1.\n\nMoreover, since c = s - a, c must also be a digit in base b, so 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. So, 0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, let's list the constraints:\n\n1. s = a + c, so s \u2265 a (since c \u2265 0)\n2. s^2 - s must be divisible by (b - 1)\n3. a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) must be an integer, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1\n4. c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1\n5. n = a*b + c must be a perfect square, since sqrt(n) is an integer (as a + c is an integer)\n\nWait, but n is a*b + c, which is equal to s^2. So n is s^2, which is a perfect square. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the key equation is s^2 - s = a*(b - 1). So, for each s, we can express a in terms of s and b. But since a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) divides (s^2 - s). So, (b - 1) is a divisor of s(s - 1).\n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible values of b - 1 are the divisors of s(s - 1). So, b - 1 can be any positive integer that divides s(s - 1).\n\nBut since b \u2265 2, b - 1 \u2265 1.\n\nSo, for each s, we can find all possible (b - 1) that divide s(s - 1), then for each such b, we can compute a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), check if a is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.\n\nWait, but how do we approach this? Maybe instead of fixing s, we can iterate over possible b and count the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b until we find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to fix s and find all possible b's that satisfy the conditions for that s, then for each b, count the number of s's that work.\n\nHmm, let's think about it. The number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of pairs (a, c) such that a*b + c is a two-digit number in base b, and a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). So, for each b, how many such pairs (a, c) exist?\n\nAlternatively, for each b, how many s's are there such that s(s - 1) is divisible by (b - 1), and a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, we can compute all possible s such that:\n\n1. s(s - 1) is divisible by (b - 1)\n2. a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) is an integer, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1\n3. c = s - a is between 0 and b -1\n\nEach such s gives a valid (a, c) pair, and thus a b-eautiful number n = a*b + c = s^2.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of valid s's.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal b with more than ten b-eautiful numbers, I need to find the smallest b such that the number of s's is greater than ten.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this as, for each b, compute the number of s's that satisfy the above conditions, and find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, we can find all possible b's such that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), and then for each such b, record that s contributes to the count of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nThen, for each b, the count is the number of s's for which (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), and a and c are within their respective ranges.\n\nWait, but s must also satisfy that a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, let's consider that for each s, (b - 1) must divide s(s - 1), and then a must be in [1, b-1], and c must be in [0, b-1].\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. For each possible s, find all possible divisors d of s(s - 1). Each divisor d corresponds to b = d + 1.\n\n2. For each such b, compute a = s(s - 1)/d, and check if 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1.\n\n3. Then compute c = s - a, and check if 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, then this s contributes to the count of b-eautiful numbers for base b.\n\nSo, for each s, we can find all b's where b = d + 1, where d divides s(s - 1), and the conditions on a and c are satisfied.\n\nThen, for each b, we can keep a count of how many s's contribute to it.\n\nOnce we have counts for all b's up to some point, we can find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut the problem is that s can be any integer such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b. So, n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b. So, n must satisfy b \u2264 n < b^2.\n\nBut since n = s^2, we have b \u2264 s^2 < b^2.\n\nSo, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < b.\n\nWait, because s^2 \u2265 b implies s \u2265 sqrt(b), and s^2 < b^2 implies s < b.\n\nSo, s must be an integer in [sqrt(b), b - 1].\n\nBut s is also equal to a + c, where a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, so s is at least 1.\n\nWait, but for two-digit numbers in base b, the minimum two-digit number is 10_b, which is b in decimal, so s^2 must be at least b.\n\nSo, s must satisfy s \u2265 sqrt(b). Since s is an integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, for each b, the possible s's are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nHmm, but this complicates things because for each b, s can vary in a range, and for each s, we have to consider all d's that divide s(s - 1), then compute b = d + 1, and check the conditions.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the equation s^2 = a*b + c, where a + c = s.\n\nSo, substituting c = s - a into the equation:\n\ns^2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ns^2 = a*(b - 1) + s\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\na*(b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b -1, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result a must be in that range.\n\nTherefore, for each s, (b - 1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1), and a must be in [1, b -1].\n\nAdditionally, c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1.\n\nSo, for each s, we can find all divisors d of s(s - 1), set b = d + 1, compute a = s(s -1)/d, and check if 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d, and c = s - a is between 0 and d.\n\nWait, since b = d +1, then b -1 = d. So, a must be \u2264 d, because a \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s -1) such that:\n\n1. d = b -1 \u22651\n2. a = s(s -1)/d is integer, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d\n3. c = s - a is between 0 and d\n\nSo, for each s, iterate through all divisors d of s(s -1), compute b = d +1, a = s(s -1)/d, and check if 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d and 0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 d.\n\nIf so, then b has a b-eautiful number n = s^2.\n\nTherefore, for each s, each such valid d contributes to the count of b = d +1.\n\nSo, our plan is:\n\n1. Iterate s from 2 upwards (since s must be at least 2, because s^2 must be at least b, which is at least 2, but wait, for b=2, s must be at least sqrt(2) ~1.414, so s=2. Hmm, perhaps s starts at 2? Or maybe s=1 is possible for b=1, but b must be at least 2. So, s starts at 2.\n\n2. For each s, compute s(s -1).\n\n3. Find all divisors d of s(s -1). Each d corresponds to a possible b = d +1.\n\n4. For each d, compute a = s(s -1)/d.\n\n5. Check if a is integer, which it will be because d divides s(s -1). Also, check if 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\n6. Compute c = s - a, check if 0 \u2264 c \u2264 d.\n\n7. If both conditions are satisfied, then increment the count for b = d +1.\n\n8. Once we've processed all s up to a certain point, we can check which b has a count >10.\n\nBut the question is, how far do we need to go with s?\n\nWell, since for each s, the possible b's are d +1, where d is a divisor of s(s -1). The minimal b is 2, so we can process s starting from 2, and for each s, process all its d's, and for each b, keep a tally of how many s's contribute to it.\n\nBut the problem is that s can be up to... Well, in theory, s can be as large as we want, but we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10. So, perhaps we can process s sequentially and for each s, add to the count for each valid b, and after each s, check if any b's have counts >10.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming if done manually, but since we're just brainstorming, let's try to think of a way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula or a pattern that relates s and b, which allows us to count the number of b's for each s.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation again:\n\na = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nBut since a must be at least 1, we have:\n\n(s^2 - s)/(b -1) \u22651 \u2192 s^2 - s \u2265 b -1 \u2192 b \u2264 s^2 - s +1\n\nAlso, a \u2264 b -1 \u2192 (s^2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u2192 s^2 -s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nSo, s^2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nBut since b = d +1, and d divides s(s -1), perhaps this can be used to find some bounds on s.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try small s and see what happens.\n\nLet's start with s=2:\n\ns=2: s(s-1)=2*1=2. Divisors of 2 are 1,2.\n\nSo, d=1: b=2.\n\nCompute a = 2*(2-1)/1 = 2.\n\nCheck if a \u2264 d=1? No, 2>1. So invalid.\n\nd=2: b=3.\n\na = 2*1 /2 =1.\n\nCheck 1 \u2264 a=1 \u22642. Yes.\n\nc = 2 -1=1. Check 0 \u22641 \u22642. Yes.\n\nSo, b=3 gets a count of 1.\n\ns=2 contributes to b=3.\n\nNext, s=3:\n\ns=3: s(s-1)=3*2=6. Divisors:1,2,3,6.\n\nd=1: b=2.\n\na=3*2 /1=6. Check a \u22641? No.\n\nd=2: b=3.\n\na=6/2=3. Check a \u22642? No.\n\nd=3: b=4.\n\na=6/3=2. Check a \u22643? Yes.\n\nc=3-2=1. 0 \u22641 \u22643. Yes.\n\nSo, b=4 gets a count of 1.\n\nd=6: b=7.\n\na=6/6=1. Check a \u22646? Yes.\n\nc=3 -1=2. 0 \u22642 \u22646. Yes.\n\nSo, b=7 gets a count of 1.\n\nSo, s=3 contributes to b=4 and b=7.\n\nMoving on to s=4:\n\ns=4: s(s-1)=4*3=12. Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nd=1: b=2.\n\na=12/1=12. Check a \u22641? No.\n\nd=2: b=3.\n\na=12/2=6. Check a \u22642? No.\n\nd=3: b=4.\n\na=12/3=4. Check a \u22643? No.\n\nd=4: b=5.\n\na=12/4=3. Check a \u22644? Yes.\n\nc=4-3=1. 0 \u22641 \u22644. Yes. So, b=5 gets a count.\n\nd=6: b=7.\n\na=12/6=2. Check a \u22646? Yes.\n\nc=4-2=2. 0 \u22642 \u22646. Yes. So, b=7 gets another count.\n\nd=12: b=13.\n\na=12/12=1. Check a \u226412? Yes.\n\nc=4 -1=3. 0 \u22643 \u226412. Yes. So, b=13 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=4 contributes to b=5,7,13.\n\ns=4: 3 contributions.\n\ns=5:\n\ns=5: s(s-1)=5*4=20. Divisors:1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\nd=1: b=2. a=20/1=20. a>1? No.\n\nd=2: b=3. a=10. a>2? No.\n\nd=4: b=5. a=5. a \u22644? No.\n\nd=5: b=6. a=4. a \u22645? Yes.\n\nc=5 -4=1. 0 \u22641 \u22645. Yes. So, b=6 gets a count.\n\nd=10: b=11. a=2. Check a \u226410? Yes.\n\nc=5-2=3. 0 \u22643 \u226410. Yes. So, b=11 gets a count.\n\nd=20: b=21. a=1. Check a \u226420? Yes.\n\nc=5-1=4. 0 \u22644 \u226420. Yes. So, b=21 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=5 contributes to b=6,11,21.\n\ns=5: 3 contributions.\n\ns=6:\n\ns=6: s(s-1)=6*5=30. Divisors:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nd=1: b=2. a=30. >1. No.\n\nd=2: b=3. a=15. >2.

Check a \u226410? Yes.\n\nc=6 -3=3. 0 \u22643 \u226410. Yes. So, b=11 gets a count.\n\nd=15: b=16. a=2. Check a \u226415? Yes.\n\nc=6 -2=4. 0 \u22644 \u226415. Yes. So, b=16 gets a count.\n\nd=30: b=31. a=1. Check a \u226430? Yes.\n\nc=6 -1=5. 0 \u22645 \u226430. Yes. So, b=31 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=6 contributes to b=7,11,16,31.\n\ns=6: 4 contributions.\n\ns=7:\n\ns=7: 7*6=42. Divisors:1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42.\n\nd=1: b=2. a=42. >1. No.\n\nd=2: b=3. a=21. >2.

Check a \u226414? Yes.\n\nc=7 -3=4. 0 \u22644 \u226414. Yes. So, b=15 gets a count.\n\nd=21: b=22. a=2. Check a \u226421? Yes.\n\nc=7-2=5. 0 \u22645 \u226421. Yes. So, b=22 gets a count.\n\nd=42: b=43. a=1. Check a \u226442? Yes.\n\nc=7-1=6. 0 \u22646 \u226442. Yes. So, b=43 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=7 contributes to b=8,15,22,43.\n\ns=7: 4 contributions.\n\ns=8:\n\ns=8: 8*7=56. Divisors:1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56.\n\nd=1: b=2. a=56. >1. No.\n\nd=2: b=3. a=28. >2.

Check a \u226414? Yes.\n\nc=8-4=4. 0 \u22644 \u226414. Yes. So, b=15 gets a count.\n\nd=28: b=29. a=2. Check a \u226428? Yes.\n\nc=8-2=6. 0 \u22646 \u226428. Yes. So, b=29 gets a count.\n\nd=56: b=57. a=1. Check a \u226456? Yes.\n\nc=8-1=7. 0 \u22647 \u226456. Yes. So, b=57 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=8 contributes to b=9,15,29,57.\n\ns=8: 4 contributions.\n\ns=9:\n\ns=9: 9*8=72. Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72.\n\nd=1: b=2. a=72. >1. No.\n\nd=2: b=3. a=36. >2. No.\n\nd=3: b=4. a=24. >3. No.\n\nd=4: b=5. a=18. >4. No.\n\nd=6: b=7. a=12. >6. No.\n\nd=8: b=9. a=9. Check a \u22648? No.\n\nd=9: b=10. a=8. Check a \u22649? Yes.\n\nc=9-8=1. 0 \u22641 \u22649. Yes. So, b=10 gets a count.\n\nd=12: b=13. a=6. Check a \u226412? Yes.\n\nc=9-6=3. 0 \u22643 \u226412. Yes. So, b=13 gets a count.\n\nd=18: b=19. a=4. Check a \u226418? Yes.\n\nc=9-4=5. 0 \u22645 \u226418. Yes. So, b=19 gets a count.\n\nd=24: b=25. a=3. Check a \u226424? Yes.\n\nc=9-3=6. 0 \u22646 \u226424. Yes. So, b=25 gets a count.\n\nd=36: b=37. a=2. Check a \u226436? Yes.\n\nc=9-2=7. 0 \u22647 \u226436. Yes. So, b=37 gets a count.\n\nd=72: b=73. a=1. Check a \u226472? Yes.\n\nc=9-1=8. 0 \u22648 \u226472. Yes. So, b=73 gets a count.\n\nSo, s=9 contributes to b=10,13,19,25,37,73.\n\ns=9: 6 contributions.\n\nHmm, I'm noticing that as s increases, the number of contributions per s is increasing, and the bases they contribute to are getting larger as well.\n\nBut I need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10. So, perhaps I need to process more s's.\n\nBut this is getting tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nWait, looking back, each s contributes to multiple b's, each corresponding to a divisor of s(s-1). So, the number of b's that a particular s contributes to is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that satisfy the conditions on a and c.\n\nBut s(s-1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's always even, meaning it has multiple divisors.\n\nBut perhaps the number of contributions per s is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) where d \u2265 s - something.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for each s, the number of valid d's (divisors of s(s-1)) that satisfy a = s(s-1)/d \u2264 d and c = s - a \u22650.\n\nSo, a = s(s-1)/d \u2264d \u2192 s(s-1) \u2264d^2 \u2192 d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid d's is the number of divisors d of s(s-1) such that d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBecause d must be \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)) to have a \u2264 d.\n\nBut since d is a divisor of s(s-1), and d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)), each such d corresponds to a co-divisor k = s(s-1)/d \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nSo, the number of such d's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nWhich is equal to the number of divisors \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to the number of small divisors (\u2264 sqrt(s(s-1))) of s(s-1).\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), s(s-1) has (number of divisors of s) * (number of divisors of s-1). So, the number of divisors is multiplicative.\n\nWait, but s and s-1 are coprime, so the number of divisors of s(s-1) is equal to the product of the number of divisors of s and the number of divisors of s-1.\n\nSo, for example, s=2: s=2 (divisors:1,2), s-1=1 (divisors:1). So, total divisors: 2*1=2.\n\nWhich matches what we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, s=3: s=3 (divisors:1,3), s-1=2 (divisors:1,2). Total divisors: 2*2=4.\n\nWhich also matches.\n\nSo, the number of divisors of s(s-1) is equal to d(s)*d(s-1), where d(n) is the number of divisors of n.\n\nBut for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to the number of small divisors (\u2264 sqrt(s(s-1))).\n\nBut the number of such d's is equal to the number of divisors \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut since s(s-1) is s\u00b2 -s, and sqrt(s(s-1)) is approximately s - 0.5.\n\nWait, sqrt(s^2 - s) = s*sqrt(1 - 1/s) \u2248 s*(1 - 1/(2s)) = s - 0.5.\n\nSo, sqrt(s(s-1)) \u2248 s - 0.5.\n\nSo, the number of divisors d of s(s-1) that are \u2264 s - 0.5.\n\nBut since d must be an integer, we can approximate that the number of valid d's is roughly the number of small divisors up to s -1.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, the small divisors of s(s-1) are the divisors of s and s-1 that are \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each s, the number of valid b's it contributes to is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) such that d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut since the number of such d's is equal to the number of small divisors (\u2264 sqrt(s(s-1))) of s(s-1), and given that s and s-1 are coprime, the number of small divisors is equal to the number of small divisors of s plus the number of small divisors of s-1, but not quite, since the small divisors are those that are factors of s(s-1) and \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d2) where d1 divides s, d2 divides s-1, and d1*d2 \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are greater than or equal to sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nWhich, in turn, is equal to the number of divisors less than or equal to sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut since s(s-1) is not a perfect square (since s and s-1 are coprime and consecutive, their product can't be a square unless s=2, which is 2*1=2, not a square).\n\nWait, for s=2, s(s-1)=2, which is not a square. So, for all s \u22652, s(s-1) is not a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)) is equal to the number of divisors \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut since the total number of divisors is even (since s(s-1) is not a square), each divisor less than sqrt(s(s-1)) pairs with one greater than sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nWait, no, because for non-square numbers, the number of divisors is even, so they can be paired as (d, s(s-1)/d), each pair multiplying to s(s-1). So, the number of divisors \u2264 sqrt(s(s-1)) is equal to half the total number of divisors.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the number is not a square. Since s(s-1) is not a square, the number of divisors is even, and the number of small divisors is exactly half the total number.\n\nSo, for each s, the number of valid d's (i.e., d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1))) is equal to (number of total divisors of s(s-1))/2.\n\nBut wait, let me verify with s=2:\n\ns=2: s(s-1)=2. Total divisors: 2. So, number of valid d's is 2/2=1. Which matches our earlier result, where s=2 contributed to d=2, but d=1 didn't satisfy a \u2264d.\n\nWait, no, earlier for s=2, d=2 was valid, but d=1 wasn't. So, number of valid d's was 1, which is half the total number of divisors (2). So, that seems to hold.\n\nSimilarly, s=3: s(s-1)=6, total divisors=4. So, number of valid d's=2. Earlier, for s=3, d=3 and d=6 were valid. Wait, no, wait, for s=3, the valid d's were d=3 and d=6, but wait, when s=3, d=3 gave b=4, which was valid, and d=6 gave b=7, which was also valid. So, 2 valid d's, which is half of 4. So that holds.\n\nSimilarly, s=4: s(s-1)=12. Total divisors=6. So, number of valid d's=3.\n\nEarlier, for s=4, the valid d's were d=4,6,12. So, 3, which is half of 6. That holds.\n\ns=5: s(s-1)=20. Total divisors=6. So, valid d's=3.\n\nEarlier, for s=5, valid d's were d=5,10,20. So, 3. Correct.\n\nSo, this seems to hold: for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to half the total number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nTherefore, the number of valid d's is (d(s) * d(s-1)) / 2, since s and s-1 are coprime, so the number of divisors is multiplicative.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of valid d's is (d(s) * d(s-1)) / 2.\n\nSo, the number of b's that s contributes to is (d(s) * d(s-1)) / 2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each s, the number of valid d's is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) such that d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nWhich, as per above, is equal to half the total number of divisors of s(s-1), which is (d(s) * d(s-1)) / 2.\n\nTherefore, each s contributes (d(s)*d(s-1))/2 b's.\n\nBut wait, but in reality, for each s, each valid d contributes to a unique b, and each b can be contributed by multiple s's.\n\nSo, to find the count for each b, we need to accumulate the number of s's that contribute to it.\n\nBut the problem is that for each s, multiple b's are being incremented, and we need to track how many times each b is incremented.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute the number of s's that contribute to a given b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that for each s, the number of b's it contributes to is (d(s)*d(s-1))/2, so the total number of b-eautiful numbers across all b's would be the sum over s of (d(s)*d(s-1))/2.\n\nBut we need the count per b.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can instead note that for each b, the number of s's that contribute to it is equal to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) such that d = b -1, and the conditions on a and c are satisfied.\n\nBut this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a function f(b) which counts the number of s's such that:\n\n1. s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1), i.e., (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\n2. a = s(s -1)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b -1.\n\n3. c = s - a is between 0 and b -1.\n\nSo, for each b, f(b) is the number of s's that satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal b where f(b) >10.\n\nSo, perhaps we can iterate b from 2 upwards, compute f(b), and find the minimal b where f(b) >10.\n\nBut how to compute f(b) efficiently?\n\nWell, for each b, we can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1, and for each s, check if (b -1) divides s(s -1), then compute a and c, and check if they are within the required ranges.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable for small b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So, for each b, the possible s's are those where s \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1), because s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1).\n\nWait, because s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so one of them must be divisible by any prime factor of (b -1). So, (b -1) must divide s(s -1), meaning that s \u22610 or 1 mod any prime power dividing (b -1).\n\nBut perhaps this is too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, (b -1) must be a factor of s(s -1). So, s must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo each prime factor of (b -1).\n\nBut this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the possible s's are those where s \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1).\n\nWait, let's test this with our earlier examples.\n\nTake b=3: b-1=2.\n\nSo, s must be \u22610 or 1 mod 2.\n\nWhich is always true, since any integer is either 0 or 1 mod 2.\n\nBut in our earlier case for b=3, s=2 contributed, s=3 didn't contribute because a was too big, but s=4 contributed?\n\nWait, no, s=4: when b=3, s=4: a= (4*3)/(3-1)=12/2=6. But a=6 > b-1=2, so it was invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is not just s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1), but also that a must be \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, s must satisfy s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1), and a = s(s -1)/(b -1) \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1, such that s \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1), and a \u2264 b -1.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that d \u2264 s and s - a is within the required range.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, f(b) is equal to the number of pairs (d, k) where d divides (b-1), and k is such that s = (k*(b-1) +1) or s =k*(b-1), and s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are \u2264 (b-1).\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to switch approaches. Let's think about the equation again:\n\ns^2 = a*b + c\n\ns = a + c\n\nSo, substituting c = s - a into the first equation:\n\ns^2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ns^2 = a*(b -1) + s\n\nRearranged:\n\na*(b -1) = s^2 - s\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSo, for a to be integer, (b -1) must divide (s^2 - s).\n\nSo, (b -1) | s(s -1)\n\nWhich means that b -1 is a factor of s(s -1).\n\nSo, for each b, to find the number of s's, we can find all s such that:\n\n1. s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1)\n2. a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1\n3. c = s - a is between 0 and b -1.\n\nSo, for each b, iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1, and check if (b -1) divides s(s -1), then compute a and c, and check the conditions.\n\nThis is manageable for small b, but for larger b, it might take longer.\n\nBut our goal is to find the minimal b where f(b) >10. So, perhaps we can start computing f(b) for b from 2 upwards, until we find the first b where f(b) >10.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nWe'll start with b=2:\n\nb=2:\n\nCheck s from ceil(sqrt(2))=2 up to 1 (since b=2, s must be <2). Wait, that can't be. Because s must be \u2265 sqrt(b)=sqrt(2)=~1.414, so s starts at 2. But b=2, s must be <2, so s can't be 2. So, no s exists. So, f(2)=0.\n\nb=3:\n\ns ranges from 2 up to 2 (since b=3, s <3). So, s=2.\n\nCheck if (3-1)=2 divides 2*(2-1)=2. Yes.\n\nCompute a= (2^2 -2)/2= (4-2)/2=1.\n\nCheck a=1 \u22642. Yes.\n\nc=2 -1=1.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nWe have an integer b that's at least 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.\n\nThe task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b^1 (which is b) up to b^2 - 1. So, any two-digit number in base b is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, the number n can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nNow, the problem states that the sum of the digits a + c must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's:\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut since n = a * b + c, we can substitute that into the equation:\n\na + c = sqrt(a * b + c)\n\nHmm, so we have an equation here involving a, c, and b. Let me write that down again:\n\na + c = sqrt(a * b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That gives:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to see if I can rearrange it:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. Let me group terms:\n\na^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nWait, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me think about that. For each c, we can solve for a, given b. But since a and c are digits in base b, they have to be integers within certain ranges. So, perhaps I can express a in terms of c and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in c. Let me see:\n\nFrom the equation a + c = sqrt(n), and n = a * b + c, so substituting:\n\na + c = sqrt(a * b + c)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, expanding:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a b + c\n\nLet me rearrange all terms to the left:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a b - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of a and c.\n\nWait, maybe I can collect like terms differently. Let's see:\n\na^2 - a b + 2 a c + c^2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out a from the first two terms:\n\na(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation in terms of a.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\na^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0\n\nYes, this is a quadratic in a. For each c, we can find a such that this equation holds.\n\nSince a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps for each base b, I can iterate through possible c values and solve for a, checking if a is an integer within the required range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between a and c.\n\nWait, another approach: Since a and c are digits in base b, and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b^2 - 1.\n\nAlso, since a + c = sqrt(n), then sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, n is a perfect square, and the digits a and c sum up to its square root. So, let me denote s = a + c, which is sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s^2.\n\nBut also, n = a * b + c.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\ns^2 = a * b + c\n\nBut since s = a + c, we have:\n\ns^2 = a b + (s - a)\n\nBecause c = s - a.\n\nSo, substituting c:\n\ns^2 = a b + s - a\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\ns^2 - s = a b - a\n\nFactor out a on the right side:\n\ns^2 - s = a (b - 1)\n\nSo, a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide (s^2 - s).\n\nSo, for each possible s, (b - 1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1). So, for a given b, and given s, a is equal to [s(s - 1)] / (b - 1).\n\nBut since a must be an integer, this fraction must be integral. Also, a must be at least 1 and at most b - 1.\n\nSo, for each b, I can iterate through possible s values and compute a accordingly.\n\nBut how do I determine the possible s values? Let's think about the constraints.\n\nFirst, n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number) and less than b^2. Therefore:\n\nb \u2264 s^2 < b^2\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s < b\n\nBut s is a positive integer, so s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(b - 1).\n\nWait, because s has to be less than b. So, s can be from 1 up to b - 1, but given that n is at least b, s must be at least sqrt(b). So, s must satisfy:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s < b\n\nBut since s is an integer, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.\n\nBut wait, for s, we also have that a and c are digits in base b. So, a is from 1 to b - 1, and c is from 0 to b - 1. Since c = s - a, then c must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b - 1, which implies:\n\n0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b - 1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\na \u2264 s \u2264 a + b - 1\n\nBut since a is at least 1 and at most b - 1, s must be at least 1 and at most (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2. However, earlier we established that s < b, so s is between 1 and b - 1.\n\nBut wait, from the two-digit number constraint, n = s^2 must be \u2265 b, so s \u2265 sqrt(b). Therefore, s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1].\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.\n\nGiven that, for each s in that range, we can compute a as [s(s - 1)] / (b - 1). We need a to be an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\nSo, for each b, we can iterate s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, and for each s, check if (s(s - 1)) is divisible by (b - 1). If it is, then compute a and check if it's in the range [1, b - 1]. If so, then this (a, c) pair is valid, and n is s^2.\n\nEach such n is a b-eautiful number. So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), and a = s(s - 1)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of such s is greater than 10.\n\nThis seems like a plan. So, let me try to formalize this.\n\nGiven b, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1:\n\n1. Check if (s(s - 1)) is divisible by (b - 1). Let's denote d = b - 1. So, check if d divides s(s - 1).\n\n2. If yes, compute a = s(s - 1)/d.\n\n3. Check if a is an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\n4. If so, then count this as a valid b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each b, the count is the number of such s. We need the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable, but it's going to require computation for various b values. Since we're looking for the smallest b where this count is more than 10, I can start checking from b=2 upwards until I find such a b.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be tedious, so maybe I can find a pattern or formula to make this easier.\n\nWait, let's think about the condition that d = b - 1 divides s(s - 1). So, for each b, d is fixed as b - 1, and s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1.\n\nWe can think of s and s - 1 as consecutive integers. So, s and s - 1 are coprime, meaning that any divisor of their product must divide either s or s - 1.\n\nTherefore, d must divide either s or s - 1, or d is a product of factors from s and s - 1.\n\nBut since s and s - 1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors where each factor divides either s or s - 1.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since d divides s(s - 1), then d must be less than or equal to s(s - 1). But since s can be up to b - 1, and d = b - 1, so d = s(s - 1) only if s(s - 1) = d, but s can be up to d, so s(s - 1) could be up to d(d - 1), which is larger than d. So, that's probably not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d, we can find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d] such that d divides s(s - 1).\n\nWait, since b = d + 1, so s ranges from ceil(sqrt(d + 1)) to d.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d] where d divides s(s - 1).\n\nLet me think: for d, s can be from ceil(sqrt(d + 1)) to d.\n\nWe can write s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod d.\n\nWhich means that s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod d, but since s \u2264 d, s can only be 0 or 1 modulo d. But s is at least ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), which is at least 2 for d \u2265 3.\n\nWait, for d \u2265 3, sqrt(d + 1) \u2265 2.\n\nSo, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d], and s \u2261 0 or 1 mod d.\n\nBut s can't be 0 mod d unless s = d, because s \u2264 d.\n\nSimilarly, s can't be 1 mod d unless s = 1, which is below the lower bound for d \u2265 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps the only possible s that satisfies s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod d is s = d, because s = d would make s \u2261 0 mod d, so s(s - 1) = d(d - 1), which is obviously divisible by d.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the example given. The example says that 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see:\n\nIn this case, b = 13, so d = 12. s is sqrt(81) = 9. So, s = 9.\n\nSo, d = 12 divides s(s - 1) = 9 * 8 = 72. 72 divided by 12 is 6, which is a = 6, which is valid because 6 is between 1 and 12.\n\nSo, s = 9, which is less than d = 12, and 12 divides 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nWait, so my earlier thought that only s = d would satisfy s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod d is incorrect. Because here, s = 9, which is less than d = 12, and 12 divides 72.\n\nSo, perhaps my reasoning earlier was flawed. Let me think again.\n\nThe condition is that d divides s(s - 1). Since s and s - 1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors where one factor divides s and the other divides s - 1.\n\nSo, d can be written as d1 * d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s - 1, and gcd(d1, d2) = 1.\n\nTherefore, for each d, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d] such that d1 divides s and d2 divides s - 1, where d1 * d2 = d.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think in terms of factors.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, find all pairs (d1, d2) where d1*d2 = d, and then check if there exists an s such that s \u2261 0 mod d1 and s \u2261 1 mod d2, with s in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d].\n\nBecause s must satisfy s \u2261 0 mod d1 and s \u2261 1 mod d2, since s - 1 \u2261 0 mod d2.\n\nThis is a system of congruences. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since d1 and d2 are coprime (as d1*d2 = d and s and s-1 are coprime), there exists a unique solution modulo d1*d2 = d.\n\nSo, for each factorization d = d1*d2 with gcd(d1, d2) = 1, there is exactly one solution s modulo d. Therefore, in the range from 1 to d, there is exactly one solution for each such factorization.\n\nBut we need s to be in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d].\n\nSo, for each d, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of valid factorizations d = d1*d2 with d1, d2 \u2265 1, gcd(d1, d2) = 1, and s \u2261 0 mod d1 and s \u2261 1 mod d2, where s is in the required range.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex, but maybe for each d, the number of such s is equal to the number of ways to factor d into coprime factors d1 and d2, such that the corresponding s is within [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of d, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. For each d, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d] such that d divides s(s - 1) is equal to the number of s in that range where s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod d.\n\nBut since s is in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d], s can't be 0 mod d unless s = d, because s \u2264 d. Similarly, s can't be 1 mod d unless s = 1, but s is at least ceil(sqrt(d + 1)) which is \u2265 2 for d \u2265 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps the only s that satisfies s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod d is s = d.\n\nBut in the example earlier, s = 9 and d = 12, and 12 divides 9*8=72. So, that's another solution. Therefore, my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps d can divide s(s - 1) even when s is less than d, as long as d shares factors with both s and s - 1.\n\nSince s and s - 1 are coprime, d must be a product of a factor of s and a factor of s - 1.\n\nSo, for d to divide s(s - 1), d must be equal to d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides s - 1, and d1 and d2 are coprime.\n\nThus, for each d, the number of such s is equal to the number of ways to factor d into two coprime factors d1 and d2, such that s \u2261 0 mod d1 and s \u2261 1 mod d2, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d].\n\nEach such factorization gives a unique solution s modulo d, so within the range from 1 to d, there is exactly one solution per valid factorization.\n\nBut since s must be \u2265 ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), which is at least 2, the number of valid s is equal to the number of such factorizations where the solution s is \u2265 ceil(sqrt(d + 1)).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit abstract, but perhaps we can think in terms of the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime numbers, which is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Because each prime factor can go to either d1 or d2, but not both.\n\nWait, yes. The number of ways to factor d into two coprime factors d1 and d2 is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Because each prime factor can go to d1 or d2, and since they have to be coprime, no prime can be in both.\n\nBut each factorization d1*d2 = d with gcd(d1, d2) = 1 corresponds to a unique way of assigning each prime factor to either d1 or d2.\n\nSo, the number of such factorizations is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.\n\nHowever, since d1 and d2 are positive integers greater than or equal to 1, and d1 \u2264 d2 without loss of generality, but in our case, since s must be in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d], we might have multiple factorizations that result in s within that range.\n\nWait, but each factorization gives exactly one solution s modulo d. So, for each factorization, there is exactly one s in [1, d] that satisfies the congruence.\n\nBut we need s to be in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d], so perhaps for each factorization, we check if the solution s is in that range.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's better to approach it computationally.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b.\n\nGiven b, we can compute d = b - 1.\n\nFor each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b - 1, check if d divides s(s - 1). If it does, then a = s(s - 1)/d must be an integer between 1 and b - 1. If so, count this s as valid.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid s is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] where d divides s(s - 1), and a is in [1, b - 1].\n\nGiven that, perhaps the way to proceed is to iterate b from 2 upwards, compute for each b the number of valid s, and stop when we find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut doing this manually is time-consuming, so maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the condition that d divides s(s - 1). Since d = b - 1, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], perhaps d and s share some factors.\n\nWait, but since s < d + 1, and d = b - 1, s can be up to d. So, for example, if d is a prime number, then the only way d divides s(s - 1) is if d divides s or d divides s - 1.\n\nBut since s \u2264 d, d can only divide s if s = d, or s = 1. But s starts from ceil(sqrt(b)) which is at least 2 for b \u2265 5.\n\nSo, for prime d, the only s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d] that satisfy d divides s(s - 1) are s = d (since s = 1 is too small). So, for prime d, there's only one s, which is s = d.\n\nBut let's test this with an example. Let\u2019s take b = 13, so d = 12, which is not prime. But in the example, s = 9, which is less than d.\n\nWait, but 12 is not prime, so it's composite. So, for composite d, there might be multiple s values that satisfy d divides s(s - 1).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of divisors of d, or something similar.\n\nWait, but in the case of d = 12, which is 2^2 * 3, the number of factorizations into coprime d1 and d2 is 2^2 = 4. So, four factorizations. Each of these would correspond to a unique s modulo d. But s must be in [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d], which is [ceil(sqrt(13)), 12] = [4, 12].\n\nSo, for each factorization, we can compute s and see if it's in that range.\n\nFor d = 12:\n\nFactorizations into coprime pairs (d1, d2):\n\n1. d1 = 1, d2 = 12: s \u2261 0 mod 1 (always true) and s \u2261 1 mod 12. So, s = 1, but 1 is less than 4, so invalid.\n\n2. d1 = 3, d2 = 4: s \u2261 0 mod 3 and s \u2261 1 mod 4.\n\nWe can solve this system:\n\ns \u2261 0 mod 3\n\ns \u2261 1 mod 4\n\nFind s such that s = 3k, and 3k \u2261 1 mod 4.\n\n3k \u2261 1 mod 4 => 3k mod 4 =1. So, 3k can be 1, 5, 9, etc. So, k \u2261 3 mod 4 (since 3*3=9\u22611 mod4). So, k=4m + 3.\n\nThus, s=3*(4m+3)=12m +9. The smallest s in [4,12] is 9, then 21, which is beyond 12. So, s=9 is valid.\n\n3. d1=4, d2=3: s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nSo, s=4k, and 4k \u22611 mod3.\n\n4k \u22611 mod3 => k \u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3, so 1*k\u22611 mod3 => k\u22611).\n\nThus, k=3m +1, so s=4*(3m+1)=12m +4. The smallest s in [4,12] is 4, then 16, which is beyond. So, s=4 is valid.\n\n4. d1=12, d2=1: s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. But mod1 is always 0, so s must be 0 mod12, which is s=12. But s must be \u226412, so s=12 is valid.\n\nSo, for d=12, we have s=4,9,12 as valid s in [4,12].\n\nEach of these s values would give a valid a.\n\nSo, for each s, compute a = s(s-1)/d.\n\nFor s=4: a=4*3/12=12/12=1. Which is valid since 1 \u2264 a \u226412.\n\nFor s=9: a=9*8/12=72/12=6. Valid.\n\nFor s=12: a=12*11/12=11. Valid.\n\nSo, three valid s values, each giving a valid a. So, for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers: 4^2=16, 9^2=81, and 12^2=144. Wait, but 144 is a three-digit number in base 13: 144 = 10*13 + 4, which is 'A4'_{13}, but wait, 10 is a digit? No, in base 13, digits go up to 12, so 10 is represented as 'A' or something, but the digits are a=10 and c=4. But wait, a=11 in this case, because s=12, a=12*11/12=11.\n\nWait, n=12^2=144. In base 13, 144 is 11*13 + 1, which is 'B1'_{13}, since 11 is 'B' in base 13. So, digits are a=11 and c=1. 11 +1=12, which is sqrt(144). So, yes, valid.\n\nSo, in this case, for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut the example only mentions 81, which is one of them. So, perhaps the problem counts all such numbers, so for b=13, there are three.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example is given, but it's not stated how many there are for each b. So, perhaps for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers can vary, and we need to find the smallest b where this number exceeds ten.\n\nSo, to find the smallest b where the count of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten, we need to find how the count grows with b.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can look for b where d = b - 1 has many factorizations into coprime pairs, leading to multiple s values in the required range.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract, so perhaps I can think of it in terms of the number of divisors.\n\nWait, for each d, the number of valid s is equal to the number of coprime factorizations of d, which is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. But not all of these factorizations will result in s within the required range.\n\nWait, but in the case of d=12, which has 2 distinct prime factors (2 and 3), we have 2^2=4 factorizations, but only 3 of them resulted in s within [4,12].\n\nHmm, so perhaps the number of valid s is less than or equal to 2^{k}.\n\nBut maybe for d with many small factors, the number of valid s increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of divisors of d that are greater than or equal to sqrt(d + 1). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of divisors of d, but that doesn't seem to fit the example.\n\nWait, in the case of d=12, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1)=6. But we had 3 valid s values. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime numbers, which is 2^{k}, but as we saw, for d=12, it's 4, but only 3 of them gave s within the range.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of coprime factorizations where the solution s is within the required range.\n\nBut without a general formula, perhaps it's better to think about how the number of valid s increases with d.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the number of valid s increases as d has more small factors, allowing for more s values in the range [ceil(sqrt(d + 1)), d] that satisfy d divides s(s - 1).\n\nSo, perhaps the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds ten is when d = b - 1 is a number with a high number of small prime factors, allowing for many s values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for d being a factorial, which has many factors, we can get a high number of valid s.\n\nBut to find the exact value, perhaps I can think of how the number of valid s increases with b.\n\nLet me try to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for small b and see when it exceeds ten.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nd=1\n\ns must be in [ceil(sqrt(2)),1], but ceil(sqrt(2))=2, which is greater than 1, so no s.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me start by understanding what a b-eautiful number is.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nThey gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). Got it.\n\nSo, let's break down what a two-digit number in base b looks like. A two-digit number in base b is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. Importantly, d1 must be less than b (since it's a digit), and d0 must also be less than b. Also, since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, right? So d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). But n is d1*b + d0. So, putting it together:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nLet me square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can factor it or find some way to express it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as:\n\nn = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nBut n is also equal to d1*b + d0. So, putting them together:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d0. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd1*b + d0 = s^2\n\nBut s = d1 + d0, so:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nLet me express d0 in terms of s and d1: d0 = s - d1.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nd1*b + (s - d1) = s^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b + s - d1 = s^2\n\nFactor d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) + s = s^2\n\nSo, d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nThen,\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the right-hand side must be an integer. So (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). \n\nAdditionally, d0 = s - d1, which must also be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for each base b, I need to find all s such that:\n\n1. s = d1 + d0, where d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.\n\n2. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer, and d0 = s - d1 is also a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of valid s that satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of such s is greater than 10.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each b starting from 2 upwards, I need to find the number of s that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut since we're looking for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I can find a way to express the number of solutions in terms of b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to iterate over possible s and see what constraints that imposes on b.\n\nWait, let me think. For each s, we have:\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nWhich implies:\n\ns^2 - s \u2265 b - 1 (since denominator is positive because b \u2265 2)\n\nand\n\ns^2 - s \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nWait, but that might not be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps for each s, we can determine possible b's such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nAlternatively, since s = d1 + d0, and d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, s can range from 1 (when d1=1, d0=0) up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But in reality, s can't be too large because n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b.\n\nWait, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b (the smallest two-digit number, 10_b = b) and b^2 - 1 (the largest two-digit number, (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1). So, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b^2 -1.\n\nBut n = s^2, so s^2 must be in [b, b^2 -1]. So s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b^2 - 1). But sqrt(b^2 -1) is just a bit less than b. So s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], since s^2 must be less than b^2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. For example, if b=13, then n can be up to 168 (since 12*13 +12= 168). So s^2 must be \u2264168. So s can be up to 12, since 13^2 is 169, which is beyond 168. So s can be from sqrt(13) \u22483.605 up to 12.\n\nSo in general, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1, because s^2 \u2264 b^2 -1 < b^2, so s < b. So s is at most b-1.\n\nSo for each base b, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Suppose b=2: two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10_2=2 and 11_2=3. So n can be 2 or 3. Then s^2 must be 2 or 3, but 2 isn't a perfect square, so no solutions. So s must satisfy s^2 =2 or 3, but those aren't squares, so no b-eautiful numbers in base 2.\n\nSimilarly, for b=3: two-digit numbers are 3 (10_3) up to 8 (22_3). So s^2 must be between 3 and 8. So s can be 2 (s=2, s^2=4) or s=3 (s^2=9, which is beyond 8). So s=2 is the only possibility. Then let's see if it's valid.\n\nSo for b=3, s=2:\n\nd1 = (2^2 -2)/(3-1) = (4-2)/2=1.\n\nd0 = s - d1 = 2 -1=1.\n\nSo the number is d1 d0 in base 3: 11_3, which is 1*3 +1=4, which is 2^2. So 4 is 3-eautiful. So yes, one solution.\n\nSo for each base, the number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1), and d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nBut since d0 = s - d1, and d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1), we can write d0 = s - (s^2 -s)/(b-1) = [s(b-1) - s^2 + s]/(b-1) = [s(b -1 +1) - s^2]/(b-1) = [s*b - s^2]/(b-1) = s*(b - s)/(b -1)\n\nSo d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n\n1. Check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Check if d1 is between 1 and b-1.\n\n2. Compute d0 = s - d1. Check if d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nIf both, then it's a valid solution.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfy these conditions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   - For each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1:\n\n      - Check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes:\n\n         - Compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Check if 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1.\n\n         - Compute d0 = s - d1. Check if 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\n         - If both, count this s as a valid solution.\n\n   - If the count exceeds 10, return b as the answer.\n\nSo now, to find the minimal b where the count is more than 10.\n\nBut instead of checking each b one by one, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think about the equation d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). So for d1 to be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be a multiple of (b -1). So (b -1) must divide s(s - 1).\n\nSo for each s, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). So, for a given s, (b -1) can be any divisor of s(s -1). But since b must be at least 2, (b-1) is at least 1, so b = divisor +1.\n\nBut wait, but for each b, we're considering s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. So perhaps it's better to fix s and see for which b's this s can be a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for a given s, the possible (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So (b-1) can be any divisor of s(s -1), so for each s, the possible values of (b -1) are the divisors of s(s -1). Then, for each such (b -1), we can compute b = divisor +1, and then check if d1 and d0 are within their digit ranges.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of s for a given b.\n\nBut since I'm looking for the minimal b with more than 10 solutions, perhaps it's feasible to compute for each b starting from 2 until I find the first one where the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b up to, say, 100 or so might be tedious, but perhaps manageable if I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation:\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nd1 = s(s -1)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So for each s, (b-1) is a divisor of s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, the possible values of (b -1) are the positive divisors of s(s-1). So, for each s, the possible b's are the divisors of s(s-1) plus 1.\n\nBut for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of positive divisors of s(s-1). But since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, the number of divisors of s(s-1) is equal to the product of the number of divisors of s and the number of divisors of s-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe it's better to think that for each s, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1). But since we're looking for b >=2, each divisor d of s(s-1) gives a b = d +1.\n\nBut in our problem, we're looking for, for each b, the number of s's that satisfy the conditions. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of for each b, how many s's satisfy the conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I can express s in terms of b.\n\nFrom d1 = s(s -1)/(b -1), and since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, we have:\n\n1 <= s(s -1)/(b -1) <= b-1\n\nWhich implies:\n\nb -1 <= s(s -1) <= (b -1)^2\n\nSo, s(s -1) must be between b -1 and (b -1)^2.\n\nBut s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find for each b, the range of s that satisfies s(s -1) >= b -1 and s(s -1) <= (b -1)^2.\n\nBut this might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that s(s-1) must be a multiple of (b-1). So, s(s-1) = k*(b-1), where k is integer, and d1 = k.\n\nSince d1 must be <= b-1, k <= b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s -1).\n\nSo, for each b, the count is the number of s in that range where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, or a combination.\n\nWait, because s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between s and s-1.\n\nSo, if (b-1) divides s(s -1), then (b-1) must be a product of factors from s and s-1, which are coprime.\n\nTherefore, (b-1) can be written as d1 * d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s -1, and gcd(d1, d2) =1.\n\nSo, for each s, (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that can be expressed as s and s-1.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nWait, no, that might not necessarily be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, (b-1) must be a factor of s(s-1). So, for each s, the possible (b-1) is any divisor of s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, there are as many (b-1) as the number of divisors of s(s-1). Then, each such (b-1) gives a b = divisor +1.\n\nBut since we're interested in the number of s's for each b, perhaps it's better to consider for each s, the number of b's that can be formed, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should instead approach this by trying small values of b and see how many solutions each has, then see when it exceeds 10.\n\nLet me start with b=2:\n\nb=2:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 2 are 10_2=2 and 11_2=3.\n\nSo n can be 2 or 3.\n\ns = sqrt(n) must be integer, so n must be a perfect square.\n\n2 is not a square, 3 isn't.

Count=3.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nn=81: yes.\n\nn=256: yes.\n\nn=576: yes.\n\nSo count=3.\n\nHmm, so up to b=25, the maximum count is 3. But the problem asks for more than ten. So I must have made a mistake in my approach because up to b=25, the counts are only 3.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a b where s can be much larger, allowing more solutions. Let's think about the equation:\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\ns^2 - s = k*(b -1), where k = d1 is between 1 and b-1.\n\nSo, s^2 - s must be a multiple of (b-1). So, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, or be a product of factors from both.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of solutions for each b is equal to the number of s in the range where s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b-1).\n\nWait, but maybe for each divisor d of (b-1), there are two possible s: one congruent to 0 mod d and another congruent to 1 mod d.\n\nBut since s must be less than b, the number of solutions depends on the number of divisors of (b-1).\n\nBut to have more than ten solutions, (b-1) must have more than ten divisors, and each divisor d would contribute two s's: s = d and s = d+1.\n\nWait, but s must be <= b-1, so for each divisor d of (b-1), s can be d or d+1, provided s <= b-1.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is roughly twice the number of divisors of (b-1), but adjusted for the range of s.\n\nTherefore, to have more than ten solutions, (b-1) must have more than five divisors, because each divisor contributes two solutions.\n\nWait, no. Because each divisor d of (b-1) can give two s's: s=d and s=d+1, but s must be <= b-1.\n\nSo, for example, if (b-1) has t divisors, then the number of s's is 2t, but we have to ensure that s=d+1 <= b-1.\n\nBut since d is a divisor of (b-1), d <= b-1, so s=d+1 <= b.\n\nBut s must be <= b-1, so s=d+1 <= b-1 => d <= b-2.\n\nBut d is a divisor of (b-1), so d can be up to (b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for each divisor d of (b-1), s can be d or d+1, provided that d+1 <= b-1.\n\nSo the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that d+1 <= b-1, multiplied by 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), s can be d or d+1, but s must be <= b-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b-1), if d+1 <= b-1, then s can be d or d+1. If d+1 = b, which is beyond the range, then only s=d is valid.\n\nBut in our case, s must be <= b-1, so d+1 <= b-1 => d <= b-2.\n\nBut d is a divisor of (b-1), so d can be 1, 2, ..., up to (b-1).\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b-1), s can be d or d+1, provided that d+1 <= b-1.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such d's where d+1 <= b-1, multiplied by 2.\n\nBut to have more than ten solutions, the number of such d's must be more than five, because each contributes two solutions.\n\nWait, but (b-1) could have multiple divisors, each contributing two s's.\n\nFor example, if (b-1) is a highly composite number, like 60, which has many divisors, then b=61 would have many solutions.\n\nWait, let's test this idea.\n\nSuppose (b-1)=60, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nEach divisor d contributes s=d and s=d+1, provided s <=60.\n\nSo for d=1: s=1 and 2.\n\nd=2: s=2 and3.\n\nd=3: s=3 and4.\n\nd=4: s=4 and5.\n\nd=5: s=5 and6.\n\nd=6: s=6 and7.\n\nd=10: s=10 and11.\n\nd=12: s=12 and13.\n\nd=15: s=15 and16.\n\nd=20: s=20 and21.\n\nd=30: s=30 and31.\n\nd=60: s=60 and61 (but 61>60, so only s=60.\n\nSo total s's:\n\nFrom d=1:1,2\n\nd=2:2,3\n\nd=3:3,4\n\nd=4:4,5\n\nd=5:5,6\n\nd=6:6,7\n\nd=10:10,11\n\nd=12:12,13\n\nd=15:15,16\n\nd=20:20,21\n\nd=30:30,31\n\nd=60:60\n\nSo unique s's:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,13,15,16,20,21,30,31,60.\n\nTotal of 18 s's.\n\nBut wait, each s must satisfy s <= b-1=60.\n\nSo, for b=61, the number of s's would be 18.\n\nBut we need to ensure that for each s, d0 = s - d1 is a valid digit (<=60).\n\nWait, but in this case, since b=61, d0 must be <=60.\n\nBut d0 = s - d1.\n\nBut d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) = (s^2 -s)/60.\n\nSo, for each s, d1 must be integer and d0 must be <=60.\n\nBut in this case, since (b-1)=60, and s is a divisor or one more than a divisor, d1 would be s(s-1)/60.\n\nBut for s=1: d1=0, which is invalid since d1 must be >=1.\n\ns=2: d1=(4-2)/60=2/60=1/30.

Because even though (b-1)=60 has many divisors, not all s's derived from those divisors will result in integer d1 and valid d0.\n\nThus, the number of solutions isn't directly proportional to the number of divisors of (b-1), but rather depends on which s's result in integer d1 and valid d0.\n\nSo perhaps the earlier approach of checking each b incrementally is better, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for b where (b-1) is a factorial or highly composite, but I need a better strategy.\n\nWait, let's think about the equation again:\n\nd1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1)\n\nWe can rearrange this to:\n\nb-1 = (s^2 -s)/d1\n\nSince b-1 must be an integer, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by d1.\n\nBut d1 is a digit in base b, so d1 <= b-1.\n\nWait, but b-1 = (s^2 -s)/d1.\n\nSo, d1 must be a divisor of (s^2 -s).\n\nThus, for each s, the possible values of d1 are the divisors of s(s-1).\n\nThen, for each such d1, b = 1 + (s(s-1))/d1.\n\nSince b must be an integer >=2, (s(s-1))/d1 must be >=1.\n\nSo, for each s >=2, and d1 a divisor of s(s-1), we can compute b = 1 + (s(s-1))/d1.\n\nThen, for each such b, we can count how many s's lead to valid solutions.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal b such that the number of s's for that b exceeds 10.\n\nSo, for each s, and each divisor d1 of s(s-1), compute b=1 + (s(s-1))/d1, and for each such b, keep track of how many s's contribute to it.\n\nThen, the b with the highest count will be our answer.\n\nBut since we need the minimal b with count>10, perhaps it's better to iterate s from 2 upwards and for each s, compute all possible b's and update their counts.\n\nOnce any b's count exceeds 10, we can note the minimal such b.\n\nThis approach might be more efficient.\n\nSo, let's try this.\n\nWe'll create a dictionary to keep track of the count for each b.\n\nInitialize an empty dictionary.\n\nFor s starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   Compute s(s-1).\n\n   Find all divisors d1 of s(s-1).\n\n   For each d1:\n\n      Compute b = 1 + (s(s-1))/d1.\n\n      If b >=2:\n\n          If b is in the dictionary, increment its count.\n\n          Else, add b to the dictionary with count=1.\n\n   After each s, check if any b in the dictionary has count>10.

Because for b=2, two-digit numbers are 10_2=2 and 11_2=3.\n\nSo n must be 2 or3.\n\nBut for s=12, n=s^2=144, which is way beyond the two-digit numbers in base2 (which are only 2 and3). So this is invalid.\n\nWait, this indicates a problem with the approach. Because when we compute b=2 for s=12, it's invalid since n=144 is a three-digit number in base2.\n\nSo, our method counts b=2 as having 11 solutions, but in reality, all those solutions are invalid because n is beyond the two-digit limit in base2.\n\nThus, our approach is flawed because it doesn't check whether n is a two-digit number in base b.\n\nSo, we need to modify our method to only count solutions where n is a two-digit number in base b, i.e., b <=n <b^2.\n\nBut n = s^2, so s^2 must satisfy b <=s^2 <b^2.\n\nWhich implies sqrt(b) <=s <b.\n\nBut s is also <=b-1, as per earlier.\n\nWait, but for b=2, s must be >=ceil(sqrt(2))=2, and <=1, which is impossible. So for b=2, there are no solutions.\n\nBut in our earlier approach, we counted b=2 as having 11 solutions, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, to correct this, we need to ensure that for each computed b, the corresponding s satisfies s >=ceil(sqrt(b)) and s <b.\n\nSo, for each s and d1, when we compute b=1 + (s(s-1))/d1, we must check if s is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nIf not, discard that solution.\n\nThis complicates the approach, but it's necessary.\n\nThus, for each s, and each d1, compute b=1 + (s(s-1))/d1.\n\nThen, check if s is >=ceil(sqrt(b)) and s <=b-1.\n\nIf yes, count it; else, discard.\n\nSo, let's adjust our method.\n\nLet's recompute for s=2 to s=12, but now with this additional check.\n\ns=2:\n\ns=2.\n\nCompute b=1 + (2*1)/d1.\n\nd1=1: b=3.\n\nCheck if s=2 is in [ceil(sqrt(3))=2, 3-1=2].

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem states that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers, meaning more than ten n's for a single b. So, for a single b, there are multiple n's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, even for b=23, there are only4 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the counts. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nEach s corresponds to a unique n = s^2, which must be a two-digit number in base b. So, for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of s's such that:\n\n1. s = d1 + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b (d1 >=1, d0 >=0).\n\n2. n = s^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s^2 = d1*b + d0 and d1 + d0 = s.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1).\n\nRearranging: s^2 - s = d1*(b -1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1), and d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) is an integer between1 and b-1.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d1 of (s^2 -s) such that d1 = (s^2 -s)/(b-1) is an integer between1 and b-1.\n\nBut this is the same as earlier.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, there exists a b with more than ten solutions. So perhaps I need to find a b where (b-1) is a highly composite number, leading to many s's.\n\nWait, let's try b=121.\n\nThen b-1=120.\n\n120 has many divisors:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120.\n\nFor each s, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by120.\n\nSo s(s-1) must be divisible by120.\n\nSo s must be such that s or s-1 is divisible by5, and s or s-1 divisible by3, and s or s-1 divisible by8.\n\nThus, s can be congruent to0 or1 modulo5,3,8.\n\nThis would allow many s's, potentially leading to many solutions.\n\nBut s must also satisfy sqrt(121)=11 <=s <=120.\n\nSo s ranges from11 to120.\n\nThus, the number of s's where s(s-1) is divisible by120 is quite large.\n\nBut how many such s's are there?\n\nIt's equal to the number of s in [11,120] such that s or s-1 is divisible by5,3,8.\n\nBut to count them, we can think of the least common multiple.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to note that for b=121, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [11,120] where s(s-1) is divisible by120.\n\nBut since 120=8*3*5, s or s-1 must be divisible by8,3,5.\n\nThis would happen for s congruent to0 or1 modulo lcm(8,3,5)=120.\n\nBut s ranges up to120, so s=120 is the only s where s is divisible by120.\n\nAlternatively, s=1: but s starts at11.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that the number of s in [11,120] where s(s-1) is divisible by120 is equal to the number of s where s \u22610 or1 mod8, s\u22610 or1 mod3, and s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThis is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such s's is roughly (number of s where s or s-1 divisible by8) * (similar for3) * (similar for5).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each prime factor, the number of s's where s or s-1 is divisible by that prime.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for b=121, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d1 of s(s-1), which is large.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is not feasible manually.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 22, as seen earlier, but with more solutions.\n\nWait, but earlier counts didn't reach ten.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 23, but the count was4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach and the minimal b is much larger.\n\nBut given the time I've spent, I think the minimal b is 23.\n\nBut earlier counts for b=23 were4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for a b where (b-1) is a factorial, like24.\n\nBut b=25: (b-1)=24.\n\n24 has divisors1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nFor each s, (s^2 -s) must be divisible by24.\n\nSo s(s-1) must be divisible by24.\n\nThus, s must be congruent to0 or1 modulo24, or s and s-1 must cover the factors.\n\nBut s ranges from5 to24.\n\nSo s can be5,6,...,24.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 not divisible by24.\n\ns=6:6*5=30, 30/24=1.25.

Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nThe example given is 81, which is 13-eautiful. In base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me formalize the conditions. If n is a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote k = sqrt(n). So, n = k^2.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\nk^2 = a*b + c\nand\nk = a + c\n\nSo, substituting k into the first equation:\nk^2 = a*b + (k - a)\nSimplify that:\nk^2 = a*b + k - a\nLet me rearrange terms:\nk^2 - k = a*(b - 1)\nSo, a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must also be an integer. So, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). That means b - 1 is a divisor of k^2 - k.\n\nAlternatively, b = (k^2 - k)/a + 1\n\nBut since a is between 1 and b-1, and b is at least 2, I can think about possible values of k and a that satisfy this equation.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express this in terms of b. Let's see.\n\nFrom the equation k^2 - k = a*(b - 1), since a must be a positive integer less than b, and b must be at least 2, I can think of possible values of k and a that satisfy this for different bases b.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of k. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So, n must satisfy b \u2264 n \u2264 b^2 - 1.\n\nSince n is k^2, we have b \u2264 k^2 \u2264 b^2 - 1. Taking square roots, sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just slightly less than b, so k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1, because k must be an integer.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's say b=10. Then n is between 10 and 99, so k is between 4 (since 4^2=16) and 9 (since 9^2=81). 10^2 is 100, which is beyond the two-digit number in base 10. So, for base b, k can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nBecause if k = b, then k^2 = b^2, which is a three-digit number in base b (100_b), so k must be less than b.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible k values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.\n\nNow, for each such k, I can find a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be a positive integer a in that range.\n\nAlternatively, since b - 1 must divide k^2 - k, which factors into k*(k - 1). So, b - 1 divides k*(k - 1).\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1).\n\nHmm, that's a key point. So, for each base b, I need to count how many k satisfy that (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1), where k is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b - 1.\n\nWait, but since k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, their GCD is 1. Therefore, for (b - 1) to divide k*(k - 1), it must be that (b - 1) can be factored into two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k - 1.\n\nLet me think about that. Since k and k - 1 are coprime, the factors of (b - 1) must split between them. So, if I factor (b - 1) as m * n, where m and n are coprime, then m divides k and n divides k - 1, or vice versa.\n\nWait, actually, since (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1), and k and k - 1 are coprime, then (b - 1) must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing k and the other dividing k - 1. So, for each factor m of (b - 1), where m and (b - 1)/m are coprime, we can have solutions where m divides k and (b - 1)/m divides k - 1, or vice versa.\n\nBut maybe this is getting a bit too abstract. Let's approach this differently.\n\nGiven that (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1), then k \u2261 0 mod d or k \u2261 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b - 1). Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to note that for each divisor d of (b - 1), we can set k \u2261 0 mod d and k \u2261 1 mod ( (b - 1)/d ). Or something like that.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to consider that for each base b, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1) that are less than or equal to k, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the equation a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) and see what constraints that puts on a.\n\nSince a must be at least 1 and at most b - 1, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nb - 1 \u2264 k^2 - k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\n1 \u2264 (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nMultiplying all parts by (b - 1):\n\nb - 1 \u2264 k^2 - k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nSo, the lower bound is k^2 - k \u2265 b - 1\n\nAnd the upper bound is k^2 - k \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nSo, for each k, the value of (k^2 - k) must be between (b - 1) and (b - 1)^2.\n\nBut since k is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b - 1, maybe we can find for each b, the possible k's that satisfy these inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express b in terms of k and a.\n\nFrom a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), we can rearrange to get b = (k^2 - k)/a + 1.\n\nSince b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by a, and (k^2 - k)/a + 1 must be an integer \u2265 2.\n\nSo, for each k, and each divisor a of (k^2 - k), we can compute b as (k^2 - k)/a + 1, and if b is an integer \u2265 2, and a is between 1 and b - 1, then n = k^2 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nWait, but a must be less than b, which is (k^2 - k)/a + 1. So, a < (k^2 - k)/a + 1.\n\nMultiplying both sides by a: a^2 < k^2 - k + a\n\nWhich rearranged is: a^2 - a - (k^2 - k) < 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by fixing k and a, then computing b, and then for each b, count how many such n exist.\n\nBut since I need to find the smallest b with more than ten such n's, perhaps I can iterate over possible b's and count the number of k's for each.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n   a. Determine the range of k: ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 k \u2264 b - 1.\n   b. For each k in this range, check if (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1). If yes, then compute a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).\n   c. Ensure that a is an integer between 1 and b - 1. If so, count this k as contributing to a b-eautiful number.\n   d. After checking all k's for this b, if the count exceeds ten, return this b as the answer.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive if done manually for each b. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute the number of k's for each b.\n\nAlternatively, since (b - 1) divides k*(k - 1), and k and k - 1 are coprime, (b - 1) must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing k and the other dividing k - 1.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b - 1), set d divides k and (b - 1)/d divides k - 1. Since d and (b - 1)/d are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo (b - 1) for k. So, for each such divisor pair, there is exactly one k modulo (b - 1) that satisfies both congruences.\n\nBut since k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], the number of valid k's would depend on how many such solutions exist in that interval.\n\nWait, but each divisor d of (b - 1) gives rise to a possible k. So, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1). But not exactly, because for each divisor d, we get a unique k modulo (b - 1), but we have to check if that k is within the required range.\n\nWait, no. Because d and (b - 1)/d are factors, but they are coprime. So, for each divisor d of (b - 1), where d <= (b - 1)/d, we can have a unique k that satisfies k \u2261 0 mod d and k \u2261 1 mod ((b - 1)/d). The number of such k's would be equal to the number of such divisor pairs.\n\nBut since each divisor pair (d, (b - 1)/d) gives a unique solution modulo (b - 1), the number of k's is equal to the number of such pairs, which is equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1). But wait, each divisor less than sqrt(b - 1) would pair with one greater than sqrt(b - 1), except when d = (b - 1)/d, which happens when (b - 1) is a perfect square.\n\nWait, but for each divisor d of (b - 1), there is a corresponding divisor (b - 1)/d. So, the number of such k's would be equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1), but each k is unique modulo (b - 1). So, for each divisor pair, you get a solution in the range 1 to (b - 1). But since k must be >= ceil(sqrt(b)) and <= b - 1, not all of these solutions will lie in the required range.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can think about specific examples to see the pattern.\n\nLet's take the example given: b = 13.\n\nThen, (b - 1) = 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nFor each divisor d of 12, we can set k \u2261 0 mod d and k \u2261 1 mod (12/d). Let's solve for k.\n\nFor d=1:\nk \u2261 0 mod 1 (always true)\nk \u2261 1 mod 12\nSo, k \u2261 1 mod 12. The solutions in 1 to 12 are k=1,13,25,... But since k must be <=12 (since b=13, k <=12), so k=1. But k must be >= ceil(sqrt(13))=4. So, k=1 is invalid.\n\nd=2:\nk \u2261 0 mod 2\nk \u2261 1 mod 6\nSo, solving:\nk \u2261 0 mod 2\nk \u2261 1 mod 6\nLooking for k in 1-12.\nPossible k's are 7, since 7 mod 6 is 1 and 7 mod 2 is 1. Wait, 7 mod 2 is 1, but we need k \u2261 0 mod 2. So, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the system is:\nk \u2261 0 mod 2\nk \u2261 1 mod 6\n\nLet me solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nLet k = 6m + 1. Then, 6m + 1 \u2261 0 mod 2. 6m is 0 mod 2, so 1 \u2261 0 mod 2, which is impossible. So, no solution for d=2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, for d=2, no solution exists.\n\nd=3:\nk \u2261 0 mod 3\nk \u2261 1 mod 4\nSo, k = 3m. Then, 3m \u2261 1 mod 4 => 3m \u2261 1 mod 4 => m \u2261 3 mod 4 (since 3*3=9\u22611 mod4). So, m=4n +3. So, k=3*(4n +3)=12n +9. So, in 1-12, k=9. 9 is within 4 to 12, so valid.\n\nSo, k=9 is a solution. Then, a = (9^2 -9)/(12) = (81 -9)/12 =72/12=6. So, a=6, which is between 1 and 12. So, n=9^2=81 is 6*13 +3=81, which matches the example.\n\nd=4:\nk \u22610 mod4\nk \u22611 mod3\nSo, k=4m. Then, 4m \u22611 mod3 => m \u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3, so 1*m\u22611 mod3 => m\u22611 mod3). So, m=3n +1. Thus, k=4*(3n +1)=12n +4. In 1-12, k=4. But k must be >=4, so k=4 is valid.\n\nCheck a: (4^2 -4)/(12) = (16 -4)/12 =12/12=1. a=1, which is valid. So, n=4^2=16. In base 13, 16 is 13 + 3 = 1*13 +3=13, which is written as 13, wait no. Wait, 16 in base 13 is 1*13 +3=13+3=16. So, digits are 1 and 3, sum is 4, which is sqrt(16). So yes, 16 is 13-eautiful.\n\nd=6:\nk \u22610 mod6\nk \u22611 mod2\nSo, k=6m. Then, 6m \u22611 mod2 => 0 \u22611 mod2, which is impossible. So, no solution for d=6.\n\nd=12:\nk \u22610 mod12\nk \u22611 mod1\nWhich is always true for k=12. But k must be <=12, so k=12. Check if k >=4: yes.\n\nCompute a: (12^2 -12)/12 = (144 -12)/12=132/12=11. a=11, which is valid. So, n=12^2=144. In base 13, 144 is 11*13 +1=143 +1=144. So, digits are 11 and 1. Their sum is 12, which is sqrt(144). So, 144 is 13-eautiful.\n\nSo, for b=13, the valid k's are 4,9,12. So, three b-eautiful numbers. But in the example, only 81 is mentioned. Wait, but 16 and 144 are also 13-eautiful. So, that's three numbers. So, perhaps the example was just one of them.\n\nSo, the number of b-eautiful numbers for b=13 is 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, we need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers. So, perhaps for higher b's, the number increases.\n\nBut how can I find the number of such numbers for a given b? It seems that it's related to the number of divisors of (b-1). For each divisor d of (b-1), we can get a solution for k, but not all d's will yield valid k's in the required range.\n\nWait, but in the case of b=13, (b-1)=12, which has 6 divisors, but only 3 of them yielded valid k's. So, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b - 1)/2? Or maybe it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to express (b - 1) as a product of two coprime factors, which is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of (b-1)}.\n\nWait, because for each prime factor, you can assign it to either d or (b-1)/d. So, the number of coprime pairs (d, (b-1)/d) is 2^{number of distinct primes}.\n\nFor example, if (b-1) is 12=2^2*3, the number of coprime pairs would be 2^{2}=4. But in our earlier case, we found 3 solutions. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's because when d and (b-1)/d are not coprime, but in our earlier approach, we considered d and (b-1)/d as coprime, which is not the case when d has multiple factors.\n\nWait, no. Since (b -1) is being factored into d and (b -1)/d, and since k and k-1 are coprime, d and (b -1)/d must also be coprime, because any common factor would have to divide both k and k-1, which are coprime. So, d and (b-1)/d must be coprime. Therefore, the number of such divisor pairs is equal to 2^{number of distinct prime factors of (b-1)}.\n\nSo, for (b -1)=12=2^2*3, the number of coprime pairs (d, (b-1)/d) is 2^2=4. But in our earlier case, we found 3 valid k's. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause one of the divisor pairs doesn't yield a valid k in the required range. For example, when d=1, k=1, which is less than ceil(sqrt(13))=4, so it's invalid. So, not all divisor pairs will result in a valid k.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (d, (b-1)/d) where the corresponding k is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of such k's, which depends on the number of valid solutions of the congruence equations within the required range.\n\nThis seems tricky to model. Maybe instead, I can compute for each b, the number of k's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between k and b.\n\nFrom earlier, we have a = (k^2 - k)/(b -1). Since a must be at least 1, (k^2 - k) >= (b -1). So, k^2 - k - (b -1) >=0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in k: k^2 -k - (b-1) >=0. The roots of the equation k^2 -k - (b -1)=0 are [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4(b-1))]/2. The positive root is [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.\n\nSo, k must be >= [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.\n\nBut we also have that k must be >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, the lower bound for k is the maximum of ceil(sqrt(b)) and [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2.\n\nWait, let's compute [1 + sqrt(4b -3)]/2 for some b's.\n\nFor b=2: [1 + sqrt(5)]/2 \u2248 (1 + 2.236)/2 \u2248 1.618. Ceil(sqrt(2))=2. So, k starts at 2.\n\nFor b=3: [1 + sqrt(9)]/2= (1 +3)/2=2. Ceil(sqrt(3))=2. So, k starts at 2.\n\nFor b=4: [1 + sqrt(13)]/2\u2248 (1+3.606)/2\u22482.303. Ceil(sqrt(4))=2. So, k starts at 3.\n\nWait, sqrt(4)=2, ceil is 2, but 2.303 is higher, so k must be >=3.\n\nWait, but for b=4, k must be >=3, but k must be <=3 (since b-1=3). So, k=3 is the only possibility.\n\nCompute a=(9-3)/(3)=6/3=2. So, a=2. So, n=9. In base 4, 9 is 21 (2*4 +1=9). Sum of digits 2+1=3, which is sqrt(9). So, yes, 9 is 4-eautiful.\n\nSo, for b=4, there's 1 such number.\n\nSimilarly, for b=5:\n\n[1 + sqrt(17)]/2\u2248 (1+4.123)/2\u22482.561. Ceil(sqrt(5))=3. So, k starts at 3.\n\nb-1=4. So, k can be 3,4.\n\nCheck for k=3:\n\na=(9-3)/4=6/4=1.5. Not integer. So, invalid.\n\nk=4:\n\na=(16-4)/4=12/4=3. a=3, which is <=4. So, valid. n=16. In base 5, 16 is 3*5 +1=16. Sum 3+1=4=sqrt(16). So, 16 is 5-eautiful.\n\nSo, only 1 number.\n\nHmm, so it seems that for each b, the number of such k's is limited. To get more than ten, b must be such that (b -1) has a lot of divisors, and many of those divisors will produce k's in the required range.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers increases as the number of divisors of (b -1) increases. So, to maximize the number of k's, (b -1) should have many divisors.\n\nSo, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers, (b -1) should have at least 11 divisors, but not exactly, because as we saw earlier, some divisors may not yield valid k's.\n\nWait, but earlier for b=13, (b-1)=12 has 6 divisors, but only 3 yielded valid k's. So, the number is half the number of divisors? Or perhaps a function of the number of coprime pairs.\n\nWait, maybe for each divisor d of (b-1), if d <= (b-1)/d and the solution k is in the required range, then it counts as a valid k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of solutions k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides k*(k -1).\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, the number of such k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that k \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1).\n\nWait, no. Because (b-1) divides k*(k -1), but k and k-1 are coprime, so (b-1) must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of (b-1) where d and (b-1)/d are coprime, we can solve for k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ). Each such pair (d, (b-1)/d) gives a unique solution modulo (b-1). So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime divisor pairs.\n\nSince each such pair corresponds to a unique k modulo (b-1), and since k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs where the solution k lies in that interval.\n\nBut to maximize the number of such k's, (b -1) should have many coprime divisor pairs, i.e., (b-1) should have many small prime factors.\n\nTherefore, to get more than ten b-eautiful numbers, (b -1) should have enough coprime divisor pairs such that multiple k's fall within the required range.\n\nWait, but for each coprime divisor pair (d, (b-1)/d), you get exactly one solution k modulo (b -1). So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs.\n\nBut the number of coprime pairs is equal to 2^{number of distinct prime factors of (b -1)}.\n\nBecause for each prime factor, you can assign it to d or to (b-1)/d, but not both, since d and (b-1)/d must be coprime.\n\nSo, if (b -1) has m distinct prime factors, the number of coprime pairs is 2^m.\n\nBut in the earlier example, (b -1)=12=2^2*3, which has m=2 distinct primes, so 2^2=4 coprime pairs. But in our earlier calculation, only 3 of them yielded valid k's in the required range. The pair d=1 gave k=1, which was too small, so it was invalid.\n\nSo, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of coprime pairs (d, (b-1)/d) where the solution k is >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nTherefore, to get more than ten b-eautiful numbers, we need (b -1) to have at least 11 coprime pairs, but adjusted for the fact that some pairs might result in k's too small.\n\nBut 2^m >=11 implies m >=4, since 2^4=16. So, (b -1) should have at least four distinct prime factors to have 16 coprime pairs, but some of these may result in k's below the required range.\n\nWait, but 2^m=16 would give 16 solutions, but some of these k's might be too small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that each solution k corresponds to a divisor d of (b -1) such that d <= (b -1)/d, and the solution k is in the required range.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe I can compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for various b's and see when it exceeds ten.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or formula.\n\nFrom earlier, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k*(k -1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to (b -1) divides k^2 -k.\n\nSo, k^2 \u2261k mod (b -1).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as k(k -1) \u22610 mod (b -1).\n\nSo, for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], check if k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, count it.\n\nThis is the same as saying that (b -1) is a divisor of k(k -1).\n\nSo, the number of such k's is equal to the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] where (b -1) divides k(k -1).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to b -1, but considering the constraints on k.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For a given (b -1), the number of k's is equal to the number of solutions to k \u22610 or 1 mod (b -1), but k must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut wait, no. Because (b -1) divides k(k -1), but k and k -1 are coprime, so (b -1) must be a product of two coprime numbers d and e, where d divides k and e divides k -1.\n\nThus, for each pair of coprime divisors d and e of (b -1) such that d*e = (b -1), we can solve for k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod e.\n\nEach such pair gives a unique solution modulo (b -1). So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs.\n\nAnd the number of such coprime pairs is equal to 2^{number of distinct prime factors of (b -1)}.\n\nSo, if (b -1) has m distinct prime factors, the number of solutions is 2^m.\n\nBut again, some of these solutions may result in k < ceil(sqrt(b)), so we have to subtract those.\n\nSo, the number of valid k's is 2^m minus the number of solutions where k < ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I can think of (b -1) as having many small factors, which would lead to many k's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if (b -1) is a factorial number, which has many divisors, but factorial numbers grow quickly.\n\nWait, but let's think of (b -1) as a number with many small factors. For example, if (b -1) is a product of the first n primes, then it would have 2^n coprime pairs, leading to 2^n solutions for k. But since we need more than ten, 2^n >10 => n >=4, since 2^4=16.\n\nSo, (b -1) should be the product of at least four distinct primes. The smallest such number is 2*3*5*7=210. So, b=211. But that's a very large base. Maybe we can find a smaller b.\n\nWait, perhaps (b -1) doesn't need to have four distinct prime factors, but can have multiple exponents. For example, (b -1)=12=2^2*3, which has two distinct primes, but 2^2*3=12. The number of coprime pairs is 2^2=4, but only 3 solutions were valid in the earlier case.\n\nWait, perhaps if (b -1) is a perfect number or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of (b -1) as having a high number of divisors, which would imply that (b -1) is a highly composite number.\n\nFor example, 24 has 8 divisors, 36 has 9, 48 has 10, 60 has 12, etc.\n\nSo, if (b -1) is a highly composite number with many small factors, it would have more coprime pairs, leading to more k's.\n\nSo, perhaps the smallest b where (b -1) is a highly composite number with enough factors to produce more than ten k's.\n\nWait, let's think about (b -1)=60, which has 12 divisors. The number of coprime pairs would be 2^{number of distinct primes}. 60=2^2*3*5, so three distinct primes. So, 2^3=8 coprime pairs. So, potentially 8 solutions, but some may be too small.\n\nBut we need more than ten solutions, so 8 is insufficient. So, perhaps (b -1) needs to have more coprime pairs.\n\nWait, but 2^m >=11 requires m>=4. So, (b -1) needs to have at least four distinct prime factors. The smallest such (b -1) is 2*3*5*7=210, so b=211. But that seems too large. Maybe there's a smaller b.\n\nWait, but perhaps (b -1) can have multiple exponents on its prime factors, which would increase the number of coprime pairs beyond 2^m. Wait, no. Because the number of coprime pairs is determined by the number of distinct prime factors, not their exponents. Because in the coprime pairs, each prime can only go to one side.\n\nSo, for example, (b -1)=12=2^2*3, which has two distinct primes, so 2^2=4 coprime pairs, regardless of the exponents.\n\nTherefore, to get 2^m >=11, we need m>=4. So, the smallest (b -1) with four distinct primes is 2*3*5*7=210. So, b=211.\n\nBut let's test this. For b=211, (b -1)=210=2*3*5*7, which has four distinct primes. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^4=16. Each pair would give a solution for k. Now, we need to check how many of these k's are >= ceil(sqrt(211)).\n\nsqrt(211)\u224814.526, so ceil is 15. So, k must be >=15 and <=210.\n\nEach coprime pair (d, e) where d*e=210 and gcd(d,e)=1 will give a solution k. Each such k is unique modulo 210, so in the range 1-210, there are 16 solutions. Now, how many of these 16 solutions are >=15?\n\nWell, for each of the 16 pairs, the solution k could be in 1-210. Let's see:\n\nFor each divisor d of 210 where d and e=210/d are coprime, we have a solution k.\n\nBut since d can be 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210.\n\nWait, but wait, no. The coprime pairs are (d, e) where d and e are coprime and d*e=210.\n\nSo, for 210=2*3*5*7, the coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,210), (2,105), (3,70), (5,42), (6,35), (7,30), (10,21), (14,15).\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because for coprime pairs, d and e must be coprime. So, for example, (2,105): 2 and 105 are coprime. Similarly, (3,70), (5,42), (6,35) (6 and 35 are coprime?), 6 and 35: gcd(6,35)=1, yes. (7,30): gcd(7,30)=1. (10,21): gcd(10,21)=1. (14,15): gcd(14,15)=1.\n\nWait, so that's 8 coprime pairs, not 16. Because for each pair, (d, e) and (e, d) are the same in terms of coprimality. So, the number is actually 2^{m-1} for m distinct primes.\n\nWait, no. For m distinct primes, the number of coprime pairs (d, e) where d*e=N and gcd(d,e)=1 is 2^{m}.\n\nWait, but in this case, N=210 has four distinct primes, so m=4, so 2^4=16. But above, I only listed 8 pairs. So, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let's list all the coprime pairs (d,e) where d*e=210 and gcd(d,e)=1.\n\nThe factors of 210 are: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210.\n\nNow, for each factor d, check if gcd(d, 210/d)=1.\n\nd=1: e=210. gcd(1,210)=1. Valid.\n\nd=2: e=105. gcd(2,105)=1. Valid.\n\nd=3: e=70. gcd(3,70)=1. Valid.\n\nd=5: e=42. gcd(5,42)=1. Valid.\n\nd=6: e=35. gcd(6,35)=1. Valid.\n\nd=7: e=30. gcd(7,30)=1. Valid.\n\nd=10: e=21. gcd(10,21)=1. Valid.\n\nd=14: e=15. gcd(14,15)=1. Valid.\n\nd=15: e=14. Same as above.\n\nd=21: e=10. Same as d=10.\n\nd=30: e=7. Same as d=7.\n\nd=35: e=6. Same as d=6.\n\nd=42: e=5. Same as d=5.\n\nd=70: e=3. Same as d=3.\n\nd=105: e=2. Same as d=2.\n\nd=210: e=1. Same as d=1.\n\nSo, the distinct coprime pairs are 8, as each pair is counted twice. So, the number of coprime pairs is 8, not 16.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 2^m, which for m=4 would be 16. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, no. Actually, for each prime, you can assign it to either d or e, but since d and e are ordered pairs, the total number is 2^m. However, in our case, since (d,e) and (e,d) are considered the same in terms of coprimality, the number of unordered coprime pairs is 2^{m-1}.\n\nSo, for m=4, it's 8 unordered pairs.\n\nTherefore, for (b -1)=210, which has four distinct primes, the number of coprime pairs is 8. Each pair gives a solution for k modulo 210.\n\nSo, in the range 1-210, there are 8 solutions. But we need k >=15 and <=210.\n\nSo, how many of these 8 solutions are >=15?\n\nWell, let's compute for each pair:\n\n1. d=1, e=210:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod1 (always true)\n   k \u22611 mod210\n   So, k=1, 211, etc. But k must be <=210, so k=1. But 1 <15, invalid.\n\n2. d=2, e=105:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod2\n   k \u22611 mod105\n   Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n   Let k=105m +1. Then, 105m +1 \u22610 mod2 => 105m \u2261-1 mod2 => m \u22611 mod2.\n   So, m=2n +1. Thus, k=105*(2n+1) +1=210n +106. In 1-210, k=106. 106 >=15: valid.\n\n3. d=3, e=70:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod3\n   k \u22611 mod70\n   Let k=70m +1. Then, 70m +1 \u22610 mod3 =>70m \u2261-1 mod3. 70 \u22611 mod3, so m \u2261-1 mod3 => m=3n +2.\n   So, k=70*(3n +2)+1=210n +141. In 1-210, k=141. 141>=15: valid.\n\n4. d=5, e=42:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod5\n   k \u22611 mod42\n   Let k=42m +1. Then, 42m +1 \u22610 mod5 =>42m \u2261-1 mod5. 42\u22612 mod5, so 2m \u2261-1 =>2m\u22614 =>m\u22612 mod5.\n   So, m=5n +2. Thus, k=42*(5n +2)+1=210n +85. In 1-210, k=85. Valid.\n\n5. d=6, e=35:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod6\n   k \u22611 mod35\n   Let k=35m +1. Then, 35m +1 \u22610 mod6. 35\u22615 mod6, so 5m +1 \u22610 =>5m \u2261-1 =>5m\u22615 =>m\u22611 mod6.\n   So, m=6n +1. Thus, k=35*(6n +1)+1=210n +36. In 1-210, k=36. Valid.\n\n6. d=7, e=30:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod7\n   k \u22611 mod30\n   Let k=30m +1. Then, 30m +1 \u22610 mod7. 30\u22612 mod7, so 2m +1 \u22610 =>2m\u2261-1 =>2m\u22616 =>m\u22613 mod7.\n   So, m=7n +3. Thus, k=30*(7n +3)+1=210n +91. In 1-210, k=91. Valid.\n\n7. d=10, e=21:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod10\n   k \u22611 mod21\n   Let k=21m +1. Then, 21m +1 \u22610 mod10. 21\u22611 mod10, so m +1 \u22610 =>m\u2261-1 mod10 =>m=10n +9.\n   So, k=21*(10n +9)+1=210n +189 +1=210n +190. In 1-210, k=190. Valid.\n\n8. d=14, e=15:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod14\n   k \u22611 mod15\n   Let k=15m +1. Then, 15m +1 \u22610 mod14. 15\u22611 mod14, so m +1 \u22610 =>m\u2261-1 mod14 =>m=14n +13.\n   So, k=15*(14n +13)+1=210n +195 +1=210n +196. In 1-210, k=196. Valid.\n\nSo, for each of the 8 coprime pairs, we get a solution k in 1-210. Of these, the first pair (d=1) gives k=1, which is invalid. The other 7 pairs give k=106,141,85,36,91,190,196. All of these are >=15. So, 7 valid k's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for m=4, we would have 8 coprime pairs, but only 7 of them yield valid k's in the required range. So, the number of b-eautiful numbers for b=211 is 7.\n\nBut we need more than ten. So, 7 is not enough. So, perhaps I need a larger (b -1) with more coprime pairs.\n\nWait, but how? Because (b -1)=210 gives 7 solutions, which is less than ten.\n\nWait, perhaps if (b -1) has more than four distinct prime factors. Let's try (b -1)=2*3*5*7*11=2310. So, b=2311.\n\nBut that's a huge base. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (b -1) can be a number with multiple exponents on its prime factors, leading to more divisors, but as we saw earlier, the number of coprime pairs is determined by the number of distinct primes, not the exponents.\n\nWait, unless we consider that for exponents, we can have more pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because in the coprime pairs, the exponents don't matter as long as the primes are assigned to one side or the other.\n\nWait, for example, (b -1)=12=2^2*3. The coprime pairs are (1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1). But only two distinct coprime pairs: (3,4) and (4,3). Wait, but earlier we saw that for d=1, e=12, which gives k=1, which is invalid. For d=3, e=4: solve k \u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod4. Solution k=9, which is valid for b=13.\n\nSimilarly, d=4, e=3: solve k \u22610 mod4, k\u22611 mod3. Solution k=4, which is valid.\n\nSo, for (b -1)=12, which has two distinct primes, we have 2^{2}=4 coprime pairs, but only 3 of them yield valid k's in the required range.\n\nWait, but earlier in the case of b=13, we had three valid k's. So, perhaps the number of valid k's is equal to the number of coprime pairs minus those that result in k < ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, to get more than ten valid k's, we need more than ten coprime pairs, but considering that some may be too small.\n\nWait, but for (b -1)=210, which has four distinct primes, we had 8 coprime pairs, but only 7 yielded valid k's. So, even with four primes, we only get 7 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a (b -1) that is a factorial, which has a lot of divisors. Let's see.\n\nLet's take (b -1)=24=2^3*3. It has three distinct primes: 2 and 3. Wait, no, it's 2^3*3, so two distinct primes. So, number of coprime pairs is 2^2=4.\n\nFor b=25, (b -1)=24.\n\nCompute the valid k's.\n\nFirst, sqrt(25)=5, so k must be >=5 and <=24.\n\nCompute for each coprime pair:\n\n1. d=1, e=24:\n   k=1, invalid.\n\n2. d=3, e=8:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod3\n   k \u22611 mod8\n   Let k=8m +1. 8m +1 \u22610 mod3 =>8m \u2261-1 mod3 =>2m \u22612 mod3 =>m \u22611 mod3.\n   So, m=3n +1. k=8*(3n +1)+1=24n +9. In 1-24, k=9. Valid.\n\n3. d=8, e=3:\n   Solve k \u22610 mod8\n   k \u22611 mod3\n   Let k=3m +1. 3m +1 \u22610 mod8 =>3m \u2261-1 mod8 =>3m\u22617 mod8 =>m\u22617*3^{-1} mod8. 3^{-1}=3 mod8, since 3*3=9\u22611 mod8. So, m\u22617*3=21\u22615 mod8.\n   So, m=8n +5. Thus, k=3*(8n +5)+1=24n +16. In 1-24, k=16. Valid.\n\n4. d=2, e=12:\n   Wait, but 2 and 12 are not coprime. So, this pair is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Coprime pairs are those where d and e are coprime. So, for 24=2^3*3, the coprime pairs are (1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (2,12) is invalid because gcd(2,12)=2\u22601. So, only three valid coprime pairs: (1,24), (3,8), (8,3).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4, but only three are valid. So, perhaps the number is less.\n\nSo, for b=25, (b -1)=24.\n\nCompute for each valid coprime pair:\n\n1. d=1, e=24: k=1, invalid.\n\n2. d=3, e=8: k=9, valid.\n\n3. d=8, e=3: k=16, valid.\n\nSo, two valid k's.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered (b -1)=24, I thought there were more. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some coprime pairs.\n\nWait, 24=2^3*3. The coprime pairs (d, e) where d*e=24 and gcd(d,e)=1 are:\n\n(1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1). So, four pairs, but two of them (d=1 and d=24) give k=1 and k=24.\n\nWait, for d=24, e=1:\n\nSolve k \u22610 mod24\nk \u22611 mod1 (always true)\nSo, k=24, which is valid since k<=24 and >=5.\n\nSo, that's another valid k.\n\nSimilarly, d=1 gives k=1, invalid.\n\nSo, for b=25, (b -1)=24, the valid k's are 9,16,24.\n\nSo, three valid k's.\n\nThus, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of coprime pairs (d,e) where d*e=(b-1), gcd(d,e)=1, and the corresponding k is >=ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nSo, for b=25, we have three valid k's.\n\nSo, to get more than ten valid k's, we need (b -1) to have enough coprime pairs such that the number of valid k's exceeds ten.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the smallest (b -1) with enough coprime pairs is when (b -1) has eight distinct prime factors, but that's impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (b -1) can be a factorial, which has a lot of small factors.\n\nWait, let's think differently. For each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], if (b -1) divides k(k -1), then it's a valid k.\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of such k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are <= (b -1)/2 and satisfy certain conditions.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here. Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, let's think of (b -1) as having many small factors. For example, if (b -1) is 12, which has factors 1,2,3,4,6,12. For each factor d, we can solve for k as before.\n\nBut earlier, for b=13, (b -1)=12, we had three valid k's.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWait, no. Because for each divisor d of (b -1), we get a solution k, but k is determined by the congruence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are <= b -1 and >= something.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], if k(k -1) is a multiple of (b -1), then it's a valid k.\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of integers in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).\n\nLet me denote m = b -1. So, m = b -1.\n\nWe need to find the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] such that m divides k(k -1).\n\nWhich is equivalent to k(k -1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] such that k \u22610 or 1 mod m.\n\nWait, no. Because m divides k(k -1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, m must be a product of two coprime numbers, d and e, such that d divides k and e divides k -1.\n\nSo, for each such pair (d,e), we get a unique k modulo m.\n\nBut this brings us back to the earlier approach.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should look for a different approach or think of the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a quadratic equation.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\nk^2 -k = a*(b -1)\n\nBut a must be an integer between 1 and b -1.\n\nSo, for each a in 1 to b -1, we can solve for k:\n\nk^2 -k - a*(b -1) =0\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nk = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4a*(b -1))]/2\n\nSince k must be a positive integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square, say d^2.\n\nSo, 1 +4a*(b -1) = d^2.\n\nSo, d^2 -4a*(b -1) =1.\n\nThis is a form of Pell's equation, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, for each a, we can compute d and check if it's an integer.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, since we're looking for the smallest b where the number of valid k's exceeds ten, perhaps I can iterate over possible b's starting from 2 upwards and count the number of valid k's for each b until I find one with more than ten.\n\nBut doing this manually is time-consuming, but perhaps manageable for small b's.\n\nLet me start with small b's and see how the count progresses.\n\nb=2:\n\nm=1. k must be in [2,1], which is invalid. So, 0 numbers.\n\nb=3:\n\nm=2. k must be in [2,2]. So, k=2.\n\nCheck if 2*(2-1)=2 divides 2. Yes. So, a=(4-2)/2=1. Valid.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let's try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.\n\nFrom the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nLet me break this down. First, a two-digit number in base b can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c can be from 0 to b-1.\n\nThe second condition says that a + c = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because a and c are integers, so their sum is an integer), n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and when expressed in base b, it's a two-digit number whose digits sum to its square root.\n\nLet me write this out mathematically. Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, so n = k^2. Then, the two-digit number in base b is k^2 = a * b + c, and a + c = k.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\nk^2 = a * b + c\nand\na + c = k\n\nFrom the second equation, c = k - a. Substitute this into the first equation:\nk^2 = a * b + (k - a)\n=> k^2 = a * b + k - a\nLet's rearrange terms:\nk^2 - k = a * (b - 1)\nSo, a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for a given base b, we can find all integers k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b-1), and when we compute a as (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), a must be in the range [1, b-1]. Then, c = k - a must also be a digit in base b, so 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, our approach can be as follows:\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, check how many k's satisfy the conditions.\n2. The first b where the number of such k's exceeds 10 is our answer.\n\nBut this might take a while if we do it manually. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the equation:\na = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\nWe can think of this as for each b, we can look for k's such that (k^2 - k) is a multiple of (b-1), and the corresponding a is between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be an integer, (b-1) must divide (k^2 -k). So, (b-1) divides k(k - 1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b-1) must divide the product k(k-1). So, the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between k and k-1.\n\nThis suggests that (b-1) can be factored into two coprime parts, say d and e, such that d divides k and e divides (k-1). But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the equation:\n\nk^2 -k = a*(b-1)\nSo, for a given b, the number of solutions k is the number of integers k where (k^2 -k) is a multiple of (b-1), and a is in [1, b-1], and c = k - a is in [0, b-1].\n\nAlternatively, since a = (k^2 -k)/(b-1), we can write this as:\n\nk^2 - k = a*(b-1)\n=> k^2 -k - a*(b-1) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in k:\nk^2 - k - a*(b-1) = 0\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is 1 + 4*a*(b-1). For k to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So, 1 + 4*a*(b-1) must be a perfect square, say m^2.\n\nSo, m^2 = 1 + 4*a*(b-1)\n=> 4*a*(b-1) = m^2 -1\n=> a*(b-1) = (m^2 -1)/4\n\nSince a must be an integer, (m^2 -1) must be divisible by 4. Let's check when that's true.\n\nm^2 mod 4 can be 0 or 1. So, m^2 -1 mod 4 is either -1 or 0. So, for m^2 -1 to be divisible by 4, m^2 must be 1 mod 4, which happens when m is odd. So, let me write m as 2t + 1, where t is an integer \u2265 0.\n\nThen, m = 2t + 1\nm^2 = (2t + 1)^2 = 4t^2 +4t +1\nSo, m^2 -1 =4t^2 +4t =4t(t +1)\nThus, a*(b-1)= [4t(t+1)]/4 = t(t +1)\nSo, a*(b-1) = t(t+1)\n\nSo, a = [t(t+1)]/(b-1)\n\nBut a must be an integer, so (b-1) must divide t(t+1). Since t and t+1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either t or t+1, or be a product of factors from both, but since they're coprime, (b-1) can be written as d*e, where d divides t and e divides t+1, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to consider that (b-1) divides t(t+1). So, for each b, the number of t's such that (b-1) divides t(t+1) is the number of possible k's, since each such t gives a solution for a, and hence for k.\n\nWait, but let's see. From above, we have:\n\na*(b-1) = t(t+1)\nSo, for each t, if (b-1) divides t(t+1), then a = t(t+1)/(b-1), and this a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nMoreover, once a is known, c = k - a. But wait, earlier we had a = (k^2 -k)/(b-1), but now from the discriminant approach, we have a = t(t+1)/(b-1). So, perhaps we can link t and k.\n\nWait, let's step back.\n\nWe started with the quadratic equation in k, which led us to m^2 = 1 +4a(b-1), which led us to m being odd, m=2t+1, and then a(b-1)=t(t+1).\n\nSo, from this, a = t(t+1)/(b-1)\n\nThen, from the earlier equation, a + c =k, and k^2 = a*b +c.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express k in terms of t.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, solving for k:\n\nk = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4a(b-1))]/2\n\nBut since k must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\nk = [1 + sqrt(1 +4a(b-1))]/2\n\nBut 1 +4a(b-1) = m^2, which is (2t+1)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nk = [1 + (2t +1)] / 2 = (2t + 2)/2 = t +1\n\nSo, k = t +1.\n\nAh, that's a key relation. So, k = t +1.\n\nSo, now, from a = t(t+1)/(b-1), and since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 t(t+1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1\n\nSo, for each b, the number of t's where t(t+1) is divisible by (b-1), and a = t(t+1)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.\n\nBut wait, also, since c = k - a, and c must be a digit in base b, so c must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, c = k - a = (t+1) - [t(t+1)/(b-1)].\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nc = (t+1) - [t(t+1)/(b-1)] = (t+1)[1 - t/(b-1)] = (t+1)[(b-1 - t)/(b-1)] = (t+1)(b-1 - t)/(b-1)\n\nBut c must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of t and b.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\n1. (b-1) divides t(t+1)\n2. 1 \u2264 a = t(t+1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1\n3. c = (t+1) - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1\n\nLet me consider that t must be such that t(t+1) is a multiple of (b-1), and a is within [1, b-1].\n\nSo, for a given b, the number of possible t's is the number of t's where (b-1) divides t(t+1), and a is in [1, b-1].\n\nBut since t and t+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b-1) must divide either t or t+1.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Since (b-1) divides t(t+1), and gcd(t, t+1)=1, then (b-1) must divide t or divide t+1.\n\nSo, either:\n\nCase 1: (b-1) divides t, so t = m*(b-1) for some integer m \u22651.\n\nCase 2: (b-1) divides t+1, so t+1 = m*(b-1), which implies t = m*(b-1) -1.\n\nBut wait, t must be non-negative, so in case 2, m must be at least 1.\n\nSo, for each b, t can be either m*(b-1) or m*(b-1) -1, for some integer m \u22651.\n\nBut then, we also have the condition that a = t(t+1)/(b-1) must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nLet me consider case 1 first: t = m*(b-1)\n\nThen,\n\na = [m*(b-1)] * [m*(b-1) +1] / (b-1)\n= m*(m*(b-1) +1)\n= m^2*(b-1) + m\n\nBut a must be \u2264 b-1, so:\n\nm^2*(b-1) + m \u2264 b-1\n=> m^2*(b-1) + m \u2264 b-1\n\nSince m \u22651, let's plug m=1:\n\n1^2*(b-1) +1 \u2264 b-1\n=> (b-1) +1 \u2264 b-1\n=> b \u2264 b-1\n\nWhich is impossible. So, m cannot be 1 in case 1.\n\nWhat about m=0? But m must be \u22651, so case 1 doesn't yield any solutions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nIf t = m*(b-1), then a = t(t+1)/(b-1) = m*(b-1)*(m*(b-1)+1)/(b-1) = m*(m*(b-1)+1) = m^2*(b-1) + m.\n\nWe require a \u2264 b-1, so m^2*(b-1) + m \u2264 b-1.\n\nBut for m \u22651, the left side is at least (1^2)*(b-1) +1 = b. Which is larger than b-1, so no solutions in case 1.\n\nSo, case 1 gives no valid t's.\n\nNow, let's consider case 2: t = m*(b-1) -1, where m \u22651.\n\nThen,\n\nt = m*(b-1) -1\n\nSo,\n\na = t(t+1)/(b-1)\n= [m*(b-1) -1] * [m*(b-1)] / (b-1)\n= [m*(b-1) -1] * m\n= m^2*(b-1) - m\n\nWe require a \u22651 and a \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 \u2264 m^2*(b-1) - m \u2264 b-1\n\nLet me analyze the lower bound first:\n\nm^2*(b-1) - m \u22651\n\nSince m \u22651, let's try m=1:\n\n1^2*(b-1) -1 = (b-1) -1 = b-2 \u22651\nWhich is true for b \u22653.\n\nFor m=1, let's check the upper bound:\n\nm^2*(b-1) - m = (b-1) -1 = b-2 \u2264 b-1\n\nWhich is true for all b \u22652.\n\nSo, for m=1, a = b-2, which is \u2264b-1 (since b \u22652). So, m=1 is acceptable for case 2.\n\nWhat about m=2?\n\na = 4*(b-1) -2 =4b -4 -2=4b -6\n\nWe require 4b -6 \u2264b-1\n=>4b -6 \u2264b-1\n=>3b \u22645\n=>b \u22645/3 \u22481.666...\n\nBut b must be \u22652, so no solution for m=2.\n\nSimilarly, m=3:\n\na=9*(b-1) -3 =9b -9 -3=9b -12\n\nWe require 9b -12 \u2264b-1\n=>8b \u226411\n=>b \u226411/8\u22481.375\n\nWhich is less than 2, so no solution.\n\nSo, only m=1 is possible in case 2.\n\nTherefore, for each b \u22652, the only t in case 2 is t = (1)*(b-1) -1 = b-2.\n\nSo, t = b-2.\n\nThen, a = t(t+1)/(b-1) = (b-2)(b-1)/(b-1) = b-2.\n\nSo, a = b-2.\n\nThen, k = t+1 = (b-2)+1 = b-1.\n\nSo, c = k - a = (b-1) - (b-2) =1.\n\nSo, for each base b, the only possible k is k = b-1, which gives a = b-2 and c=1.\n\nWait, but that would imply that for each b, there's exactly one b-eautiful number, which is n =k^2 = (b-1)^2.\n\nBut the problem says to find the least b where there are more than ten such numbers. So, if for each b, there's only one b-eautiful number, then the answer would be that no such b exists, which contradicts the problem statement. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed other cases where (b-1) divides t(t+1) without necessarily being a factor of t or t+1 individually.\n\nEarlier, I thought that since t and t+1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either t or t+1. But actually, that's only if (b-1) is square-free. If (b-1) has square factors, then it's possible that (b-1) divides t(t+1) without dividing either t or t+1 individually.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because even if (b-1) has square factors, since t and t+1 are coprime, any prime factor of (b-1) can divide either t or t+1, but not both. So, the square factors would have to be entirely in t or entirely in t+1.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong to think that (b-1) must divide t or t+1. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose (b-1) = d * e, where d and e are coprime, and d divides t, and e divides t+1.\n\nIn that case, t = d * m, and t+1 = e * n, for some integers m and n.\n\nBut since t+1 = e*n, and t = d*m, then:\n\nd*m +1 = e*n\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nd*m \u2261 -1 mod e\n\nWhich implies that d must be invertible modulo e.\n\nBut since d and e are coprime (as we factored (b-1) into d and e which are coprime), d has an inverse modulo e. So, m \u2261 (-1)*d^{-1} mod e.\n\nThus, m can be written as m = e*k + r, where r is the solution to d*r \u2261 -1 mod e.\n\nBut this might not lead us anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each divisor d of (b-1), we can set d to divide t, and (b-1)/d to divide t+1. Then, t \u2261 0 mod d, and t \u2261 -1 mod (b-1)/d.\n\nThis is a system of congruences, which can be solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), provided that d and (b-1)/d are coprime. But since (b-1) is factored into d and (b-1)/d, which are coprime, the solution exists.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find a t that satisfies:\n\nt \u22610 mod d\nt \u2261-1 mod (b-1)/d\n\nThis t would satisfy t(t+1) \u22610 mod (b-1), because d divides t and (b-1)/d divides t+1.\n\nThus, each such d gives a possible t, leading to a possible solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions t is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that the system of congruences has a solution, which it does because d and (b-1)/d are coprime.\n\nWait, but actually, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find a unique t modulo (b-1) that satisfies the two congruences. So, for each d, there's a unique solution t in the range [0, (b-1)-1], but we might have multiple t's that are valid for our purposes.\n\nBut perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of positive divisors of (b-1). Because for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find a t that satisfies the congruences, leading to a possible a and k.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for each b, there's only one solution, but that's not the case. So, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1), but let's check.\n\nWait, let's take an example. The problem statement mentions that 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see:\n\nb=13, so b-1=12.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of 12, we can find a t and hence a solution.\n\nLet me compute for each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod 1 \u2192 t can be any integer.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod 12 \u2192 t \u226111 mod 12.\n\nSo, t=11,23,35,...\n\nBut since we're looking for t such that a = t(t+1)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1=12.\n\nLet's compute for t=11:\n\na=11*12 /12=11, which is \u226412.\n\nSo, a=11, which is valid.\n\nThen, k = t+1=12.\n\nSo, n=k^2=144.\n\nWait, but in the example, 81 is 13-eautiful. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the t's can be lower.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute for each d.\n\nWait, for d=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod12 \u2192 t=12m -1.\n\nSo, t=11,23,35,...\n\nNow, a = t(t+1)/12.\n\nFor t=11: a=11*12/12=11.\n\nWhich is \u226412, so valid.\n\nSimilarly, t=23: a=23*24/12=46, which is >12, so invalid.\n\nSo, only t=11 is valid for d=1.\n\nSimilarly, d=2:\n\nt \u22610 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod6 (since 12/2=6).\n\nSo, t \u22615 mod6.\n\nSo, possible t=5,11,17,...\n\nCompute a for t=5:\n\na=5*6/12=30/12=2.5 \u2192 not integer. So, invalid.\n\nt=11: a=11*12/12=11 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=17: a=17*18/12=306/12=25.5 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, only t=11 is valid for d=2.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because for d=2, the solution t=5 would give a non-integer a, which is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's try a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find a t such that t \u22610 mod d and t \u2261-1 mod (b-1)/d.\n\nThen, using CRT, we can find t.\n\nLet me take b=13, so b-1=12.\n\nDivisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod12 \u2192 t=11,23,...\n\nAs before, a=11*12/12=11, which is valid.\n\nd=2:\n\nt \u22610 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod6.\n\nSo, t \u22615 mod6, and even.\n\nLooking for t that is even and \u22615 mod6. Wait, 5 mod6 is 5, which is odd. So, t must be even and \u22615 mod6. But 5 mod6 is odd, so no solution exists for d=2.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, perhaps for some d, there's no solution.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the congruences.\n\nWait, for d=2 and (b-1)/d=6, we have:\n\nt \u22610 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod6 \u2192 t \u22615 mod6.\n\nSo, t must satisfy both t \u22610 mod2 and t\u22615 mod6.\n\nBut 5 mod6 is 5, which is odd, and 0 mod2 is even. So, no solution exists for d=2.\n\nSimilarly, for d=3:\n\nt \u22610 mod3.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod4.\n\nSo, t \u22613 mod4.\n\nWe can solve for t \u22610 mod3 and t\u22613 mod4.\n\nLet me find t:\n\nt \u22610 mod3 \u2192 t=3k.\n\nt \u22613 mod4 \u2192 3k \u22613 mod4 \u2192 3k-3 \u22610 mod4 \u2192 3(k-1) \u22610 mod4.\n\nSince 3 and 4 are coprime, this implies k-1 \u22610 mod4 \u2192 k \u22611 mod4.\n\nSo, k=4m +1 \u2192 t=3*(4m +1)=12m +3.\n\nSo, t=3,15,27,...\n\nNow, compute a = t(t+1)/12.\n\nFor t=3: a=3*4/12=12/12=1 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=15: a=15*16/12=240/12=20 \u2192 which is >12, invalid.\n\nSo, only t=3 is valid for d=3.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4:\n\nt \u22610 mod4.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod3.\n\nSo, t \u22612 mod3.\n\nWe can write t=4k.\n\nWe need 4k \u22612 mod3 \u2192 4k mod3 = (1k) mod3 \u22612 mod3 \u2192 k \u22612 mod3.\n\nSo, k=3m +2 \u2192 t=4*(3m+2)=12m +8.\n\nSo, t=8,20,32,...\n\nCompute a for t=8:\n\na=8*9/12=72/12=6 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=20: a=20*21/12=420/12=35 \u2192 >12, invalid.\n\nSo, only t=8 is valid for d=4.\n\nNext, d=6:\n\nt \u22610 mod6.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod2 \u2192 t \u22611 mod2.\n\nBut t must be \u22610 mod6, which implies t is even, so t \u22610 mod2. But 0 mod2 \u22601 mod2, so no solution exists for d=6.\n\nFinally, d=12:\n\nt \u22610 mod12.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1.\n\nt \u22610 mod12, which is any multiple of 12.\n\nBut t must also \u2261-1 mod1, which is always true, since mod1 is always 0.\n\nSo, t=12m -1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, for d=12, we have:\n\nt \u22610 mod12.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1.\n\nBut mod1 is always 0, so t \u22610 mod12 and t \u22610 mod1, which is always true.\n\nSo, t can be 0,12,24,...\n\nCompute a for t=0:\n\na=0*1/12=0 \u2192 invalid, since a must be \u22651.\n\nt=12:\n\na=12*13/12=13 \u2192 which is >12, invalid.\n\nt=24: a=24*25/12=50 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, no valid solutions for d=12.\n\nSo, for b=13, the valid t's are t=3,8,11.\n\nWait, earlier for d=1, t=11 gave a=11, which is valid.\n\nFor d=3, t=3 gave a=1.\n\nFor d=4, t=8 gave a=6.\n\nWait, so that's three solutions. So, three b-eautiful numbers for b=13.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it was said that 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see what k is for each t.\n\nFor t=3: k=4, so n=16.\n\nBut 16 in base13 is 13 +3 \u2192 digits 1 and3, sum=4, which is sqrt(16)=4. So, yes.\n\nFor t=8: k=9, n=81. In base13, 81=6*13 +3 \u2192 digits 6 and3, sum=9, which is sqrt(81)=9.\n\nFor t=11: k=12, n=144. In base13, 144=11*13 +1 \u2192 digits 11 and1, sum=12, which is sqrt(144)=12.\n\nSo, three b-eautiful numbers for b=13.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought that each b would have only one solution, that was incorrect. It seems that the number of solutions depends on the number of divisors of (b-1) that satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSo, in the example of b=13, which has (b-1)=12, which has 6 divisors, but only 3 of them led to valid solutions.\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where the system of congruences t \u22610 mod d and t \u2261-1 mod (b-1)/d has a solution with a in [1, b-1].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as d*e, where d and e are coprime, and then solve the congruences.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern.\n\nWait, from the example with b=13, we had three solutions. Let's see what (b-1)=12's divisors contributed.\n\nWe saw that for d=1,3,4, we had valid solutions, but for d=2,6,12, no solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of valid solutions is equal to the number of odd divisors of (b-1).\n\nWait, in the case of 12, which is 2^2 *3^1, the number of odd divisors is (2^0)*(1+1)=2, but we had three solutions. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the number of divisors where d and (b-1)/d are coprime. Wait, but for d=3 and (b-1)/d=4, which are coprime. Similarly, d=4 and (b-1)/d=3, which are coprime. For d=1, (b-1)/d=12, which is not coprime with 1, but 1 is coprime with everything.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of valid solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two coprime numbers d and e, where d divides t and e divides t+1.\n\nIn the case of 12, the coprime pairs (d,e) are (1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1). But in our earlier analysis, some of these didn't yield solutions because of the congruence conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs where the resulting t is non-negative and a is within [1, b-1].\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a formula for the number of solutions based on the number of divisors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b-1). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For each divisor d of (b-1), we can attempt to find a solution t as per the congruences. The number of such valid t's where a is in [1, b-1] will give the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) for which the system of congruences t \u22610 mod d and t \u2261-1 mod (b-1)/d has a solution t such that a = t(t+1)/(b-1) is between 1 and b-1.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me take another example. Let's take b=5, so b-1=4.\n\nDivisors of 4:1,2,4.\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod4 \u2192 t=3,7,11,...\n\nCompute a for t=3:\n\na=3*4/4=3 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=7: a=7*8/4=14 \u2192 >4, invalid.\n\nSo, only t=3.\n\nd=2:\n\nt \u22610 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod2 \u2192 t \u22611 mod2.\n\nBut t must be even and \u22611 mod2, which is impossible. So, no solution.\n\nd=4:\n\nt \u22610 mod4.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1 \u2192 always true.\n\nSo, t=0,4,8,...\n\nCompute a for t=0: a=0*1/4=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nt=4: a=4*5/4=5 \u2192 >4, invalid.\n\nSo, no solutions for d=4.\n\nThus, only one solution for b=5: t=3, a=3, k=4, n=16.\n\nIndeed, 16 in base5 is 31, which sums to 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4. So, correct.\n\nAnother example: b=6, so b-1=5.\n\nDivisors of 5:1,5.\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod5 \u2192 t=4,9,14,...\n\na=4*5/5=4 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=9: a=9*10/5=18 \u2192 >5, invalid.\n\nSo, t=4.\n\nd=5:\n\nt \u22610 mod5.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1 \u2192 always true.\n\nt=0,5,10,...\n\na=0*1/5=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nt=5: a=5*6/5=6 \u2192 >5, invalid.\n\nSo, only one solution for b=6: t=4, a=4, k=5, n=25.\n\n25 in base6 is 41, sum=5, sqrt=5. Correct.\n\nNow, let's try b=7, b-1=6.\n\nDivisors of 6:1,2,3,6.\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod6 \u2192 t=5,11,17,...\n\na=5*6/6=5 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=11: a=11*12/6=22 \u2192 >6, invalid.\n\nSo, t=5.\n\nd=2:\n\nt \u22610 mod2.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod3 \u2192 t \u22612 mod3.\n\nSo, t=2 mod3 and even.\n\nFind t that is even and \u22612 mod3.\n\nt=2: even, 2 mod3=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nt=2: a=2*3/6=6/6=1 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=8: even, 8 mod3=2 \u2192 yes.\n\na=8*9/6=72/6=12 \u2192 >6, invalid.\n\nSo, t=2 is valid.\n\nd=3:\n\nt \u22610 mod3.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod2 \u2192 t \u22611 mod2.\n\nSo, t must be odd and \u22610 mod3.\n\nt=3: odd? 3 is odd.\n\na=3*4/6=12/6=2 \u2192 valid.\n\nt=9: odd, 9 mod2=1.\n\na=9*10/6=90/6=15 \u2192 >6, invalid.\n\nSo, t=3 is valid.\n\nd=6:\n\nt \u22610 mod6.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1 \u2192 always true.\n\nt=0,6,12,...\n\na=0*1/6=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nt=6: a=6*7/6=7 \u2192 >6, invalid.\n\nSo, solutions for d=1,2,3.\n\nThus, three solutions for b=7.\n\nSo, for b=7, the b-eautiful numbers are:\n\nt=5: a=5, k=6, n=36.\n\nIn base7: 36=5*7 +1 \u2192 digits 5 and1, sum=6.\n\nt=2: a=1, k=3, n=9.\n\nIn base7: 9=1*7 +2 \u2192 digits1 and2, sum=3.\n\nt=3: a=2, k=4, n=16.\n\nIn base7: 16=2*7 +2 \u2192 digits2 and2, sum=4.\n\nSo, three numbers:9,16,36.\n\nThus, for b=7, there are three b-eautiful numbers.\n\nSo, the number of b-eautiful numbers seems to be equal to the number of valid divisors d of (b-1) that allow a solution t with a in [1, b-1].\n\nSo, the problem is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to express (b-1) as d*e, where d and e are coprime, and the system of congruences t \u22610 mod d and t \u2261-1 mod e has a solution with a in [1, b-1].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where d \u2264 sqrt(b-1) or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to realize that for each divisor d of (b-1), there's a solution t if and only if d and (b-1)/d are coprime, which is always true because (b-1) is being factored into two coprime parts.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case. For example, if (b-1) is a square number, say 36=6^2, then d=6 and e=6 are not coprime.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors d and e, and for each such factorization, there's a solution t.\n\nIn that case, the number of solutions would be equal to 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). Because each prime factor can be assigned to d or e, leading to 2^{k} factorizations, but since d and e are ordered pairs, we divide by 2 to account for symmetry, leading to 2^{k-1} solutions.\n\nWait, but in the case of b=13, (b-1)=12=2^2*3^1, which has two distinct prime factors. So, k=2, and number of solutions would be 2^{2-1}=2, but earlier we saw three solutions. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two coprime factors, considering the multiplicity of each prime factor.\n\nWait, for 12=2^2*3^1, the number of coprime pairs (d,e) where d*e=12 is equal to the product over each prime's exponent plus one, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the number of coprime pairs (d,e) with d*e=N is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of N. Because for each prime, you assign it to d or e, but not both.\n\nSo, for N=12=2^2*3^1, which has two distinct primes, the number of coprime pairs is 2^2=4. But earlier, for b=13, we found three solutions, so perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs where d < e, to avoid duplicates.\n\nBut for N=12, the coprime pairs would be (1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1). But when considering d and e as ordered pairs, it's four, but when unordered, it's two.\n\nBut earlier, for b=13, we found three solutions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each such coprime pair (d,e) where d <= e gives a unique solution.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to find a formula for the number of solutions in terms of the number of divisors of (b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where d is <= sqrt(b-1).\n\nBut for b=13, (b-1)=12, sqrt(12)\u22483.464. So, divisors <=3 are 1,2,3. We had three solutions, which matches.\n\nFor b=7, (b-1)=6, sqrt(6)\u22482.449. Divisors <=2 are 1,2. But we had three solutions, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where d is odd.\n\nFor b=13, (b-1)=12, which has two odd divisors:1,3. But we had three solutions, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for each divisor d of (b-1), we can have a solution only if d is odd.\n\nBecause in the case of even d, the congruences may not have a solution, as seen in the earlier examples.\n\nWait, for example, in b=13, d=2 didn't yield a solution because t had to be even and \u22615 mod6, which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4, which is even, we had a solution. Wait, no, for d=4, t=8, which is even, and t=8 satisfies t \u22610 mod4 and t\u2261-1 mod3.\n\nSo, perhaps the parity isn't the determining factor.\n\nI think I'm stuck trying to find a general formula here. Maybe a better approach is to compute the number of solutions for each b by checking the number of valid t's, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut this would be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me start computing for b from 2 upwards, compute the number of b-eautiful numbers, and stop when I find a b with more than 10.\n\nLet's start:\n\nb=2:\n\nb-1=1.\n\nDivisors:1.\n\nd=1:\n\nt \u22610 mod1 \u2192 any t.\n\nt \u2261-1 mod1 \u2192 always true.\n\nSo, t can be 0,1,2,...\n\na = t(t+1)/1 = t(t+1).\n\nWe need a \u22641.\n\nSo, t(t+1) \u22641.\n\nt=0: a=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nt=1: a=2 \u2192 >1.\n\nSo, no solutions.
