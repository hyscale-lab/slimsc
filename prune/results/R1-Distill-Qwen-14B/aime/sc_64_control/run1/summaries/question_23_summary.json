      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v).\n\nSo, the four points can be represented as A(x, y), B(u, v), C(-x, -y), D(-u, -v). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, for point A, (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B, (u\u00b2)/20 - (v\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. The lengths of the diagonals can be found using the distance formula. The length of AC would be the distance between A and C, which is sqrt[(x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x)\u00b2 + (2y)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, the length of BD would be the distance between B and D, which is sqrt[(u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2u)\u00b2 + (2v)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for BD\u00b2. So, BD\u00b2 would be [2*sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, I need to find the maximum value of 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2), but actually, the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Hmm, that sounds like the supremum of BD\u00b2, but maybe it's the maximum BD\u00b2? Or perhaps it's a lower bound? Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's like the least upper bound, but not necessarily attainable. So, it's the supremum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi, but the question is phrased as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the minimal upper bound, meaning the smallest number that is larger than all possible BD\u00b2. But the way it's phrased is \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the supremum, but perhaps it's the maximum BD\u00b2? Or maybe the infimum? Hmm, I think I need to proceed with the math and see.\n\nSo, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on. Let's compute the distance between A and B. The distance squared between A(x, y) and B(u, v) is (x - u)\u00b2 + (y - v)\u00b2. Similarly, the distance squared between B(u, v) and C(-x, -y) is (u + x)\u00b2 + (v + y)\u00b2. Since all sides are equal, these distances must be equal.\n\nSo, (x - u)\u00b2 + (y - v)\u00b2 = (u + x)\u00b2 + (v + y)\u00b2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x\u00b2 - 2ux + u\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 - 2vy + v\u00b2)\nRight side: (u\u00b2 + 2ux + x\u00b2) + (v\u00b2 + 2vy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n[(u\u00b2 + 2ux + x\u00b2) + (v\u00b2 + 2vy + y\u00b2)] - [(x\u00b2 - 2ux + u\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 - 2vy + v\u00b2)] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2ux + 2vy) - (-2ux - 2vy) = 0\n2ux + 2vy + 2ux + 2vy = 0\n4ux + 4vy = 0\nDivide both sides by 4:\nux + vy = 0.\n\nSo, that's a condition that must be satisfied: ux + vy = 0.\n\nSo, this is one equation that relates u and v with x and y.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same length. Wait, but since we already equated AB and BC, maybe another condition comes from the slopes or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since diagonals intersect at the origin, and in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Hmm, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, that means the product of their slopes is -1. So, if AC is one diagonal and BD is the other, their slopes should be negative reciprocals.\n\nSo, let's compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. The slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So:\n\n(y/x) * (v/u) = -1\n\nWhich simplifies to (yv)/(xu) = -1 => yv = -xu.\n\nSo, another equation: yv = -xu.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. ux + vy = 0 (from equal side lengths)\n2. yv = -xu (from perpendicular diagonals)\n\nWait, equation 1 is ux + vy = 0, and equation 2 is yv = -xu, which can be rewritten as -xu + yv = 0, which is the same as equation 1. So, they are not independent. So, perhaps I need another condition.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the rhombus properties differently. Since the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular, the rhombus can be considered as formed by two perpendicular lines through the origin, each with points on the hyperbola.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the points A and B in terms of some parameters and then use the conditions to find BD\u00b2.\n\nLet me try parametrizing points A and B.\n\nSince points A and C are (-x, -y), and B and D are (-u, -v), perhaps it's easier to represent A and B in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nWait, the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So, standard parametrization for hyperbola is x = a sec\u03b8, y = b tan\u03b8, where a\u00b2=20 and b\u00b2=24.\n\nSo, let's parametrize point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. The slope of AC is (y_A)/(x_A) = (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)/(sqrt(20) sec\u03b8) = (sqrt(24)/sqrt(20)) sin\u03b8 = (sqrt(6)/sqrt(5)) sin\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD is (y_B)/(x_B) = (sqrt(24) tan\u03c6)/(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6) = (sqrt(24)/sqrt(20)) sin\u03c6 = (sqrt(6)/sqrt(5)) sin\u03c6.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:\n\n[(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5)) sin\u03b8] * [(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5)) sin\u03c6] = -1\n\nWhich simplifies to (6/5) sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -1\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nAlso, from the earlier condition, ux + vy = 0. Let's express u and v in terms of \u03c6, and x and y in terms of \u03b8.\n\nPoint A: x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nPoint B: u = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, v = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, ux + vy = 0 becomes:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03c6 * sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 + sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 * sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(20) sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + (24) tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by, say, 4:\n\n5 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 6 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nHmm, let's express sec and tan in terms of sin and cos.\n\nsec\u03c6 = 1/cos\u03c6, tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\n5 (1/cos\u03c6)(1/cos\u03b8) + 6 (sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6)(sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8) = 0\n\nMultiply through by cos\u03c6 cos\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo,\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nBut from the earlier condition, sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n5 + 6*(-5/6) = 5 -5 = 0, which checks out. So, that condition is consistent.\n\nSo, we have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, now, what's BD\u00b2? BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is twice the distance from B to the origin, since BD is a diagonal passing through the origin.\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal from B(u, v) to D(-u, -v), so the length is sqrt[(u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2u)\u00b2 + (2v)\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = [2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSince point B is on the hyperbola, u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1, so u\u00b2 = 20(1 + v\u00b2/24). Wait, no, u\u00b2 = 20(1 + (v\u00b2)/24). Wait, that can't be because u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1, so u\u00b2 =20 + (20/24) v\u00b2 =20 + (5/6) v\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, let's solve for u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 =20*(1 + (v\u00b2)/24). Hmm, no, that's not correct. Let me do it step by step:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by 20*24=480 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24 u\u00b2 -20 v\u00b2 =480.\n\nHmm, but I need to express u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 in terms of something.\n\nWait, since u and v are related via the parametrization, perhaps I can express u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6.\n\nPoint B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So,\n\nu = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 => u\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nv = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 => v\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6:\n\nsec\u00b2\u03c6 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2=20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)=4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6)=80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut I have a condition: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut from the parametrization, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, from earlier, we had:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I also have point A: x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, point B: u = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, v = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6 through the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me denote S = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, but how can I relate this to tan\u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express sin\u03b8 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nFrom S = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nsin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6).\n\nBut I also know that sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nFrom point A's parametrization, x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 => sec\u03b8 = x/sqrt(20). So, cos\u03b8 = sqrt(20)/x. Similarly, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - (20/x\u00b2)).\n\nWait, maybe that's not the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, from point A: y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 => tan\u03b8 = y/sqrt(24).\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, from point B: v = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 => tan\u03c6 = v/sqrt(24) => sin\u03c6 = v / sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03c6 = v / sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo, the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 becomes:\n\n(y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) * (v / sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.\n\nWait, from point A and B, we have:\n\nu\u00b2 =20 + (5/6)v\u00b2,\n\nand BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*(20 + (5/6)v\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=4*(20 + (11/6)v\u00b2)=80 + (44/3)v\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, earlier I had u\u00b2 =20 + (5/6)v\u00b2.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=20 + (5/6)v\u00b2 +v\u00b2=20 + (11/6)v\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 + (11/6)v\u00b2)=80 + (44/3)v\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 + (44/3)v\u00b2.\n\nSo, if I can express v\u00b2 in terms of something, maybe I can find a relationship.\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, u\u00b2/20 -v\u00b2/24=1 => u\u00b2=20 + (5/6)v\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I had.\n\nBut perhaps I can relate v\u00b2 to something else.\n\nWait, from the earlier condition, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut I also have expressions for sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 in terms of y and v.\n\nsin\u03b8 = y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03c6 = v / sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n(y / sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)) * (v / sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)) = -5/6.\n\nBut since x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, u\u00b2=20(1 +v\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x\u00b2=20 + (20/24)y\u00b2=20 + (5/6)y\u00b2,\n\nu\u00b2=20 + (5/6)v\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(20 + (5/6)y\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(20 + (11/6)y\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nsqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=sqrt(20 + (5/6)v\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=sqrt(20 + (11/6)v\u00b2).\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n\n(y * v) / [sqrt(20 + (11/6)y\u00b2) * sqrt(20 + (11/6)v\u00b2)] = -5/6.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\nSo,\n\n(y\u00b2 v\u00b2) / [(20 + (11/6)y\u00b2)(20 + (11/6)v\u00b2)] = (25)/(36).\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n36 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 =25 [20 + (11/6)y\u00b2][20 + (11/6)v\u00b2].\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n25 [ (20)^2 + 20*(11/6)v\u00b2 + 20*(11/6)y\u00b2 + (11/6)^2 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 ]\n\n=25 [400 + (220/6)v\u00b2 + (220/6)y\u00b2 + (121/36) y\u00b2 v\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n220/6 = 110/3,\n\n121/36 is as it is.\n\nSo,\n\n25 [400 + (110/3)v\u00b2 + (110/3)y\u00b2 + (121/36)y\u00b2 v\u00b2 ]\n\n=25*400 +25*(110/3)(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +25*(121/36)y\u00b2 v\u00b2\n\n=10000 + (2750/3)(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3025/36) y\u00b2 v\u00b2.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n36 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 =10000 + (2750/3)(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (3025/36) y\u00b2 v\u00b2.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36*36 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 =36*10000 +36*(2750/3)(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +3025 y\u00b2 v\u00b2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n36*36=1296,\n\n36*10000=360000,\n\n36*(2750/3)=12*2750=33000,\n\n3025 is as it is.\n\nSo,\n\n1296 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 =360000 +33000(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +3025 y\u00b2 v\u00b2.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n1296 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 -3025 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 -33000(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -360000=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1296 -3025)y\u00b2 v\u00b2 -33000(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -360000=0\n\nCompute 1296 -3025= -1729.\n\nSo,\n\n-1729 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 -33000(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -360000=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n1729 y\u00b2 v\u00b2 +33000(v\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +360000=0.\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think differently.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, and all points lying on the hyperbola, perhaps I can use the properties of hyperbola and rhombus to find BD\u00b2.\n\nI remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1, which we used earlier.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to consider that for a rhombus centered at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices can be represented as (a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d), such that the vectors (a, b) and (c, d) are perpendicular.\n\nWait, yes, since the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors OA and OB should be zero, where O is the origin.\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB = a*c + b*d =0.\n\nAlso, since OA and OB are points on the hyperbola, (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24=1 and similarly (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24=1.\n\nMoreover, since ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of OA and OB should satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, the sides of the rhombus are equal, so the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nWait, the distance from A(a, b) to B(c, d) is sqrt[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2], and the distance from B(c, d) to C(-a, -b) is sqrt[(c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2]. These must be equal.\n\nSo, setting them equal squared:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nExpanding:\n\na\u00b2 -2ac +c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 -2bd +d\u00b2 = a\u00b2 +2ac +c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +2bd +d\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left side from right side:\n\n(2ac +2bd) - (-2ac -2bd) =0\n\nWhich gives:\n\n4ac +4bd =0 => ac + bd =0.\n\nBut we already have ac + bd =0 from the perpendicularity condition, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, the key conditions are:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24=1,\n\n3. a*c + b*d =0,\n\n4. The diagonals are perpendicular, so (b/a)*(d/c)=-1, if a and c are non-zero.\n\nWait, the slope of AC is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a))= (2b)/(2a)=b/a.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD is (d - (-d))/(c - (-c))= (2d)/(2c)=d/c.\n\nTheir product is (b/a)*(d/c)= (b d)/(a c). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, this product should be -1.\n\nSo,\n\n(b d)/(a c) = -1 => b d = -a c.\n\nBut from condition 3, a c + b d =0, which is the same as b d = -a c. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the only conditions we really have are:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24=1,\n\n3. a c + b d =0,\n\n4. b d = -a c.\n\nBut condition 3 and 4 are the same, so only three independent conditions.\n\nBut maybe we can parametrize this.\n\nLet me think in terms of parametric equations.\n\nLet me consider points A(a, b) and B(c, d) on the hyperbola such that a c + b d=0.\n\nWe can parametrize A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), as before.\n\nThen, since a c + b d=0,\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * c + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * d=0.\n\nWe need to find point B(c, d) on the hyperbola such that this condition holds.\n\nBut point B is also on the hyperbola, so (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24=1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express c and d in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * c + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * d=0.\n\nLet me solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me express d in terms of c.\n\nsqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * d = -sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * c\n\n=> d = [ -sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 / sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 ] * c\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt(20)/sqrt(24)=sqrt(20/24)=sqrt(5/6).\n\nsec\u03b8 / tan\u03b8 = (1/cos\u03b8)/(sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)=1/sin\u03b8.\n\nSo,\n\nd= - sqrt(5/6) * (1/sin\u03b8) * c.\n\nSo,\n\nd= - (sqrt(5/6)/sin\u03b8) c.\n\nNow, substitute this into the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSubstitute d:\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - [ ( (sqrt(5/6)/sin\u03b8)^2 c\u00b2 ) ] /24 =1.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - [ (5/6)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 * c\u00b2 ] /24 =1.\n\nFactor out c\u00b2:\n\nc\u00b2 [1/20 - (5/6)/(24 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] =1.\n\nCompute the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - (5)/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 [ (1/20) - (5)/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ] =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nc\u00b2 [ (72 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 250 ) / (1440 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] =1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's messy. Let me compute the common denominator.\n\n1/20 = 7.2/something? Wait, perhaps compute:\n\n1/20 - 5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = [ (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) - 100 ] / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n1/20 = (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8),\n\n5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (100)/(2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSo,\n\n1/20 -5/(144 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = [144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 100]/(2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 [ (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100 ) / (2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ] =1.\n\nSo,\n\nc\u00b2 = [2880 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / (144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\n144 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -100 =4(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\n2880 = 4*720=4*8*90=...

So, t must be greater than 25/36.\n\nSo, s>0.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=20/9 + (1100/9)/s.\n\nNow, as s increases, the second term decreases.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is minimized when s is maximized, and BD\u00b2 is maximized when s is minimized.\n\nBut s=36t -25, and t can be as large as possible.\n\nWait, but t=sin\u00b2\u03b8, which is at most 1.\n\nSo, t can vary from 25/36 up to 1.\n\nThus, s=36t -25 varies from 0 up to 36*1 -25=11.\n\nSo, s \u2208 (0,11].\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of s is approaching 0, which would make BD\u00b2 approach infinity. But that can't be the case because as s approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, which isn't practical.\n\nWait, but that suggests that BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, which doesn't make sense because points A and B are on a hyperbola, which extends to infinity, but perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as large as possible.\n\nBut the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, we need the supremum of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi, but since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large (as points go to infinity on the hyperbola), the supremum is infinity. But the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Wait, that wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the infimum of BD\u00b2? Or maybe the minimal possible BD\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, the wording says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because it's the greatest lower bound. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than this number. So, it's the minimal BD\u00b2 across all rhombi.\n\nWait, but in the expression we have, BD\u00b2=20/9 + 1100/(9s), where s>0. So, as s approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. As s increases, BD\u00b2 decreases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when s is as large as possible. The maximum value of s is 11, when t=1.\n\nSo, substituting s=11,\n\nBD\u00b2=20/9 + (1100/9)/11=20/9 + 100/9=120/9=40/3\u224813.333.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 40/3, but can be larger. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 40/3, and it can go to infinity.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 40/3. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 40/3, so 40/3 is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but wait, when s approaches 11, BD\u00b2 approaches 40/3. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 40/3, but can be larger. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 40/3, because BD\u00b2 is always at least 40/3, so 40/3 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and it's the greatest such number.\n\nWait, but wait, when s=11, BD\u00b2=40/3. So, that's the minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if BD\u00b2 can be equal to 40/3, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be something less than 40/3.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 40/3, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would have to be less than or equal to 40/3. But the wording is a bit tricky.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 40/3, the number we're looking for must be less than 40/3, because if it were equal to or greater than 40/3, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=40/3, the number would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait. The number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 40/3, then any number less than 40/3 would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but the greatest such number would be 40/3 itself, because 40/3 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi except the one where BD\u00b2=40/3. Wait, but in that case, the number can't be equal to BD\u00b2 for any rhombus, because it's supposed to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nSo, the supremum of all such numbers would be 40/3, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 40/3, the number we're looking for must be less than 40/3. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 40/3.\n\nWait, but that's contradictory because 40/3 is attainable, so the number we're looking for must be less than 40/3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between infimum and supremum.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 40/3, because it's the greatest lower bound. So, 40/3 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, and it's the largest such number. So, 40/3 is the answer.\n\nWait, but when BD\u00b2=40/3, then 40/3 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the number we're looking for must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, so it must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the minimal BD\u00b2 is 40/3. So, the number must be less than 40/3.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 across all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 40/3, the supremum of such numbers is 40/3. Because for any number less than 40/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number. Wait, no, because BD\u00b2 can't be less than 40/3. So, the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than or equal to 40/3.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 40/3. Because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 40/3, so 40/3 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 40/3, because for any number larger than 40/3, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number, but 40/3 is the maximum lower bound.\n\nWait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I can find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, which is 40/3, then any number less than 40/3 would be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 40/3 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=40/3. So, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum, which is 40/3, but since BD\u00b2 can be equal to 40/3, the number must be less than 40/3. Therefore, the answer is 40/3.\n\nWait, but no, because 40/3 is attainable, so the number has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the one where BD\u00b2=40/3. So, the number must be less than 40/3, making 40/3 the supremum of such numbers.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about it differently.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be as small as 40/3 and can grow without bound, the set of all possible BD\u00b2 is [40/3, \u221e). So, the problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 40/3, because for every rhombus, BD\u00b2 >=40/3. So, 40/3 is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, making it the greatest such number.\n\nBut the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, if the number is 40/3, then for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=40/3, 40/3 is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the number has to be strictly less than 40/3 to satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including the minimal case.\n\nBut then, the supremum of all such numbers less than 40/3 is 40/3 itself, but since 40/3 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, the answer must be 40/3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, the number must be less than every possible BD\u00b2. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 40/3, the number must be less than or equal to 40/3. But since it has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, including those with BD\u00b2 approaching 40/3 from above, the greatest such number is 40/3.\n\nWait, no. Because if the number is 40/3, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=40/3, the number is equal, not less. So, the number must be less than 40/3. But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the greatest such number is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 40/3. So, the answer is 40/3.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWe found that BD\u00b2=40/3 when s=11, which occurs when t=1, meaning sin\u03b8=1 or -1, so \u03b8=\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nAt \u03b8=\u03c0/2, point A is (sqrt(20)*sec(\u03c0/2), sqrt(24) tan(\u03c0/2)), but sec(\u03c0/2) is undefined. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, wait, when sin\u03b8=1, \u03b8=\u03c0/2, but then cos\u03b8=0, so sec\u03b8 is undefined. So, that point A is at infinity on the hyperbola. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when points A and B are at infinity along the asymptotes.\n\nWait, but that suggests that BD\u00b2 approaches 40/3 as points A and B approach infinity along certain directions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because when sin\u03b8 approaches 1, t approaches 1, s approaches 11, and BD\u00b2 approaches 40/3. But in reality, when sin\u03b8=1, point A is at infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches 40/3 asymptotically.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 40/3, but never actually reaches it because that would require sin\u03b8=1, which is at infinity. So, 40/3 is the infimum, but not attainable. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 40/3, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 40/3.\n\nWait, but if BD\u00b2 approaches 40/3, then 40/3 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 40/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 40/3.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\), where the diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rhombus and Hyperbola**:\n   - The rhombus \\( ABCD \\) has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n   - Points \\( A, B, C, D \\) lie on the hyperbola, so their coordinates satisfy \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Parametrization of Points**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are parametrized as \\( A(a, b) \\) and \\( B(c, d) \\), with \\( C(-a, -b) \\) and \\( D(-c, -d) \\).\n   - Using hyperbola parametrization, \\( a = \\sqrt{20} \\sec\\theta \\), \\( b = \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\theta \\), and similarly for \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Conditions for Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\( ac + bd = 0 \\).\n   - The side lengths are equal, leading to the condition \\( (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2 \\), simplifying to \\( ac + bd = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - \\( BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) \\), where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are coordinates of point \\( B \\).\n   - Using the hyperbola equation and parametrization, \\( BD^2 \\) is expressed in terms of \\( \\sin\\theta \\).\n\n5. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**:\n   - After simplifying, \\( BD^2 = \\frac{40}{3} + \\frac{1100}{9s} \\), where \\( s = 36\\sin^2\\theta - 25 \\).\n   - As \\( s \\) approaches its maximum value of 11, \\( BD^2 \\) approaches \\( \\frac{40}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The minimal value of \\( BD^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{40}{3} \\), which is the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{3}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x\u00b2.\n\nPoints A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin.\n\nI remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, but wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Oh right, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, each vertex of the rhombus is located at a point such that if one vertex is (a, b), the opposite vertex is (-a, -b). Similarly, the other two vertices would be symmetric in the same way.\n\nSo, the four points A, B, C, D can be thought of as (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s). But since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between (p, q) and (r, s) should be equal to the distance between (r, s) and (-p, -q), etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to parametrize the points on the hyperbola.\n\nThe hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, any point on the hyperbola can be written in terms of hyperbolic functions, but maybe using parametric equations.\n\nAlternatively, since the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin, maybe we can represent the points as (a, b), (-a, -b), (c, d), (-c, -d). But since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal, so the distance between (a, b) and (c, d) must be equal to the distance between (c, d) and (-a, -b), etc.\n\nWait, but another approach is to consider that the diagonals of the rhombus are along the coordinate axes. Because the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, perhaps the diagonals are the x-axis and y-axis? But no, that would make the rhombus a square, which is a special case of a rhombus.\n\nWait, no, actually, the diagonals can be any lines through the origin, not necessarily the coordinate axes. So, the diagonals are two lines passing through the origin, which are perpendicular to each other because in a rhombus the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the rhombus is formed by points lying on the hyperbola such that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to represent the diagonals as vectors. Let me denote the diagonals as vectors. Let\u2019s say one diagonal is along vector (p, q), and the other is along vector (r, s). Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the four vertices would be (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s).\n\nBut wait, since it's a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the distance between (p, q) and (r, s) should be equal to the distance between (r, s) and (-p, -q). So, let's compute the distance between (p, q) and (r, s):\n\nDistance squared: (p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2.\n\nDistance squared between (r, s) and (-p, -q): (r + p)^2 + (s + q)^2.\n\nSince these are equal:\n\n(p - r)^2 + (q - s)^2 = (p + r)^2 + (q + s)^2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2.\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\n( p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2 ) - ( p\u00b2 - 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2qs + s\u00b2 ) = 4pr + 4qs = 0.\n\nSo, 4(pr + qs) = 0 => pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, the dot product of vectors (p, q) and (r, s) is zero. Therefore, the diagonals are perpendicular. Which makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, now, since the points (p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting (p, q) into the hyperbola equation: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, (r, s) must satisfy r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n2) r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nAnd from the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular, we have pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, that's the setup.\n\nNow, we need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the length of one of the diagonals. Wait, the problem says \"BD\u00b2\". So, BD is one of the diagonals.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, points A and C are (p, q) and (-p, -q), so AC has length 2\u221a(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Similarly, BD would be between points B and D, which are (r, s) and (-r, -s), so BD has length 2\u221a(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 is (2\u221a(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, we're looking for the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi satisfying the given conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, but we need the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's the minimum value of BD\u00b2, or the lower bound.\n\nWait, but since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily small, but wait, no, because the points lie on the hyperbola, which has a certain shape. So, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum value, which would be the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Or perhaps BD\u00b2 can be as small as possible, but there's a lower bound.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWe have the conditions:\n\np\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nand pr + qs = 0.\n\nWe need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2 = 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, perhaps we can express r and s in terms of p and q, using the conditions, and then minimize r\u00b2 + s\u00b2.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom pr + qs = 0, we can write pr = -qs.\n\nLet me think. Let's parameterize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote that (p, q) and (r, s) are vectors such that pr + qs = 0, which is their dot product is zero. So, they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, (r, s) is a vector perpendicular to (p, q). So, (r, s) could be a scalar multiple of (-q, p) or (q, -p), depending on the orientation.\n\nSo, perhaps we can write (r, s) = k*(-q, p), where k is some scalar.\n\nBut since (r, s) lies on the hyperbola, let's substitute that.\n\nSo, if (r, s) = ( -kq, kp ), then substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nSo,\n\n( (-kq)^2 ) /20 - ( (kp)^2 ) /24 = 1,\n\nWhich is:\n\n(k\u00b2 q\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 p\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 ) = 1.\n\nBut from the first equation, we have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, let me compute q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24.\n\nFrom p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- p\u00b2/20 + q\u00b2/24 = -1,\n\nWhich is q\u00b2/24 - p\u00b2/20 = -1,\n\nSo, q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 = (q\u00b2/24 + q\u00b2/20) - (p\u00b2/24 + p\u00b2/20) ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's compute q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24.\n\nFrom p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\np\u00b2/20 = 1 + q\u00b2/24,\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24) = 20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimilarly, q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 = q\u00b2/20 - (20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6)/24.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nq\u00b2/20 - [20/24 + (5 q\u00b2)/(6*24)] = q\u00b2/20 - [5/6 + (5 q\u00b2)/144].\n\nSo, this is q\u00b2/20 - 5/6 - (5 q\u00b2)/144.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nq\u00b2 (1/20 - 5/144 ) -5/6.\n\nCompute 1/20 -5/144:\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 360.\n\n1/20 = 18/360,\n\n5/144 = 25/360,\n\nSo, 18/360 -25/360 = -7/360.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 (-7/360 ) -5/6.\n\nThus, q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 = -7 q\u00b2 /360 -5/6.\n\nSo, going back to the expression for k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 ) = 1,\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 ( -7 q\u00b2 /360 -5/6 ) =1.\n\nWait, but this expression is negative, because both terms are negative.\n\nBut k\u00b2 is positive, so the left side is negative, but the right side is 1. So, we have a negative equals positive. That can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that our assumption that (r, s) = k*(-q, p) might be incorrect. Maybe we should take (r, s) = k*(q, -p). Let's try that.\n\nSo, if (r, s) = (k q, -k p), then substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\nr\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nSo,\n\n( (k q)^2 ) /20 - ( (-k p)^2 ) /24 =1,\n\nWhich is:\n\n(k\u00b2 q\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 p\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 ( q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 ) =1.\n\nAgain, we have from the first equation p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1, so q\u00b2/24 = p\u00b2/20 -1.\n\nSo, substituting into q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24,\n\n= q\u00b2/20 - ( p\u00b2/24 )\n\n= q\u00b2/20 - ( (20 (1 + q\u00b2/24 )) /24 )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom p\u00b2/20 = 1 + q\u00b2/24,\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2/24 = (20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 ) /24 = 20/24 + (5 q\u00b2)/(6*24) = 5/6 + (5 q\u00b2)/144.\n\nSo, q\u00b2/20 - p\u00b2/24 = q\u00b2/20 - 5/6 - (5 q\u00b2)/144.\n\nCompute this:\n\n= ( (72 q\u00b2) /144 ) - (5 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6,\n\n= (72 q\u00b2 -5 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6,\n\n= (67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6.\n\nSo, this is positive because 67 q\u00b2/144 is positive and 5/6 is subtracted.\n\nThus, k\u00b2 ( (67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6 ) =1.\n\nSo, k\u00b2 = 1 / ( (67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6 ).\n\nBut since k\u00b2 must be positive, the denominator must be positive:\n\n(67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6 > 0,\n\nMultiply both sides by 144:\n\n67 q\u00b2 -120 >0,\n\nSo, 67 q\u00b2 >120,\n\nq\u00b2 >120/67 \u22481.791.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 1.791.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 =1 / ( (67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6 ).\n\nBut we need to find BD\u00b2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSince (r, s) = (k q, -k p), so:\n\nr\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = (k q)^2 + (-k p)^2 =k\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 + p\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4 k\u00b2 ( q\u00b2 + p\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from the first hyperbola equation, p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nWe can write p\u00b2 =20(1 + q\u00b2/24 )=20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2=20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4 k\u00b2 (20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 ).\n\nBut we have k\u00b2 expressed in terms of q\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 =1 / ( (67 q\u00b2)/144 -5/6 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nk\u00b2 =1 / ( (67 q\u00b2 - 120 ) /144 )\n\n=144 / (67 q\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nSo, substituting into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2=4 * [144 / (67 q\u00b2 -120 ) ] * [20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6 ].\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nThat's (120 +11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4 * [144 / (67 q\u00b2 -120 ) ] * (120 +11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n4 * (144/6 )=4 *24=96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=96 * [ (120 +11 q\u00b2 ) / (67 q\u00b2 -120 ) ].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=96*(120 +11 q\u00b2)/(67 q\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2. So, we can consider this as a function of q\u00b2.\n\nLet me let t = q\u00b2, so t >120/67 \u22481.791.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=96*(120 +11 t)/(67 t -120 ).\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=96*(11 t +120)/(67 t -120 ).\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this expression for t>120/67.\n\nLet me denote f(t)= (11 t +120)/(67 t -120 ).\n\nWe can write f(t)= (11 t +120)/(67 t -120 ).\n\nTo find the minimum of f(t), we can take derivative and set it to zero.\n\nBut alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate the expression.\n\nLet me write f(t) as:\n\nf(t)= [11 t +120 ] / [67 t -120 ].\n\nWe can perform polynomial long division or see if it can be expressed as a constant plus something over denominator.\n\nLet me write:\n\nDivide 11 t +120 by 67 t -120.\n\n11 t +120 = A*(67 t -120 ) + B.\n\nSolve for A and B.\n\n11 t +120 =67 A t + (-120 A + B).\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n67 A=11 => A=11/67.\n\n-120 A + B=120.\n\nSo, B=120 +120 A=120 +120*(11/67 )=120*(1 +11/67 )=120*(78/67 )= (120*78)/67.\n\nCompute 120*78: 120*70=8400, 120*8=960, total 9360.\n\nSo, B=9360/67.\n\nThus,\n\nf(t)= A + B/(67 t -120 )= (11/67 ) + (9360/67 )/(67 t -120 ).\n\nSo, f(t)=11/67 + (9360)/(67*(67 t -120 )).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=96*f(t)=96*(11/67 + 9360/(67*(67 t -120 ))).\n\nBut perhaps this isn't the most useful form.\n\nAlternatively, to find the minimum of f(t), we can take derivative.\n\nLet me compute f'(t):\n\nf(t)= (11 t +120)/(67 t -120 ).\n\nf'(t)= [11*(67 t -120 ) - (11 t +120 )*67 ] / (67 t -120 )\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n11*(67 t -120 ) -67*(11 t +120 )\n\n= 737 t -1320 -737 t -8040\n\n= (737 t -737 t ) + (-1320 -8040 )\n\n= 0 -9360= -9360.\n\nSo, f'(t)= -9360 / (67 t -120 )\u00b2.\n\nSince t>120/67\u22481.791, denominator is positive, so f'(t)=negative.\n\nSo, f(t) is a decreasing function of t.\n\nTherefore, as t increases, f(t) decreases.\n\nThus, the minimum of f(t) occurs as t approaches infinity.\n\nBut as t\u2192\u221e,\n\nf(t)= (11 t +120 )/(67 t -120 )\u224811/67.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches 11/67 from above.\n\nSimilarly, as t approaches (120/67 )+,\n\nf(t)= (11*(120/67 ) +120 )/(67*(120/67 ) -120 )= ( (1320/67 ) +120 )/(120 -120 )= undefined, but denominator approaches zero.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nAt t=120/67,\n\nDenominator=67*(120/67 ) -120=120 -120=0,\n\nNumerator=11*(120/67 ) +120= (1320/67 ) +120= (1320 +8040 )/67=9360/67.\n\nSo, f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 120/67 from above.\n\nSo, f(t) is decreasing from infinity to 11/67 as t increases from 120/67 to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of f(t) is 11/67, approached as t\u2192infty.\n\nBut wait, since t can't actually reach infinity, the infimum of f(t) is 11/67.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 96*(11/67 )= (96*11)/67=1056/67\u224815.761.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 1056/67 from above, but not less than that, because as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67.\n\nBut wait, no, wait. Wait, BD\u00b2=96*f(t). As t increases, f(t) approaches 11/67, so BD\u00b2 approaches 96*(11/67 )=1056/67\u224815.761.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that as t increases, f(t) decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67. So, BD\u00b2 can get as close as we like to 1056/67, but can't be less than that. So, 1056/67 is the infimum.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, if t is increasing, f(t) is decreasing, so BD\u00b2 is decreasing towards 1056/67. So, BD\u00b2 can be made as close to 1056/67 as desired, but can't be less than that. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, BD\u00b2 can be as small as just above 1056/67, but not smaller. So, the infimum is 1056/67, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So, that number would be the infimum, which is 1056/67.\n\nWait, but 1056 divided by 67 is equal to:\n\nLet me compute 67*15=1005,\n\n67*16=1005+67=1072.\n\nSo, 1056 is between 67*15 and 67*16.\n\n1056-1005=51.\n\nSo, 1056/67=15 +51/67\u224815.761.\n\nSo, the answer is 1056/67, which is approximately 15.761. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as approaching 1056/67 from above, but can't be less, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, no. Because for each rhombus, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to 1056/67. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 1056/67, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 1056/67, so the number just below BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nWait, but 1056/67 is the infimum. So, the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound, which is 1056/67.\n\nWait, but let me check if 1056/67 is correct.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=96*(11/67 )=1056/67.\n\nSo, 1056 divided by 67: 67*15=1005, 1056-1005=51, so 15 and 51/67, which is approximately 15.761.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using parametric equations.\n\nLet me parameterize the hyperbola.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, we can use parametric equations with hyperbolic functions:\n\nx= sqrt(20 ) * cosh \u03b8,\n\ny= sqrt(24 ) * sinh \u03b8.\n\nSo, any point on the hyperbola can be written as (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ).\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is formed by two such points and their negatives.\n\nWait, suppose one diagonal is from (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ) to (-sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, -sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ), and the other diagonal is from (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ) to (-sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, -sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ).\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ) and (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ) must be perpendicular.\n\nSo, their dot product is zero:\n\n[ sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8 ] * [ sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6 ] + [ sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ] * [ sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ] =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 =0.\n\nSo,\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6=0.\n\nLet me factor this:\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6=0.\n\nSo,\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6:\n\n5= -6 (sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 )/(cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 )\n\n= -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\n5= -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6= -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nBut now, we can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me set tanh \u03c6= (-5)/(6 tanh \u03b8 ).\n\nBut tanh is bounded between -1 and 1, so (-5)/(6 tanh \u03b8 ) must also be within that range.\n\nBut this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express \u03c6 as some function of \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal between (sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ) and (-sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, -sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ), so its length is 2*sqrt(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 )=80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSimilarly, the other diagonal AC has length 2*sqrt(20 cosh\u00b2 \u03b8 +24 sinh\u00b2 \u03b8 ), so AC\u00b2=80 cosh\u00b2 \u03b8 +96 sinh\u00b2 \u03b8.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area of the rhombus is (AC * BD )/2.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't necessary.\n\nAlternatively, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nFrom the earlier equation, 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6=0.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6= -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n25 cosh\u00b2 \u03b8 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6=36 sinh\u00b2 \u03b8 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express cosh \u03c6 and sinh \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, from 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6= -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6,\n\nLet me divide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6,\n\n5= -6 ( sinh \u03b8 / cosh \u03b8 ) ( sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6 )\n\n= -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo, tanh \u03c6= (-5)/(6 tanh \u03b8 ).\n\nLet me denote t= tanh \u03b8.\n\nSo, tanh \u03c6= (-5)/(6 t ).\n\nBut tanh is limited between -1 and 1, so (-5)/(6 t ) must be within (-1,1 ).\n\nSo,\n\n-1 < (-5)/(6 t ) <1.\n\nMultiply through by 6 t, but we have to be careful with the sign.\n\nCase 1: t>0,\n\nThen,\n\n-6 t < -5 <6 t,\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-6 t < -5 => t >5/6,\n\nAnd -5 <6 t => t> -5/6, which is always true since t>0.\n\nSo, for t>0, we have t>5/6.\n\nCase 2: t<0,\n\nThen,\n\n-6 t > -5,\n\nWhich implies t>5/6. But t<0, so no solution.\n\nSo, only t>5/6 is acceptable.\n\nSo, tanh \u03b8 >5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 must be such that tanh \u03b8 >5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8> artanh(5/6 ).\n\nCompute artanh(5/6 ):\n\nartanh(x )=0.5 ln( (1+x)/(1-x) ).\n\nSo, artanh(5/6 )=0.5 ln( (1+5/6 )/(1-5/6 ))=0.5 ln( (11/6 )/(1/6 ))=0.5 ln(11 )=approx 0.5 *2.397=1.198.\n\nSo, \u03b8>1.198.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2=80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut we can express cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 and sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of t.\n\nFrom tanh \u03c6= (-5)/(6 t ).\n\nLet me denote s= tanh \u03c6= (-5)/(6 t ).\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6=1/(1 -s\u00b2 ), sinh\u00b2 \u03c6= s\u00b2/(1 -s\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(1/(1 -s\u00b2 )) +96*(s\u00b2/(1 -s\u00b2 ))= [80 +96 s\u00b2 ]/(1 -s\u00b2 ).\n\nBut s= (-5)/(6 t ), so s\u00b2=25/(36 t\u00b2 ).\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2= [80 +96*(25)/(36 t\u00b2 ) ] / (1 -25/(36 t\u00b2 )).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n80 + (96*25)/(36 t\u00b2 )=80 + (2400)/(36 t\u00b2 )=80 + (200)/(3 t\u00b2 ).\n\nDenominator:\n\n1 -25/(36 t\u00b2 )=(36 t\u00b2 -25 )/(36 t\u00b2 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2= [80 + (200)/(3 t\u00b2 ) ] / [ (36 t\u00b2 -25 )/(36 t\u00b2 ) ]\n\n= [80 + (200)/(3 t\u00b2 ) ] * (36 t\u00b2 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nMultiply numerator:\n\n= [80 *36 t\u00b2 + (200)/(3 t\u00b2 ) *36 t\u00b2 ] / (36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nSimplify:\n\n80*36 t\u00b2=2880 t\u00b2,\n\n(200/3 t\u00b2 )*36 t\u00b2=200*12=2400.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2= (2880 t\u00b2 +2400 ) / (36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n= 480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 ) / (36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nWait, 2880=480*6, 2400=480*5.\n\nSo, numerator=480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 ).\n\nDenominator=36 t\u00b2 -25= (6 t )\u00b2 -5\u00b2= (6 t -5 )(6 t +5 ).\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 ) / ( (6 t -5 )(6 t +5 ) ).\n\nBut 6 t\u00b2 +5= (6 t\u00b2 -25 ) +30.\n\nWait, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 ) / (36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nBut perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nExpress numerator as A*(denominator ) + B.\n\nLet me see:\n\n6 t\u00b2 +5 = A*(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) + B.\n\nBut 6 t\u00b2 +5 =36 A t\u00b2 + (-25 A + B ).\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n36 A=6 => A=6/36=1/6.\n\n-25 A + B=5 => -25*(1/6 ) + B=5 => B=5 +25/6= (30 +25 )/6=55/6.\n\nSo,\n\n6 t\u00b2 +5= (1/6 )(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) +55/6.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*( (1/6 )(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) +55/6 ) / (36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\n=480*( (36 t\u00b2 -25 )/(6 (36 t\u00b2 -25 )) + (55/6 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) )\n\n=480*(1/(6 ) + (55/6 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) )\n\n=480*(1/6 ) +480*(55/6 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\n=80 + (480*55)/(6*(36 t\u00b2 -25 )).\n\nSimplify:\n\n480/6=80,\n\nSo,\n\n=80 + (80*55 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\n=80 +4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nNow, let's see, t= tanh \u03b8 >5/6\u22480.8333.\n\nSo, t>5/6, so 36 t\u00b2 -25 >36*(25/36 ) -25=25 -25=0.\n\nSo, denominator is positive.\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2=80 +4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which occurs when 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) is minimized.\n\nSince 36 t\u00b2 -25 is in the denominator, to minimize the entire expression, we need to maximize 36 t\u00b2 -25.\n\nBut t can be as large as possible (since \u03b8 can go to infinity, making t approach 1 from below).\n\nAs t approaches 1, 36 t\u00b2 -25 approaches 36*1 -25=11.\n\nSo, 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ) approaches 4400/11=400.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 80 +400=480.\n\nBut wait, that's as t approaches 1, which would correspond to \u03b8 approaching infinity.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that as t increases, f(t) decreases, leading BD\u00b2 to approach 1056/67\u224815.761.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered points (p, q ) and (r, s ), and found that BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67 as t increases. But in the second approach, using hyperbolic parametrization, I get BD\u00b2 approaching 480 as t approaches 1.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check the parametrization approach again.\n\nWait, in the second approach, I used hyperbola parametrization with x= sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, y= sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8.\n\nThen, I considered two points ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ) and ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ), which are the endpoints of the diagonals.\n\nBut in reality, for a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the vectors from the origin to the vertices must be perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, [ sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8 ][ sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6 ] + [ sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ][ sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ]=0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6=0.\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 +6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6=0.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThen, I expressed this as 5= -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo, tanh \u03c6= -5/(6 tanh \u03b8 ).\n\nBut then I set t=tanh \u03b8, so tanh \u03c6= -5/(6 t ).\n\nBut then I tried to express BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 +96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nBut using hyperbola identities, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6=1/(1 -s\u00b2 ), sinh\u00b2 \u03c6=s\u00b2/(1 -s\u00b2 ), where s=tanh \u03c6= -5/(6 t ).\n\nSo, s\u00b2=25/(36 t\u00b2 ).\n\nThus, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6=1/(1 -25/(36 t\u00b2 ))=36 t\u00b2/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6=25/(36 t\u00b2 (1 -25/(36 t\u00b2 )) )=25/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=80*(36 t\u00b2/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )) +96*(25/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )).\n\n= [80*36 t\u00b2 +96*25 ]/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\n= [2880 t\u00b2 +2400 ]/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n= 480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 )\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(6 t\u00b2 +5 )/(36 t\u00b2 -25 ).\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, using (p, q ), we had BD\u00b2 approaching 1056/67\u224815.761, but here, as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWhich is conflicting.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the first approach, I considered (r, s ) being proportional to (q, -p ), but in reality, the other diagonal is not necessarily aligned with that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by assuming the relationship between (r, s ) and (p, q ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the hyperbolic parametrization, as \u03b8 increases, the point moves along the hyperbola, and the corresponding rhombus changes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider both approaches and see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I let (r, s )=k*(q, -p ), I derived that BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67\u224815.761 as t\u2192\u221e.\n\nBut in the hyperbolic parametrization, as t approaches 1 (i.e., \u03b8\u2192\u221e ), BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nThis suggests that my two approaches are inconsistent, which means I made a mistake in one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I incorrectly related (r, s ) to (p, q ).\n\nWait, in the first approach, I assumed that (r, s ) is proportional to (q, -p ), but perhaps it's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (r, s ) is proportional to (-q, p ), as I initially thought.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first approach.\n\nIn the first approach, I had:\n\npr + qs=0.\n\nSo, (p, q ) \u22c5 (r, s )=0.\n\nThus, vectors (p, q ) and (r, s ) are perpendicular.\n\nSo, in that case, (r, s ) can be expressed as a scalar multiple of (-q, p ), because that would make them perpendicular.\n\nSo, (r, s )=k*(-q, p ).\n\nBut then, when I substituted into the hyperbola equation, I got an expression for k\u00b2 in terms of q\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps in that approach, BD\u00b2 is expressed as 4*(r\u00b2 +s\u00b2 )=4*(k\u00b2 (q\u00b2 +p\u00b2 )).\n\nBut when I did the hyperbolic parametrization, I got a different expression.\n\nSo, perhaps the discrepancy arises because in the first approach, the parametrization is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 in the first approach is indeed 1056/67, but in the hyperbolic parametrization, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hyperbolic parametrization.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, in the hyperbolic parametrization, I considered two points on the hyperbola, ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ) and ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ), which are diagonally opposite, and the other two points being their negatives.\n\nBut in reality, for a rhombus, the four points should be such that each pair of adjacent points are connected by sides of equal length.\n\nWait, perhaps the hyperbolic parametrization approach is not correctly capturing the rhombus condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the minimal BD\u00b2 as 1056/67\u224815.761, as in the first approach, which seems more consistent.\n\nBut let me try to see.\n\nWait, in the first approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67 as t approaches infinity, which is about 15.761.\n\nIn the hyperbolic approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 1.\n\nWhich is which?\n\nWait, perhaps in the hyperbolic approach, t approaches 1 corresponds to \u03b8 approaching infinity, which would place the point ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03b8, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03b8 ) far away on the hyperbola.\n\nBut in that case, the other point ( sqrt(20 ) cosh \u03c6, sqrt(24 ) sinh \u03c6 ) would be close to the origin, since tanh \u03c6= -5/(6 t ) approaches 0 as t approaches 1.\n\nWait, but then BD\u00b2 would be dominated by the distant point, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nBut in the first approach, as t approaches infinity, the points (p, q ) and (r, s ) are becoming very large, but in a way that their product pr + qs=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1056/67, as in the first approach, because in that approach, as t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards that limit.\n\nBut in the hyperbolic approach, as t increases, BD\u00b2 increases towards 480.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the first approach, t is q\u00b2, while in the hyperbolic approach, t is tanh \u03b8.\n\nSo, perhaps the two approaches are considering different limits.\n\nWait, in the first approach, as t\u2192infty, q\u00b2 is very large, so the point (p, q ) is far along the hyperbola, and (r, s ) is determined accordingly.\n\nIn the hyperbolic approach, as t approaches 1 (i.e., \u03b8 approaches infinity ), the point is far along the hyperbola, but the other point is approaching the vertex.\n\nSo, perhaps in the first approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67, which is minimal, while in the hyperbolic approach, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, which is maximal.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the hyperbolic approach, as \u03b8 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, which would be the maximum possible BD\u00b2.\n\nWhile in the first approach, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 1056/67, which is the minimum possible BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1056/67, and the maximal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nSo, the answer is 1056/67, which is approximately 15.761.\n\nBut to confirm, let's compute 1056 divided by 67.\n\nCompute 67*15=1005,\n\n1056-1005=51,\n\nSo, 1056/67=15 +51/67=15.761194...\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the minimal BD\u00b2 as 1056/67, so the answer is 1056/67.\n\nBut let me see, is 1056/67 the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, in the first approach, we found that BD\u00b2=96*(11/67 )=1056/67\u224815.761.\n\nBut in the hyperbolic approach, as \u03b8 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, which is larger.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1056/67, which is approximately 15.761.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1056/67.\n\nBut let me check the calculation once more.\n\nFrom the first approach:\n\nBD\u00b2=96*(11/67 )= (96*11 )/67=1056/67.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 1056/67, which is approximately 15.761.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 1056/67.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1056}{67}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals are perpendicular, and the points \\(A, B, C, D\\) lie on the hyperbola.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin with transverse axis along the x-axis.\n   - The rhombus is symmetric about the origin, and its diagonals are perpendicular.\n\n2. **Parametrization of Points**:\n   - Points \\(A, B, C, D\\) can be represented as \\((p, q), (-p, -q), (r, s), (-r, -s)\\).\n   - The diagonals are perpendicular, so \\((p, q) \\cdot (r, s) = pr + qs = 0\\).\n\n3. **Hyperbola Equations**:\n   - Substituting \\((p, q)\\) and \\((r, s)\\) into the hyperbola equation gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{r^2}{20} - \\frac{s^2}{24} = 1.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2}\\), so \\(BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2)\\).\n   - Using the condition \\(pr + qs = 0\\), we express \\((r, s)\\) as a scalar multiple of \\((-q, p)\\) and substitute into the hyperbola equation.\n\n5. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - After algebraic manipulation and considering the constraints, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches the minimal value of \\(\\frac{1056}{67}\\) as the parameters grow large.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1056}{67}}\\).",
