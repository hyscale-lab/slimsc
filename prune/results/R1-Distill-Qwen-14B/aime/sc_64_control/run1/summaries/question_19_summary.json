      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked. \n\nWe have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm. Alright, let's break this down. I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is also related to the area and the semiperimeter. Maybe I can use some formulas involving these.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the circumradius R of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides, and A is the area. The inradius r is given by r = A/s, where s is the semiperimeter, (a+b+c)/2.\n\nBut in this problem, I have another condition: IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to figure out what that implies.\n\nWait, IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, IA \u22a5 OI.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. So, their positions relative to the triangle can vary depending on the triangle's type (acute, obtuse, etc.).\n\nI also recall that in some cases, there are relations between the distances OI, IA, and others, but I'm not too sure. Maybe I can use coordinates or vector methods, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities or properties related to triangle centers.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula that relates the length of IA and the distance OI. Let me think. I remember that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be related to other distances, but I'm not sure about IA specifically.\n\nWait, IA is not the inradius; the inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to a vertex. So IA is different.\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can express IA in terms of the sides of the triangle.\n\nI think there's a formula for the length of the angle bisector from the incenter to the vertex. Or perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify calculations.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is the line from I(0,0) to O. Let me denote O as (h, k). Then, the vector OI is (h, k), and IA is a vector from I(0,0) to A(x, y), which is (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero: h*x + k*y = 0.\n\nBut without knowing the coordinates of O and A, this might not be straightforward. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use some known relations in triangle geometry. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Oh, that's a useful formula. So OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Given R = 13 and r = 6, so OI^2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, that's useful. So the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(13). Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, we can perhaps use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle IAO.\n\nWait, triangle IAO: points I, A, O. IA is perpendicular to OI, so triangle IAO is a right triangle with right angle at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras, AO^2 = AI^2 + OI^2.\n\nBut AO is the distance from A to the circumradius O. Wait, in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter can be found using the formula: AO^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/ something. Wait, actually, the formula is AO^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/3 + something... Hmm, maybe I'm confusing it with another formula.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABC, the distance from A to O can be found using the formula AO = R, since O is the circumradius. Wait, no, AO is the distance from A to O, which is just R, because O is the circumcenter, so all vertices are at distance R from O. So AO = R = 13. Wait, is that correct?\n\nYes, because O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = R =13. So AO =13.\n\nSo in the right triangle IAO, AO = 13, OI = sqrt(13), so AI^2 = AO^2 - OI^2 = 13^2 - (sqrt(13))^2 = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, AI = sqrt(156). Let me simplify that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo AI = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. Now, how can I relate AI to the sides of the triangle?\n\nI remember that the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. Wait, but AI is not the angle bisector length; it's from the incenter to the vertex A, which is the same as the angle bisector length. So maybe there's a formula for AI.\n\nYes, I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is AI = (r)/(sin(A/2)), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Alternatively, another formula: AI = (2*R*sin(A/2)). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, I think AI can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter, sides, and angles. Let me try to recall.\n\nWait, I think the formula is AI = (r)/sin(A/2). So since we have AI = 2*sqrt(39) and r =6, we can write:\n\n2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) )= 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation. 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes.\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nFrom here, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1.\n\nSo cos^2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 = 10*13/169 = 10/13.\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13) = (sqrt(130))/13.\n\nWait, sqrt(10/13) is sqrt(130)/13, because sqrt(10/13) = sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) = (sqrt(10)*sqrt(13))/13 = sqrt(130)/13. Yes.\n\nNow, I think there's a formula that relates AI with the sides of the triangle. Let me recall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate the sides using the formula for the inradius. The inradius r = A/s, where A is the area, and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet, so maybe I can express AI in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, another approach: in triangle ABC, the length of AI can be given by AI = (2bc cos(A/2))/(b + c). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector from A to the inradius is given by AI = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. The formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is AI = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2).\n\nSo, in this case, AI = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). We already have AI = 2*sqrt(39), and cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo:\n\n2*sqrt(39) = (2bc/(b + c)) * (sqrt(130)/13)\n\nWe can simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, let's write down:\n\n2*sqrt(39) = (2bc/(b + c)) * (sqrt(130)/13)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(39) = (bc/(b + c)) * (sqrt(130)/13)\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\nsqrt(39)*(b + c) = (bc)*sqrt(130)/13\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n13*sqrt(39)*(b + c) = bc*sqrt(130)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, square both sides:\n\n[13^2 * 39] * (b + c)^2 = [bc]^2 * 130\n\nCalculate 13^2 = 169, so:\n\n169 * 39 * (b + c)^2 = 130 * (bc)^2\n\nLet me compute 169 * 39:\n\nWell, 170 * 39 = 6630, so 169 *39 = 6630 - 39 = 6591.\n\nSo left side is 6591*(b + c)^2, right side is 130*(bc)^2.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6591*(b + c)^2 = 130*(bc)^2\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n6591*(b + c)^2 = 130*b\u00b2c\u00b2\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the area of the triangle. Since we have the inradius and the circumradius, perhaps we can find the area in two different ways.\n\nWe know that r = 6 and R =13.\n\nThe area A is related to the inradius by A = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using the formula A = (a*b*c)/(4R).\n\nSo, A = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nBut we also have A = r*s = 6*s.\n\nSo, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nThus, a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312*s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate the sides using the Law of Sines. Since R =13, the sides are a = 2R*sin A, b = 2R*sin B, c = 2R*sin C.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. The Law of Sines says a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R = 26.\n\nSo, a = 26 sin A, b =26 sin B, c =26 sin C.\n\nWait, this might be helpful. Let's denote a =26 sin A, etc.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have AI expressed in terms of sides b and c. Let me see.\n\nWait, from earlier, we have AI = 2*sqrt(39), which we expressed in terms of b and c.\n\nBut perhaps we can relate sin A and cos(A/2) to find expressions for sides b and c.\n\nWait, from the earlier steps, we have AI = 2*sqrt(39) = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2).\n\nBut since a =26 sin A, and in a triangle, angles add up to \u03c0, so A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find another relation.\n\nWait, let's think about the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe also have the area A = r*s =6s.\n\nAnd the area can also be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not be directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since a =26 sin A, etc., we can write:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 =13 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, and the area A =6s =6*13*(sin A + sin B + sin C)=78*(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nBut also, A = (a*b*c)/52 = (26 sin A *26 sin B *26 sin C)/52 = (26^3 sin A sin B sin C)/52.\n\nWait, 26^3 is 17,576. Divided by 52 is 17,576 /52. Let me compute that.\n\n17,576 \u00f7 52: 52*300=15,600; 17,576-15,600=1,976.\n\n52*38=1,976 (since 50*38=1900, 2*38=76; 1900+76=1976).\n\nSo 300 +38=338. So 26^3/52 =338.\n\nTherefore, A =338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nBut earlier, we had A=78(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nSo, 78(sin A + sin B + sin C) =338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can relate it to other equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the right triangle IAO.\n\nWe have AO =13, OI = sqrt(13), AI=2*sqrt(39). So, in triangle IAO, right-angled at I, we can relate the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps using trigonometric ratios in triangle IAO. Let me think.\n\nIn triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, where theta is angle at O.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = AI/OI = (2*sqrt(39))/sqrt(13) = 2*sqrt(3) = 2*1.732\u22483.464.\n\nWait, sqrt(39) is sqrt(13*3)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(3). So, AI/OI = [2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)] / sqrt(13) )= 2*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, tan(theta)=2*sqrt(3). Therefore, theta = arctan(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nWhat's arctan(2*sqrt(3))? Let me think. tan(60\u00b0)=sqrt(3), tan(30\u00b0)=1/sqrt(3). So, 2*sqrt(3) is about 3.464, which is tan(73.897\u00b0). Hmm, not a standard angle.\n\nBut maybe in terms of sine and cosine, we can find sin(theta) and cos(theta). Since tan(theta)=2*sqrt(3)= opposite/adjacent, so we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side 2*sqrt(3), adjacent side 1. Then, hypotenuse is sqrt( (2*sqrt(3))^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(12 +1)=sqrt(13).\n\nSo, sin(theta)= opposite/hypotenuse= 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13)= 2*sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, sqrt(3)/sqrt(13)=sqrt(39)/13. Because sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(3*13)/13= sqrt(39)/13. So 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13)=2*sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos(theta)= adjacent/hypotenuse=1/sqrt(13)=sqrt(13)/13.\n\nSo, in triangle IAO, angle at O is theta, whose sin is 2*sqrt(39)/13 and cos is sqrt(13)/13.\n\nBut how does this relate to angle A in triangle ABC? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the angle between OI and AO, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate this to the Euler line or other triangle centers, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps using vector methods. Let me consider vectors.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWe have AI =2*sqrt(39), and AI is expressed as (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). So, from earlier, we have:\n\nAI = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2) =2*sqrt(39)\n\nWe found cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo:\n\n(2bc/(b + c)) * (sqrt(130)/13) )= 2*sqrt(39)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(bc/(b + c)) * (sqrt(130)/13) )= sqrt(39)\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\nbc * sqrt(130)/13 = sqrt(39)*(b + c)\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nbc*sqrt(130) =13*sqrt(39)*(b + c)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nb\u00b2c\u00b2 *130 = 169*39*(b + c)^2\n\nCompute 169*39: 169*40=6760, minus 169=6760-169=6591.\n\nSo, 130b\u00b2c\u00b2=6591*(b + c)^2\n\nDivide both sides by 130:\n\nb\u00b2c\u00b2= (6591/130)*(b + c)^2\n\nCalculate 6591/130: 130*50=6500, 6591-6500=91. So 6591=130*50 +91.\n\nSo 6591/130=50 +91/130=50 + 13/10=Wait, 91/130= (13*7)/(13*10)=7/10=0.7.\n\nWait, 91 \u00f713=7, 130 \u00f713=10. So 91/130=7/10=0.7.\n\nSo, 6591/130=50.7.\n\nSo, b\u00b2c\u00b2=50.7*(b + c)^2.\n\nBut 50.7 is 507/10.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write it as a fraction: 6591/130= (6591 \u00f713)/(130 \u00f713)=507/10.\n\nSo, 507/10=50.7.\n\nSo, we have b\u00b2c\u00b2=(507/10)*(b + c)^2.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n10b\u00b2c\u00b2=507*(b + c)^2.\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation, but perhaps we can find a substitution.\n\nLet me denote x = b + c and y = bc. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n10y\u00b2 =507x\u00b2.\n\nBut we also know from the Law of Cosines that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut since a =26 sin A, and we have expressions for sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe we can find cos A.\n\nWe have sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, so cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, cos A =1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) =1 - 2*(39/169)=1 - 78/169= (169-78)/169=91/169=13/23? Wait, 91/169. Let me compute: 91=13*7, 169=13\u00b2. So 91/169=7/13.\n\nWait, cos A=1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2)=1 - 2*(39/169)=1 - 78/169= (169-78)/169=91/169=7/13.\n\nYes, so cos A=7/13.\n\nSo, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nBut a =26 sin A, so a\u00b2= (26)^2 sin\u00b2 A=676 sin\u00b2 A.\n\nSo,\n\n676 sin\u00b2 A= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, but I don't know sin A yet. Wait, from earlier, we have sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13. So, sin A=2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(39*130)/169.\n\nCompute sqrt(39*130)=sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070=10*507=10*3*169=10*3*13\u00b2. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2)=13*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sin A=2*(13*sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169= (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, sin\u00b2 A= (4*30)/169=120/169.\n\nSo, a\u00b2=676*(120/169)= (676/169)*120=4*120=480.\n\nSo, a\u00b2=480.\n\nThus, a= sqrt(480)=sqrt(16*30)=4*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a=4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, side a is opposite angle A, which is BC. So, BC=4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, going back to the Law of Cosines equation:\n\na\u00b2= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nWe have a\u00b2=480, so:\n\n480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nBut we also have another equation from earlier:\n\n10b\u00b2c\u00b2=507*(b + c)^2.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc =480.\n\n2) 10b\u00b2c\u00b2=507*(b + c)^2.\n\nLet me denote x = b + c and y= bc.\n\nThen, from equation 2:\n\n10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2.\n\nAnd from equation 1:\n\n(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2= (b + c)^2 - 2 bc= x\u00b2 - 2y.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 - 2y=480 + (14/13)y.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2=480 + (14/13)y +2y=480 + (14/13 +26/13)y=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nBut from equation 2, 10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting x\u00b2 from above:\n\n10y\u00b2=507*(480 + (40/13)y )\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 507*(480)=507*480.\n\nCompute 500*480=240,000.\n\n7*480=3,360.\n\nSo, total is 240,000 +3,360=243,360.\n\nNext, 507*(40/13)y= (507/13)*40 y=39*40 y=1,560 y.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n10y\u00b2=243,360 +1,560 y.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n10y\u00b2 -1,560 y -243,360=0.\n\nDivide all terms by 10:\n\ny\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nNow, we have a quadratic in y:\n\ny\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nLet me solve for y using quadratic formula.\n\ny = [156 \u00b1 sqrt(156\u00b2 +4*24,336)]/2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n156\u00b2=24,336.\n\n4*24,336=97,344.\n\nSo, sqrt(24,336 +97,344)=sqrt(121,680).\n\nCompute sqrt(121,680). Let me factor it:\n\n121,680= 16*7,605=16*5*1,521=16*5*39\u00b2.\n\nSo sqrt(121,680)=4*sqrt(5*39\u00b2)=4*39*sqrt(5)=156 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, sqrt(121,680)=156 sqrt(5).\n\nTherefore,\n\ny= [156 \u00b1156 sqrt(5)]/2=78*(1 \u00b1 sqrt(5)).\n\nSince y= bc must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\ny=78*(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, bc=78*(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when I computed 156^2, that's 24,336. Then, 4*24,336=97,344. Adding 24,336 +97,344 gives 121,680. So sqrt(121,680)=sqrt(16*7,605)=4*sqrt(7,605). Hmm, but I think I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, 7,605 can be broken down further.\n\n7,605 \u00f75=1,521. So 7,605=5*1,521=5*(39)^2. Because 39^2=1,521.\n\nSo sqrt(7,605)=sqrt(5*(39)^2)=39*sqrt(5).\n\nTherefore, sqrt(121,680)=4*39*sqrt(5)=156 sqrt(5).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, y= [156 +156 sqrt(5)]/2=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, bc=78*(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut the question asks for AB\u00b7AC. AB is c, and AC is b, so AB\u00b7AC= bc=78*(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because 78*(1 + sqrt(5)) seems a bit large, but let's see.\n\nWait, in equation 10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2, and x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nWe substituted and got y=78*(1 + sqrt(5)). Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if the quadratic solution is correct.\n\nEquation after substitution: y\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nSolutions: y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(156\u00b2 +4*24,336))/2.\n\nWhich is y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(24,336 +97,344))/2= y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(121,680))/2.\n\nsqrt(121,680)= sqrt(16*7,605)=4*sqrt(7,605)=4*sqrt(5*39\u00b2)=4*39*sqrt(5)=156 sqrt(5). So yes, correct.\n\nSo, y=(156 +156 sqrt(5))/2=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nTherefore, bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc. So, the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because 78 is 6*13, and 1 + sqrt(5) is about 3.236. So 78*3.236\u2248252. So, the product bc\u2248252. But given that the circumradius is 13, sides can't be too large, but 4 sqrt(30)\u224821.908, so sides b and c might be in the same ballpark. So, bc\u2248252 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in earlier steps. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nWait, from equation 10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2.\n\nAnd x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nSo,\n\n10y\u00b2=507*(480 + (40/13)y )\n\n=507*480 +507*(40/13)y\n\n=243,360 + (507/13)*40 y\n\n507 \u00f713=39, because 13*39=507.\n\nSo, 39*40=1,560.\n\nSo,\n\n10y\u00b2=243,360 +1,560 y.\n\nThen, moving all to left:\n\n10y\u00b2 -1,560 y -243,360=0.\n\nDivide by 10: y\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 156\u00b2 +4*24,336=24,336 +97,344=121,680.\n\nsqrt(121,680)=156 sqrt(5). So, y=(156 +156 sqrt(5))/2=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but the problem states to find AB\u00b7AC, which is bc. So, the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut the problem is presented in integers and sqrt terms, but 78(1 + sqrt(5)) is a simplified form. Alternatively, maybe it can be expressed differently.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier in deriving AI.\n\nWait, let me double-check the AI calculation.\n\nWe had AI =2*sqrt(39).\n\nWhich comes from triangle IAO, right-angled at I, with AO=13, OI= sqrt(13).\n\nSo, AI\u00b2=13\u00b2 - (sqrt(13))\u00b2=169 -13=156. So AI= sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). That seems correct.\n\nThen, AI is given by (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2).\n\nWe found cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n2*sqrt(39)= (2bc/(b + c))*(sqrt(130)/13).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(39)= (bc/(b + c))*(sqrt(130)/13).\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\nsqrt(39)*(b + c)= bc*sqrt(130)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n13 sqrt(39) (b + c)= bc sqrt(130).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n169 *39*(b + c)^2= b\u00b2c\u00b2 *130.\n\nWhich gives 6591*(b + c)^2=130 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nWhich is where we were before.\n\nSo, yes, the steps are correct.\n\nSo, the answer is bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but 78(1 + sqrt(5)) is approximately 78*2.236\u2248174.648, but earlier, I thought bc\u2248252. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, no, 78*(1 + sqrt(5))=78*(approximately 2.236)=78*2.236\u2248174.648. Hmm, but in the quadratic solution, we have bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)), which is about 174.648. But earlier, I thought bc\u2248252. Wait, perhaps I was mistaken.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that bc=78*(1 + sqrt(5))\u2248174.648, but then I thought 252, which was a mistake. So, the correct value is 78*(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the quadratic solution.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was y\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nSo, y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(156\u00b2 +4*24,336))/2.\n\nWhich is y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(24,336 +97,344))/2= y=(156 \u00b1 sqrt(121,680))/2.\n\nsqrt(121,680)=sqrt(16*7,605)=4*sqrt(7,605)=4*sqrt(5*39\u00b2)=4*39*sqrt(5)=156 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, y=(156 +156 sqrt(5))/2=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but the problem says to put the answer as an integer in a box. But 78(1 + sqrt(5)) isn't an integer. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the quadratic solution. Let me check again.\n\nWait, equation after substitution was 10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2, and x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nSo,\n\n10y\u00b2=507*(480 + (40/13)y )\n\n=507*480 +507*(40/13)y.\n\nCompute 507*(40/13)= (507/13)*40=39*40=1,560.\n\nSo,\n\n10y\u00b2=243,360 +1,560 y.\n\nBring all to left:\n\n10y\u00b2 -1,560 y -243,360=0.\n\nDivide by 10:\n\ny\u00b2 -156 y -24,336=0.\n\nSo, discriminant D=156\u00b2 +4*24,336=24,336 +97,344=121,680.\n\nsqrt(D)=sqrt(121,680)=sqrt(16*7,605)=4*sqrt(7,605).\n\nWait, 7,605=5*1,521=5*39\u00b2.\n\nSo sqrt(7,605)=39*sqrt(5).\n\nThus, sqrt(D)=4*39*sqrt(5)=156 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, y=(156 +156 sqrt(5))/2=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut that's not an integer. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the initial equations.\n\nWait, let me check the earlier steps.\n\nFrom triangle IAO, AI=2*sqrt(39).\n\nThen, AI=(2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2).\n\nWe found cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n2*sqrt(39)= (2bc/(b + c))*(sqrt(130)/13).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(39)= (bc/(b + c))*(sqrt(130)/13).\n\nMultiply both sides by (b + c):\n\nsqrt(39)*(b + c)= bc*sqrt(130)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\n13*sqrt(39)*(b + c)= bc*sqrt(130).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n169*39*(b + c)^2= b\u00b2c\u00b2*130.\n\nWhich is 6591*(b + c)^2=130 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, denoting x =b + c and y= bc, equation becomes:\n\n10y\u00b2=507x\u00b2.\n\nAnd from equation 1, x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y.\n\nSo,\n\n10y\u00b2=507*(480 + (40/13)y )\n\nWhich is 10y\u00b2=243,360 +1,560 y.\n\nThus, leading to y=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects an integer answer, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming something earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating AI.\n\nWait, AI is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. The formula I used was AI=(2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). Let me confirm that formula.\n\nYes, according to standard formulas, the length of the angle bisector from the inradius to the vertex A is given by AI = (2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express AI in terms of the sides and area.\n\nWait, another formula for AI is AI = r / sin(A/2). Since r=6, AI=6/sin(A/2). We found AI=2*sqrt(39), so 6/sin(A/2)=2*sqrt(39). So sin(A/2)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13. Which is what we had earlier.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find bc using the formula bc= (2A)/(sin A). Wait, because area A=(1/2)ab sin C, but that might not be directly helpful.\n\nWait, but from area A= r*s=6s, and A=(a*b*c)/(4R)= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6s= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nBut a=4 sqrt(30), so:\n\n6s= (4 sqrt(30)*b*c)/52= (4 sqrt(30) bc)/52= (sqrt(30) bc)/13.\n\nSo,\n\n6s= (sqrt(30) bc)/13.\n\nThus,\n\ns= (sqrt(30) bc)/(13*6)= (sqrt(30) bc)/78.\n\nBut s=(a + b + c)/2= (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.\n\nSo,\n\n(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2= (sqrt(30) bc)/78.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n4 sqrt(30) + b + c= (2 sqrt(30) bc)/78= (sqrt(30) bc)/39.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, since we have bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)), perhaps we can compute s.\n\ns= (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2= (4 sqrt(30) + x)/2, where x= b + c.\n\nFrom earlier, x\u00b2=480 + (40/13)y=480 + (40/13)*78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nCompute (40/13)*78= (40*78)/13=40*6=240.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=480 +240(1 + sqrt(5))=480 +240 +240 sqrt(5)=720 +240 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(720 +240 sqrt(5)).\n\nHmm, maybe this can be simplified.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(720 +240 sqrt(5))=sqrt(240*(3 + sqrt(5)))=sqrt(240)*sqrt(3 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut sqrt(240)=sqrt(16*15)=4 sqrt(15).\n\nSo, x=4 sqrt(15) * sqrt(3 + sqrt(5)).\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to accept that bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, but the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc. So, unless there's a miscalculation, this seems to be the answer.\n\nBut since the problem is given with integer radii and such, perhaps the answer is an integer, so maybe I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the product bc can be expressed in terms of the area and other known quantities.\n\nWe have area A=6s= (a*b*c)/52.\n\nWe also have A= (1/2)ab sin C, but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Heron's formula.\n\nBut without knowing the semiperimeter, it's tricky.\n\nWait, but we have a=4 sqrt(30), and bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, let me compute the semiperimeter s= (a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe have a=4 sqrt(30), b + c=x= sqrt(720 +240 sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, s= [4 sqrt(30) + sqrt(720 +240 sqrt(5))]/2.\n\nBut without knowing sqrt(720 +240 sqrt(5)) in a simpler form, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another relation involving bc.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, we have a=26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, bc= (26)^2 sin B sin C=676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut we also have angle A, so maybe we can find relations between angles.\n\nBut without more information, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is meant to be 78(1 + sqrt(5)), which is approximately 174.648. But the problem might expect an exact form.\n\nWait, but the problem says to put the final answer as an integer in a box. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated when I squared both sides.\n\nWait, let's go back to:\n\n13*sqrt(39)*(b + c)= bc*sqrt(130).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(13\u00b2)*(39)*(b + c)^2= b\u00b2c\u00b2*(130).\n\nWhich is 169*39*(b + c)^2=130 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nWhich is 6591*(b + c)^2=130 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nSo, 6591*(b + c)^2=130 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\n507*(b + c)^2=10 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nSo, 507*(b + c)^2=10 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should have divided earlier.\n\nWait, 6591 \u00f713=507, because 13*507=6591.\n\nSo, 507*(b + c)^2=10 b\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nSo, 507 x\u00b2=10 y\u00b2.\n\nWhich gives y\u00b2= (507/10)x\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified.\n\nBut I think I followed the correct steps earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check the initial assumption.\n\nWait, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, AO=13, OI= sqrt(13), AI=2 sqrt(39).\n\nSo, from Pythagoras, AO\u00b2=AI\u00b2 + OI\u00b2.\n\n13\u00b2= (2 sqrt(39))\u00b2 + (sqrt(13))\u00b2.\n\n169=4*39 +13=156 +13=169. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the calculations up to AI=2 sqrt(39) are correct.\n\nSo, the error must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps in the formula for AI.\n\nWait, I used AI=(2bc/(b + c)) * cos(A/2). Let me confirm this formula.\n\nYes, according to standard triangle formulas, the length of the internal angle bisector from A to the inradius is given by AI=(2bc/(b + c)) cos(A/2).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)), but since it's a competition problem, maybe it's an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated when I squared the equation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equation:\n\n13 sqrt(39) (b + c)= bc sqrt(130).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nbc= [13 sqrt(39) (b + c)] / sqrt(130).\n\nSimplify sqrt(39)/sqrt(130)=sqrt(39/130)=sqrt(3/10)=sqrt(30)/10.\n\nWait, because 39=13*3, 130=13*10. So, sqrt(39/130)=sqrt(3/10)=sqrt(30)/10.\n\nSo,\n\nbc= [13 * sqrt(30)/10 * (b + c)].\n\nSo,\n\nbc= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(b + c).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nbc= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(b + c).\n\nLet me denote b + c =x, bc=y.\n\nSo,\n\ny= (13 sqrt(30)/10) x.\n\nSo, y= (13 sqrt(30)/10)x.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2=480 + (14/13)y.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2= (b + c)^2 -2 bc= x\u00b2 -2y.\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 -2y=480 + (14/13)y.\n\nSubstitute y= (13 sqrt(30)/10)x:\n\nx\u00b2 -2*(13 sqrt(30)/10)x=480 + (14/13)*(13 sqrt(30)/10)x.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - (26 sqrt(30)/10)x=480 + (14 sqrt(30)/10)x.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b2 - (26 sqrt(30)/10)x - (14 sqrt(30)/10)x -480=0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - (40 sqrt(30)/10)x -480=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30)x -480=0.\n\nSo, the equation is x\u00b2 -4 sqrt(30)x -480=0.\n\nLet me solve this quadratic for x.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx= [4 sqrt(30) \u00b1 sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))^2 +4*480 )]/2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(4 sqrt(30))\u00b2=16*30=480.\n\n4*480=1920.\n\nSo, sqrt(480 +1920)=sqrt(2400)=sqrt(100*24)=10*sqrt(24)=10*2*sqrt(6)=20 sqrt(6).\n\nThus,\n\nx= [4 sqrt(30) \u00b120 sqrt(6)]/2= 2 sqrt(30) \u00b110 sqrt(6).\n\nSince x=b + c must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\nx=2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, x=2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6).\n\nNow, from y= (13 sqrt(30)/10)x, we can find y= bc.\n\nSo,\n\ny= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6)).\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, compute 2 sqrt(30) * sqrt(30)=2*30=60.\n\nThen, 10 sqrt(6)*sqrt(30)=10*sqrt(180)=10*sqrt(36*5)=10*6*sqrt(5)=60 sqrt(5).\n\nSo,\n\ny= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6))= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(2 sqrt(30) +10 sqrt(6)).\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n= (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(2 sqrt(30)) + (13 sqrt(30)/10)*(10 sqrt(6)).\n\n= (13*2*30)/10 + (13 sqrt(30)*10 sqrt(6))/10.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (26*30)/10=780/10=78.\n\nSecond term: (13 sqrt(30)*sqrt(6))=13 sqrt(180)=13*6*sqrt(5)=78 sqrt(5).\n\nSo, y=78 +78 sqrt(5)=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, despite the initial confusion, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nBut the problem says to put the answer as an integer in a box. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the product AB\u00b7AC is bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)), which is approximately 174.648, but the problem might expect an exact form, which is 78(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting AI as the length from I to A, but in reality, IA is the length from A to I, which is the same as AI. So, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different form, but given the calculations, 78(1 + sqrt(5)) is the correct value.\n\nSo, the final answer is 78(1 + sqrt(5)), which is 78 +78 sqrt(5).\n\nBut since the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, and we found bc=78(1 + sqrt(5)), that's the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The distance between the circumcenter \\( O \\) and the incenter \\( I \\) is given by the formula \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\). Substituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( IAO \\) is a right triangle with \\( \\angle I = 90^\\circ \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nAO^2 = AI^2 + OI^2\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( AO = R = 13 \\) and \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n13^2 = AI^2 + (\\sqrt{13})^2 \\implies 169 = AI^2 + 13 \\implies AI^2 = 156 \\implies AI = 2\\sqrt{39}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the formula for \\( AI \\) in terms of the sides \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) (opposite angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) respectively) and the angle \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nAI = \\frac{2bc}{b + c} \\cos\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWe also know that \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13} \\) and \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} \\). Substituting these into the formula for \\( AI \\):\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{2bc}{b + c} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{bc}{b + c} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( b + c \\) and then by 13:\n\n\\[\n13\\sqrt{39}(b + c) = bc\\sqrt{130}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n169 \\cdot 39 (b + c)^2 = 130 (bc)^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n6591 (b + c)^2 = 130 (bc)^2\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x = b + c \\) and \\( y = bc \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n10y^2 = 507x^2\n\\]\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines and the given circumradius, we find \\( a = 4\\sqrt{30} \\). Using the relationship \\( b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + 2bc \\cos A \\) and solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we find:\n\n\\[\ny = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5})\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC = bc = 78(1 + \\sqrt{5}) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{78(1 + \\sqrt{5})}\n\\]",

The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB \u00b7 AC.\n\nHmm. So, triangle ABC, circumradius R = 13, inradius r = 6. IA is perpendicular to OI. And we need to find the product of AB and AC, which is AB\u00b7AC.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters.\n\nThe circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle. It's the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, with radius R = 13.\n\nThe incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. It's the center of the inscribed circle, with radius r = 6.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, so the line from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting incenter I to circumcenter O.\n\nI think this is a key condition here. So, IA \u22a5 OI.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. So, in triangle ABC, the inradius is 6, and the circumradius is 13. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nI need to find AB\u00b7AC. Hmm. Let me recall that in a triangle, AB\u00b7AC can be related to other elements.\n\nWait, AB\u00b7AC is equal to 2R times the area of triangle ABC, but wait, no. Wait, let me think. The area of a triangle is (AB\u00b7AC\u00b7sin A)/2, but that's the area. Hmm, but maybe I can relate AB\u00b7AC to other things.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and the circumradius. Wait, the formula for the area is (a b c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius. But that's for the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me think about the formula for AB\u00b7AC.\n\nWait, AB is the side opposite to C, and AC is opposite to B. Wait, actually, AB is opposite to C, AC opposite to B, and BC opposite to A.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the inradius: Area = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nBut I also know that Area = (a b c)/(4R). So, combining these, (a b c)/(4R) = r s.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. Yes, in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumradius is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, let me verify. Wait, actually, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So, OI = sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr).\n\nGiven that R = 13, r = 6. So, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).\n\nWait, but in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since OI is a line from I(0,0) to O, which is at some point. Let me denote vector OI as vector from I to O, which is O - I. Since I is at (0,0), O is at (h, k), so OI is the vector (h, k). The length of OI is sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(13), as we found earlier.\n\nNow, IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the line from I(0,0) to A. Let me denote point A as (x, y). So, the vector IA is (x, y). For IA to be perpendicular to OI, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, (x, y) \u00b7 (h, k) = 0 => x h + y k = 0.\n\nHmm. Also, point A lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, which has center O(h, k) and radius R=13. So, the distance from A to O is 13.\n\nSo, (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 13\u00b2 = 169.\n\nAlso, since I is the incenter, it's located at a position determined by the angle bisectors. But setting up coordinates with I at origin might complicate things because the coordinates of O are (h, k), which are not necessarily aligned with the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I can choose a coordinate system where O lies on the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set point O at (d, 0), where d is the distance from I to O, which is sqrt(13). Wait, OI is sqrt(13), so if I place I at (0,0) and O at (sqrt(13), 0), then the vector OI is along the x-axis.\n\nWait, but then IA is perpendicular to OI, which is along the x-axis. So, IA must be vertical, i.e., along the y-axis.\n\nWait, so if O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0), then IA is a vector from I to A, which must be perpendicular to OI. Since OI is along the x-axis, IA must be along the y-axis. So, point A must lie somewhere along the y-axis.\n\nSo, point A is at (0, y). But point A is also on the circumcircle centered at O(sqrt(13), 0) with radius 13. So, the distance from A to O is sqrt((0 - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + (y - 0)^2) = sqrt(13 + y\u00b2) = 13.\n\nSo, sqrt(13 + y\u00b2) = 13 => 13 + y\u00b2 = 169 => y\u00b2 = 156 => y = sqrt(156) or y = -sqrt(156). Since we're dealing with a triangle, let's take y positive, so A is at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nSo, A is at (0, sqrt(156)). Now, since I is the incenter, and I is at (0,0), which is also the inradius point. The inradius is 6, so the inradius is the distance from I to each side.\n\nHmm. So, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), which is (0, 2*sqrt(39)).\n\nWait, but the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to side BC is 6. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the coordinates of points B and C as well. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of triangle incenters and excenters.\n\nWait, another approach. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is along the x-axis in this coordinate system, IA is along the y-axis. So, point A is (0, sqrt(156)), as we found.\n\nNow, the inradius is 6, so the inradius is the distance from I to BC, which is 6. But in this coordinate system, I is at (0,0). So, the equation of side BC must be such that the distance from (0,0) to BC is 6.\n\nWait, but we don't know the equation of BC yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates of B and C by considering that they lie on the circumcircle. So, points B and C lie on the circle centered at (sqrt(13), 0) with radius 13.\n\nSo, the equation of the circumcircle is (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe also know that the incenter I is at (0,0), and the inradius is 6. So, the sides of the triangle are tangent to the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 6.\n\nSo, the sides BC, AC, and AB are tangent to this circle.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), which is (0, 2*sqrt(39)). So, the side BC is opposite to A, and it's a tangent to the incircle.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find the equations of the sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, since A is at (0, sqrt(156)), and I is at (0,0), the inradius is 6, which is the distance from I to BC. But the inradius is also the distance from I to AB and I to AC. Wait, no, actually, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, so all three sides are at a distance of 6 from I.\n\nBut in this coordinate system, the side BC is opposite to A, which is on the y-axis, so BC is a horizontal line? Wait, no, because if A is at (0, y), then BC is a line that is a distance of 6 from (0,0). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parameterize the triangle.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula that relates the distance between inradius and circumradius. Wait, we already used that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr, which gave us OI = sqrt(13). So that's correct.\n\nNow, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is along the x-axis, IA is along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, sqrt(13 + 13\u00b2)), but wait, no, earlier we had point A at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nWait, maybe we can find the lengths of sides AB and AC.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Since we have point A, maybe we can express AB and AC in terms of coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)). Points B and C are somewhere on the circumcircle. Let me denote point B as (x1, y1) and point C as (x2, y2). Both points satisfy (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6. The equation of BC can be written as ax + by + c = 0, and the distance from (0,0) to this line is |c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 6.\n\nBut since BC is a side of the triangle, and A is opposite to BC, the line BC is also the line joining points B and C.\n\nHmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe I can use some other properties.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the length of IA can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, the formula for the length of the inradius is r = (Area)/s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nBut we also have the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The distance from I to A is given by IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2), where a is the side opposite to A, which is BC.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Similarly for IB and IC.\n\nSo, IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps we can relate this.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, IA is along the y-axis, so its length is just the y-coordinate of A, which is sqrt(156). So, IA = sqrt(156). Let's compute that: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39) \u2248 12.49.\n\nBut from the formula, IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). So, sqrt(156) = sqrt(6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, sqrt(156) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2). Squaring both sides, 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm. So, s - a = 2*sqrt(30). So, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nBut s is the semi-perimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2. So, (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2*sqrt(30) => (b + c)/2 = 2*sqrt(30) => b + c = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm. So, b + c = 4*sqrt(30). Interesting.\n\nBut we also know that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed as c\u00b7b, since AB is opposite to C, which is c, and AC is opposite to B, which is b. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.\n\nSo, AB is c, AC is b. So, AB\u00b7AC is c\u00b7b.\n\nSo, we need to find c\u00b7b.\n\nWe know that b + c = 4*sqrt(30). If we can find another equation involving b and c, we can solve for their product.\n\nHmm. Let's think about other properties.\n\nWe know that the area of the triangle can be expressed as r*s, where r is inradius, s is semi-perimeter.\n\nSo, Area = r*s = 6*s.\n\nWe also know that Area = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.\n\nSo, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312*s.\n\nHmm. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, a = 2R*sin A, b = 2R*sin B, c = 2R*sin C.\n\nSo, a = 26*sin A, b = 26*sin B, c = 26*sin C.\n\nSo, the product b*c = 26\u00b2*sin B*sin C = 676*sin B*sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know angles B and C yet.\n\nWait, but since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relation between angle A and the other angles.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, IA is along the y-axis, and OI is along the x-axis. So, the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. But how does that relate to the angles of the triangle?\n\nWait, perhaps we can find the coordinates of O and I, and then find some relations.\n\nWait, O is at (sqrt(13), 0), I is at (0,0), and A is at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nSo, in this coordinate system, OA is the distance from O to A, which is sqrt( (sqrt(13) - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(156))^2 ) = sqrt(13 + 156) = sqrt(169) = 13, which is consistent because A is on the circumcircle.\n\nNow, let's think about the triangle's sides.\n\nSince I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nGiven the coordinates of A, B, and C, perhaps we can find the equations of the angle bisectors.\n\nBut this might get too involved. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A is IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + 120) = sqrt(156), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, we have that s - a = 2*sqrt(30), and s = a + 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWe also have that b + c = 4*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the Law of Cosines. In triangle ABC, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A.\n\nBut I don't know angle A yet.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0). So, perhaps we can find angle A.\n\nWait, angle at A is the angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nBut since we don't know points B and C, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nSince points B and C lie on the circumcircle: (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nAlso, the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6.\n\nMoreover, the sides AB and AC are tangent to the incircle.\n\nWait, the equation of side BC can be found if we know two points on it, but since we don't know B and C, perhaps we can find the equation of BC another way.\n\nWait, since the distance from I(0,0) to BC is 6, and BC is a chord of the circumcircle.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can find the equation of BC as a line that is at distance 6 from (0,0).\n\nLet me denote the equation of BC as y = m x + c. Then, the distance from (0,0) to BC is |c| / sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1) = 6.\n\nSo, |c| = 6*sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1). So, c = \u00b16*sqrt(m\u00b2 + 1).\n\nBut BC is a chord of the circumcircle. So, the line BC intersects the circumcircle at two points B and C.\n\nThe equation of the circumcircle is (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSubstituting y = m x + c into this equation:\n\n(x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + (m x + c)^2 = 169.\n\nExpanding this:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(13)*x + 13 + m\u00b2 x\u00b2 + 2 m c x + c\u00b2 = 169.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 + m\u00b2) x\u00b2 + (-2 sqrt(13) + 2 m c) x + (13 + c\u00b2 - 169) = 0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n13 + c\u00b2 - 169 = c\u00b2 - 156.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation becomes:\n\n(1 + m\u00b2) x\u00b2 + (-2 sqrt(13) + 2 m c) x + (c\u00b2 - 156) = 0.\n\nFor this quadratic to have real solutions (since BC is a chord), the discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nBut maybe that's not the way to go. Alternatively, since BC is at a distance of 6 from (0,0), and it's a chord of the circumcircle, we can find the length of BC.\n\nWait, the length of a chord at distance d from the center is 2*sqrt(R\u00b2 - d\u00b2). But wait, that's for a circle centered at the origin. Wait, in this case, the circumcircle is centered at (sqrt(13), 0), so the distance from the center to BC is not the same as the distance from (0,0) to BC.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to calculate the distance from the center O(sqrt(13), 0) to the line BC.\n\nLet me denote the equation of BC as a x + b y + c = 0.\n\nThe distance from O(sqrt(13), 0) to BC is |a*sqrt(13) + b*0 + c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut the distance from I(0,0) to BC is |c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 6.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. |c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 6.\n\n2. |a sqrt(13) + c| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = d, where d is the distance from O to BC.\n\nBut I don't know d. However, the length of chord BC can be found using the formula 2*sqrt(R\u00b2 - d\u00b2), where R is the radius of the circumcircle, which is 13. So, length BC = 2*sqrt(13\u00b2 - d\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(169 - d\u00b2).\n\nBut the length of BC is also equal to a, the side opposite angle A.\n\nHmm, but I don't know d. However, maybe I can relate d to other quantities.\n\nWait, from equation 1: |c| = 6*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nFrom equation 2: |a sqrt(13) + c| = d*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the formula for the distance between two parallel lines or something else, but I don't see an immediate connection.\n\nWait, another approach: the length of BC is a, and the distance from O to BC is d. So, a = 2*sqrt(R\u00b2 - d\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(169 - d\u00b2).\n\nBut from the distance formulas, we have:\n\nFrom I: |c| = 6*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nFrom O: |a sqrt(13) + c| = d*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but this seems too abstract.\n\nWait, let me denote sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) as k. Then, |c| = 6k, and |a sqrt(13) + c| = d k.\n\nSo, we have |a sqrt(13) + c| = d k.\n\nBut since c = \u00b16k, then |a sqrt(13) \u00b16k| = d k.\n\nHmm, perhaps squaring both sides:\n\n(a sqrt(13) \u00b16k)^2 = d\u00b2 k\u00b2.\n\nExpanding:\n\n13 a\u00b2 \u00b112 a sqrt(13) k + 36 k\u00b2 = d\u00b2 k\u00b2.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can express a in terms of k. Since k = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut I don't know angle A. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the distance from O to BC is d, and the distance from I to BC is 6.\n\nAlso, the distance from O to BC can be related to the circumradius and the side BC.\n\nWait, but maybe using vector methods or coordinate geometry is getting too involved. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me recall that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed as b c, where b = AC and c = AB.\n\nWe have that b + c = 4 sqrt(30). If I can find another equation involving b and c, I can solve for bc.\n\nEarlier, I thought about the area being equal to both r s and (a b c)/(4 R).\n\nWe have Area = r s = 6 s.\n\nAlso, Area = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/(52).\n\nSo, 6 s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2. And earlier, we found that b + c = 4 sqrt(30), and s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = (a + 4 sqrt(30))/2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, s is (a + b + c)/2, and we found that b + c = 4 sqrt(30). So, s = (a + 4 sqrt(30))/2.\n\nSo, s = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, substituting into a b c = 312 s:\n\na b c = 312*(a/2 + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nHmm.\n\nBut we also have from the Law of Sines that a = 2 R sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a b c = 26^3 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know the angles yet.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula: in any triangle, the product b c can be expressed as 2 R (b c) = a / sin A.\n\nWait, no, that's the Law of Sines. Wait, a = 2 R sin A, so sin A = a/(2 R).\n\nSimilarly, sin B = b/(2 R), sin C = c/(2 R).\n\nSo, sin A sin B sin C = (a b c)/(8 R^3).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for area in terms of sides and angles: Area = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nBut Area is also equal to r s = 6 s.\n\nSo, (1/2) b c sin A = 6 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2 = a/2 + (b + c)/2 = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(1/2) b c sin A = 6*(a/2 + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nb c sin A = 6 a + 24 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm.\n\nBut from the Law of Sines, sin A = a/(2 R) = a/(26).\n\nSo, sin A = a/26.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nb c (a/26) = 6 a + 24 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 26:\n\na b c = 156 a + 624 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but from earlier, we have a b c = 312 s = 312*(a/2 + 2 sqrt(30)) = 156 a + 624 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, this matches. So, this doesn't give us new information.\n\nHmm. So, I need another equation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, A + B + C = 180\u00b0. But I don't see how that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: since IA is perpendicular to OI, and in our coordinate system, OI is along the x-axis, IA is along the y-axis. So, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nIn this coordinate system, the triangle has vertex A at (0, sqrt(156)), incenter at (0,0), and circumradius 13, circumradius center at (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the lengths of AB and AC using coordinates.\n\nBut to do that, I need coordinates of B and C, which are on the circumcircle and satisfy the inradius condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the inradius is 6, so the area is 6*s.\n\nWait, area = 6*s, and also area = (1/2)*base*height. But I don't know the base or height.\n\nWait, another approach: in triangle ABC, the distance from A to I is sqrt(156). Also, in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the inradius can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, earlier, we had IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2). So, sqrt(156) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2). So, (s - a)^2 = 120 => s - a = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nWe also have that s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: a + b + c = 2a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, but earlier we had that b + c = 4 sqrt(30). Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, earlier I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nEarlier, from IA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2), we had sqrt(156) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2), so (s - a)^2 = 120, so s - a = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: a + b + c = 2a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut earlier, I thought b + c was 4 sqrt(30). Wait, that must be incorrect.\n\nWait, where did I get b + c = 4 sqrt(30)? Wait, no, I think I confused something.\n\nWait, from s = a + 2 sqrt(30), and s = (a + b + c)/2, we have:\n\n(a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30) => a + b + c = 2a + 4 sqrt(30) => b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, that's the correct relation.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\n1. b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\n2. From the Law of Sines: a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\n3. Also, A + B + C = 180\u00b0.\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the product b c can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles.\n\nWait, from the formula, b c = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 a d)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles.\n\nWait, area = (1/2) b c sin A = 6 s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, area = 6*(a + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nAlso, area = (1/2) b c sin A.\n\nSo, (1/2) b c sin A = 6*(a + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nb c sin A = 12 a + 24 sqrt(30).\n\nBut sin A = a/(2 R) = a/(26).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nb c (a/26) = 12 a + 24 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 26:\n\na b c = 312 a + 624 sqrt(30).\n\nBut from earlier, we have a b c = 312 s = 312*(a + 2 sqrt(30)) = 312 a + 624 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, again, this gives the same equation, which doesn't provide new information.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find another relation.\n\nWait, going back to the coordinate system. Point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0).\n\nThe sides AB and AC are tangent to the incircle centered at (0,0) with radius 6.\n\nSo, the equations of AB and AC must satisfy the condition that the distance from (0,0) to these lines is 6.\n\nLet me denote the equation of AB as y = m1 x + c1. Since it passes through A(0, sqrt(156)), c1 = sqrt(156). So, equation is y = m1 x + sqrt(156).\n\nSimilarly, equation of AC is y = m2 x + sqrt(156).\n\nBut since AB and AC are tangent to the incircle, the distance from (0,0) to these lines must be 6.\n\nSo, the distance from (0,0) to AB is |0 - m1*0 - sqrt(156)| / sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = sqrt(156)/sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = 6.\n\nSo, sqrt(156)/sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = 6 => sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = sqrt(156)/6.\n\nSimplify sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2 sqrt(39). So, sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = (2 sqrt(39))/6 = sqrt(39)/3.\n\nSo, sqrt(m1\u00b2 + 1) = sqrt(39)/3 => m1\u00b2 + 1 = 39/9 = 13/3 => m1\u00b2 = 13/3 - 1 = 10/3 => m1 = \u00b1sqrt(10/3).\n\nSo, the slopes of AB and AC are sqrt(10/3) and -sqrt(10/3). Wait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), which is above the x-axis. So, if AB and AC are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, then their slopes would be positive and negative.\n\nSo, let me assume that the slope of AB is sqrt(10/3) and the slope of AC is -sqrt(10/3).\n\nSo, equation of AB: y = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156).\n\nEquation of AC: y = -sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156).\n\nNow, points B and C lie on the circumcircle (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169 and on these lines.\n\nLet me find the coordinates of point B by solving the equation of AB and the circumcircle.\n\nSubstitute y = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156) into (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 169.\n\nSo:\n\n(x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 + (sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156))\u00b2 = 169.\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: (x - sqrt(13))\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(13) x + 13.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156))\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n= (sqrt(10/3) x)^2 + 2*sqrt(10/3)*sqrt(156)*x + (sqrt(156))^2.\n\n= (10/3) x\u00b2 + 2*sqrt{(10/3)*156} x + 156.\n\nSimplify sqrt{(10/3)*156}:\n\n156 = 12 * 13, so (10/3)*156 = 10 * 52 = 520. So, sqrt(520) = sqrt(4*130) = 2 sqrt(130).\n\nSo, second term becomes:\n\n(10/3) x\u00b2 + 2*(2 sqrt(130)) x + 156 = (10/3) x\u00b2 + 4 sqrt(130) x + 156.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst term + Second term = x\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(13) x + 13 + (10/3) x\u00b2 + 4 sqrt(130) x + 156 = 169.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (10/3) x\u00b2 = (13/3) x\u00b2.\n\n-2 sqrt(13) x + 4 sqrt(130) x = x*(-2 sqrt(13) + 4 sqrt(130)).\n\n13 + 156 = 169.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(13/3) x\u00b2 + x*(-2 sqrt(13) + 4 sqrt(130)) + 169 = 169.\n\nSubtract 169 from both sides:\n\n(13/3) x\u00b2 + x*(-2 sqrt(13) + 4 sqrt(130)) = 0.\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx [ (13/3) x + (-2 sqrt(13) + 4 sqrt(130)) ] = 0.\n\nSo, solutions are x=0, which corresponds to point A(0, sqrt(156)), and:\n\n(13/3) x + (-2 sqrt(13) + 4 sqrt(130)) = 0.\n\nSolve for x:\n\n(13/3) x = 2 sqrt(13) - 4 sqrt(130).\n\nx = [ (2 sqrt(13) - 4 sqrt(130)) * 3 ] / 13.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [6 sqrt(13) - 12 sqrt(130)] / 13.\n\nFactor out 6:\n\nx = 6 [ sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130) ] / 13.\n\nHmm, this seems messy, but let's compute the y-coordinate for point B.\n\ny = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156).\n\nSubstitute x:\n\ny = sqrt(10/3) * [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) / 13] + sqrt(156).\n\nSimplify sqrt(10/3) * 6 = 6 sqrt(10/3) = 6 * sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 6 sqrt(30)/3 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, y = [2 sqrt(30) (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 + sqrt(156).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: [2 sqrt(30) sqrt(13) - 4 sqrt(30) sqrt(130)] /13.\n\nsqrt(30)*sqrt(13) = sqrt(390).\n\nsqrt(30)*sqrt(130) = sqrt(3900) = sqrt(100*39) = 10 sqrt(39).\n\nSo, first term becomes:\n\n[2 sqrt(390) - 4*10 sqrt(39)] /13 = [2 sqrt(390) - 40 sqrt(39)] /13.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nSo, y = [2 sqrt(390) - 40 sqrt(39)] /13 + 2 sqrt(39).\n\nConvert 2 sqrt(39) to have denominator 13:\n\n2 sqrt(39) = (26 sqrt(39))/13.\n\nSo, y = [2 sqrt(390) - 40 sqrt(39) + 26 sqrt(39)] /13 = [2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39)] /13.\n\nHmm, that's the y-coordinate.\n\nSo, point B has coordinates ( [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 , [2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39)] /13 ).\n\nSimilarly, point C would be symmetric, with the slope being -sqrt(10/3), so its coordinates would be ( [6 (sqrt(13) + 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 , [2 sqrt(390) +14 sqrt(39)] /13 ).\n\nWait, but this is getting very complicated. Maybe I can compute the distances AB and AC.\n\nPoint A is at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nPoint B is at (x1, y1) = ( [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 , [2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39)] /13 ).\n\nSo, distance AB is sqrt( (x1 - 0)^2 + (y1 - sqrt(156))^2 ).\n\nBut this seems too messy. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of computing AB and AC directly, I can compute AB\u00b7AC using vectors or dot product.\n\nWait, in coordinate system, AB is the vector from A to B, and AC is the vector from A to C. But since we need AB\u00b7AC, which is the product of lengths, not the dot product of vectors.\n\nWait, no, AB\u00b7AC is the product of the lengths of AB and AC.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, since AB and AC are the lengths from A to B and A to C, which are the sides of the triangle adjacent to A.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in our coordinate system, points B and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis because the slopes of AB and AC are positive and negative sqrt(10/3). So, their x-coordinates are negatives of each other.\n\nWait, no, in our earlier calculation, point B had x-coordinate [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13, and point C would have x-coordinate [6 (sqrt(13) + 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13.\n\nWait, but sqrt(130) is larger than sqrt(13), so the x-coordinate of B is negative, and that of C is positive.\n\nSo, points B and C are on opposite sides of the y-axis.\n\nBut given that, perhaps I can compute AB and AC.\n\nWait, AB is the distance from A(0, sqrt(156)) to B(x1, y1).\n\nSo, AB = sqrt( x1\u00b2 + (y1 - sqrt(156))\u00b2 ).\n\nSimilarly, AC = sqrt( x2\u00b2 + (y2 - sqrt(156))\u00b2 ), where x2 is the x-coordinate of C, which is [6 (sqrt(13) + 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13.\n\nBut computing AB and AC seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute AB\u00b2 and AC\u00b2, then take the product.\n\nWait, AB\u00b2 = x1\u00b2 + (y1 - sqrt(156))\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = x2\u00b2 + (y2 - sqrt(156))\u00b2.\n\nThen, AB\u00b7AC = sqrt( AB\u00b2 * AC\u00b2 ).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think about the product AB\u00b7AC.\n\nIn our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), and points B and C are on the circumcircle. So, AB and AC are chords of the circumcircle passing through A.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point.\n\nWait, the power of point A with respect to the circumcircle is zero because A lies on the circumcircle. Hmm, that might not help.\n\nWait, but the power of point A with respect to the incircle can be considered. Wait, the power of A with respect to the incircle is AI\u00b2 - r\u00b2.\n\nBut AI is sqrt(156), so power is 156 - 36 = 120.\n\nBut the power of point A with respect to the incircle is equal to the square of the length of the tangent from A to the incircle. But in this case, since A is outside the incircle, the tangent length squared is equal to the power.\n\nWait, but the tangent from A to the incircle is equal to sqrt( (distance from A to I)^2 - r^2 ) = sqrt(156 - 36) = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nHmm, which is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nWait, but how does that help with AB\u00b7AC?\n\nWait, AB and AC are the lengths of the tangents from A to the incircle? No, because AB and AC are sides of the triangle, not tangents.\n\nWait, no, the sides BC, AC, and AB are the tangents to the incircle.\n\nHmm. So, the lengths from the vertices to the points of tangency are equal to s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\nWait, right, in a triangle, the lengths from a vertex to the point where the incircle touches the opposite side are equal to s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\nSo, in this case, the lengths from A to the points of tangency on BC, AC, and AB are s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nWait, but earlier, we have that s - a = 2 sqrt(30), and s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, from earlier, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\n2. s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + a + 4 sqrt(30))/2 = (2a + 4 sqrt(30))/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using Heron's formula.\n\nArea = sqrt( s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ).\n\nBut we also have Area = 6 s.\n\nSo,\n\n6 s = sqrt( s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n36 s\u00b2 = s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c).\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u2260 0):\n\n36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c).\n\nHmm.\n\nWe know s - a = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nLet me denote s - b = x and s - c = y.\n\nThen, x + y = (s - b) + (s - c) = 2 s - (b + c) = 2 s - (a + 4 sqrt(30)).\n\nBut s = a + 2 sqrt(30), so 2 s = 2a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, x + y = 2a + 4 sqrt(30) - a - 4 sqrt(30) = a.\n\nSo, x + y = a.\n\nAlso, from Heron's formula:\n\n36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = (2 sqrt(30)) * x * y.\n\nSo, 36 s = 2 sqrt(30) * x y.\n\nBut s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n36 (a + 2 sqrt(30)) = 2 sqrt(30) * x y.\n\nSo,\n\n18 (a + 2 sqrt(30)) = sqrt(30) * x y.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, we have that x + y = a.\n\nSo, perhaps we can write x y in terms of a.\n\nWe know that x + y = a and x y = [18 (a + 2 sqrt(30)) ] / sqrt(30).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx y = [18 (a + 2 sqrt(30)) ] / sqrt(30) = 18/sqrt(30) * (a + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nSimplify 18/sqrt(30) = (18 sqrt(30))/30 = (3 sqrt(30))/5.\n\nSo,\n\nx y = (3 sqrt(30)/5) * (a + 2 sqrt(30)).\n\nSo,\n\nx y = (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + (3 sqrt(30)/5)*2 sqrt(30) = (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + (6*30)/5 = (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + 36.\n\nSo, x y = (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + 36.\n\nBut we also have that x + y = a.\n\nSo, we can write the quadratic equation:\n\nt\u00b2 - (x + y) t + x y = 0 => t\u00b2 - a t + [ (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + 36 ] = 0.\n\nHmm, but I don't know if this helps.\n\nWait, perhaps using the AM-GM inequality or something else, but I don't think that's the way.\n\nWait, perhaps expressing everything in terms of a.\n\nWe have:\n\nx + y = a,\n\nx y = (3 sqrt(30)/5) a + 36.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I don't see an obvious way to find a.\n\nWait, another thought: from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nBut we also have that from the Law of Sines, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (26)^2 sin\u00b2 A,\n\nb\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (26)^2 (sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C),\n\nand 2 b c cos A = 2*(26 sin B)*(26 sin C)*cos A = 2*676 sin B sin C cos A.\n\nHmm, but this seems too involved.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the identity sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C = 1 - cos\u00b2 B + 1 - cos\u00b2 C all over 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that A + B + C = 180\u00b0, so B + C = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I can make an assumption to find a.\n\nWait, perhaps assuming that the triangle is isoceles, but I don't know if that's valid.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), and points B and C are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nWait, is that true? Because the slopes of AB and AC are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, so yes, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so AB = AC.\n\nSo, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nSo, c = b.\n\nSo, from earlier, b + c = 4 sqrt(30) => 2 b = 4 sqrt(30) => b = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, b = c = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but then a = BC.\n\nHmm, if b = c = 2 sqrt(30), then s = (a + 2 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(30))/2 = (a + 4 sqrt(30))/2.\n\nFrom earlier, we have that s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n(a + 4 sqrt(30))/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + 4 sqrt(30) = 2 a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSubtract a + 4 sqrt(30) from both sides:\n\n0 = a.\n\nWhich is impossible because a is the length of BC, which can't be zero.\n\nSo, that assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the triangle is not isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nHmm. So, back to square one.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the product AB\u00b7AC in terms of the sides and the angle at A.\n\nSince AB\u00b7AC = c b.\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nBut without knowing angle A, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0).\n\nSo, vector OA is from O(sqrt(13),0) to A(0, sqrt(156)) is (-sqrt(13), sqrt(156)).\n\nThe length of OA is 13, as it's the circumradius.\n\nSimilarly, vector IA is from I(0,0) to A(0, sqrt(156)) is (0, sqrt(156)), length sqrt(156).\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is from I(0,0) to O(sqrt(13), 0), vector (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nDot product of IA and OI is (0, sqrt(156)) \u00b7 (sqrt(13), 0) = 0*sqrt(13) + sqrt(156)*0 = 0, which confirms they are perpendicular.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula that relates the distance between O and I, which is sqrt(13), and the product of the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the distance between O and I is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nWhich we have already used.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula that relates the product of the sides with other elements.\n\nWait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute AB\u00b7AC using coordinates.\n\nGiven that points B and C are on the circumcircle, and AB and AC are tangent to the incircle.\n\nWait, since AB and AC are tangent to the incircle, the lengths from A to the points of tangency on AB and AC are equal to s - a.\n\nWait, right, the lengths from A to the points where the incircle touches AB and AC are both equal to s - a.\n\nSo, in triangle ABC, the lengths from A to the points of tangency on AB and AC are s - a.\n\nSo, the tangent lengths are s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\nWait, so the length from A to the point where incircle touches AB is s - a.\n\nSimilarly, the length from A to the point where incircle touches AC is also s - a.\n\nWait, no, actually, the lengths from A to the points of tangency on AB and AC are both equal to s - BC, which is s - a.\n\nSo, in our case, s - a = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the tangent lengths from A are 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, the lengths from A to the points where the incircle touches AB and AC are both 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, in our coordinate system, the points of tangency on AB and AC are located at a distance of 2 sqrt(30) from A along AB and AC.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps I can find the coordinates of these points of tangency.\n\nGiven that AB has equation y = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156), and the point of tangency is at a distance of 2 sqrt(30) from A(0, sqrt(156)).\n\nSo, the direction vector of AB is (1, sqrt(10/3)).\n\nThe unit vector in the direction of AB is (1, sqrt(10/3)) divided by its magnitude.\n\nThe magnitude of AB is sqrt(1 + 10/3) = sqrt(13/3) = sqrt(13)/sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the unit vector is ( sqrt(3)/sqrt(13), sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) ).\n\nSo, moving from A in the direction towards B for a distance of 2 sqrt(30), the point of tangency T1 has coordinates:\n\nA + 2 sqrt(30) * unit vector.\n\nSo,\n\nx-coordinate: 0 + 2 sqrt(30) * sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 2 sqrt(30)*sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 2 sqrt(90)/sqrt(13) = 2*3 sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) = 6 sqrt(10/13).\n\ny-coordinate: sqrt(156) + 2 sqrt(30) * sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(156) + 2 sqrt(300)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(156) + 2*10 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(156) + 20 sqrt(3/13).\n\nWait, sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) = 2 sqrt(39). So,\n\ny-coordinate: 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(3/13).\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nSimilarly, the point of tangency T1 is at (6 sqrt(10/13), 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(3/13)).\n\nBut since T1 lies on AB, which has equation y = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156).\n\nLet me check if the coordinates satisfy this equation.\n\nCompute y:\n\nsqrt(10/3) * 6 sqrt(10/13) + sqrt(156) = sqrt(10/3)*6 sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) + sqrt(156).\n\n= 6*(10)/(sqrt(3) sqrt(13)) + sqrt(156).\n\n= 60 / sqrt(39) + sqrt(156).\n\n= 60 sqrt(39)/39 + 2 sqrt(39).\n\n= (60/39 + 2) sqrt(39).\n\n= (20/13 + 26/13) sqrt(39).\n\n= (46/13) sqrt(39).\n\nBut the y-coordinate we have is 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(3/13) = 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13).\n\nHmm, sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, 20 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 20 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, total y-coordinate is 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(39)/13 = (26 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(39))/13 = 46 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWhich matches the calculation from the equation.\n\nSo, the point of tangency T1 is correctly calculated.\n\nSimilarly, the point of tangency T2 on AC is symmetric, with coordinates (-6 sqrt(10/13), 2 sqrt(39) + 20 sqrt(3/13)).\n\nWait, no, because AC has a slope of -sqrt(10/3), so the direction vector is (1, -sqrt(10/3)).\n\nSo, the unit vector is ( sqrt(3)/sqrt(13), -sqrt(10)/sqrt(13) ).\n\nSo, the point T2 is at:\n\nx: 0 + 2 sqrt(30) * sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 6 sqrt(10/13),\n\ny: sqrt(156) + 2 sqrt(30) * (-sqrt(10)/sqrt(13)) = sqrt(156) - 20 sqrt(3/13).\n\nBut this should lie on AC, whose equation is y = -sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156).\n\nSo, substituting x = 6 sqrt(10/13):\n\ny = -sqrt(10/3)*6 sqrt(10/13) + sqrt(156).\n\n= -6*(10)/(sqrt(3) sqrt(13)) + sqrt(156).\n\n= -60 / sqrt(39) + sqrt(156).\n\n= -60 sqrt(39)/39 + 2 sqrt(39).\n\n= (-60/39 + 78/39) sqrt(39).\n\n= 18/39 sqrt(39).\n\n= 6/13 sqrt(39).\n\nBut according to the y-coordinate from the point of tangency, it's sqrt(156) - 20 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 2 sqrt(39) - 20 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13).\n\nWhich is 2 sqrt(39) - 20 sqrt(39)/13 = (26 sqrt(39) - 20 sqrt(39))/13 = 6 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWhich matches the calculation from the equation.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, the points of tangency T1 and T2 are on AB and AC, respectively.\n\nBut how does that help with finding AB\u00b7AC?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, since the points T1 and T2 are points of tangency, the lines IT1 and IT2 are radii of the incircle and are perpendicular to AB and AC, respectively.\n\nSo, the line IT1 is perpendicular to AB, and IT2 is perpendicular to AC.\n\nSo, the slope of IT1 is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\nSlope of AB is sqrt(10/3), so slope of IT1 is -sqrt(3/10).\n\nSimilarly, slope of AC is -sqrt(10/3), so slope of IT2 is sqrt(3/10).\n\nBut I is at (0,0), so the line IT1 has slope -sqrt(3/10) and passes through (0,0).\n\nSo, equation of IT1: y = -sqrt(3/10) x.\n\nSimilarly, equation of IT2: y = sqrt(3/10) x.\n\nNow, the point T1 lies on both AB and IT1.\n\nSo, solving the equations y = sqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156) and y = -sqrt(3/10) x.\n\nSet equal:\n\nsqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(156) = -sqrt(3/10) x.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nsqrt(10/3) x + sqrt(3/10) x + sqrt(156) = 0.\n\nFactor x:\n\nx (sqrt(10/3) + sqrt(3/10)) + sqrt(156) = 0.\n\nCompute sqrt(10/3) + sqrt(3/10):\n\n= sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/sqrt(10).\n\n= (sqrt(10)*sqrt(10) + sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3)*sqrt(10).\n\n= (10 + 3)/sqrt(30).\n\n= 13/sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\nx * (13/sqrt(30)) + sqrt(156) = 0.\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx = - sqrt(156) * sqrt(30)/13.\n\nsqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39).\n\nsqrt(30) = sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\nx = - 2 sqrt(39) * sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSimplify sqrt(39)*sqrt(30) = sqrt(1170) = sqrt(9*130) = 3 sqrt(130).\n\nSo,\n\nx = - 2 * 3 sqrt(130) /13 = -6 sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, x = -6 sqrt(130)/13.\n\nThen, y = -sqrt(3/10) x = -sqrt(3/10)*(-6 sqrt(130)/13) = 6 sqrt(3/10)*sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSimplify sqrt(3/10)*sqrt(130) = sqrt( (3/10)*130 ) = sqrt(39).\n\nSo, y = 6 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, point T1 is at (-6 sqrt(130)/13, 6 sqrt(39)/13).\n\nSimilarly, point T2 is at (6 sqrt(130)/13, 6 sqrt(39)/13).\n\nNow, the distance from A(0, sqrt(156)) to T1 is 2 sqrt(30), as we found earlier.\n\nLet me compute the distance between A and T1:\n\nsqrt( (0 - (-6 sqrt(130)/13))\u00b2 + (sqrt(156) - 6 sqrt(39)/13)^2 ).\n\n= sqrt( (6 sqrt(130)/13)^2 + (sqrt(156) - 6 sqrt(39)/13)^2 ).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(6 sqrt(130)/13)^2 = 36*130 / 169 = (4680)/169.\n\nsqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39), so sqrt(156) - 6 sqrt(39)/13 = 2 sqrt(39) - (6/13) sqrt(39) = (26 sqrt(39) - 6 sqrt(39))/13 = (20 sqrt(39))/13.\n\nSo, (20 sqrt(39)/13)^2 = (400 * 39)/169 = 15600/169.\n\nSo, total distance squared:\n\n4680/169 + 15600/169 = (4680 + 15600)/169 = 20280/169.\n\nsqrt(20280/169) = sqrt(20280)/13.\n\nCompute sqrt(20280):\n\n20280 = 4*5070 = 4*10*507 = 40*507.\n\n507 = 3*13*13.\n\nSo, sqrt(20280) = sqrt(40*507) = sqrt(40)*sqrt(507) = 2 sqrt(10)*sqrt(507).\n\nBut 507 = 13*39 = 13*3*13.\n\nWait, no, 507 divided by 13 is 39, which is 3*13.\n\nSo, 507 = 13\u00b2 * 3.\n\nSo, sqrt(507) = 13 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, sqrt(20280) = 2 sqrt(10)*13 sqrt(3) = 26 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, sqrt(20280)/13 = 26 sqrt(30)/13 = 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich matches our earlier result that the distance from A to T1 is 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, all the calculations are consistent.\n\nBut how does this help with finding AB\u00b7AC?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinates of points B and C.\n\nEarlier, we found that point B is at ( [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 , [2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39)] /13 ).\n\nSimilarly, point C is at ( [6 (sqrt(13) + 2 sqrt(130)) ] /13 , [2 sqrt(390) +14 sqrt(39)] /13 ).\n\nSo, the coordinates are quite messy, but let me try to compute AB and AC.\n\nCompute AB:\n\nPoint A: (0, sqrt(156)) = (0, 2 sqrt(39)).\n\nPoint B: (6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130))/13, (2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39))/13).\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = [6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130))/13 - 0]^2 + [ (2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39))/13 - 2 sqrt(39) ]^2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n[6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130))/13]^2 = [6/13 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130))]^2 = (36/169)(13 - 4 sqrt(13*130) + 4*130).\n\nCompute sqrt(13*130) = sqrt(1690) = 13 sqrt(10).\n\nSo,\n\n= (36/169)(13 - 4*13 sqrt(10) + 520).\n\n= (36/169)(533 - 52 sqrt(10)).\n\nWait, 13 + 520 = 533, and -4*13 sqrt(10) = -52 sqrt(10).\n\nSecond term:\n\n[ (2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39))/13 - 2 sqrt(39) ]^2.\n\n= [ (2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39) - 26 sqrt(39))/13 ]^2.\n\n= [ (2 sqrt(390) -40 sqrt(39))/13 ]^2.\n\n= [ 2 (sqrt(390) -20 sqrt(39))/13 ]^2.\n\n= 4 (sqrt(390) -20 sqrt(39))\u00b2 /169.\n\nCompute (sqrt(390) -20 sqrt(39))\u00b2:\n\n= 390 + 400*39 - 40 sqrt(390*39).\n\n= 390 + 15600 - 40 sqrt(15210).\n\n= 15990 - 40 sqrt(15210).\n\nsqrt(15210) = sqrt(1521*10) = 39 sqrt(10).\n\nSo,\n\n= 15990 - 40*39 sqrt(10) = 15990 - 1560 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, second term becomes:\n\n4*(15990 - 1560 sqrt(10))/169 = (63960 - 6240 sqrt(10))/169.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 is the sum of the first and second terms:\n\n(36/169)(533 - 52 sqrt(10)) + (63960 - 6240 sqrt(10))/169.\n\n= [36*(533 - 52 sqrt(10)) + 63960 - 6240 sqrt(10)] /169.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n36*533 = let's compute 500*36=18000, 33*36=1188, so total 18000+1188=19188.\n\n36*(-52 sqrt(10)) = -1872 sqrt(10).\n\nSo,\n\n19188 -1872 sqrt(10) +63960 -6240 sqrt(10).\n\n= (19188 +63960) + (-1872 sqrt(10) -6240 sqrt(10)).\n\n= 83148 - 8112 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = (83148 -8112 sqrt(10))/169.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(83148,8112,169). Let's see, 169 is 13\u00b2.\n\nCheck if 13 divides 83148: 83148 \u00f713=6396, since 13*6000=78000, 13*396=5148, 78000+5148=83148. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, 8112 \u00f713=624.\n\nSo,\n\nAB\u00b2 = [13*(6396 - 624 sqrt(10))]/13\u00b2 = (6396 -624 sqrt(10))/13.\n\nSimplify:\n\n6396 \u00f713= 492, since 13*492=6396.\n\n624 \u00f713=48, since 13*48=624.\n\nSo,\n\nAB\u00b2 = (492 -48 sqrt(10)).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be the same as AB\u00b2 because of symmetry, but wait, no, because point C has a different y-coordinate.\n\nWait, no, actually, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so AB and AC should have the same length. Wait, but earlier, when I assumed AB = AC, it led to a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so AB and AC should indeed be equal.\n\nSo, AB = AC, so AB\u00b7AC = (AB)\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 = 492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = (492 -48 sqrt(10)).\n\nWait, but this seems like an exact form, but the problem might expect a numerical value or a simplified radical form.\n\nWait, but 492 -48 sqrt(10) can be factored as 12*(41 - 4 sqrt(10)), but I don't know if that's helpful.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again, because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, when computing AB\u00b2, I had:\n\nFirst term: (36/169)(533 - 52 sqrt(10)).\n\nSecond term: (63960 - 6240 sqrt(10))/169.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n[36*(533 -52 sqrt(10)) +63960 -6240 sqrt(10)] /169.\n\nCompute 36*533: 500*36=18000, 33*36=1188, total 19188.\n\n36*(-52 sqrt(10))= -1872 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n19188 -1872 sqrt(10) +63960 -6240 sqrt(10).\n\n= (19188 +63960) + (-1872 sqrt(10) -6240 sqrt(10)).\n\n= 83148 -8112 sqrt(10).\n\nDivide by 169: 83148/169 = 492, 8112/169=48.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC=AB\u00b2=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nBut the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is this value.\n\nBut let me see if this can be simplified or expressed in another form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier, because this seems a bit messy.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute AB\u00b7AC using another approach.\n\nWait, since AB and AC are tangent to the incircle, and the lengths from A to the points of tangency are 2 sqrt(30), as we found earlier.\n\nSo, the length from A to T1 is 2 sqrt(30), and from T1 to B is some length, say, m.\n\nSimilarly, from A to T2 is 2 sqrt(30), and from T2 to C is the same length m.\n\nWait, but in reality, the lengths from the points of tangency to the vertices are s - a, s - b, s - c.\n\nWait, so from T1 to B is s - c, and from T2 to C is s - b.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula that in a triangle, the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed in terms of the tangents.\n\nWait, but I don't recall such a formula.\n\nWait, another thought: the product AB\u00b7AC can be expressed as (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) multiplied by something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in our coordinate system, AB and AC have slopes sqrt(10/3) and -sqrt(10/3), so the angle between AB and AC can be found.\n\nWait, the angle at A can be found using the slopes.\n\nThe angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1 m2)|.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = |( -sqrt(10/3) - sqrt(10/3) ) / (1 + (sqrt(10/3))(-sqrt(10/3)))|.\n\n= | (-2 sqrt(10/3)) / (1 - 10/3) |.\n\n= | (-2 sqrt(10/3)) / (-7/3) |.\n\n= | (2 sqrt(10/3)) * (3/7) |.\n\n= | (6 sqrt(10/3)) /7 |.\n\n= (6 sqrt(10/3))/7.\n\nSimplify sqrt(10/3) = sqrt(30)/3.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = (6*(sqrt(30)/3))/7 = (2 sqrt(30))/7.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = 2 sqrt(30)/7.\n\nSo, angle A has tan(theta) = 2 sqrt(30)/7.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how this helps.\n\nWait, using the Law of Cosines:\n\nAB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2 AB AC cos(theta) = BC\u00b2.\n\nBut since AB = AC, as we thought earlier due to symmetry, but that led to a contradiction, maybe it's not isoceles.\n\nWait, but in our coordinate system, AB and AC have different slopes, so they are not equal.\n\nWait, but earlier, we found that AB\u00b2 = 492 -48 sqrt(10). Similarly, AC\u00b2 would be the same because of symmetry.\n\nWait, but if AB and AC are not equal, then AB\u00b2 and AC\u00b2 would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming AB = AC. Let me check.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so distances AB and AC should be equal. Because reflecting over the y-axis preserves distances.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I assumed AB = AC, it led to a contradiction, so perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinate system, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so AB and AC should indeed be equal.\n\nHmm, but then why did assuming AB = AC lead to a contradiction?\n\nWait, when I assumed AB = AC, I set b = c = 2 sqrt(30), leading to s = a + 2 sqrt(30), and from b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30), which gave 4 sqrt(30) = a + 4 sqrt(30), implying a = 0, which is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps the triangle is not isoceles, which contradicts the coordinate system.\n\nWait, no, in the coordinate system, points B and C are symmetric across the y-axis, so AB and AC should be equal, meaning the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nBut then the earlier contradiction arises, which suggests that perhaps my coordinate system assumption is flawed.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the coordinate system.\n\nWait, when I placed I at (0,0) and O at (sqrt(13), 0), and since IA is perpendicular to OI, IA is along the y-axis, so point A is at (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nBut in this case, the triangle would be isoceles with AB = AC, but that led to a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that in reality, the triangle is not isoceles, and my coordinate system incorrectly enforces symmetry.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should not have placed O at (sqrt(13), 0). Maybe O is not on the x-axis, but in a different position.\n\nWait, but I thought placing O on the x-axis would simplify things because IA is perpendicular to OI, so IA is along the y-axis.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use vector algebra.\n\nWait, let me denote vector OI as vector from I to O, which has length sqrt(13).\n\nVector IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nLet me denote vector OI as vector v, and vector IA as vector w.\n\nThen, v \u00b7 w = 0.\n\nThe length of v is sqrt(13), length of w is sqrt(156).\n\nBut I don't know how to proceed from here.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the product AB\u00b7AC in terms of other elements.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB\u00b7AC = c b.\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nAnd from the Law of Sines, a = 26 sin A, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 676 sin\u00b2 A.\n\nAlso, b c = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, from the Law of Cosines:\n\n676 sin\u00b2 A = 676 sin\u00b2 B + 676 sin\u00b2 C - 2*676 sin B sin C cos A.\n\nDivide both sides by 676:\n\nsin\u00b2 A = sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C - 2 sin B sin C cos A.\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, sin\u00b2 A + sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C = 2 + 2 cos A cos B cos C.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity sin\u00b2 B + sin\u00b2 C = 1 - cos\u00b2 B + 1 - cos\u00b2 C = 2 - (cos\u00b2 B + cos\u00b2 C).\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nWait, another approach: since in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0), perhaps we can find vectors OA and IA, and use their dot product.\n\nWait, vector OA is from O to A: (0 - sqrt(13), sqrt(156) - 0) = (-sqrt(13), sqrt(156)).\n\nVector IA is from I to A: (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nWait, but we already know that IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, vector OI is from I to O: (sqrt(13), 0).\n\nVector IA is (0, sqrt(156)).\n\nDot product: 0*sqrt(13) + sqrt(156)*0 = 0, which confirms they are perpendicular.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of vectors.\n\nBut I don't think that's helpful.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using trigonometric identities involving the distance between O and I.\n\nWe know that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r = 169 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13, so OI = sqrt(13).\n\nAlso, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, in triangle IOA, we have sides:\n\n- IO = sqrt(13),\n\n- IA = sqrt(156),\n\n- OA = 13.\n\nAnd angle between IA and IO is 90 degrees.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras:\n\nIA\u00b2 + IO\u00b2 = OA\u00b2.\n\nWait, IA\u00b2 = 156,\n\nIO\u00b2 =13,\n\nOA\u00b2 =169.\n\n156 +13=169. Yes, 169=169.\n\nSo, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.\n\nSo, triangle IOA is a right triangle with legs IA and IO, and hypotenuse OA.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we can use trigonometric relations.\n\nSo, angle at O: let's call it theta.\n\nSo, sin(theta) = IA / OA = sqrt(156)/13.\n\nCompute sqrt(156)/13: sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39), so 2 sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSimilarly, cos(theta) = IO / OA = sqrt(13)/13.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, angle theta = angle IOA.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut how does this relate to the rest of the triangle ABC?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the Euler line connects O and I, but in this case, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps there's a relation.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from O to I is sqrt(13), and IA is sqrt(156), which is 12.49.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the distance from the circumcenter to the incenter in terms of the sides.\n\nBut I think we already used that OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another formula: in any triangle, the distance from O to I can also be expressed in terms of the angles.\n\nWait, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2 R r.\n\nWhich we have already used.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps using trigonometric identities involving the angles.\n\nWait, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we have:\n\nsin(theta) = IA / OA = sqrt(156)/13,\n\ncos(theta) = IO / OA = sqrt(13)/13.\n\nSo, tan(theta) = sqrt(156)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nWait, sqrt(156)/sqrt(13) = sqrt(156/13) = sqrt(12) = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, tan(theta) = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo, theta = arctan(2 sqrt(3)).\n\nWhich is 60 degrees, since tan(60\u00b0)=sqrt(3). Wait, 2 sqrt(3) is approximately 3.464, which is tan(73.89\u00b0), not 60\u00b0.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps using this angle theta in triangle ABC.\n\nWait, perhaps relating theta to angle A.\n\nWait, angle theta is the angle at O between IO and OA.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector approaches.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula that relates AB\u00b7AC with other elements.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, AB\u00b7AC = 2 R\u00b2 cos A.\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, AB = 2 R sin C,\n\nAC = 2 R sin B.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = 4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, in any triangle, B + C = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) - cos(180\u00b0 - A)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = 4 R\u00b2 [ (cos(B - C) + cos A ) / 2 ] = 2 R\u00b2 [ cos(B - C) + cos A ].\n\nHmm.\n\nBut without knowing angle A or B - C, this might not help.\n\nWait, but we know that in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, angle at O is theta with tan(theta)=2 sqrt(3).\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps relating angle theta to angle A.\n\nWait, in triangle IOA, angle at O is theta, which is the angle between IO and OA.\n\nBut I don't know how theta relates to angle A of triangle ABC.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that in triangle ABC, the Euler line connects O and I, but I don't know.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps using coordinates to compute AB\u00b7AC.\n\nFrom earlier, we have AB\u00b2 = 492 -48 sqrt(10), so AB\u00b7AC = (492 -48 sqrt(10)).\n\nBut let me compute this numerically to see if it makes sense.\n\nCompute 492 -48 sqrt(10):\n\nsqrt(10) \u2248 3.1623,\n\n48*3.1623 \u2248 48*3 + 48*0.1623 \u2248 144 + 7.8 \u2248 151.8.\n\nSo, 492 -151.8 \u2248 340.2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC \u2248 340.2.\n\nBut the problem likely expects an exact value, not a decimal.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nBut let me check if this can be simplified.\n\n492 -48 sqrt(10) = 12*(41 -4 sqrt(10)).\n\nHmm, 41 and 4 are coprime, so I don't think it can be simplified further.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = 492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nBut wait, let me check my earlier calculation of AB\u00b2.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, earlier, I computed AB\u00b2 as:\n\n[6 (sqrt(13) - 2 sqrt(130))/13]^2 + [ (2 sqrt(390) -14 sqrt(39))/13 - 2 sqrt(39) ]^2.\n\nWhich became:\n\n(36/169)(533 -52 sqrt(10)) + (63960 -6240 sqrt(10))/169.\n\nBut wait, 533 -52 sqrt(10) multiplied by 36/169:\n\nWait, 36*(533 -52 sqrt(10)) = 36*533 -36*52 sqrt(10).\n\n36*533: Let's compute 500*36=18000, 33*36=1188, so total 19188.\n\n36*52=1872, so 36*52 sqrt(10)=1872 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, first term: 19188 -1872 sqrt(10).\n\nSecond term: 63960 -6240 sqrt(10).\n\nAdding together: 19188 +63960 = 83148,\n\n-1872 sqrt(10) -6240 sqrt(10) = -8112 sqrt(10).\n\nSo, numerator is 83148 -8112 sqrt(10).\n\nDivide by 169:\n\n83148 /169=492,\n\n8112 /169=48.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, AB\u00b7AC = AB\u00b2=492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nBut wait, in reality, AB and AC are not necessarily equal, but in our coordinate system, they are because of symmetry.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but when I assumed AB = AC, I got a contradiction, implying that the triangle is not isoceles, which contradicts the coordinate system.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that AB and AC are symmetric across the y-axis.\n\nWait, in our coordinate system, point A is at (0, sqrt(156)), O is at (sqrt(13), 0), and I is at (0,0).\n\nSo, the line OI is along the x-axis, and IA is along the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, points B and C must lie symmetrically with respect to the y-axis, leading to AB = AC.\n\nBut earlier, when we assumed AB = AC, it led to a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps there's an error in the earlier assumption.\n\nWait, let me check the earlier assumption.\n\nAssuming AB = AC implies that b = c.\n\nFrom earlier, b + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nIf b = c, then 2 b = a + 4 sqrt(30) => a = 2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (a + 2 b)/2.\n\nBut from earlier, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n(a + 2 b)/2 = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\na + 2 b = 2 a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n2 b = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is consistent with earlier.\n\nSo, a = 2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nAlso, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A.\n\nBut since b = c,\n\na\u00b2 = 2 b\u00b2 - 2 b\u00b2 cos A.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines:\n\na = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nand since angles B = C,\n\nso 2 B + A = 180\u00b0.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I don't see a contradiction here.\n\nWait, earlier when I assumed AB = AC, I set b = c = 2 sqrt(30), leading to a = 0, which is impossible.\n\nBut that was a wrong assumption because in reality, if AB = AC, then b = c, but their values are not necessarily 2 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in that step.\n\nWait, let me redo that.\n\nAssuming AB = AC, so b = c.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\nb + c = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, 2 b = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\nFrom the semi-perimeter, s = (a + 2 b)/2 = a/2 + b.\n\nBut we also have s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\na/2 + b = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\n=> b = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nBut from 2 b = a + 4 sqrt(30):\n\nSubstitute b = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30):\n\n2*(a/2 + 2 sqrt(30)) = a + 4 sqrt(30).\n\n=> a +4 sqrt(30) = a +4 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is always true.\n\nSo, no contradiction. So, my earlier conclusion was wrong.\n\nSo, if AB = AC, then b = c, and the equations are consistent.\n\nSo, no contradiction arises.\n\nSo, in that case, AB = AC, and the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nSo, then, AB = AC = b,\n\nand BC = a,\n\ns = (a + 2 b)/2 = a/2 + b.\n\nBut also, s = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\na/2 + b = a + 2 sqrt(30).\n\n=> b = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30).\n\nFrom 2 b = a + 4 sqrt(30):\n\nSubstitute b = a/2 + 2 sqrt(30):\n\n2*(a/2 + 2 sqrt(30)) = a +4 sqrt(30).\n\n=> a +4 sqrt(30) = a +4 sqrt(30).\n\nWhich is always true.\n\nSo, the assumption AB = AC is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC.\n\nSo, AB = AC = b,\n\nBC = a,\n\nand from the earlier equation, 2 b = a +4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo, a = 2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nNow, from the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = 2 b\u00b2 (1 - cos A).\n\nFrom the Law of Sines:\n\na = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nand since angles B = C,\n\nA + 2 B = 180\u00b0.\n\nSo, B = (180\u00b0 - A)/2.\n\nSo, sin B = sin( (180\u00b0 - A)/2 ) = sin(90\u00b0 - A/2) = cos(A/2).\n\nSo, sin B = cos(A/2).\n\nSo, b =26 cos(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, a =26 sin A.\n\nSo, a =26 sin A =26*2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) =52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nBut a =2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) =2*(26 cos(A/2)) -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify:\n\n52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) =52 cos(A/2) -4 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by cos(A/2) (assuming cos(A/2) \u22600):\n\n52 sin(A/2) =52 -4 sqrt(30)/cos(A/2).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the double-angle formula.\n\nLet me denote t = A/2.\n\nSo, A = 2 t.\n\nThen, sin A = 2 sin t cos t.\n\nAlso, cos(A/2) = cos t.\n\nSo, a =26*2 sin t cos t =52 sin t cos t.\n\nb =26 cos t.\n\nSo, a =2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n52 sin t cos t =2*26 cos t -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSimplify:\n\n52 sin t cos t =52 cos t -4 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by cos t (assuming cos t \u22600):\n\n52 sin t =52 -4 sqrt(30)/cos t.\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nAlternatively, rearrange:\n\n52 sin t cos t -52 cos t = -4 sqrt(30).\n\nFactor cos t:\n\ncos t (52 sin t -52) = -4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, factor 52:\n\n52 cos t (sin t -1) = -4 sqrt(30).\n\nHmm.\n\nBut sin t -1 is negative or zero, since sin t \u22641.\n\nSo, left side is negative or zero, right side is negative.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me write:\n\n52 cos t (1 - sin t ) =4 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n13 cos t (1 - sin t ) = sqrt(30).\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me denote u = sin t.\n\nThen, cos t = sqrt(1 - u\u00b2).\n\nSo,\n\n13 sqrt(1 - u\u00b2) (1 - u) = sqrt(30).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n169 (1 - u\u00b2)(1 - u)^2 =30.\n\nExpand (1 - u)^2 =1 -2 u +u\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n169 (1 - u\u00b2)(1 -2 u +u\u00b2) =30.\n\nLet me compute (1 - u\u00b2)(1 -2 u +u\u00b2):\n\n= (1 -u)(1 +u)(1 -2u +u\u00b2).\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, multiply out:\n\n(1 - u\u00b2)(1 -2u +u\u00b2) = (1)(1 -2u +u\u00b2) -u\u00b2(1 -2u +u\u00b2).\n\n=1 -2u +u\u00b2 -u\u00b2 +2 u\u00b3 -u^4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n=1 -2u +0 u\u00b2 +2 u\u00b3 -u^4.\n\nSo,\n\n169*(1 -2u +2 u\u00b3 -u^4) =30.\n\nSo,\n\n169 -338 u +338 u\u00b3 -169 u^4 =30.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-169 u^4 +338 u\u00b3 -338 u +169 -30=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-169 u^4 +338 u\u00b3 -338 u +139=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n169 u^4 -338 u\u00b3 +338 u -139=0.\n\nHmm, quartic equation. This seems too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I can factor it.\n\nLet me try to factor.\n\nAssume it factors as (a u\u00b2 +b u +c)(d u\u00b2 +e u +f).\n\nBut this might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using rational root theorem.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 139 over factors of 169.\n\n139 is a prime number.\n\nSo, possible roots: \u00b11, \u00b1139, \u00b11/13, \u00b1139/13.\n\nTest u=1:\n\n169 -338 +338 -139= (169-139) + (-338+338)=30 +0=30\u22600.\n\nu=1 is not a root.\n\nu=1/13:\n\n169*(1/13)^4 -338*(1/13)^3 +338*(1/13) -139.\n\n=169*(1/28561) -338*(1/2197) +338/13 -139.\n\n\u2248 negligible terms +26 -139\u2248-113\u22600.\n\nNot a root.\n\nSimilarly, u=139/13 is too big.\n\nSo, no rational roots.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nWait, perhaps using substitution.\n\nLet me let v = u - something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using numerical methods.\n\nBut this is getting too involved.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, perhaps the answer is 492 -48 sqrt(10).\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 240.\n\nWait, 240 is a nice number, and 240=16*15, etc.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, another idea: since AB\u00b7AC = c b,\n\nand from Heron's formula, we have:\n\n36 s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c).\n\nWe know s - a =2 sqrt(30),\n\nand s - b =x,\n\ns - c =y,\n\nwith x + y =a,\n\nand x y= [18 (a + 2 sqrt(30)) ] / sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area:\n\nArea =6 s=6*(a +2 sqrt(30)).\n\nBut also, Area=(1/2)*AB*AC*sin A.\n\nSo,\n\n6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A.\n\nBut from the Law of Sines, sin A =a/(26).\n\nSo,\n\n6*(a +2 sqrt(30))= (1/2)*AB*AC*(a/26).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n12*(a +2 sqrt(30))= AB*AC*(a/26).\n\nSo,\n\nAB*AC=12*(a +2 sqrt(30)) *26 /a= 312*(a +2 sqrt(30))/a.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut we need another equation involving a.\n\nFrom earlier, a =2 b -4 sqrt(30).\n\nBut without knowing b, this is not helpful.\n\nWait, but from the Law of Sines,\n\na=26 sin A,\n\nb=26 sin B,\n\nand since angles B=(180\u00b0 -A)/2,\n\nsin B= sin(90\u00b0 -A/2)=cos(A/2).\n\nSo,\n\nb=26 cos(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, a=26 sin A=52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nSo,\n\na=52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2).\n\nAlso, a=2 b -4 sqrt(30)=2*26 cos(A/2) -4 sqrt(30)=52 cos(A/2) -4 sqrt(30).\n\nSo,\n\n52 sin(A/2) cos(A/2)=52 cos(A/2) -4 sqrt(30).\n\nDivide both sides by 52 cos(A/2):\n\nsin(A/2)=1 - (4 sqrt(30))/(52 cos(A/2)).\n\nSimplify:\n\nsin(A/2)=1 - (sqrt(30))/(13 cos(A/2)).\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me let t = A/2,\n\nso,\n\nsin t =1 - (sqrt(30))/(13 cos t).\n\nRearrange:\n\nsin t + (sqrt(30))/(13 cos t)=1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13 cos t:\n\n13 sin t cos t + sqrt(30)=13 cos t.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut 13 sin t cos t= (13/2) sin 2t.\n\nSo,\n\n(13/2) sin 2t + sqrt(30)=13 cos t.\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, express cos t in terms of sin t.\n\nBut this seems too involved.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that AB\u00b7AC=492\u221248\u221a10, which is approximately 340.2.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 240.\n\nWait, if I consider that AB\u00b7AC=240, then 240=16*15, which is possible.\n\nBut without more information, I can't be sure.\n\nWait, another thought: in our coordinate system, AB\u00b7AC= (AB)^2=492\u221248\u221a10\u2248340.2.\n\nBut 340.2 is approximately 340, which is 2*170, but I don't see a reason for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 492\u221248\u221a10 is the exact value.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the answer is 492\u221248\u221a10.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and the condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). \n\n1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**: Using the formula \\( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \\), we find \\( OI = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\n2. **Coordinate System Setup**: Place the incenter \\( I \\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and circumcenter \\( O \\) at \\((\\sqrt{13}, 0)\\). Point \\( A \\) is at \\((0, \\sqrt{156})\\) since \\( IA \\) is perpendicular to \\( OI \\) and has length \\( \\sqrt{156} \\).\n\n3. **Semi-perimeter and Side Lengths**: Using the relation \\( IA = \\sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \\), we find \\( s - a = 2\\sqrt{30} \\).
