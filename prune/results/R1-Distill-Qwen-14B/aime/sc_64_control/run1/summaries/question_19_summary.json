      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nIt says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.\n\nHmm, right. So, triangle ABC with some specific centers and properties. I remember that the circumradius R is 13, inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. Interesting condition. \n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, they're different points unless the triangle is equilateral, which it probably isn't here since R and r are different.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from incenter I to circumcenter O. That's an interesting condition. I don't recall a standard formula for that. Maybe I can derive some relations using coordinate geometry or vector methods.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula or relation involving the distance between O and I, and the sides of the triangle. I remember that the distance between O and I is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that formula. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me compute that with R=13 and r=6.\n\nSo, OI\u00b2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 -12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). That's useful.\n\nSo, we have that OI is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, which means their dot product is zero. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to make things simpler. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a vector from I to O, which is just the position vector of O since I is at the origin.\n\nSo, if I place I at (0,0), then O is at some point (h, k), such that the line OI is from (0,0) to (h,k). Now, IA is the line from I(0,0) to A(x,y). The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nSo, the vector IA is (x, y) and the vector OI is (h, k). Their dot product must be zero: x*h + y*k =0.\n\nBut I also know that O is the circumcenter, so it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The circumradius is the distance from O to any vertex, so OA = OB = OC =13.\n\nSince I is the inradius center, the inradius is 6. The formula for the inradius is r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nBut maybe I can find the sides AB, BC, AC in terms of other variables. Wait, the problem asks for AB*AC. Maybe I can find AB and AC individually or find a relation between them.\n\nWait, let's consider the formula involving OI, R, r, and maybe the angles of the triangle. Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. For example, IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, the distance from O to A is the circumradius, which is 13.\n\nWait, so IA is the length from inradius to A, which is r / sin(A/2). But wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe we can use some right triangle properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector algebra. Let me think: Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular.\n\nLet me denote vector IA as A (since I is at origin), and vector OI as O. Then, their dot product is A \u00b7 O =0.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius vector, so |OA|=13. So, the length of vector O is 13. Wait, no, OA is the vector from O to A, which is the same as vector A - O. Wait, maybe I should get this straight.\n\nWait, I placed I at origin, so position vectors of A, B, C, O are all relative to I. So O is at (h,k), and A is at (x,y). So OA vector is (x - h, y - k), and its length is 13.\n\nWait, but I is the inradius at (0,0). So, the distance from O to I is sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(13), as we found earlier.\n\nSo, we have that (x*h + y*k) =0 because IA is perpendicular to OI.\n\nAlso, the distance from O to A is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (y -k)^2 ) =13.\n\nHmm. Also, I is the inradius, so the distance from I to each side is 6. But perhaps that's more complicated to use in this coordinate system.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the triangle's sides and use trigonometric identities.\n\nLet me recall that in any triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2), IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, the distance from the circumradius O to A is R =13, which is the same as OA=13.\n\nWait, but OA is the length from O to A, which is 13, given.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is sqrt(13). So, perhaps in triangle IOA, which is a right triangle, we can apply Pythagoras.\n\nWait, let me consider triangle IOA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWait, OA is 13, IO is sqrt(13), so OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2=169. IO\u00b2 is 13, IA\u00b2 is ?\n\nSo, 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 =156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, IA = 2*sqrt(39). But I also know that IA = r / sin(A/2) =6 / sin(A/2). So,\n\n2*sqrt(39) =6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, sin(A/2) =6 / (2*sqrt(39)) )= 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nWait, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nThen, cos(A/2) can be found as sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169))= sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nNow, in a triangle, we have the formula that relates the sides with the inradius and semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nBut maybe it's better to relate the sides using the formulae involving angles. Let me think about the Law of Sines and Cosines.\n\nWait, the Law of Sines says that a=2R sin A, where a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, no: actually, Law of Sines is a/(sin A) = 2R. So, a=2R sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b=2R sin B, c=2R sin C.\n\nBut we're interested in AB*AC. AB is side c, AC is side b. Because in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So, AB is c, AC is b. So, AB*AC = b*c.\n\nSo, we need to find b*c.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express b and c in terms of angles. Since b=2R sin B, c=2R sin C. So, b*c=4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I need to find sin B and sin C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this product in terms of other known quantities. Let me think.\n\nWait, I also know that in any triangle, angles A + B + C = 180 degrees, so B + C = 180 - A.\n\nAlso, the inradius formula is r = (a + b - c)/2 * tan(A/2), but I might be mixing things up. Wait, let's think about the formula for the inradius.\n\nWait, the formula is r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nBut I don't know the sides yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the product b*c.\n\nWait, from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut I don't know a yet. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express b*c in terms of other known variables.\n\nWait, another approach: Using formulae involving exradii or other triangle centers? Not sure.\n\nWait, I found sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, and cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13.\n\nAlso, I know that in a triangle, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). Wait, no, that's the double-angle formula. Wait, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). So, sin(A/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos A)/2 ).\n\nWait, but I already have sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, so let's compute cos A.\n\ncos A = 1 - 2*( (sqrt(39)/13)^2 )= 1 - 2*(39/169)= 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169=91/169=7*13/(13\u00b2)=7/13.\n\nWait, so cos A =7/13.\n\nThen, from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, b, or c yet.\n\nWait, but I also know that the area can be expressed in terms of inradius: Area = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed using sides and angles: Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo, equate these two expressions:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = r*s.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (1/2)*b*c*sin A = r*(a + b + c)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nb*c*sin A = r*(a + b + c).\n\nHmm, but I don't know a, b, c yet.\n\nBut I also know from the Law of Sines that a=2R sin A, b=2R sin B, c=2R sin C.\n\nSo, a=2*13*sin A=26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, the semiperimeter s=(a +b +c)/2=13*(sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nThen, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*26 sin B *26 sin C * sin A= (1/2)*676 sin A sin B sin C= 338 sin A sin B sin C.\n\nBut area is also r*s=6*13*(sin A + sin B + sin C)=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nTherefore, 338 sin A sin B sin C=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, this might not be the easiest way. Let me see if I can find another relation.\n\nWait, I also know that angle A is known in terms of cos A=7/13. So, sin A can be found.\n\nSince cos A=7/13, then sin A= sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2 )=sqrt(1 -49/169)=sqrt(120/169)=sqrt(120)/13=2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nSo, sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nAlso, angles B and C are related since A + B + C=180\u00b0, so B + C = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nLet me denote angle B as \u03b2, angle C as \u03b3.\n\nSo, \u03b2 + \u03b3 = 180\u00b0 - A.\n\nWe can write that sin B sin C = [cos(\u03b2 - \u03b3) - cos(\u03b2 + \u03b3)] / 2.\n\nBut since \u03b2 + \u03b3 = 180\u00b0 - A, cos(\u03b2 + \u03b3) = cos(180\u00b0 - A)= -cos A= -7/13.\n\nAlso, sin B sin C = [cos(\u03b2 - \u03b3) - (-7/13)] /2 = [cos(\u03b2 - \u03b3) +7/13]/2.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle ABC, the product bc can be expressed in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, since I know R=13, from the Law of Sines, a=2R sin A=26*(2\u221a30/13)=4\u221a30.\n\nWait, wait, sin A=2\u221a30/13, so a=26*(2\u221a30/13)=2*2\u221a30=4\u221a30.\n\nSo, side a is 4\u221a30. So, a\u00b2= (4\u221a30)^2=16*30=480.\n\nHmm, so a\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, from earlier, Law of Cosines: a\u00b2= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, but I need to find bc. Let me denote bc =k. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)k.\n\nBut I don't know b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Hmm.\n\nWait, from the Law of Sines, since a=4\u221a30, and a=2R sin A=26 sin A, which we already used.\n\nAlso, from Law of Sines, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, bc= (26 sin B)(26 sin C)=676 sin B sin C.\n\nWait, but earlier we have that in the area expression, 338 sin A sin B sin C=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nSo, 338 sin A sin B sin C=78 (sin A + sin B + sin C).\n\nLet me plug sin A=2\u221a30/13 into this.\n\nSo, 338*(2\u221a30/13) sin B sin C =78*(2\u221a30/13 + sin B + sin C).\n\nSimplify:\n\n338 * 2\u221a30 /13 * sin B sin C =78*(2\u221a30/13 + sin B + sin C).\n\nCompute 338/13=26, so left side becomes 26*2\u221a30 sin B sin C=52\u221a30 sin B sin C.\n\nRight side: 78/13 =6, so 6*(2\u221a30 +13 sin B +13 sin C )=12\u221a30 +78 sin B +78 sin C.\n\nWait, but 78*(2\u221a30/13 + sin B + sin C) = 78*(2\u221a30)/13 +78 sin B +78 sin C= (78/13)*2\u221a30 +78 sin B +78 sin C=6*2\u221a30 +78 sin B +78 sin C=12\u221a30 +78 (sin B + sin C).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n52\u221a30 sin B sin C=12\u221a30 +78 (sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can factor out 13 from the coefficients.\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\n4\u221a30 sin B sin C= (12\u221a30)/13 +6 (sin B + sin C).\n\nWait, 12\u221a30 /13 is a bit messy. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, another thought: Since I have a\u00b2=480, and I need to find bc.\n\nAlso, I know that in any triangle, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(bc + ac + ab).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area in another way.\n\nArea= r*s=6*s.\n\nBut s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, Area= (1/2)*b*c*sin A= (1/2)*k*(2\u221a30/13).\n\nWait, so (1/2)*k*(2\u221a30/13)=6*s.\n\nSo, (k * \u221a30)/13=6*s.\n\nBut s=(a + b + c)/2=(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, (k\u221a30)/13=6*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2=3*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nSo, (k\u221a30)/13=12\u221a30 +3b +3c.\n\nHmm, but I don't know b + c either. This is getting tangled.\n\nWait, but from the Law of Sines, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, b + c=26(sin B + sin C).\n\nSo, 3b +3c=78(sin B + sin C).\n\nSo, our equation becomes:\n\n(k\u221a30)/13=12\u221a30 +78(sin B + sin C).\n\nBut k= bc=676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, plug that in:\n\n(676 sin B sin C * \u221a30)/13=12\u221a30 +78(sin B + sin C).\n\nSimplify 676/13=52.\n\nSo, 52 sin B sin C \u221a30=12\u221a30 +78(sin B + sin C).\n\nHmm, let's divide both sides by \u221a30 to make it simpler.\n\n52 sin B sin C=12 +78 (sin B + sin C)/\u221a30.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I can factor out 52 and 78.\n\nWait, 52=4*13, 78=6*13.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote x= sin B and y= sin C.\n\nThen, since B + C=180\u00b0 - A, which is 180\u00b0 - arccos(7/13). So, the sum is known, but not sure if that's useful.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n52 xy=12 +78 (x + y)/\u221a30.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should think about another approach.\n\nWait, maybe using the formula for distance between O and I again.\n\nWe had OI\u00b2= R(R - 2r)=13*(13 -12)=13, so OI=\u221a13.\n\nWe had triangle IOA being right-angled at I, with OA=13, OI=\u221a13, IA=\u221a(13\u00b2 - (\u221a13)^2)=\u221a(169-13)=\u221a156=2\u221a39, as we had before.\n\nBut IA=2\u221a39, and we also have IA= r / sin(A/2)=6/sin(A/2)=2\u221a39, so sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13.\n\nWait, which is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another formula: In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA= sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2 ), where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. I think that's a formula for the length of the angle bisector, but maybe it's different.\n\nWait, actually, another formula: IA= (r)/sin(A/2). Which we used earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, IA can also be expressed as IA= 2R sin(B/2) sin(C/2). Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps we can relate this to other triangle quantities. Let's think about the formula for the product bc.\n\nWait, from the Law of Cosines, a\u00b2= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nWe have a\u00b2=480, so:\n\n480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13).\n\nSo, 480= (b + c)^2 - 2bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, because b\u00b2 + c\u00b2= (b + c)^2 - 2bc.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n480= (b + c)^2 - 2bc - (14/13) bc.\n\nCombine the bc terms:\n\n-2bc - (14/13) bc= - (26/13 +14/13) bc= -40/13 bc.\n\nSo,\n\n480= (b + c)^2 - (40/13) bc.\n\nHmm, but I don't know b + c or bc. So, this equation introduces another variable.\n\nWait, but from the area expressions, we had:\n\nArea= (1/2) bc sin A=6*s.\n\nWhere s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nWe can write:\n\n(1/2) bc sin A=6*(a + b + c)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2) bc sin A=3(a + b + c).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nbc sin A=6(a + b + c).\n\nWe know sin A=2\u221a30/13, a=4\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\nbc*(2\u221a30/13)=6*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nbc*2\u221a30=6*13*(4\u221a30 + b + c)=78*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nbc*2=78*(4 + (b + c)/\u221a30).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the Law of Sines. Since a=4\u221a30, and a=2R sin A=26 sin A.\n\nWe have sin A=2\u221a30/13, which is correct because (2\u221a30/13)^2= (4*30)/169=120/169, which is less than 1, so that's valid.\n\nSo, angle A is known in terms of its sine and cosine.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c in terms of angles B and C.\n\nSince a=4\u221a30, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nAnd since B + C=180\u00b0 - A, which we can write as angle sum.\n\nLet me denote angle A as \u03b1, so \u03b1=arccos(7/13).\n\nThen, B + C=\u03c0 - \u03b1.\n\nSo, let me consider using the formula for the product bc.\n\nFrom Law of Sines, bc= (26 sin B)(26 sin C)=676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, bc=676 sin B sin C.\n\nBut, in triangle ABC, angles B and C satisfy B + C=\u03c0 - \u03b1.\n\nSo, using the sine of sum:\n\nsin(B + C)=sin(\u03c0 - \u03b1)=sin \u03b1.\n\nBut sin(B + C)=sin \u03c0 - sin C cos B + cos C sin B= no, wait, sin(B + C)=sin B cos C + cos B sin C= sin(\u03c0 - A)=sin A.\n\nSo, sin B cos C + cos B sin C= sin A.\n\nBut I don't see how that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps using the product-to-sum formula: sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)]/2.\n\nBut B + C= \u03c0 - A, so cos(B + C)=cos(\u03c0 - A)= -cos A= -7/13.\n\nSo, sin B sin C= [cos(B - C) +7/13]/2.\n\nSo, bc=676 sin B sin C=676*[cos(B - C) +7/13]/2= 338 [cos(B - C) +7/13].\n\nHmm, but I don't know cos(B - C). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for cos(B - C):\n\ncos(B - C)= (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nWait, that's from the Law of Cosines for angle B - C, but I'm not sure if that's a standard formula.\n\nWait, no, the Law of Cosines for angle B is:\n\ncos B= (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac).\n\nSimilarly, cos C= (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab).\n\nSo, cos(B - C)= cos B cos C + sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I don't know cos B or cos C individually, but maybe I can express them in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, from Law of Cosines:\n\ncos B=(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac).\n\nSimilarly, cos C=(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab).\n\nSo, cos(B - C)= [ (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac) ] * [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab) ] + [ sin B sin C ].\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but from earlier, we have that 480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=480 + (14/13) bc.\n\nSo, let me denote bc=k. Then, b\u00b2 + c\u00b2=480 + (14/13)k.\n\nSo, let's write cos(B - C):\n\ncos(B - C)= [ (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac) ] * [ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab) ] + [ sin B sin C ].\n\nWait, but this seems really complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the fact that in triangle ABC, if I can express bc in terms of known quantities, that would solve the problem.\n\nWait, from the area formula, we have (1/2) bc sin A=6*s.\n\nWe have s=(a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, 6*s=3(a + b + c).\n\nSo, (1/2) bc sin A=6*s => bc sin A=12*s.\n\nBut s=(a + b + c)/2, so bc sin A=6(a + b + c).\n\nWe have bc sin A=6(a + b + c).\n\nWe know a=4\u221a30, sin A=2\u221a30/13.\n\nSo, bc*(2\u221a30/13)=6*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nbc*2\u221a30=6*13*(4\u221a30 + b + c)=78*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nbc*2=78*(4 + (b + c)/\u221a30).\n\nHmm, this seems tricky because we have bc and b + c in the same equation.\n\nWait, let me denote bc=k and b + c=m.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) From Law of Cosines:\n\n480= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13)k.\n\nBut b\u00b2 + c\u00b2= (b + c)^2 - 2k= m\u00b2 - 2k.\n\nSo, 480= m\u00b2 -2k - (14/13)k = m\u00b2 - (2 +14/13)k = m\u00b2 - (30/13)k.\n\nSo, equation (1): m\u00b2 - (30/13)k=480.\n\n2) From the area expression:\n\nk*2\u221a30/13=6*(4\u221a30 + m).\n\nSo, (2\u221a30/13)k=24\u221a30 +6m.\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\n2\u221a30 k= 312\u221a30 +78m.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\n2k=312 +78m/\u221a30.\n\nHmm, 78m/\u221a30 can be simplified.\n\n78/\u221a30= (78\u221a30)/30=13\u221a30/5.\n\nSo, 2k=312 + (13\u221a30/5) m.\n\nBut this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should think about another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the formula for OI.\n\nWe had OI\u00b2= R(R - 2r)=13*(13 -12)=13.\n\nSo, OI=\u221a13.\n\nWe have IA perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, OA\u00b2=OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWhich we used to find IA=2\u221a39.\n\nWait, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the incenter I at (0,0). Let me place point O at (h,k), so that OI is the vector (h,k). IA is the vector from I(0,0) to A(x,y), which is (x,y). The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero: xh + yk=0.\n\nSince O is the circumradius center, the distance from O to A is 13, so sqrt( (x-h)^2 + (y -k)^2 )=13.\n\nWe also know that OI=\u221a13, so sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)=\u221a13 => h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=13.\n\nWe can write these as:\n\n1. xh + yk=0.\n\n2. (x - h)^2 + (y -k)^2=169.\n\n3. h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=13.\n\nHmm, but that's three equations with four variables (x,y,h,k). Not enough.\n\nBut perhaps we can find more relations.\n\nSince I is the inradius, the coordinates of A, B, C must satisfy the condition that the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6. But that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to set up coordinates such that point A is on the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place point I at (0,0), and point A at (d,0), so that IA is along the x-axis. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is from (0,0) to (h,k), then OI must be vertical or horizontal? Wait, no: IA is along x-axis, so OI must be perpendicular, which would be along y-axis.\n\nWait, if IA is along x-axis and is perpendicular to OI, then OI must be along y-axis. So, point O is at (0, t), since it's along the y-axis. So, O is at (0, t), and since OI is from (0,0) to (0,t), the distance is |t|=\u221a13, so t=\u221a13 or -\u221a13. Let's take t=\u221a13 for simplicity, so O is at (0,\u221a13).\n\nWait, that's a good idea. So, O is at (0,\u221a13), I is at (0,0), and A is at (d,0). So, IA is from (0,0) to (d,0), which is along the x-axis, and OI is from (0,0) to (0,\u221a13), which is along the y-axis. So, IA is perpendicular to OI, which satisfies the given condition.\n\nSo, now, point A is at (d,0), O is at (0,\u221a13). The distance OA is 13, so the distance between (d,0) and (0,\u221a13) is 13.\n\nSo, sqrt( (d - 0)^2 + (0 - \u221a13)^2 )=13.\n\nSo, sqrt(d\u00b2 +13)=13.\n\nSquare both sides: d\u00b2 +13=169 => d\u00b2=156 => d=\u221a156=2\u221a39.\n\nSo, point A is at (2\u221a39, 0).\n\nHmm, that's a good setup.\n\nNow, let me recall that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6. Let me find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nLet me denote points B and C as (e,f) and (g,h), but perhaps it's better to exploit some symmetry.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, since I is at (0,0) and O is at (0,\u221a13), and A is at (2\u221a39,0), perhaps triangle ABC is such that BC is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. So, B and C could be mirror images across the y-axis. So, if B is at (p,q), then C is at (-p,q). Would that make sense?\n\nWait, let me check. If BC is symmetric across the y-axis, then the midpoint of BC is on the y-axis, which would be (0, q'), so the incenter I is at (0,0), so that would fit if the triangle is symmetric across the y-axis. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nSo, let's assume that B is at (p, q) and C is at (-p, q). That makes BC symmetric across the y-axis.\n\nSo, the sides AB and AC can be found using the coordinates.\n\nPoint A is at (2\u221a39,0), point B is at (p,q), point C is at (-p,q).\n\nSo, AB is the distance between (2\u221a39,0) and (p,q): sqrt( (2\u221a39 -p)^2 + (0 - q)^2 ).\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between (2\u221a39,0) and (-p,q): sqrt( (2\u221a39 +p)^2 + q\u00b2 ).\n\nThe product AB*AC is then sqrt( (2\u221a39 -p)^2 + q\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (2\u221a39 +p)^2 + q\u00b2 ).\n\nHmm, that seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.\n\nWait, let me compute AB\u00b2 * AC\u00b2 first.\n\nAB\u00b2= (2\u221a39 - p)^2 + q\u00b2.\n\nAC\u00b2= (2\u221a39 + p)^2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 * AC\u00b2= [ (2\u221a39 - p)^2 + q\u00b2 ][ (2\u221a39 + p)^2 + q\u00b2 ].\n\nLet me denote u=2\u221a39. So, AB\u00b2= (u - p)^2 + q\u00b2, AC\u00b2= (u + p)^2 + q\u00b2.\n\nSo, AB\u00b2 * AC\u00b2= [ (u - p)^2 + q\u00b2 ][ (u + p)^2 + q\u00b2 ].\n\nLet me expand this product:\n\n= [ (u\u00b2 - 2u p + p\u00b2) + q\u00b2 ] * [ (u\u00b2 + 2u p + p\u00b2) + q\u00b2 ]\n\n= [ (u\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - 2u p) ] * [ (u\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2u p) ]\n\nThis is of the form (M - N)(M + N)=M\u00b2 - N\u00b2, where M= u\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, N=2u p.\n\nSo,\n\n= (u\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)^2 - (2u p)^2.\n\n= (u\u00b2 + p\u00b2 + q\u00b2)^2 -4u\u00b2 p\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's a bit better.\n\nBut I don't know u, p, q. Let me think about what else I know.\n\nWe know that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I(0,0) to each side is 6.\n\nSince I is the inradius center, in this coordinate system, the distance from (0,0) to side BC, side AB, and side AC is 6.\n\nBut in this setup, since BC is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, the equations of AB and AC can be determined.\n\nWait, the sides AB and AC meet at A(2\u221a39,0), and BC is the line joining B(p,q) and C(-p,q), which is horizontal if q is same for both.\n\nWait, no, because points B and C are at (p,q) and (-p,q), so the line BC is the horizontal line y=q, connecting (p,q) to (-p,q).\n\nWait, so line BC is horizontal, at y=q.\n\nSo, the distance from I(0,0) to line BC is |q|, because line BC is y=q. The distance from (0,0) to this line is |q|. So, since the inradius is 6, |q|=6. So, q=6 or q=-6.\n\nBut since point A is at (2\u221a39, 0), which is on the x-axis, and the inradius is inside the triangle, q must be positive, because the inradius is above the x-axis. So, q=6.\n\nSo, point B is at (p,6), point C is at (-p,6).\n\nNow, line BC is y=6, from (-p,6) to (p,6). So, the length of BC is 2p.\n\nHmm, but we can also compute BC using the Law of Sines or other relations.\n\nWait, from Law of Sines, a= BC=2p, since B is at (p,6) and C is at (-p,6). So, BC=2p.\n\nEarlier, I found that a=4\u221a30. So, 2p=4\u221a30 => p=2\u221a30.\n\nSo, p=2\u221a30. So, points B and C are at (2\u221a30,6) and (-2\u221a30,6).\n\nNow, let me compute AB and AC.\n\nPoint A is at (2\u221a39,0), point B is at (2\u221a30,6).\n\nSo, AB= sqrt( (2\u221a39 - 2\u221a30)^2 + (0 -6)^2 ).\n\nSimilarly, AC= sqrt( (2\u221a39 + 2\u221a30)^2 + (0 -6)^2 ).\n\nSo, AB= sqrt( [2(\u221a39 -\u221a30)]^2 +36 )=sqrt(4*(\u221a39 -\u221a30)^2 +36).\n\nSimilarly, AC= sqrt( [2(\u221a39 +\u221a30)]^2 +36 )=sqrt(4*(\u221a39 +\u221a30)^2 +36).\n\nLet me compute AB*AC.\n\nAB*AC= sqrt(4*(\u221a39 -\u221a30)^2 +36) * sqrt(4*(\u221a39 +\u221a30)^2 +36).\n\nLet me compute each term inside the square roots.\n\nFirst term inside AB's sqrt:\n\n4*(\u221a39 -\u221a30)^2 +36.\n\n=4*(39 +30 -2\u221a(39*30)) +36.\n\n=4*(69 - 2\u221a1170) +36.\n\n=276 -8\u221a1170 +36.\n\n=312 -8\u221a1170.\n\nSimilarly, for AC's sqrt:\n\n4*(\u221a39 +\u221a30)^2 +36.\n\n=4*(39 +30 +2\u221a(39*30)) +36.\n\n=4*(69 +2\u221a1170) +36.\n\n=276 +8\u221a1170 +36.\n\n=312 +8\u221a1170.\n\nSo, AB*AC= sqrt(312 -8\u221a1170) * sqrt(312 +8\u221a1170).\n\nThis is of the form sqrt(M - N) * sqrt(M + N)=sqrt(M\u00b2 - N\u00b2).\n\nSo, M=312, N=8\u221a1170.\n\nSo, AB*AC= sqrt(312\u00b2 - (8\u221a1170)^2 ).\n\nCompute 312\u00b2: 312*312. Let's compute that.\n\n312 * 312:\n\nCompute 300\u00b2=90000.\n\nCompute 12\u00b2=144.\n\nCompute 2*300*12=7200.\n\nSo, (300+12)^2=300\u00b2 +2*300*12 +12\u00b2=90000 +7200 +144=97344.\n\nSo, 312\u00b2=97344.\n\nNow, compute (8\u221a1170)^2=64*1170=64*(1000 +170)=64000 + 64*170.\n\nCompute 64*170: 64*100=6400, 64*70=4480. So, 6400 +4480=10880.\n\nSo, 64*1170=64000 +10880=74880.\n\nSo, AB*AC= sqrt(97344 -74880)=sqrt(22464).\n\nSimplify sqrt(22464).\n\nLet me factor 22464.\n\nDivide by 16: 22464/16=1404.\n\n1404 divided by 4=351.\n\n351=3*117=3*3*39=3*3*3*13.\n\nSo, 22464=16*1404=16*4*351=16*4*3*3*3*13.\n\nSo, sqrt(22464)=sqrt(16*4*3^3*13)=4*2*3*sqrt(3*13)=8*3*sqrt(39)=24\u221a39.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nsqrt(16*4*3^3*13)=sqrt(16)*sqrt(4)*sqrt(3^3)*sqrt(13)=4*2*3*sqrt(3)*sqrt(13)=8*3*sqrt(39)=24\u221a39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, AB*AC=24\u221a39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit big, but let me see:\n\nWe had AB*AC= sqrt( (312 -8\u221a1170)(312 +8\u221a1170) )=sqrt(312\u00b2 - (8\u221a1170)^2 )=sqrt(97344 -74880)=sqrt(22464)=24\u221a39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 24\u221a39.\n\nBut let me check for any miscalculations in the steps.\n\nWait, when I computed BC as 2p, I got a=4\u221a30, so 2p=4\u221a30 \u21d2 p=2\u221a30. Correct.\n\nThen, the coordinates of B and C are (2\u221a30,6) and (-2\u221a30,6).\n\nThen, AB is from (2\u221a39,0) to (2\u221a30,6).\n\nSo, AB\u00b2= (2\u221a39 -2\u221a30)^2 +6\u00b2.\n\n= [2(\u221a39 -\u221a30)]\u00b2 +36=4*(\u221a39 -\u221a30)^2 +36.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2= [2(\u221a39 +\u221a30)]\u00b2 +36=4*(\u221a39 +\u221a30)^2 +36.\n\nThen, AB*AC= sqrt(4*(\u221a39 -\u221a30)^2 +36) * sqrt(4*(\u221a39 +\u221a30)^2 +36).\n\nWhich when expanded gives sqrt(312 -8\u221a1170) * sqrt(312 +8\u221a1170)=sqrt(312\u00b2 - (8\u221a1170)^2 ).\n\nWhich is sqrt(97344 -74880)=sqrt(22464)=24\u221a39.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 24\u221a39.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \\( R = 13 \\) and the inradius \\( r = 6 \\). The condition \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\) implies that triangle \\( IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). Using the formula for the distance between the circumcenter and incenter, we find:\n\n\\[\nOI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\triangle IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\), we apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nOA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThe length \\( IA \\) can also be expressed as \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Equating the two expressions for \\( IA \\):\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}.\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we find \\( \\cos(A/2) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(A/2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13} \\). Using the double-angle formula for cosine:\n\n\\[\n\\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{78}{169} = \\frac{91}{169} = \\frac{7}{13}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the Law of Cosines to find side \\( a \\) (opposite angle \\( A \\)):\n\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A.\n\\]\n\nWe also know \\( a = 2R \\sin A \\). Since \\( \\cos A = \\frac{7}{13} \\), we find \\( \\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 A} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\na = 2 \\times 13 \\times \\frac{2\\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\\sqrt{30}.\n\\]\n\nUsing coordinate geometry, we place the incenter \\( I \\) at \\( (0,0) \\) and the circumcenter \\( O \\) at \\( (0, \\sqrt{13}) \\). Point \\( A \\) is at \\( (2\\sqrt{39}, 0) \\), and points \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are symmetric with respect to the y-axis at \\( (2\\sqrt{30}, 6) \\) and \\( (-2\\sqrt{30}, 6) \\), respectively.\n\nFinally, we calculate \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\):\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{39} - 2\\sqrt{30})^2 + 6^2}, \\quad AC = \\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{39} + 2\\sqrt{30})^2 + 6^2}.\n\\]\n\nThe product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nAB \\cdot AC = \\sqrt{(312 - 8\\sqrt{1170})(312 + 8\\sqrt{1170})} = \\sqrt{312^2 - (8\\sqrt{1170})^2} = \\sqrt{22464} = 24\\sqrt{39}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24\\sqrt{39}}\n\\]",
