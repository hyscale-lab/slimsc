      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. \n\nGiven that SA = 54 and V = 23, I can write two equations:\n\n1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \u2192 lw + lh + wh = 27\n2. lwh = 23\n\nI need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the box entirely. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere will be half of that, so r = d/2. So, r\u00b2 would be (l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2)/4.\n\nSo, my goal is to minimize r\u00b2, which is equivalent to minimizing (l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Therefore, I need to find the minimum value of l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 given the constraints lw + lh + wh = 27 and lwh = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that for such problems, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used, but maybe I can approach it using algebraic manipulations or inequalities.\n\nI recall that for positive real numbers, the Arithmetic Mean is greater than or equal to the Geometric Mean (AM \u2265 GM). Maybe I can apply that here somehow.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I can express l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 in terms of (l + w + h)\u00b2. Because (l + w + h)\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 + 2(lw + lh + wh). Since I know lw + lh + wh =27, this becomes (l + w + h)\u00b2 = l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 + 54. So, l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = (l + w + h)\u00b2 - 54.\n\nTherefore, to minimize l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2, I need to minimize (l + w + h)\u00b2. So, the problem reduces to minimizing l + w + h given that lw + lh + wh =27 and lwh=23.\n\nWait, but how do I minimize l + w + h with those constraints? Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.\n\nLet me set up the function to minimize: f(l, w, h) = l + w + h.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\ng(l, w, h) = lw + lh + wh - 27 = 0\nh(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0\n\nSo, I'll set up the Lagrangian function:\n\nL = l + w + h + \u03bb1(lw + lh + wh -27) + \u03bb2(lwh -23)\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and setting them to zero:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202l = 1 + \u03bb1(w + h) + \u03bb2(wh) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202w = 1 + \u03bb1(l + h) + \u03bb2(lh) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202h = 1 + \u03bb1(l + w) + \u03bb2(lw) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb1 = lw + lh + wh -27 = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb2 = lwh -23 = 0\n\nHmm, so the first three equations are:\n\n1 + \u03bb1(w + h) + \u03bb2(wh) = 0  -- (1)\n1 + \u03bb1(l + h) + \u03bb2(lh) = 0  -- (2)\n1 + \u03bb1(l + w) + \u03bb2(lw) = 0  -- (3)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n[1 + \u03bb1(l + h) + \u03bb2(lh)] - [1 + \u03bb1(w + h) + \u03bb2(wh)] = 0\nSimplify: \u03bb1(l + h - w - h) + \u03bb2(lh - wh) = 0\nWhich becomes: \u03bb1(l - w) + \u03bb2 h (l - w) = 0\nFactor out (l - w): (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 h)(l - w) = 0\n\nSo either l = w or \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 h = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n[1 + \u03bb1(l + w) + \u03bb2(lw)] - [1 + \u03bb1(l + h) + \u03bb2(lh)] = 0\nSimplify: \u03bb1(w - h) + \u03bb2 l (w - h) = 0\nFactor out (w - h): (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 l)(w - h) = 0\n\nSo either w = h or \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 l = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n[1 + \u03bb1(l + w) + \u03bb2(lw)] - [1 + \u03bb1(w + h) + \u03bb2(wh)] = 0\nSimplify: \u03bb1(l - h) + \u03bb2 w (l - h) = 0\nFactor out (l - h): (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 w)(l - h) = 0\n\nSo either l = h or \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 w = 0.\n\nNow, if l = w, and from another equation, perhaps w = h, which would imply l = w = h. But that would mean the box is a cube. But wait, let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf l = w = h, then the surface area would be 2(3l\u00b2) = 6l\u00b2 =54 \u2192 l\u00b2=9 \u2192 l=3. Then the volume would be l\u00b3=27, but the volume given is 23, which is less than 27. So the cube is not a solution here. Hence, our assumption that l=w=h is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the other possibility is that \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 h =0, \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 l =0, and \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 w =0.\n\nWait, if \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 h = 0 and \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 l = 0, then:\n\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 h = 0\n\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 l = 0\nSubtracting these: \u03bb2 (h - l) = 0\n\nSo either \u03bb2 =0 or h = l.\n\nIf \u03bb2 =0, then from equation (1): 1 + \u03bb1(w + h) =0, and similar equations. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nIf \u03bb2=0, then equations (1), (2), (3) become:\n\n1 + \u03bb1(w + h) =0 \u2192 \u03bb1 = -1/(w + h)\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03bb1(l + h) =0 \u2192 \u03bb1 = -1/(l + h)\nAnd 1 + \u03bb1(l + w) =0 \u2192 \u03bb1 = -1/(l + w)\n\nSo, -1/(w + h) = -1/(l + h) = -1/(l + w)\n\nWhich implies that w + h = l + h \u2192 w = l\n\nSimilarly, l + h = l + w \u2192 h = w\n\nSo l = w = h, which as before, leads to a cube, which doesn't satisfy the volume constraint. So \u03bb2 cannot be zero.\n\nTherefore, the other option is that h = l, w = l, so l = w = h. But as we saw, that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps only two variables are equal? Let me consider l = w \u2260 h.\n\nIf l = w, then let me substitute into the constraints.\n\nSo, l = w.\n\nThen, the surface area equation becomes 2(l\u00b2 + 2lh) =54 \u2192 l\u00b2 + 2lh =27.\n\nThe volume is l\u00b2 h =23.\n\nSo, from volume: h = 23/(l\u00b2)\n\nSubstitute into surface area:\n\nl\u00b2 + 2l*(23/(l\u00b2)) =27 \u2192 l\u00b2 + (46)/l =27\n\nMultiply both sides by l: l\u00b3 +46 =27 l \u2192 l\u00b3 -27 l +46 =0\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation: l\u00b3 -27 l +46=0.\n\nLet me try possible integer roots. The possible roots are factors of 46: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting l=2: 8 -54 +46= 0 \u2192 8-54= -46; -46 +46=0. So l=2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor out (l -2):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide l\u00b3 -27 l +46 by (l -2).\n\nCoefficients: 1 (l\u00b3), 0 (l\u00b2), -27 (l), 46.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 2: 2.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.\n\nMultiply by2:4.\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -27+4= -23.\n\nMultiply by2: -46.\n\nAdd to last coefficient:46 + (-46)=0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (l-2)(l\u00b2 +2l -23)=0.\n\nSo, the other roots are solutions to l\u00b2 +2l -23=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: l = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6).\n\nSince lengths can't be negative, l = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 +4.898 \u22483.898.\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions: l=2, and l\u22483.898.\n\nSo, when l=2, then h=23/(l\u00b2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nSo, the box dimensions would be l=w=2, h=5.75.\n\nCompute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 +5.75\u00b2 =4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625.\n\nWhich is 41.0625. Let me write that as a fraction: 5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)\u00b2 is 529/16.\n\nSo, 4 +4 +529/16 = 8 + 529/16 = (128 +529)/16=657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nAlternatively, when l= -1 +2\u221a6, which is approximately 3.898, then h=23/(l\u00b2).\n\nBut perhaps this leads to a larger l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2? Let me check.\n\nBut first, let me see if l=2 gives the minimal l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2. Because in the other case, where l= -1 +2\u221a6, which is about 3.898, which is larger than 2, so maybe l\u00b2 is bigger, but h would be smaller.\n\nWait, l=3.898, so h=23/(3.898)^2 \u224823/(15.19)\u22481.515.\n\nSo l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2= 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.515)^2\u2248 2*(15.19) +2.296\u224830.38 +2.296\u224832.676, which is much smaller than 41.0625.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the minimal value.\n\nWait, but hold on. When l= -1 +2\u221a6, then since l=w, we have l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, and h=23/(l\u00b2).\n\nSo let me compute l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2.\n\nSince l=w, so 2l\u00b2 + h\u00b2.\n\nCompute l:\n\nl= -1 +2\u221a6 \u2248-1 +4.898\u22483.898.\n\nBut let's compute l\u00b2:\n\nl= -1 +2\u221a6, so l\u00b2= (-1)^2 + (2\u221a6)^2 + 2*(-1)(2\u221a6)=1 +24 -4\u221a6=25 -4\u221a6.\n\nSo, l\u00b2=25 -4\u221a6.\n\nThen, h=23/(l\u00b2)=23/(25 -4\u221a6).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nh=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[(25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2]=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify 23/529=1/23.\n\nSo, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nNow, compute h\u00b2:\n\nh\u00b2=(25 +4\u221a6)^2 / (23)^2 = (625 + 200\u221a6 + 96)/529 = (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 2l\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 2*(25 -4\u221a6) + (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute each term.\n\nWait, 2l\u00b2 =2*(25 -4\u221a6)=50 -8\u221a6.\n\nh\u00b2=(721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 =50 -8\u221a6 + (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nTo combine these, let's write 50 as 50*(529)/529=26450/529.\n\nSimilarly, -8\u221a6= -8\u221a6*(529)/529= (-4232\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= [26450 -4232\u221a6 +721 +200\u221a6]/529.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n26450 +721=27171.\n\n-4232\u221a6 +200\u221a6= (-4032\u221a6).\n\nSo, numerator is 27171 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nHmm, but is this the minimal value? Because when l=2, it was 657/16\u224841.0625, but this is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529\u2248(27171 -4032*2.449)/529\u2248(27171 -9878)/529\u224817293/529\u224832.676.\n\nSo, 32.676 is smaller than 41.0625. Therefore, this is the minimal value.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because in the first case, l=2, w=2, h=23/4=5.75, which gives a larger space diagonal, but in the second case, the space diagonal is smaller.\n\nBut the problem is that we have two different cases when solving the cubic equation. When l=2, we get a solution, but when l= -1 +2\u221a6, which is about 3.898, we get another solution which might give a smaller sum of squares.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of symmetric variables. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote x = l, y=w, z=h.\n\nWe have:\n\nxy + xz + yz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nWe need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nWe know that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.\n\nSo, to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to minimize (x + y + z)^2.\n\nSo, let me denote S =x + y + z. So, we need to minimize S\u00b2, which is equivalent to minimizing S.\n\nGiven that xy + yz + xz=27 and xyz=23.\n\nI remember that for three variables, the minimal sum occurs when the variables are equal, but in this case, they can't be equal because it leads to a cube which doesn't satisfy the volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the inequality between symmetric sums.\n\nI know that for positive real numbers, (x + y + z)^3 \u2265 27xyz, which is AM \u2265 GM.\n\nSo, S^3 \u226527*23 \u2192 S^3 \u2265621 \u2192 S \u2265 cube root of 621\u22488.52.\n\nBut this is just a lower bound. The actual minimal S might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the method of substitution.\n\nSince we have three variables, maybe we can express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet me solve for z from the volume equation: z=23/(xy).\n\nSubstitute into the surface area equation:\n\nxy + x*(23/(xy)) + y*(23/(xy)) =27\n\nSimplify: xy + (23/y) + (23/x) =27.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of x and y.\n\nBut maybe it's better to use Lagrange multipliers again.\n\nWait, earlier, we saw that if l=w, then we can get a valid solution. But perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily l=w=h.\n\nWait, in the earlier case, when l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, and h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23, that gives a lower sum of squares.\n\nSo, perhaps that is indeed the minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily when all three are equal.\n\nSo, let me proceed with the case when l=w. Then, we have l=w, so as above.\n\nSo, l=w, and h=23/l\u00b2.\n\nSurface area equation: 2(l\u00b2 + 2lh)=54 \u2192 l\u00b2 + 2lh=27.\n\nSubstituting h=23/l\u00b2:\n\nl\u00b2 + 2l*(23/l\u00b2)=27 \u2192 l\u00b2 + 46/l=27.\n\nMultiply both sides by l: l\u00b3 +46=27 l \u2192 l\u00b3 -27 l +46=0.\n\nAs above, l=2 is a root, so we can factor it as (l-2)(l\u00b2 +2 l -23)=0.\n\nThus, l=2 or l= [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2= (-2 \u00b1sqrt(96))/2= (-2 \u00b14\u221a6)/2= -1 \u00b12\u221a6.\n\nSo, l must be positive, so l= -1 +2\u221a6\u22483.898.\n\nSo, in this case, l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, h=23/(l\u00b2)= (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nSo, then l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2=2l\u00b2 +h\u00b2.\n\nEarlier, we found l\u00b2=25 -4\u221a6, so 2l\u00b2=50 -8\u221a6.\n\nh\u00b2= (25 +4\u221a6)^2 /23\u00b2= (625 + 200\u221a6 +96)/529= (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2=50 -8\u221a6 + (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nTo combine these, let's write 50 as 50*529/529=26450/529.\n\nSimilarly, -8\u221a6= -8\u221a6*529/529= -4232\u221a6/529.\n\nSo, total sum is:\n\n(26450 -4232\u221a6 +721 +200\u221a6)/529= (26450 +721) + (-4232\u221a6 +200\u221a6) all over 529.\n\nWhich is 27171 -4032\u221a6 over 529.\n\nSo, 27171 -4032\u221a6 is the numerator.\n\nBut let me check if this can be simplified.\n\nWait, 27171 divided by 529: 529*51=26979. 27171-26979=192. So 27171=529*51 +192.\n\nSimilarly, 4032 divided by 529: 529*7=3703. 4032-3703=329. So, 4032=529*7 +329.\n\nBut I don't see a clear factor here. So perhaps that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute h\u00b2:\n\nh= (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nSo, h\u00b2= (25 +4\u221a6)^2 /23\u00b2= (625 + 200\u221a6 + 96)/529= (721 +200\u221a6)/529. That's correct.\n\nAnd 2l\u00b2=2*(25 -4\u221a6)=50 -8\u221a6.\n\nSo, 50 -8\u221a6 + (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nWait, but 50 is 50/1, so to add it to 721/529, we need a common denominator.\n\nSimilarly, -8\u221a6 is -8\u221a6/1, and 200\u221a6/529.\n\nSo, let me write all terms over 529.\n\nSo, 50=50*(529)/529=26450/529.\n\nSimilarly, -8\u221a6= -8\u221a6*(529)/529= (-4232\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, adding all terms:\n\n26450/529 +721/529 + (-4232\u221a6)/529 +200\u221a6/529.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(26450 +721) /529 + (-4232\u221a6 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nWhich is:\n\n27171/529 + (-4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, the total is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal value? Because when l=w=2, h=23/4=5.75, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625\u224841.0625, which is 657/16=41.0625.\n\nBut 657/16 is approximately 41.0625, whereas (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529\u2248(27171 -4032*2.449)/529\u2248(27171 -9878)/529\u224817293/529\u224832.676, which is smaller.\n\nSo, this suggests that the minimal sum of squares is achieved when l=w= -1 +2\u221a6\u22483.898, h\u22481.515.\n\nTherefore, the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, r\u00b2=(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/4= [ (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529 ] /4= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nSo, r\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut I need to express this as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime.\n\nWait, but 27171 and 4032\u221a6 are separate terms. Hmm, but I can't combine them because one is a multiple of \u221a6 and the other isn't. Wait, but the problem says r\u00b2 is equal to p/q, which is a fraction. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the minimal sphere enclosing the box must have a radius equal to half the space diagonal. So, the space diagonal is sqrt(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2). So, r= sqrt(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/2, so r\u00b2=(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/4.\n\nSo, if I can find the minimal value of (l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2), then I can compute r\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to minimize l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nLet me think in terms of variables.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1. xy + yz + zx=27\n2. xyz=23\n\nWe can think of this as a system where we have three variables and two equations, so perhaps we can express two variables in terms of the third.\n\nLet me let z=23/(xy).\n\nThen, substitute into the first equation:\n\nxy + x*(23/(xy)) + y*(23/(xy))=27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nxy + 23/y +23/x=27.\n\nMultiply both sides by xy to eliminate denominators:\n\n(xy)^2 +23x +23y=27xy.\n\nRearranged: (xy)^2 -27xy +23x +23y=0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let u =x + y and v=xy.\n\nThen, from the first equation: v + 23*(x + y)/v =27 \u2192 v +23u/v=27.\n\nMultiply both sides by v: v\u00b2 +23u=27v.\n\nSo, v\u00b2 -27v +23u=0.\n\nBut we need another equation relating u and v.\n\nWe know that u=x + y and v=xy.\n\nBut without another equation, perhaps it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the minimal value of l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 as a function subject to the constraints and use Lagrange multipliers.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nWe have (l + w + h)^2 \u22643(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2). But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the inequality that relates the sum of squares to the product.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that for positive real numbers, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 \u2265 (l +w +h)^2 /3.\n\nBut again, not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution.\n\nLet me consider the case when two variables are equal, as before.\n\nSo, let l=w, then h=23/(l\u00b2).\n\nThen, the surface area equation gives:\n\nl\u00b2 + 2lh=27 \u2192 l\u00b2 + 2l*(23/l\u00b2)=27 \u2192 l\u00b2 +46/l=27.\n\nMultiply both sides by l: l\u00b3 -27l +46=0.\n\nWe found that l=2 is a root, so we can factor it as (l-2)(l\u00b2 +2l -23)=0.\n\nThus, l=2 or l=(-2 +sqrt(96))/2= -1 +2\u221a6\u22483.898.\n\nSo, the two possible solutions are l=2 and l= -1 +2\u221a6.\n\nWhen l=2, h=23/4=5.75.\n\nWhen l= -1 +2\u221a6, h=23/( (-1 +2\u221a6)^2 ).\n\nCompute (-1 +2\u221a6)^2=1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6.\n\nSo, h=23/(25 -4\u221a6).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nh=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[(25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2]=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify: 23/529=1/23, so h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nSo, now, for each case, compute l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2.\n\nCase 1: l=w=2, h=23/4.\n\nl\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nCase 2: l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nCompute l\u00b2= (-1 +2\u221a6)^2=1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2=2*(25 -4\u221a6) + [(25 +4\u221a6)^2]/(23)^2.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n2*(25 -4\u221a6)=50 -8\u221a6.\n\n(25 +4\u221a6)^2=625 + 200\u221a6 +96=721 +200\u221a6.\n\nSo, h\u00b2=(721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, total sum: 50 -8\u221a6 + (721 +200\u221a6)/529.\n\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\n50=50*(529)/529=26450/529.\n\n-8\u221a6= -8\u221a6*(529)/529= -4232\u221a6/529.\n\nSo, total sum:\n\n(26450 -4232\u221a6 +721 +200\u221a6)/529= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529\u224832.676.\n\nWhich is smaller than the first case.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, r\u00b2=(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/4= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that r\u00b2 can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. However, in this expression, we have a term with \u221a6, which is irrational. So, this suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect, or perhaps I need to rationalize or find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. Maybe the minimal occurs when all variables are different. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, another thought: Since the problem asks for r\u00b2, which is (l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/4, perhaps I can find the minimal value of l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 as a function of the given constraints.\n\nWait, let me consider that l, w, h are positive real numbers. Let me set up the problem as minimizing f(l, w, h)=l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 subject to g(l, w, h)=2(lw + lh + wh)=54 and h(l, w, h)=lwh=23.\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb \u2207g + \u03bc \u2207h.\n\nCompute gradients.\n\n\u2207f=(2l, 2w, 2h).\n\n\u2207g=(2(w + h), 2(l + h), 2(l + w)).\n\n\u2207h=(wh, lh, lw).\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n2l = \u03bb*2(w + h) + \u03bc*(wh) \u2192 2l = 2\u03bb(w + h) + \u03bc wh.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2w = 2\u03bb(l + h) + \u03bc lh.\n\n2h = 2\u03bb(l + w) + \u03bc lw.\n\nPlus the constraints:\n\n2(lw + lh + wh)=54 \u2192 lw + lh + wh=27.\n\nlwh=23.\n\nSo, from the first three equations:\n\nDivide each by 2:\n\nl = \u03bb(w + h) + (\u03bc/2) wh.\n\nw = \u03bb(l + h) + (\u03bc/2) lh.\n\nh = \u03bb(l + w) + (\u03bc/2) lw.\n\nLet me denote (\u03bc/2) as \u03bd for simplicity.\n\nSo,\n\nl = \u03bb(w + h) + \u03bd wh. -- (1)\n\nw = \u03bb(l + h) + \u03bd lh. -- (2)\n\nh = \u03bb(l + w) + \u03bd lw. -- (3)\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nw - l = \u03bb(l + h - w - h) + \u03bd(lh - wh).\n\nSimplify: w - l = \u03bb(l - w) + \u03bd h (l - w).\n\nFactor out (l - w):\n\nw - l = (\u03bb + \u03bd h)(l - w).\n\nWhich is: -(l -w)= (\u03bb + \u03bd h)(l -w).\n\nAssuming l \u2260 w, we can divide both sides by (l -w):\n\n-1=\u03bb + \u03bd h. \u2192 \u03bb + \u03bd h = -1. -- (4)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\nh - w = \u03bb(l + w - l - h) + \u03bd(lw - lh).\n\nSimplify: h -w= \u03bb(w - h) + \u03bd l(w -h).\n\nFactor out (w -h):\n\nh -w= (\u03bb + \u03bd l)(w -h).\n\nWhich is: -(w -h)= (\u03bb + \u03bd l)(w -h).\n\nAssuming w \u2260 h, divide both sides:\n\n-1=\u03bb + \u03bd l \u2192 \u03bb + \u03bd l = -1. -- (5)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\nh - l = \u03bb(l + w - w - h) + \u03bd(lw - wh).\n\nSimplify: h - l= \u03bb(l - h) + \u03bd w (l - h).\n\nFactor out (l -h):\n\nh - l= (\u03bb + \u03bd w)(l -h).\n\nWhich is: -(l -h)= (\u03bb + \u03bd w)(l -h).\n\nAssuming l \u2260h, divide both sides:\n\n-1=\u03bb + \u03bd w \u2192 \u03bb + \u03bd w = -1. -- (6)\n\nSo now, from equations (4), (5), (6):\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd h = -1.\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd l = -1.\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd w = -1.\n\nSubtracting the first two equations:\n\n(\u03bb + \u03bd l) - (\u03bb + \u03bd h)=0 \u2192 \u03bd(l -h)=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the first and third:\n\n\u03bd(w -h)=0.\n\nSo, either \u03bd=0 or l=h and w=h.\n\nIf \u03bd=0, then from equation (4): \u03bb= -1.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1): l= -1*(w + h) +0 \u2192 l= -w -h.\n\nBut l, w, h are positive, so l= -w -h would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, \u03bd\u22600.\n\nThus, l=h and w=h, which implies l=w=h.\n\nBut as before, this leads to a cube, which doesn't satisfy the volume constraint.\n\nWait, but if l=w=h, then from the surface area: 6l\u00b2=54 \u2192 l\u00b2=9 \u2192 l=3.\n\nThen, volume would be 27, which is more than 23. So, it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that our assumption that l\u2260w, etc., is wrong, meaning that perhaps two variables are equal, but not all three.\n\nWait, but earlier when we assumed l=w, we found a valid solution. So, perhaps in that case, the minimal occurs when l=w.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is indeed (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut then, r\u00b2=(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2)/4= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut this expression has \u221a6 in it, which is irrational, but the problem states that r\u00b2 is p/q, a rational number. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is a cube, but that doesn't satisfy the volume. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can express l, w, h in terms of the roots of a cubic equation.\n\nLet me consider that l, w, h are the roots of the cubic equation t\u00b3 - At\u00b2 + Bt -C=0, where A=l +w +h, B= lw + lh + wh=27, C=lwh=23.\n\nSo, the cubic equation is t\u00b3 - A t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nWe need to find the minimal A such that this cubic has three positive real roots.\n\nThe minimal A would correspond to the minimal sum l +w +h, which in turn corresponds to the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal A?\n\nI know that for a cubic with three positive real roots, certain conditions must hold, such as the discriminant being positive.\n\nThe discriminant D of the cubic equation t\u00b3 +pt\u00b2 +qt +r=0 is D=18pqr -4p\u00b3r +p\u00b2q\u00b2 -4q\u00b3 -27r\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, the cubic is t\u00b3 - A t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nSo, p=-A, q=27, r=-23.\n\nPlugging into the discriminant formula:\n\nD=18*(-A)*27*(-23) -4*(-A)^3*(-23) + (-A)^2*(27)^2 -4*(27)^3 -27*(-23)^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 18*(-A)*27*(-23)=18*A*27*23.\n\n18*27=486, 486*23=11178. So, first term=11178 A.\n\nSecond term: -4*(-A)^3*(-23)= -4*(-A\u00b3)*(-23)= -4*A\u00b3*23= -92 A\u00b3.\n\nThird term: (-A)^2*(27)^2= A\u00b2 *729=729 A\u00b2.\n\nFourth term: -4*(27)^3= -4*19683= -78732.\n\nFifth term: -27*(-23)^2= -27*529= -14283.\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\nD=11178 A -92 A\u00b3 +729 A\u00b2 -78732 -14283.\n\nSimplify:\n\nD= -92 A\u00b3 +729 A\u00b2 +11178 A - (78732 +14283)= -92 A\u00b3 +729 A\u00b2 +11178 A -93015.\n\nFor the cubic to have three real roots, the discriminant must be positive.\n\nSo, we need D>0.\n\nBut solving this inequality for A is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal sum occurs when two variables are equal, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved when l=w, which gives A=2l +h.\n\nFrom earlier, when l= -1 +2\u221a6\u22483.898, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23\u22481.515.\n\nSo, A=2l +h\u22482*3.898 +1.515\u22487.796 +1.515\u22489.311.\n\nAlternatively, when l=2, h=5.75, A=2*2 +5.75=4 +5.75=9.75.\n\nSo, the minimal A is approximately9.311, which is less than9.75.\n\nBut how does this help me? Well, the minimal A is achieved when l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nThus, the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut the problem is that this expression has \u221a6, which is irrational, but r\u00b2 is supposed to be a rational number p/q.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sphere enclosing the box doesn't necessarily require the box to have two equal sides. Maybe the minimal occurs when the box is a cube, but that doesn't fit the volume. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: The space diagonal is sqrt(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2). To minimize the sphere's radius, I need to minimize the space diagonal. So, minimize sqrt(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2).\n\nBut I need to minimize l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 given the constraints lw + lh + wh=27 and lwh=23.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution again.\n\nLet me consider that l, w, h are the roots of the cubic equation t\u00b3 - At\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nTo minimize A, which is l +w +h.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality that relates the sum of squares to the sum and product.\n\nWe know that:\n\n(l +w +h)^2 = l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 + 2(lw + lh + wh).\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 = (l +w +h)^2 - 2*27= S\u00b2 -54, where S=l +w +h.\n\nSo, to minimize l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2, we need to minimize S\u00b2.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to minimizing S, given that lwh=23 and lw + lh + wh=27.\n\nThis is similar to finding the minimal perimeter of a box with given surface area and volume.\n\nI think in such optimization problems, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as we considered earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal S is indeed when l=w= -1 +2\u221a6, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23, giving S=2l +h=2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nWait, compute S:\n\n2*(-1 +2\u221a6)= -2 +4\u221a6.\n\nAdding (25 +4\u221a6)/23:\n\nS= -2 +4\u221a6 +25/23 + (4\u221a6)/23.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-2 +25/23= (-46/23 +25/23)= (-21/23).\n\n4\u221a6 + (4\u221a6)/23= (92\u221a6 +4\u221a6)/23=96\u221a6/23.\n\nSo, S= (-21/23) + (96\u221a6)/23= (96\u221a6 -21)/23.\n\nThus, S\u00b2= [(96\u221a6 -21)/23]^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(96\u221a6 -21)^2= (96\u221a6)^2 -2*96\u221a6*21 +21\u00b2= 96\u00b2*6 - 4032\u221a6 +441.\n\n96\u00b2=9216, so 9216*6=55296.\n\nThus, numerator=55296 -4032\u221a6 +441=55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut earlier, we had l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= S\u00b2 -54= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529 -54.\n\nCompute 54 as 54*529/529=28626/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28626)/529= (27111 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nWait, earlier I had (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529, but this is (27111 -4032\u221a6)/529. There's a discrepancy in the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let's recalculate S\u00b2:\n\nS= (96\u221a6 -21)/23.\n\nSo, S\u00b2= (96\u221a6 -21)^2 /23\u00b2= (96\u221a6)^2 -2*96\u221a6*21 +21\u00b2 all over 529.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(96\u221a6)^2=96\u00b2 *6=9216*6=55296.\n\n-2*96\u221a6*21= -4032\u221a6.\n\n21\u00b2=441.\n\nSo, numerator=55296 -4032\u221a6 +441=55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nThus, S\u00b2= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThen, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= S\u00b2 -54= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529 -54.\n\nConvert 54 to 54*529/529=28626/529.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28626)/529= (27111 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nWait, earlier I had 27171, which is different. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier calculations.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nEarlier, when l= -1 +2\u221a6, h=(25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nThen, S=2l +h=2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nCompute 2*(-1 +2\u221a6)= -2 +4\u221a6.\n\nThen, add (25 +4\u221a6)/23:\n\nSo, -2 +4\u221a6 +25/23 +4\u221a6/23.\n\nConvert -2 to -46/23.\n\nSo, -46/23 +25/23= (-21)/23.\n\nSimilarly, 4\u221a6=92\u221a6/23.\n\nSo, 92\u221a6/23 +4\u221a6/23=96\u221a6/23.\n\nThus, S= (-21 +96\u221a6)/23.\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2= [(-21 +96\u221a6)/23]^2= (96\u221a6 -21)^2 /529= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= S\u00b2 -54= (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529 -54= (55737 -4032\u221a6 -54*529)/529.\n\nCompute 54*529:\n\n529*50=26450, 529*4=2116 \u2192 26450+2116=28566.\n\nSo, 54*529=28566.\n\nThus, numerator=55737 -4032\u221a6 -28566=27171 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I had 27171, but in this calculation, I got 27111. Wait, no, wait, in this case, it's 55737 -28566=27171. So, the correct numerator is 27171 -4032\u221a6.\n\nSo, l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, r\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut this still has \u221a6 in it, which is irrational. However, the problem states that r\u00b2 is a rational number p/q.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my assumption that two variables are equal is incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are equal, but that leads to a cube which doesn't satisfy the volume constraint.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal sphere is determined not by the space diagonal, but by some other measure, but that doesn't make sense because the space diagonal is the maximum distance in the box, so the sphere must have a diameter at least equal to that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal enclosing sphere is determined by the farthest points of the box, which would indeed be the space diagonal.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is indeed (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116, but expressed as p/q where p and q are coprime.\n\nWait, but 27171 and 4032 have a common factor.\n\nCompute GCD of 27171 and 4032.\n\nCompute GCD(27171,4032):\n\n27171 \u00f74032=6, remainder 27171 -6*4032=27171-24192=2979.\n\nNow, GCD(4032,2979).\n\n4032 \u00f72979=1, remainder 4032-2979=1053.\n\nGCD(2979,1053).\n\n2979 \u00f71053=2, remainder 2979-2106=873.\n\nGCD(1053,873).\n\n1053 \u00f7873=1, remainder 180.\n\nGCD(873,180).\n\n873 \u00f7180=4, remainder 873-720=153.\n\nGCD(180,153).\n\n180 \u00f7153=1, remainder 27.\n\nGCD(153,27).\n\n153 \u00f727=5, remainder 18.\n\nGCD(27,18).\n\n27 \u00f718=1, remainder 9.\n\nGCD(18,9)=9.\n\nSo, GCD is 9.\n\nTherefore, 27171=9*3019.\n\n4032=9*448.\n\nSo, (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116=9*(3019 -448\u221a6)/2116.\n\nSimplify 9 and 2116: 2116=46\u00b2=4*115=4*5*23.\n\nSo, 9 and 2116 are coprime? 2116 \u00f79=235.111..., so no common factors.\n\nWait, 2116=4*529=4*23\u00b2.\n\nSo, 9 and 2116 have no common factors, so the fraction is 9*(3019 -448\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut this still has \u221a6, which is irrational, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the minimal enclosing sphere doesn't require the box to be axis-aligned. But the problem says \"rectangular boxes\", which are axis-aligned, so the sphere must enclose the box with edges aligned with the axes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sphere must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is indeed (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116, but expressed as p/q.\n\nBut since this has \u221a6, it can't be expressed as a rational number. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal occurs when the box is a cube, but that doesn't satisfy the volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the minimal enclosing sphere is determined by the maximum distance between any two vertices of the box, which is the space diagonal.\n\nSo, the radius is half the space diagonal.\n\nThus, to minimize r, I need to minimize the space diagonal, which is sqrt(l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2).\n\nGiven the constraints lw + lh + wh=27 and lwh=23.\n\nBut I need to find the minimal value of l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.\n\nWe know that l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 \u2265 (l +w +h)^2 /3.\n\nBut I also have that (l +w +h)^3 \u226527 lwh=27*23=621.\n\nSo, (l +w +h)^3 \u2265621 \u2192 l +w +h \u2265 cube root of 621\u22488.52.\n\nBut this is just a lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me denote x=l, y=w, z=h.\n\nWe have:\n\nxy + yz + zx=27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nWe need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but perhaps I can find a relationship between the variables.\n\nFrom the earlier equations, we have:\n\nFrom the partial derivatives, we had:\n\nl = \u03bb(w + h) + \u03bd wh.\n\nw = \u03bb(l + h) + \u03bd lh.\n\nh = \u03bb(l + w) + \u03bd lw.\n\nSubtracting the first two equations:\n\nw - l = \u03bb(w - l) + \u03bd h (w - l).\n\nIf w \u2260 l, we can divide both sides by (w - l):\n\n1 = \u03bb + \u03bd h.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the first and third:\n\nh - l = \u03bb(h - l) + \u03bd w (h - l).\n\nIf h \u2260 l, divide by (h - l):\n\n1=\u03bb + \u03bd w.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the second and third:\n\nh - w=\u03bb(h -w) + \u03bd l (h -w).\n\nIf h\u2260w, divide by (h -w):\n\n1=\u03bb + \u03bd l.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd h=1,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd w=1,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bd l=1.\n\nSubtracting the first two equations:\n\n\u03bd (h -w)=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the first and third:\n\n\u03bd (h -l)=0.\n\nAnd subtracting the second and third:\n\n\u03bd (w -l)=0.\n\nThus, either \u03bd=0 or h=w=l.\n\nIf \u03bd=0, then from \u03bb +0=1 \u2192 \u03bb=1.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\nl=1*(w + h) +0 \u2192 l=w +h.\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\nw=1*(l + h) +0 \u2192 w=l +h.\n\nBut from equation (1), l=w +h, and from equation (2), w=l +h.\n\nSubstituting l from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\nw= (w +h) +h \u2192 w=w +2h \u2192 0=2h \u2192 h=0.\n\nBut h=0 is impossible for a box. Thus, \u03bd\u22600.\n\nTherefore, h=w=l.\n\nBut as before, this leads to a cube, which doesn't satisfy the volume constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nThus, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as we considered earlier.\n\nTherefore, the minimal l\u00b2 +w\u00b2 +h\u00b2 is (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529, and r\u00b2= (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut since this is irrational, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rationalize differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express r\u00b2 as (27171 -4032\u221a6)/2116.\n\nBut 27171 and 4032 are both divisible by 9, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, 27171=9*3019,\n\n4032=9*448,\n\n2116=4*529=4*23\u00b2.\n\nSo, r\u00b2=9*(3019 -448\u221a6)/(4*529)= (9/4)*(3019 -448\u221a6)/529.\n\nBut 3019 and 448 may have common factors.\n\nCompute GCD(3019,448):\n\n3019 \u00f7448=6, remainder 3019-6*448=3019-2688=331.\n\nGCD(448,331).\n\n448 \u00f7331=1, remainder 117.\n\nGCD(331,117).\n\n331 \u00f7117=2, remainder 331-234=97.\n\nGCD(117,97).\n\n117 \u00f797=1, remainder 20.\n\nGCD(97,20).\n\n97 \u00f720=4, remainder 17.\n\nGCD(20,17).\n\n20 \u00f717=1, remainder 3.\n\nGCD(17,3).\n\n17 \u00f73=5, remainder 2.\n\nGCD(3,2).\n\n3 \u00f72=1, remainder 1.\n\nGCD(2,1)=1.\n\nThus, GCD is 1.

Let me assume that w= l*r, h= l*r\u00b2.\n\nThen, the surface area:\n\n2(lw + lh + wh)=2(l*(l r) + l*(l r\u00b2) + (l r)*(l r\u00b2))=2(l\u00b2 r + l\u00b2 r\u00b2 + l\u00b2 r\u00b3)=2 l\u00b2(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)=54.\n\nVolume: l*(l r)*(l r\u00b2)=l\u00b3 r\u00b3=23.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n2 l\u00b2 (r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)=54 \u2192 l\u00b2 (r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)=27.\n\nAnd l\u00b3 r\u00b3=23.\n\nLet me express l\u00b2 from the first equation: l\u00b2=27/(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3).\n\nThen, l\u00b3= l * l\u00b2= l * [27/(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)].\n\nBut l\u00b3 r\u00b3=23 \u2192 l\u00b3=23/(r\u00b3).\n\nSo, equate:\n\nl * [27/(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)]=23/(r\u00b3).\n\nSolve for l:\n\nl= [23/(r\u00b3)] / [27/(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)] =23*(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)/(27 r\u00b3).\n\nBut l must be positive.\n\nThus, l=23*(1 + r + r\u00b2)/(27 r\u00b3).\n\nNow, express l\u00b2= [23\u00b2*(1 + r + r\u00b2)^2]/(27\u00b2 r^6).\n\nBut from earlier, l\u00b2=27/(r + r\u00b2 + r\u00b3)=27/(r(1 + r + r\u00b2)).\n\nThus,\n\n[23\u00b2*(1 + r + r\u00b2)^2]/(27\u00b2 r^6)=27/(r(1 + r + r\u00b2)).\n\nMultiply both sides by r^6 (1 + r + r\u00b2):\n\n23\u00b2*(1 + r + r\u00b2)^3=27^3 r^5.\n\nCompute 23\u00b2=529, 27\u00b3=19683.\n\nSo, 529*(1 + r + r\u00b2)^3=19683 r^5.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps I can find a value of r that satisfies this equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps r=1, but that would lead to a cube, which doesn't satisfy the volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps r=\u221asomething.\n\nBut this seems too involved.

Maybe the minimal occurs when all variables are different, but I can't find a way to calculate that.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll have to proceed with the answer I have.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the radius squared (\\(r^2\\)) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) with surface area 54 and volume 23. The radius of the sphere is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to minimize the space diagonal, which is equivalent to minimizing \\(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\\).\n\nGiven:\n1. Surface area: \\(2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \\Rightarrow lw + lh + wh = 27\\)\n2. Volume: \\(lwh = 23\\)\n\nWe aim to minimize \\(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\\). Using the identity \\((l + w + h)^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2(lw + lh + wh)\\), we have:\n\\[ l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = (l + w + h)^2 - 54 \\]\n\nThus, minimizing \\(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\\) is equivalent to minimizing \\((l + w + h)^2\\). We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the critical points under the constraints \\(lw + lh + wh = 27\\) and \\(lwh = 23\\).\n\nAfter solving the system of equations derived from the Lagrange multipliers method, we find that the minimal value occurs when two variables are equal, say \\(l = w\\). Substituting \\(l = w\\) into the constraints, we solve the cubic equation:\n\\[ l^3 - 27l + 46 = 0 \\]\nThe real root is \\(l = 2\\), leading to \\(h = \\frac{23}{4}\\). However, this does not yield the minimal value. Instead, solving the cubic equation gives another root \\(l = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6}\\), leading to \\(h = \\frac{25 + 4\\sqrt{6}}{23}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\\) for these values:\n\\[ l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 2(25 - 4\\sqrt{6}) + \\left(\\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6}}{529}\\right) = \\frac{27171 - 4032\\sqrt{6}}{529} \\]\n\nThus, the radius squared is:\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}{4} = \\frac{27171 - 4032\\sqrt{6}}{2116} \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem states \\(r^2\\) is rational, there must be an error in the approach. Despite extensive calculations, the result remains irrational, indicating a possible mistake in the method or assumptions. Given the constraints and the problem's requirements, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{27171 - 4032\\sqrt{6}}{2116}}",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, we have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n\nAlright, so I think this involves optimizing the size of the sphere that can contain any rectangular box with the given surface area and volume. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box would have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r would be half of that space diagonal.\n\nSo, first, let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area S and volume V of the box are given by:\n\nSurface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\nVolume: xyz = 23\n\nWe need to find the minimal radius r such that the sphere can contain the box, which means we need to minimize the space diagonal. The space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Therefore, the radius r would be d/2, so r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4. Therefore, to minimize r, we need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm. So, I need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with these two constraints. This seems like an optimization problem with constraints, so maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third using the given constraints and then find the minimum. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote the variables as x, y, z. Let's see if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nGiven that xyz = 23, perhaps I can express z as 23/(xy). Then, substitute this into the surface area equation.\n\nSo, surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\nSubstituting z = 23/(xy), we get:\n\n2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))) = 54\n\nSimplify each term inside the parentheses:\n\nFirst term: xy\nSecond term: y*(23/(xy)) = 23/x\nThird term: x*(23/(xy)) = 23/y\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2(xy + 23/x + 23/y) = 54\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nxy + 23/x + 23/y = 27\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can let u = x + y, and v = xy, but I'm not sure if that will help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make some symmetry assumption. Since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the minimal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs when x = y = z? Wait, but if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nIf x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x\u00b2 = 54, so x\u00b2 = 9, x = 3. Then, the volume would be x\u00b3 = 27. But the volume here is given as 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here. Therefore, the minimal diagonal might not occur at a cube, but perhaps the box is as close to a cube as possible given the constraints.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to find the dimensions x, y, z that satisfy both the surface area and volume constraints and minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. But since we have two constraints and three variables, that might be a bit involved.\n\nWait, let's think about using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We can set up the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nSo, the Lagrangian would be:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) - \u03bc(xyz - 23)\n\nThen, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them equal to zero, and solve.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(2y + 2z) - \u03bc(yz) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y - \u03bb(2x + 2z) - \u03bc(xz) = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 2z - \u03bb(2x + 2y) - \u03bc(xy) = 0\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\n1. 2x = \u03bb(2y + 2z) + \u03bc(yz)\n2. 2y = \u03bb(2x + 2z) + \u03bc(xz)\n3. 2z = \u03bb(2x + 2y) + \u03bc(xy)\n\nAlso, we have the constraints:\n\n4. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54\n5. xyz = 23\n\nHmm, that's a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, \u03bb, \u03bc.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or relations between x, y, z.\n\nSuppose that x = y. Let's see if that's possible. If x = y, then maybe the equations can be simplified.\n\nLet me assume x = y. Then, let's substitute y = x into the equations.\n\nSo, equations 1 and 2 become identical, so we only need to consider equation 1 and equation 3.\n\nEquation 1: 2x = \u03bb(2x + 2z) + \u03bc(x z)\nEquation 3: 2z = \u03bb(2x + 2x) + \u03bc(x\u00b2)\n\nSimplify equation 3:\n\n2z = \u03bb(4x) + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nEquation 1: 2x = \u03bb(2x + 2z) + \u03bc x z\n\nSo, let's write equation 1 as:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc x z\n\nSimilarly, equation 3 is:\n\n2z = 4\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nSo, maybe we can solve for \u03bb and \u03bc in terms of x and z.\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n2z = 4\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nLet me solve for \u03bc:\n\n\u03bc x\u00b2 = 2z - 4\u03bb x\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bc = (2z - 4\u03bb x) / x\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb(x + z) + \u03bc x z\n\nSubstitute \u03bc from above:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb(x + z) + [ (2z - 4\u03bb x) / x\u00b2 ] * x z\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb(x + z) + (2z - 4\u03bb x) * (z / x)\n\nSo, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 2\u03bb(x + z)\nSecond term: (2z - 4\u03bb x) * (z/x) = (2 z\u00b2 / x) - (4 \u03bb x z)/x = 2 z\u00b2 / x - 4 \u03bb z\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb(x + z) + 2 z\u00b2 / x - 4 \u03bb z\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nLeft side: 2x\n\nRight side: 2\u03bb x + 2\u03bb z + 2 z\u00b2 / x - 4 \u03bb z\n\nCombine the \u03bb terms:\n\n2\u03bb x + (2\u03bb z - 4 \u03bb z) = 2\u03bb x - 2 \u03bb z\n\nSo, right side becomes: 2\u03bb x - 2 \u03bb z + 2 z\u00b2 / x\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n2x = 2\u03bb x - 2 \u03bb z + 2 z\u00b2 / x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n2x - 2\u03bb x + 2 \u03bb z - 2 z\u00b2 / x = 0\n\nFactor terms:\n\n2x(1 - \u03bb) + 2 \u03bb z - 2 z\u00b2 / x = 0\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can factor 2 out:\n\n2[ x(1 - \u03bb) + \u03bb z - z\u00b2 / x ] = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx(1 - \u03bb) + \u03bb z - z\u00b2 / x = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:\n\nx\u00b2(1 - \u03bb) + \u03bb z x - z\u00b2 = 0\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I can express \u03bb from equation 3 and substitute back.\n\nFrom equation 3: 2z = 4\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nBut we have \u03bc expressed in terms of \u03bb and z earlier:\n\n\u03bc = (2z - 4\u03bb x)/x\u00b2\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express \u03bb from equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: 2z = 4\u03bb x + \u03bc x\u00b2\n\nLet me express \u03bb:\n\n4\u03bb x = 2z - \u03bc x\u00b2\n\u03bb = (2z - \u03bc x\u00b2)/(4x)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between x and z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume that x = y, but then z is different. Let me see if the constraints hold.\n\nIf x = y, then surface area is 2(x\u00b2 + 2x z) = 54\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 + 4x z = 54 => x\u00b2 + 2x z = 27\n\nVolume is x\u00b2 z = 23\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + 2x z = 27\n2. x\u00b2 z = 23\n\nLet me denote a = x\u00b2, then equation 1 becomes a + 2x z =27, equation 2 is a z =23.\n\nSo, from equation 2: z = 23/a\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\na + 2x*(23/a) =27\n\nSimplify:\n\na + (46 x)/a =27\n\nBut x is sqrt(a), since a =x\u00b2, so x= sqrt(a). Therefore, equation becomes:\n\na + (46 sqrt(a))/a =27\nSimplify:\n\na + 46 / sqrt(a) =27\n\nLet me set t = sqrt(a). So, t^2 = a.\n\nEquation becomes:\n\nt\u00b2 + 46 / t =27\n\nMultiply both sides by t:\n\nt\u00b3 +46 =27 t\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt\u00b3 -27 t +46 =0\n\nSo, now we have a cubic equation: t\u00b3 -27 t +46 =0\n\nLet me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nLet's test t=2:\n\n2\u00b3 -27*2 +46 =8 -54 +46= (8+46)-54=54-54=0. Yes, t=2 is a root.\n\nSo, we can factor (t-2) from the cubic:\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide t\u00b3 -27 t +46 by (t-2):\n\nCoefficients: 1 (t\u00b3), 0 (t\u00b2), -27 (t), 46 (constant)\n\nUsing synthetic division with t=2:\n\nBring down 1\n\nMultiply 1 by 2: 2, add to next coefficient: 0+2=2\n\nMultiply 2 by 2:4, add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23\n\nMultiply -23 by 2: -46, add to 46: 0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (t -2)(t\u00b2 +2t -23)=0\n\nThus, the roots are t=2, and t = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4 sqrt(6)]/2= -1 \u00b1 2 sqrt(6)\n\nSince t = sqrt(a) must be positive, we discard the negative roots. So, t=2 and t= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). Let's compute numerical values to see which is positive.\n\nsqrt(6) \u22482.449, so 2 sqrt(6)\u22484.898. So, -1 +4.898\u22483.898, which is positive. So, possible t=2 and t\u22483.898.\n\nSo, t=2: sqrt(a)=2 => a=4, so x\u00b2=4 =>x=2. Then, from equation 2: z=23/a=23/4=5.75.\n\nSo, dimensions would be x=y=2, z=5.75. Let's check surface area: 2(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75)=2*(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. Yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, for t= -1 +2 sqrt(6): sqrt(a)= -1 +2 sqrt(6), so a= ( -1 +2 sqrt(6) )\u00b2=1 -4 sqrt(6) +24=25 -4 sqrt(6). Then, z=23/a=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)). Hmm, that would be another solution.\n\nBut let's see, which solution gives a smaller x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nWait, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625.\n\nIn the other case, where t= -1 +2 sqrt(6), so x= sqrt(a)= sqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6)), which is approximately sqrt(25 -4*2.449)=sqrt(25 -9.796)=sqrt(15.204)=approx3.899.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, t is sqrt(a), so a= t\u00b2, which for t= -1 +2 sqrt(6), a= ( -1 +2 sqrt(6) )\u00b2=1 -4 sqrt(6) +24=25 -4 sqrt(6). So, x= sqrt(a)= sqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6)).\n\nThen, z=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)). Let's rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):\n\nz=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6)) / [ (25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2 ]=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625-96)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSimplify: 23/529 =1/23, so z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nSo, x= sqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6)), y=x, z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)) + [ (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).\n\nSecond, compute [ (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23 ]^2.\n\nLet me compute numerator squared: (25)^2 + 2*25*4 sqrt(6) + (4 sqrt(6))^2=625 +200 sqrt(6)+16*6=625 +200 sqrt(6)+96=721 +200 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, [ (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23 ]^2= (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSo, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Let me compute the numerical value to see which is smaller.\n\nFirst, the case where x=y=2, z=5.75: sum is 41.0625\u224841.0625.\n\nIn the other case, compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6))\u2248sqrt(25 -9.798)=sqrt(15.202)=\u22483.899. So, x\u22483.899.\n\nz=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23\u2248(25 +9.798)/23\u224834.798/23\u22481.513.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2\u2248(3.899)^2 + (3.899)^2 + (1.513)^2\u224815.202 +15.202 +2.289\u224832.693.\n\nWait, that's significantly smaller than 41.06. So, this suggests that when x=y=2, the sum is 41.06, but when x and y are approximately 3.899 and z\u22481.513, the sum is about 32.69, which is smaller. Therefore, the minimal sum occurs at the other root.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier step, when I assumed x=y, I found two possible solutions: one with x=y=2 and another with x=y\u22483.899, z\u22481.513.\n\nSo, the minimal sum is 32.69, but let's see exactly what it is.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs when x, y, z are all equal? But earlier, we saw that the cube isn't possible because the volume would be 27, which is higher than 23.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily when all three are equal. So, in this case, it seems that the minimal occurs when x=y\u22483.899, z\u22481.513.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to ensure that this is indeed the minimal. Because we only considered the case where x=y, but maybe the minimal occurs when all three variables are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, as we've found, but perhaps we can find a better minimal by allowing all variables to be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality or other inequalities to find the minimal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nLet me think. We have two constraints:\n\n1. 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 => xy + yz + zx=27\n2. xyz=23\n\nWe need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nI recall that for positive real numbers, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 >= (xy + yz + zx). So, since xy + yz + zx=27, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 >=27. But in our case, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is 32.69, which is larger than 27, so that's okay.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a better lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean.\n\nWait, perhaps not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 in terms of (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx). Since (x + y + z)^2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz +zx). So, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27= (x + y + z)^2 -54.\n\nSo, to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to minimize (x + y + z)^2. So, we can think of minimizing x + y + z.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the minimal value of x + y + z given that xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23, then I can find the minimal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the problem reduces to minimizing x + y + z.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y + z, P = xyz =23, and Q=xy + yz + zx=27.\n\nWe know from the theory of symmetric equations that for positive real numbers x, y, z, we have the inequality:\n\nS^3 >= 27 P\n\nWhich is from AM >= GM.\n\nSo, S^3 >= 27 *23 => S >= (27*23)^(1/3)= (621)^(1/3)\u22488.528.\n\nBut that's just a lower bound. Not sure if it's achievable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the inequality that relates S, Q, and P. For example, the inequality S^2 >= 3Q.\n\nWhich in this case would be S^2 >= 81 => S >=9.\n\nBut S is the sum x + y + z. So, the minimal S is 9, but when does equality hold? When x = y = z. But in our case, x=y=z isn't possible because the volume would be 27, which is more than 23. So, the minimal S must be greater than 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal S is achieved when two variables are equal, as we saw earlier.\n\nWait, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, the sum S=2+2+5.75=9.75, which is greater than 9.\n\nIn the other case, x=y\u22483.899, z\u22481.513, S\u22483.899 +3.899 +1.513\u22489.311, which is closer to 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal S is achieved when x and y are as close as possible to each other, but not equal, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the problem.\n\nLet me think. Since we have two constraints, perhaps I can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.\n\nLet me fix z, then express x and y in terms of z.\n\nGiven that xyz=23 => xy=23/z.\n\nAnd, from the surface area, xy + yz + zx=27 => (23/z) + z(x + y)=27.\n\nLet me denote x + y = a, and xy =23/z.\n\nThen, from the identity (x + y)^2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2xy, we can write x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2*(23/z).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= a\u00b2 - 46/z + z\u00b2.\n\nWe need to minimize this expression.\n\nBut I also have the equation from the surface area: (23/z) + z a =27 => z a =27 -23/z => a=(27 -23/z)/z=27/z -23/z\u00b2.\n\nSo, a=27/z -23/z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= a\u00b2 -46/z + z\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting a:\n\n= (27/z -23/z\u00b2)^2 -46/z + z\u00b2\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst, compute (27/z -23/z\u00b2)^2:\n\n= (27/z)^2 - 2*(27/z)*(23/z\u00b2) + (23/z\u00b2)^2\n= 729/z\u00b2 - (1242)/z\u00b3 + 529/z^4\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= [729/z\u00b2 -1242/z\u00b3 +529/z^4] -46/z + z\u00b2\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n= z\u00b2 +729/z\u00b2 -1242/z\u00b3 +529/z^4 -46/z\n\nSo, we can write this as:\n\nf(z) = z\u00b2 + (729)/z\u00b2 + (-1242)/z\u00b3 + (529)/z^4 -46/z\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(z) for z>0.\n\nThis seems quite complicated, but perhaps we can take the derivative of f(z) with respect to z, set it equal to zero, and solve for z.\n\nCompute f'(z):\n\nf'(z) = 2z + (729*2)/z\u00b3 + (-1242*3)/z^4 + (529*4)/z^5 -46/z\u00b2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n=2z + (1458)/z\u00b3 - (3726)/z^4 + (2116)/z^5 -46/z\u00b2\n\nSet f'(z)=0:\n\n2z + 1458/z\u00b3 -3726/z^4 +2116/z^5 -46/z\u00b2 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by z^5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n2z^6 +1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z +2116 -46 z\u00b3=0\n\nArrange in order:\n\n2z^6 -46 z\u00b3 +1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z +2116=0\n\nHmm, that's a sixth-degree polynomial. Solving this seems really challenging. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.\n\nLet me check for possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 2116 over factors of 2.\n\nFactors of 2116: 1, 2, 4, 23, 46, 92, 529, 1058, 2116.\n\nDivided by factors of 2: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b123, etc., divided by 1 or 2.\n\nLet me test z=2:\n\n2*(64) -46*(8) +1458*(4) -3726*(2) +2116\n\n=128 -368 +5832 -7452 +2116\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n128 -368 = -240\n\n-240 +5832=5592\n\n5592 -7452= -1860\n\n-1860 +2116=256\u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nTry z=1:\n\n2 -46 +1458 -3726 +2116=2 -46= -44; -44 +1458=1414; 1414 -3726= -2312; -2312 +2116= -196\u22600.\n\nz=4:\n\n2*4096=8192\n\n-46*(64)= -2944\n\n1458*(16)=23328\n\n-3726*4= -14904\n\n+2116\n\nSo,\n\n8192 -2944=5248\n\n5248 +23328=28576\n\n28576 -14904=13672\n\n13672 +2116=15788\u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nz=23: Seems too big, but let's see:\n\n2*(23)^6 -46*(23)^3 +1458*(23)^2 -3726*(23) +2116.\n\nThis is way too big, probably not zero.\n\nHow about z=1/2:\n\n2*(1/2)^6=2*(1/64)=1/32\n\n-46*(1/2)^3= -46*(1/8)= -23/4\n\n1458*(1/2)^2=1458*(1/4)=364.5\n\n-3726*(1/2)= -1863\n\n+2116\n\nSo,\n\n1/32 \u22480.03125\n\n-23/4= -5.75\n\n+364.5\n\n-1863\n\n+2116\n\nAdding up:\n\n0.03125 -5.75= -5.71875\n\n-5.71875 +364.5=358.78125\n\n358.78125 -1863= -1504.21875\n\n-1504.21875 +2116=611.78125\u22600\n\nNot zero.\n\nHmm, maybe z= sqrt(23/ something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps z is a root that can be expressed as a combination of sqrt terms. But this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can be done. Let me set w = z^3.\n\nWait, the equation is 2z^6 -46 z^3 +1458 z^2 -3726 z +2116=0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a quadratic in terms of z^3. Let me check:\n\n2z^6 -46 z^3 + ... Hmm, but the other terms are z^2, z, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution u = z^3. Then, z^6= u\u00b2, z^3=u. But then, the equation becomes:\n\n2u\u00b2 -46 u + ... Wait, the other terms are not in u, so that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the equation.\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n2z^6 -46 z\u00b3 +1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z +2116=0\n\nLet me factor out 2 from the first two terms:\n\n2(z^6 -23 z\u00b3) +1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z +2116=0\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms as (2z^6 -46 z\u00b3) + (1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z) +2116=0\n\nFactor 2z\u00b3 from first group: 2z\u00b3(z\u00b3 -23)\n\nFactor 1458 z from second group:1458 z(z - 2.555...) Hmm, but 3726 /1458= 3726 \u00f71458\u22482.556. Not a nice number.\n\nAlternatively, factor 1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z= z(1458 z -3726)= z*6(243 z -621)=6 z(81 z -207)\n\nWait, 1458=6*243, 3726=6*621.\n\nSo, 1458 z\u00b2 -3726 z=6 z(243 z -621)\n\nSimilarly, 2z^6 -46 z\u00b3=2 z\u00b3(z\u00b3 -23)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2 z\u00b3(z\u00b3 -23) +6 z(243 z -621) +2116=0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this polynomial is a multiple of (z - a)^2 or something similar, but without knowing a root, it's hard to factor.\n\nSince this approach seems too complicated, maybe I should try a different method.\n\nLet me go back to the Lagrange multipliers approach but assume that x, y, z are all different.\n\nWe have the system of equations:\n\n1. 2x = \u03bb(2y + 2z) + \u03bc yz\n2. 2y = \u03bb(2x + 2z) + \u03bc xz\n3. 2z = \u03bb(2x + 2y) + \u03bc xy\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 and 2:\n\n2x -2y = \u03bb(2y + 2z -2x -2z) + \u03bc(yz -xz)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x - y) = \u03bb(2(y -x)) + \u03bc z(y -x)\n\nFactor (x - y):\n\n2(x - y) = -2 \u03bb(x - y) + \u03bc z (y -x)\n\n= -2 \u03bb(x - y) - \u03bc z (x - y)\n\nFactor (x - y):\n\n[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z](x - y) =0\n\nSo, either x=y or 2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc z=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 1 and 3:\n\n2x -2z = \u03bb(2y + 2z -2x -2y) + \u03bc(yz -xy)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x - z) = \u03bb(2z -2x) + \u03bc z y - \u03bc x y\n\n= 2\u03bb(z -x) + \u03bc y (z -x)\n\nFactor (x - z):\n\n2(x - z) = -2\u03bb(x - z) + \u03bc y (x - z)\n\nFactor (x - z):\n\n[2 + 2\u03bb - \u03bc y](x - z)=0\n\nSo, either x=z or 2 +2\u03bb - \u03bc y=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:\n\n2y -2z= \u03bb(2x + 2z -2x -2y) + \u03bc(xz -xy)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(y -z)=\u03bb(2z -2y) + \u03bc x(z -y)\n\nFactor:\n\n2(y - z)= -2\u03bb(y - z) + \u03bc x (z -y)\n\n= -2\u03bb(y - z) - \u03bc x (y - z)\n\nFactor (y - z):\n\n[2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x](y - z)=0\n\nSo, either y=z or 2 + 2\u03bb + \u03bc x=0.\n\nSo, from these, we have several cases:\n\nCase 1: x=y=z. But as before, this would require the box to be a cube, which isn't possible because the volume would be 27, not 23.\n\nCase 2: x=y\u2260z. Then, from the earlier equations, we have x=y, and z different.\n\nSimilarly, we can have other cases where two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nSo, in our earlier analysis, we considered x=y\u2260z, which gave us two solutions. One with x=y=2, z=5.75, and another with x=y\u22483.899, z\u22481.513.\n\nSince the second solution gives a smaller x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, that's the one we need.\n\nTherefore, in that case, the minimal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is approximately32.69, but we need the exact value.\n\nWait, let me compute it exactly.\n\nEarlier, when x=y= sqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6)), z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)) + [ (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23 ]\u00b2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6)\n\nSecond term: [ (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23 ]\u00b2= (25\u00b2 + 2*25*4 sqrt(6) + (4 sqrt(6))\u00b2 ) /23\u00b2= (625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 96)/529= (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSo, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= (50 *529)/529 + (-8 sqrt(6)*529)/529 + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529\n\n= (26450 -4232 sqrt(6) +721 +200 sqrt(6))/529\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n26450 +721=27171\n\n-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6)= (-4032) sqrt(6)\n\nSo, numerator=27171 -4032 sqrt(6)\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nThen, since r\u00b2= (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/(4*529)= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.\n\nBut let me check: Is 27171 and 4032 divisible by any common factors with 529? 529=23\u00b2.\n\nCheck if 27171 \u00f723= 27171 /23= 1181.347\u2026 Not an integer. Similarly, 4032 \u00f723\u2248175.3. So, no, 23 isn't a factor of numerator terms.\n\nSo, the fraction is (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.\n\nWait, but 27171 and 4032: Let me see if they have a common factor.\n\n27171 \u00f73=9057, 4032 \u00f73=1344. So, factor out 3:\n\n=3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6))/2116\n\nBut 2116 \u00f73\u2248705.333, which isn't integer. So, no, that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 9057 and 1344 have a common factor.\n\n9057 \u00f73=3019, 1344 \u00f73=448.\n\nSo, 9057=3*3019, 1344=3*448.\n\nSo, 3*(3*3019 -3*448 sqrt(6))/2116= 3*3*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/2116=9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/2116.\n\nBut 2116=4*529=4*23\u00b2.\n\nSo, 9 and 2116 are coprime? 9=3\u00b2, 2116=4*23\u00b2. Yes, no common factors. So, the fraction is (9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)))/2116.\n\nWait, but I think I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, in the numerator, we had 27171 -4032 sqrt(6). Let me factor 3 out:\n\n27171=3*9057, 4032=3*1344.\n\nSo, 27171 -4032 sqrt(6)=3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6)).\n\nThen, 9057 \u00f73=3019, 1344 \u00f73=448.\n\nSo, 9057 -1344 sqrt(6)=3*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)).\n\nWait, no, 9057=3*3019, 1344=3*448. So, 9057 -1344 sqrt(6)=3*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)).\n\nSo, the numerator is 3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6))=3*3*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))=9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)).\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nThen, r\u00b2=(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4= [9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/529 ] /4=9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/(4*529)=9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6))/2116.\n\nSo, r\u00b2= (9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)))/2116.\n\nBut 9 and 2116: 2116=4*529=4*23\u00b2, 9=3\u00b2. So, no common factors.\n\nWait, but let me check if 3019 and 448 have any common factors. 3019 is a prime? Let me check.\n\n3019 \u00f77=431.285\u2026 No.\n\n3019 \u00f713=232.23\u2026 No.\n\n3019 \u00f717=177.588\u2026 No.\n\n3019 \u00f719=158.89\u2026 No.\n\nIt might be a prime number.\n\nSimilarly, 448=64*7.\n\nSo, 3019 and 448 have no common factors.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is (9*(3019 -448 sqrt(6)))/2116, which can be written as (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.\n\nBut the problem states that r\u00b2 can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers.\n\nBut in our expression, we have sqrt(6) involved, which complicates things because p and q are integers, but here we have an irrational term. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. Because x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 must be a rational number if r\u00b2 is to be expressed as p/q.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculation earlier when trying to compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nWait, going back, when I assumed x=y, I found that the cubic equation had a solution t=2, leading to x=2, y=2, z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the other root t= -1 +2 sqrt(6), I thought that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 was smaller, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine that.\n\nWe had t= -1 +2 sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.898.\n\nThen, a= t\u00b2= ( -1 +2 sqrt(6) )\u00b2=1 -4 sqrt(6) +24=25 -4 sqrt(6).\n\nSo, x= sqrt(a)= sqrt(25 -4 sqrt(6)).\n\nThen, z=23/(x\u00b2)=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):\n\nz=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2]=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSimplify: 23/529=1/23, so z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)) + [(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).\n\n[(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2= (25^2 + 2*25*4 sqrt(6) + (4 sqrt(6))^2)/23^2= (625 +200 sqrt(6) +96)/529= (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=50 + (721/529) + (-8 sqrt(6)) + (200 sqrt(6)/529).\n\nConvert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.\n\nSimilarly, -8 sqrt(6)= -8 sqrt(6)*529/529= -4232 sqrt(6)/529.\n\nSo, total:\n\n(26450 +721)/529 + (-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n26450 +721=27171.\n\n-4232 sqrt(6)+200 sqrt(6)= (-4032 sqrt(6)).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.\n\nHmm, so that's correct.\n\nBut this expression includes sqrt(6), which is irrational. However, r\u00b2 is supposed to be a rational number p/q, because the problem states that r\u00b2 can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. So, my conclusion must be wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=y=2, z=23/4, giving x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=657/16, which is a rational number.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered x=y=2, z=5.75=23/4, the sum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16=41.0625.\n\nBut in the other case, x=y\u22483.899, z\u22481.513, the sum is about 32.69, but it's expressed as (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529\u2248 (27171 -4032*2.449)/529\u2248(27171 -9878)/529\u224817293/529\u224832.69.\n\nBut since that sum includes sqrt(6), which is irrational, but r\u00b2 is supposed to be rational, perhaps that solution isn't valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption when setting x=y. Maybe the minimal occurs when all three variables are different, leading to a rational x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when x, y, z are all equal, but that's not possible because volume is 23, not 27.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"rectangular boxes\", so they don't have to be cubes. So, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but in that case, the sum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 would have sqrt(6) in it, which is irrational, but the problem says r\u00b2 is p/q, which is rational. Therefore, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=y=2, z=23/4, leading to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=657/16, which is rational.\n\nBut that would mean that r\u00b2=(657/16)/4=657/64.\n\nSo, p=657, q=64. Are 657 and 64 coprime? 64 is 2^6. 657 \u00f73=219, so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 73 is prime. So, 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the other case gives a smaller sum, but that sum is irrational, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=y=2, z=23/4, giving r\u00b2=657/64, and p+q=721.\n\nBut wait, let's verify.\n\nIf x=2, y=2, z=23/4, then surface area=2*(2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4))=2*(4 +23/2 +23/2)=2*(4 +23)=2*27=54. Correct.\n\nVolume=2*2*(23/4)=4*(23/4)=23. Correct.\n\nSo, that is a valid box in set B.\n\nBut is it the minimal sphere? Or is there another box in B that requires a smaller sphere?\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere that contains all boxes in B must have a radius large enough to contain any box in B. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain the box with the maximal space diagonal.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal r is the maximum of the space diagonals over all boxes in B.\n\nSo, to find r, we need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) over all boxes in B, and then r would be half of that maximum.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the sphere must contain every box in B. So, the sphere must have a radius at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2.\n\nWait, no, actually, the sphere must contain each box individually. So, for each box, the sphere must contain it, meaning that the sphere's radius must be at least the space diagonal of each box divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal r is the supremum (least upper bound) of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B.\n\nThus, to find the minimal r, we need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal over all boxes in B, and then r is half of that.\n\nWait, but if we can find the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, then r\u00b2 is (max x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought we needed to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, but perhaps we need to find the maximum.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify.\n\nThe sphere must contain each box. Each box has its own space diagonal. The sphere must be large enough to contain each box. Therefore, the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal of each box. Therefore, the minimal such sphere will have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) over all boxes in B, and then r is half of that maximum.\n\nSo, in that case, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23.\n\nEarlier, I thought we needed to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, but that was incorrect. So, now, I need to find the maximum.\n\nSo, that changes the approach. So, the problem is now to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints.\n\nSo, given that, let me start over.\n\nWe need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given that 2(xy + yz + zx)=54 and xyz=23.\n\nSo, similar to before, but now we need to maximize.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum occurs when one of the variables is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible.\n\nLet me consider the case where one variable is very large, and the other two are small. But given the constraints, there's a limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers again, but this time looking for the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution.\n\nLet me express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom xyz=23, we can express z=23/(xy).\n\nThen, substitute into the surface area equation:\n\n2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) +x*(23/(xy)))=54\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(xy +23/x +23/y)=54\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nxy +23/x +23/y=27\n\nLet me denote u =x + y, v=xy.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nv +23/x +23/y=27\n\nBut 23/x +23/y=23*(x + y)/(xy)=23 u /v.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nv +23 u /v=27\n\nMultiply both sides by v:\n\nv\u00b2 +23 u=27 v\n\nBut u\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2= u\u00b2 -2v.\n\nAnd, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= u\u00b2 -2v + z\u00b2.\n\nBut z=23/(xy)=23/v.\n\nSo, z\u00b2=529 /v\u00b2.\n\nThus, the expression to maximize is:\n\nu\u00b2 -2v +529 /v\u00b2.\n\nBut from the equation above, v\u00b2 +23 u=27 v =>23 u=27v -v\u00b2 =>u=(27v -v\u00b2)/23.\n\nSo, substitute u into the expression:\n\n[(27v -v\u00b2)/23]^2 -2v +529 /v\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term: (27v -v\u00b2)^2 / (23)^2= (729v\u00b2 -54v\u00b3 +v^4)/529.\n\nSecond term: -2v.\n\nThird term:529 /v\u00b2.\n\nSo, total expression:\n\n(729v\u00b2 -54v\u00b3 +v^4)/529 -2v +529 /v\u00b2.\n\nLet me write all terms over a common denominator, which would be 529 v\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n= [ (729v\u00b2 -54v\u00b3 +v^4) *v\u00b2 -2v *529 v\u00b2 +529 *529 ] / (529 v\u00b2)\n\nWait, that seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as a function of v and take its derivative.\n\nLet me denote f(v)= (729v\u00b2 -54v\u00b3 +v^4)/529 -2v +529 /v\u00b2.\n\nCompute f(v):\n\n= (v^4 -54v\u00b3 +729v\u00b2)/529 -2v +529 /v\u00b2.\n\nTo find the maximum, take derivative f\u2019(v), set to zero.\n\nCompute f\u2019(v):\n\n= [4v\u00b3 -162v\u00b2 +1458v]/529 -2 - (2*529)/v\u00b3.\n\nSet f\u2019(v)=0:\n\n[4v\u00b3 -162v\u00b2 +1458v]/529 -2 -1058/v\u00b3=0\n\nMultiply both sides by 529 v\u00b3 to eliminate denominators:\n\nv\u00b3*(4v\u00b3 -162v\u00b2 +1458v) -2*529 v\u00b3 -1058*529=0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term:4v^6 -162v^5 +1458v^4\n\nSecond term:-1058v\u00b3\n\nThird term:-1058*529= -559,  1058*529: Let me compute 1000*529=529,000, 58*529=30,562, so total=529,000 +30,562=559,562.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n4v^6 -162v^5 +1458v^4 -1058v\u00b3 -559,562=0\n\nThis is a sixth-degree equation, which is very difficult to solve analytically. Perhaps I can look for rational roots.\n\nPossible rational roots are factors of 559,562 over factors of 4.\n\nBut 559,562 is a large number. Let me see if v=13 is a root.\n\nCompute f(13):\n\n4*(13)^6 -162*(13)^5 +1458*(13)^4 -1058*(13)^3 -559,562.\n\nThis is time-consuming, but let me try:\n\n13^2=169\n\n13^3=2197\n\n13^4=28,561\n\n13^5=371,293\n\n13^6=4,826,809\n\nSo,\n\n4*4,826,809=19,307,236\n\n-162*371,293= -162*371,293= let's compute 160*371,293=59,406,880; 2*371,293=742,586; total=59,406,880 +742,586=60,149,466; so -60,149,466.\n\n+1458*28,561=1458*28,561. Let's compute 1000*28,561=28,561,000; 400*28,561=11,424,400; 50*28,561=1,428,050; 8*28,561=228,488.
