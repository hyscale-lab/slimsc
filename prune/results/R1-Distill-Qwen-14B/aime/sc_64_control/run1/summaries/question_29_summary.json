      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle, which probably means they're concyclic or lie on the same circumference. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. There are two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. So, AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. That makes ABCD a rectangle where AB is the length and BC is the width. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, these four points are on it. Now, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe I can use some circle theorems or properties here.\n\nFirst, let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: Let's assume it's placed with AB horizontal and BC vertical. So, point A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, D at the top left. Then rectangle EFGH: I'm not sure how it's placed yet, but since E, F, G, H are the vertices, and EF and FG are sides, EF is 184, FG is 17.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, and considering the positions of these points, perhaps the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Alternatively, maybe the order is different, but I'll go with this for now.\n\nGiven that A, D, H, G are concyclic, they lie on a circle. So, maybe I can use some cyclic quadrilateral properties here. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure how that directly applies here yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the power of a point theorem or something related to similar triangles. Let me think about the coordinates approach. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point can help.\n\nLet's assign coordinate system: Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, AB = 107, BC =16. So, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (107, 16), because in rectangle ABCD, moving from D to C is along the length AB and the width BC.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107, and BC is 16, then ABCD would have points: A (x, y), B (x + 107, y), C (x + 107, y + 16), D (x, y + 16). But since I placed D at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 16), right? Because from D, moving right 107 units and down 16 units gives point C.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if D is at (0,0), then moving up 16 units along the y-axis would give point A at (0,16). Then, AB is 107 units to the right, so point B would be at (107,16), and point C would be at (107,0). Hmm, that makes sense because in rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but then BC would be from (107,16) to (107,0), which is 16 units, correct. AB is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is 107 units. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, points are:\nA: (0,16)\nB: (107,16)\nC: (107,0)\nD: (0,0)\n\nNow, points E, F are on the same line as D, E, C, F. So, the line passes through D (0,0), E, C (107,0), and F.\n\nWait, so the line DC is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,0). So, points E and F must lie on the x-axis. Since E and F are part of rectangle EFGH, which is another rectangle.\n\nWait, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is a side, and FG is another side. Since E is on the x-axis, and F is also on the x-axis, that would mean that the side EF is along the x-axis. So, EF = 184, meaning the distance between E and F is 184 units along the x-axis.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E is between D and C, but D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0), so the line DC is from 0 to 107. If E and F are on this line, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is 107, that suggests that E and F are beyond C.\n\nWait, perhaps E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C. Because if E is at (x, 0) and F is at (x + 184, 0), then if x is negative, E is left of D, and F is right of C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is between D and C, but F is beyond C, but then EF would have to be 184. But since DC is 107, that would require E to be 184 units to the left of F. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to E and F.\n\nLet me assume that the line through D, E, C, F is the x-axis, as points D, C are on the x-axis.\n\nSo, let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since E and F are on the x-axis.\n\nSince EF = 184, the distance between E and F is |f - e| = 184.\n\nAlso, since E and F are on the same line as D (0,0) and C (107,0), E can be either to the left of D or right of C, and F accordingly.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH: Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is one side, FG is another side. So, from F, moving up or down 17 units (since FG =17) to get point G.\n\nWait, but the rectangle can be oriented in two ways: Either the sides FG and EH are vertical or horizontal. But since EF is along the x-axis, the sides FG and EH must be vertical. Because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular.\n\nSo, from point F (f,0), moving up 17 units would give point G at (f,17). Similarly, from E (e,0), moving up 17 units would give point H at (e,17). But wait, in rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So, after EFGH, the next point after F is G, so the direction is important.\n\nWait, but in rectangle EFGH, the order is E-F-G-H-E. So, from E to F is along the x-axis, then from F to G is upwards (assuming the rectangle is above the x-axis), then G to H is back along the x-axis, and H to E is downwards.\n\nWait, but in that case, points G and H would be above the x-axis, so their y-coordinates would be positive.\n\nBut the problem states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. A is (0,16), D is (0,0), H is (e,17), and G is (f,17). So, all four points lie on a circle.\n\nSo, four points: (0,16), (0,0), (e,17), (f,17) lie on a circle.\n\nHmm, I can use the general equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. But since three of the points are (0,0), (0,16), and (e,17), (f,17), maybe I can find the equation of the circle passing through these points.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (f,17) lie on a circle. Let's see.\n\nFirst, points A and D are both on the y-axis at (0,16) and (0,0). So, the circle passes through these two points, which are vertically aligned. The circle's center must lie on the perpendicular bisector of AD. The midpoint of AD is (0,8), and the perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line y=8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the perpendicular bisector of a vertical line segment (like AD, which is along the y-axis) is a horizontal line passing through the midpoint. So, the perpendicular bisector is y=8.\n\nSo, the center of the circle lies somewhere on y=8. Let's denote the center as (h,8). The radius can be found using the distance from the center to any of the points on the circle.\n\nSo, the distance from center (h,8) to A (0,16) should equal the distance to D (0,0), which is the same as the radius.\n\nCalculating distance from (h,8) to (0,16):\n\n\u221a[(h - 0)^2 + (8 - 16)^2] = \u221a[h\u00b2 + 64]\n\nDistance from (h,8) to (0,0):\n\n\u221a[(h - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2] = \u221a[h\u00b2 + 64]\n\nSo, that's consistent, as both distances are equal, which is the radius.\n\nNow, the circle must also pass through H (e,17) and G (f,17). So, the distance from (h,8) to (e,17) must also equal the radius.\n\nSo, let's write the equation:\n\n\u221a[(e - h)^2 + (17 - 8)^2] = \u221a[h\u00b2 + 64]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(e - h)^2 + 81 = h\u00b2 + 64\n\nExpanding (e - h)^2:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2eh + h\u00b2 +81 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2eh +81 = 64\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 - 2eh = -17\n\nSimilarly, for point G (f,17):\n\n\u221a[(f - h)^2 + (17 - 8)^2] = \u221a[h\u00b2 +64]\n\nSquaring:\n\n(f - h)^2 +81 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nExpand:\n\nf\u00b2 - 2fh + h\u00b2 +81 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nSimplify:\n\nf\u00b2 - 2fh = -17\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. e\u00b2 - 2eh = -17\n2. f\u00b2 - 2fh = -17\n\nSo, both e\u00b2 - 2eh and f\u00b2 - 2fh equal -17.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2eh +17 = 0 --> equation (1)\nf\u00b2 - 2fh +17 = 0 --> equation (2)\n\nHmm, subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nf\u00b2 - 2fh +17 - (e\u00b2 - 2eh +17) = 0\nf\u00b2 - 2fh - e\u00b2 + 2eh =0\n(f\u00b2 - e\u00b2) -2h(f - e) =0\nFactor:\n\n(f - e)(f + e) -2h(f -e)=0\n(f - e)(f + e - 2h) =0\n\nSo, either f = e or f + e - 2h =0.\n\nBut f \u2260 e because EF =184, so |f - e|=184. So, f - e = \u00b1184. So, f \u2260 e, so the other factor must be zero: f + e -2h=0.\n\nThus,\n\nf + e = 2h --> equation (3)\n\nSo, from equation (3), h = (e + f)/2.\n\nNow, going back to equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 - 2e h = -17\n\nSubstituting h = (e + f)/2:\n\ne\u00b2 - 2e*(e + f)/2 = -17\nSimplify:\n\ne\u00b2 - e(e + f) = -17\ne\u00b2 - e\u00b2 - e f = -17\n- e f = -17\nSo, e f =17 --> equation (4)\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\nf\u00b2 - 2f h = -17\n\nSubstitute h=(e + f)/2:\n\nf\u00b2 - 2f*(e + f)/2 = -17\nSimplify:\n\nf\u00b2 - f(e + f) = -17\nf\u00b2 - e f - f\u00b2 = -17\n- e f = -17\nSo, e f =17, which is consistent with equation (4).\n\nSo, e f =17.\n\nNow, we know that EF =184, which is |f - e|=184.\n\nAssuming that f > e, then f - e =184.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nf = e +184 --> equation (5)\n\nAnd from equation (4):\n\ne*(e + 184) =17\ne\u00b2 +184 e =17\ne\u00b2 +184 e -17=0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in e:\n\ne\u00b2 +184 e -17=0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*17)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16=33856\n\n4*17=68\n\nSo, discriminant is 33856 +68=33924\n\nWhat is the square root of 33924?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n184\u00b2=33856, as above.\n\n184.5\u00b2 = (184 +0.5)^2=184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25, which is larger than 33924.\n\nWait, 184^2=33856, 185^2=34225. So, sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 185.\n\nCompute 184.7^2= ?\n\n184*184=33856\n\n0.7^2=0.49\n\n2*184*0.7=257.6\n\nSo, 33856 +257.6 +0.49=34114.09, which is still higher than 33924.\n\nWait, maybe 184.2^2:\n\nCompute 184 +0.2.\n\n(184 +0.2)^2=184^2 +2*184*0.2 +0.2^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33930.64.\n\nHmm, that's close to 33924.\n\nWait, 33930.64 is higher than 33924.\n\nSo, 184.2^2=33930.64\n\n184.1^2= (184 +0.1)^2=184\u00b2 +2*184*0.1 +0.01=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81\n\nWait, 33892.81 is less than 33924.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)= approximately between 184.1 and 184.2.\n\nBut perhaps it's an integer? Let me check.\n\nWait, 33924 divided by 4 is 8481.\n\nIs 8481 a square? Let's check sqrt(8481)=92.1 (since 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649). So, 92.1^2\u22488481, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 33924 is 184.2^2 as we saw, but that's not integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not approximate, but find exact values.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation is e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0\n\nSolutions are e = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +68)]/2\n\nWhich is [-184 \u00b1\u221a(33856 +68)]/2 = [-184 \u00b1\u221a33924]/2\n\nWait, 33924=4*8481, since 4*8000=32000, 4*481=1924, 32000+1924=33924.\n\nSo, \u221a33924=\u221a(4*8481)=2\u221a8481.\n\nNow, 8481: Let's see if it's a perfect square.\n\nCalculate 92\u00b2=8464, 93\u00b2=8649. So, 92\u00b2=8464, 92.1\u00b2\u22488481?\n\nWait, 92*92=8464, 92*93=8556, so 8481 is between 92\u00b2 and 93\u00b2.\n\nWait, 92\u00b2=8464, so 8481-8464=17. So, 92\u00b2 +17=8481, which is not a perfect square. So, \u221a8481 is irrational.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481)=2*92.11 (approx). So, approximately 184.22.\n\nSo, e is [ -184 \u00b1184.22 ] /2\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because if e is negative, then f = e +184 would be positive, but let's see:\n\nIf we take the positive sqrt:\n\ne = [ -184 + 184.22 ] /2 \u2248 (0.22)/2 \u2248 0.11\n\nOr the negative sqrt:\n\ne = [ -184 - 184.22 ] /2 \u2248 (-368.22)/2 \u2248 -184.11\n\nSo, possible e values are approximately 0.11 or -184.11.\n\nBut given that E is a point on the line D-E-C-F, which is the x-axis from D (0,0) to C (107,0), but E and F are on the same line beyond that.\n\nWait, but if E is at approximately 0.11, that would place E just to the right of D (0,0), and F would be at e +184 \u2248 0.11 +184 \u2248184.11, which is way beyond C (107,0). Alternatively, if e is -184.11, then F would be at e +184= -184.11 +184\u2248-0.11, which is just left of D (0,0). But in that case, points E and F would be on opposite sides of D.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order could be E, D, C, F or D, E, C, F or E, C, D, F, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the positions. Maybe E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C, which is beyond C.\n\nIf E is at e = -184.11, then F would be at e +184 = -184.11 +184 \u2248-0.11, which is just to the left of D (0,0). But that would place F near D, which might not make sense because C is at (107,0), and F is supposed to be on the same line as D, E, C, F.\n\nAlternatively, if E is at e \u22480.11, F is at 184.11, which is way to the right of C (107,0). So, points would be D (0,0), E (0.11,0), C (107,0), F (184.11,0). That seems plausible.\n\nBut let's check if E is at 0.11, then H would be at (e,17) = (0.11,17), and G would be at (f,17) = (184.11,17).\n\nBut in that case, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (0.11,17), G (184.11,17) lie on a circle.\n\nAlternatively, if E is at -184.11, then F is at -0.11, so H is at (-184.11,17), G is at (-0.11,17). Then, the circle passes through A (0,16), D (0,0), H (-184.11,17), G (-0.11,17). That might not be possible because H is far away.\n\nWait, but the circle equation suggests that regardless of e and f, as long as e*f=17 and f=e+184, the points lie on a circle.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is symmetric in some way.\n\nWait, let's try to compute e and f.\n\nWe have e*f=17 and f = e +184.\n\nSo,\n\ne*(e +184) =17\ne\u00b2 +184 e -17=0\n\nSolutions are:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*17)] /2\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(33856 +68)] /2\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a33924]/2\ne = [-184 \u00b1 184.22]/2\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: e = [ -184 + 184.22 ] /2 \u2248 (0.22)/2 \u2248 0.11\n\nCase 2: e = [ -184 -184.22 ] /2 \u2248 (-368.22)/2 \u2248 -184.11\n\nSo, e can be approximately 0.11 or -184.11.\n\nBut let's see if both cases are possible.\n\nCase 1: e\u22480.11, f\u22480.11+184\u2248184.11\n\nSo, E is at (0.11,0), F at (184.11,0)\n\nThen, rectangle EFGH would have points:\n\nE (0.11,0), F (184.11,0), G (184.11,17), H (0.11,17)\n\nSo, this rectangle is 184 units long along the x-axis and 17 units tall.\n\nPoints A (0,16), D (0,0), H (0.11,17), G (184.11,17) lie on a circle.\n\nAlternatively, Case 2: e\u2248-184.11, f\u2248-184.11+184\u2248-0.11\n\nSo, E is at (-184.11,0), F at (-0.11,0)\n\nThen, rectangle EFGH would have points:\n\nE (-184.11,0), F (-0.11,0), G (-0.11,17), H (-184.11,17)\n\nSo, this rectangle is also 184 units long along the x-axis, but from E (-184.11,0) to F (-0.11,0), and up to G (-0.11,17) and H (-184.11,17).\n\nThen, the points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (-184.11,17), G (-0.11,17) lie on a circle.\n\nSo, both cases are possible, but in the problem, it's stated that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, in the first case, E is between D and C (since 0.11 is between 0 and 107), but F is beyond C. In the second case, E is far to the left of D, and F is just left of D, so C (107,0) is not between E and F in this case. Because E is at -184.11, F at -0.11, so C is at 107, which is way to the right, so D (0,0) is between E and F.\n\nWait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order must be such that D is between E and C, or E and F are on either side of D and C is beyond.\n\nWait, perhaps the first case is more plausible, where E is just to the right of D, and F is way to the right of C. Because then D is between E and F, and C is between D and F.\n\nWait, but in the first case, E is at 0.11, D at 0, C at 107, F at 184.11. So, the order is E, D, C, F along the x-axis. So, they are collinear in that order.\n\nIn the second case, E is at -184.11, F at -0.11, D at 0, and C at 107. So, the order would be E, F, D, C along the x-axis. So, in that case, D is between F and C, but E is far to the left. So, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but in this case, the order would be E, F, D, C, so D is not between E and C.\n\nWait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order might be E, D, C, F or D, E, C, F. So, perhaps both cases are possible, but let's see which one makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the first case, E is at 0.11, which is very close to D (0,0), so CE would be from C (107,0) to E (0.11,0), which is 107 -0.11=106.89 units.\n\nIn the second case, E is at -184.11, so CE would be from C (107,0) to E (-184.11,0), which is 107 - (-184.11)=291.11 units.\n\nBut the problem asks for the length of CE, so perhaps it's either of these, but we need more information to decide which case is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the rectangle EFGH. Let me see.\n\nIn the first case, rectangle EFGH is from E (0.11,0) to F (184.11,0) to G (184.11,17) to H (0.11,17). So, the rectangle is 184 units long and 17 units tall.\n\nIn the second case, the rectangle is from E (-184.11,0) to F (-0.11,0) to G (-0.11,17) to H (-184.11,17). So, same dimensions.\n\nBut in the first case, the rectangle EFGH is to the right of D, which is at (0,0). In the second case, it's to the left.\n\nNow, considering points A (0,16), D (0,0), H, G lie on a circle.\n\nIn the first case, H is at (0.11,17), G at (184.11,17). So, points A and D are on the y-axis, H and G are on the line y=17, to the right.\n\nIn the second case, H is at (-184.11,17), G at (-0.11,17). So, points A and D are on the y-axis, H and G are on the line y=17 to the left.\n\nIn either case, the circle passes through A, D, H, G.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is symmetric, so both cases are possible. But the length CE would differ.\n\nWait, but in the first case, CE is 107 -0.11=106.89, and in the second case, CE is 107 - (-184.11)=291.11.\n\nBut the problem gives specific lengths, so perhaps the answer is 107 +17=124? Wait, but that's a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find CE without approximating.\n\nWait, from equation (3): f + e = 2h\n\nAnd from equation (4): e f =17\n\nAlso, we have f = e +184\n\nSo, substituting f =e +184 into f + e = 2h:\n\n(e +184) + e = 2h => 2e +184 = 2h => e +92 = h\n\nSo, h = e +92\n\nNow, the circle center is at (h,8) = (e +92,8)\n\nThe radius is \u221a[h\u00b2 +64] = \u221a[(e +92)^2 +64]\n\nNow, the point H is at (e,17), so the distance from center (h,8) to H (e,17) must equal the radius.\n\nSo,\n\n\u221a[(e - h)^2 + (17 -8)^2] = \u221a[(e - (e +92))^2 +81] = \u221a[(-92)^2 +81] = \u221a(8464 +81)=\u221a8545\n\nBut the radius is \u221a[(e +92)^2 +64]\n\nSo,\n\n\u221a[(e +92)^2 +64] = \u221a8545\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(e +92)^2 +64 =8545\n\n(e +92)^2 =8545 -64=8481\n\nSo,\n\ne +92 = \u00b1\u221a8481\n\nBut \u221a8481 is approximately 92.11, as before.\n\nSo,\n\ne +92 =92.11 or e +92 = -92.11\n\nCase 1: e +92=92.11 => e=0.11\n\nCase 2: e +92= -92.11 => e= -184.11\n\nWhich brings us back to the same two cases as before.\n\nSo, in case 1, e=0.11, f=184.11\n\nIn case 2, e=-184.11, f=-0.11\n\nNow, we need to find CE.\n\nPoint C is at (107,0), E is at (e,0). So, CE is |107 - e|.\n\nIn case 1: CE=107 -0.11=106.89\n\nIn case 2: CE=107 - (-184.11)=291.11\n\nBut these are approximate values. Let's find exact expressions.\n\nFrom (e +92)^2=8481\n\nSo, e +92=\u00b1\u221a8481\n\nSo,\n\ne= -92 \u00b1\u221a8481\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: e= -92 +\u221a8481\n\nCase 2: e= -92 -\u221a8481\n\nThen, CE= |107 - e|\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: CE=107 - e=107 - (-92 +\u221a8481)=107 +92 -\u221a8481=199 -\u221a8481\n\nCase 2: CE=107 - (-92 -\u221a8481)=107 +92 +\u221a8481=199 +\u221a8481\n\nBut we need to find which case is applicable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute \u221a8481.\n\nWait, 92\u00b2=8464, 93\u00b2=8649. So, \u221a8481 is between 92 and 93.\n\nCompute 92*92=8464, 92*93=8556.\n\nCompute 8481-8464=17. So, \u221a8481=92 +17/(2*92) approximately=92 +0.092=92.092.\n\nBut exact value isn't necessary if we can write the answer in terms of \u221a8481.\n\nBut the problem expects an integer answer, as per the instructions, so maybe there's a way to find CE as an integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another approach: Since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, perhaps the power of point C with respect to that circle can be used.\n\nPower of a point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of distances from C to E and C to F, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, and C is outside the circle, maybe we can use power of point C with respect to the circle.\n\nThe power of point C is equal to CE * CF = CH * CG.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nPower of a point C with respect to the circle is defined as the product of the lengths from C to the points of intersection with the circle along any line through C. In this case, line E-F passes through C, so CE * CF = power of C.\n\nBut also, line H-G is another line passing through C? Wait, no, H and G are points on the circle, but line H-G is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal at y=17.\n\nSo, point C is at (107,0), which is below the line y=17, so line CG would be from C (107,0) to G (f,17). Similarly, line CH is from C (107,0) to H (e,17).\n\nWait, perhaps power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CG * CH.\n\nBut power of point C can also be expressed as CE * CF, since E and F are the intersections of line DC with the circle.\n\nWait, but wait, points E and F are not on the circle. Only A, D, H, G are on the circle. So, line DC is the x-axis, which passes through E and F, but E and F are not on the circle.\n\nSo, perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of distances from C to E and C to F.\n\nPower of point C is equal to CE * CF = (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2.\n\nWait, the power of a point outside the circle is equal to the square of the tangent length from the point to the circle, which is equal to (distance from point to center)^2 - radius^2.\n\nAlternatively, if a line through C intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y, then CX * CY = power of C.\n\nIn our case, line E-F passes through C and intersects the circle at E and F? Wait, no, E and F are not on the circle. Only A, D, H, G are on the circle.\n\nWait, perhaps another line through C intersects the circle at H and G. So, line HG is horizontal at y=17, passing through C? No, because C is at (107,0), which is below y=17.\n\nWait, perhaps line CG and CH are two lines from C to the circle.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from C to any two points where a line through C intersects the circle.\n\nSo, if I draw a line from C that intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, then CP * CQ = power of C.\n\nIn our case, line E-F passes through C and intersects the circle at E and F? Wait, no, E and F are not on the circle. So, perhaps another line.\n\nAlternatively, line CG and CH are two lines from C to the circle, but they are not colinear.\n\nWait, perhaps the line from C to H and G? But H and G are on the circle, but line HG is horizontal, so line from C to H and G would not be the same line.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the power of point C with respect to the circle.\n\nThe power of point C is equal to CA * CD, but wait, points A and D are on the circle, so CA and CD are the distances from C to A and D.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2.\n\nAlternatively, since A and D are on the circle, the power of C can also be expressed as CA * CD, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point outside the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersection points of any line through the point and the circle.\n\nIn this case, line CA passes through C and A, which is on the circle, so the power of C is CA * (CA extended beyond A to another point on the circle, but since A is on the circle, the other intersection is A itself, so the power would be zero, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, the power of a point P with respect to a circle is defined as:\n\n- If P is outside: power = PA * PB, where PA and PB are lengths from P to points A and B where a line through P intersects the circle.\n\n- If P is on the circle: power =0.\n\n- If P is inside: power = - (PA * PB), where PA and PB are lengths from P to two points on the circle along a line through P.\n\nIn our case, point C is at (107,0). Let's compute the power of point C with respect to the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nFirst, find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nEarlier, we found the center at (h,8), where h = e +92.\n\nAnd the radius squared is h\u00b2 +64.\n\nSo, the equation is (x - h)^2 + (y -8)^2 = h\u00b2 +64.\n\nExpanding:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2hx + h\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -16y +64 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2hx + y\u00b2 -16y =0\n\nNow, compute the power of point C (107,0):\n\nPower = (107)^2 - 2h*107 + (0)^2 -16*0 = 107\u00b2 - 207h\n\nBut the power should also be equal to the product of the distances from C to E and C to F along line E-F, which is the x-axis.\n\nSo, CE * CF = (107 - e) * (107 - f)\n\nBut since f =e +184,\n\nCE * CF = (107 - e)(107 - (e +184)) = (107 -e)(-77 -e) = -(107 -e)(77 +e)\n\nBut wait, the power of point C is equal to CE * CF.\n\nWait, but in the power formula, if the point is outside the circle, the power is positive and equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersection points.\n\nBut in our case, line E-F passes through C and intersects the circle at E and F? No, because E and F are not on the circle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the line. Maybe another line through C intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, so that CP * CQ = power of C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps line CG and CH are the two points of intersection, but that would require that line CG and CH are the same line, which they are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps line CG intersects the circle at G and another point, but G is on the circle, so maybe CG is tangent? No, because CG is from C to G, which is on the circle, so CG is a tangent only if CG is perpendicular to the radius at G.\n\nWait, the radius at G is from center (h,8) to G (f,17). The slope of this radius is (17 -8)/(f - h)=9/(f - h).\n\nThe slope of CG is (17 -0)/(f -107)=17/(f -107)\n\nIf CG is tangent, then the radius at G is perpendicular to CG, so the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo,\n\n[9/(f - h)] * [17/(f -107)] = -1\n\nBut this would require specific values of f and h, which we don't have yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power of point C can be expressed as CG * CH, where CG and CH are the lengths from C to G and H.\n\nWait, but G and H are two different points on the circle, so line GH is the line connecting them, which is horizontal at y=17.\n\nSo, point C is at (107,0), which is below this line. So, the line from C to GH would be a vertical line, but since GH is horizontal, the perpendicular distance from C to GH is 17 units.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the power of point C as (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2.\n\nCompute distance from C (107,0) to center (h,8):\n\n\u221a[(107 - h)^2 + (0 -8)^2] = \u221a[(107 - h)^2 +64]\n\nSo, power of C is:\n\n(107 - h)^2 +64 - (h\u00b2 +64) = (107 - h)^2 - h\u00b2\n\nExpand (107 - h)^2:\n\n107\u00b2 - 2*107*h + h\u00b2 - h\u00b2 = 107\u00b2 -214h\n\nSo, power of C is 107\u00b2 -214h\n\nBut power of C is also equal to CG * CH, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since line E-F passes through C, and E and F are on the x-axis, and the circle passes through A, D, H, G, perhaps the power of point C is equal to CE * CF.\n\nSo,\n\nCE * CF = 107\u00b2 -214h\n\nBut CE = |107 - e|\n\nCF = |107 - f|\n\nBut f = e +184, so CF = |107 - (e +184)| = | -77 -e | = |e +77|\n\nSo,\n\nCE * CF = |107 - e| * |e +77|\n\nBut since e is either approximately 0.11 or -184.11, let's compute in both cases.\n\nCase 1: e \u22480.11\n\nCE \u2248107 -0.11=106.89\n\nCF\u22480.11 +77=77.11\n\nCE * CF\u2248106.89 *77.11\u22488222. But 107\u00b2=11449, 214h=214*(e +92)=214*(0.11 +92)=214*92.11\u2248214*92=19768 +214*0.11\u224823.54 \u2192 total\u224819768+23.54=19791.54\n\nSo, power of C would be 11449 -214h\u224811449 -19791.54\u2248-8342.54\n\nBut CE * CF\u22488222, which is positive, while power is negative. Contradiction.\n\nCase 2: e\u2248-184.11\n\nCE=107 - (-184.11)=291.11\n\nCF= |-184.11 +77|= |-107.11|=107.11\n\nCE * CF\u2248291.11 *107.11\u224831,111\n\nPower of C=107\u00b2 -214h=11449 -214*(e +92)=11449 -214*(-184.11 +92)=11449 -214*(-92.11)\n\nCompute 214*(-92.11)= -214*92.11\u2248-19768 -214*0.11\u2248-23.54 \u2192 total\u2248-19791.54\n\nSo,\n\nPower of C=11449 - (-19791.54)=11449 +19791.54\u224831240.54\n\nWhich is approximately equal to CE * CF\u224831,111. Close enough considering the approximations.\n\nSo, this suggests that case 2 is the correct one, where e\u2248-184.11, f\u2248-0.11.\n\nThus, CE=107 - e=107 - (-184.11)=291.11\n\nBut the problem expects an integer answer, so perhaps the exact value is 291.11, but that's not an integer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let's compute CE exactly.\n\nFrom earlier, CE= |107 - e|\n\nAnd e= -92 -\u221a8481\n\nSo,\n\nCE=107 - (-92 -\u221a8481)=107 +92 +\u221a8481=199 +\u221a8481\n\nBut \u221a8481=92.11, so 199 +92.11=291.11, which is not an integer.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the power of point calculation.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWe have:\n\nPower of point C=107\u00b2 -214h\n\nBut h= e +92\n\nSo,\n\nPower=107\u00b2 -214*(e +92)=107\u00b2 -214e -214*92\n\nWe also have from the circle equation:\n\nThe power of point C is equal to CG * CH\n\nWait, but CG and CH are the distances from C to G and H, which are points on the circle.\n\nSo,\n\nCG= distance from C (107,0) to G (f,17)=\u221a[(f -107)^2 +17^2]\n\nSimilarly, CH= distance from C to H (e,17)=\u221a[(e -107)^2 +17^2]\n\nSo,\n\nCG * CH=\u221a[(f -107)^2 +289] * \u221a[(e -107)^2 +289]\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the equation of the circle and plug in point C to find the power.\n\nThe circle equation is (x - h)^2 + (y -8)^2 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nSo, plug in point C (107,0):\n\n(107 - h)^2 + (0 -8)^2 = h\u00b2 +64\n\nExpand:\n\n(107 -h)^2 +64= h\u00b2 +64\n\nSo,\n\n(107 -h)^2 = h\u00b2\n\nTake square root:\n\n107 -h = \u00b1h\n\nCase 1: 107 -h = h \u2192 107=2h \u2192 h=53.5\n\nCase 2: 107 -h = -h \u2192107=0 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo, only Case 1 is possible: h=53.5\n\nSo, h=53.5\n\nFrom earlier, h= e +92 \u2192 e= h -92=53.5 -92= -38.5\n\nSo, e= -38.5\n\nThen, f= e +184= -38.5 +184=145.5\n\nSo, e= -38.5, f=145.5\n\nSo, exact values are e= -77/2, f=291/2\n\nSo, CE= |107 - e|=107 - (-38.5)=145.5\n\nWhich is 291/2=145.5\n\nBut the problem expects an integer, but 145.5 is not integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, but h=53.5, which is 107/2.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nFrom the circle equation, when we plugged in point C, we found h=53.5\n\nThus, h=53.5, so e= h -92=53.5 -92= -38.5\n\nThus, CE= |107 - (-38.5)|=107 +38.5=145.5=291/2\n\nBut the problem says to put the answer as an integer.

Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should express CE as 291/2, but the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the correct answer is 145.5, but that's not integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption that E is to the left of D. Maybe E is between D and C, which would make CE=107 -e, but e would be positive, less than 107.\n\nWait, but from the quadratic solution, e is either approximately 0.11 or -184.11. So, if e=0.11, then CE=107 -0.11=106.89, which is approximately 107, but not integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that e= -38.5, which is -77/2, so CE=145.5=291/2\n\nBut the problem expects an integer. So, perhaps the answer is 145.5, but expressed as a fraction, it's 291/2.\n\nBut the problem says to put the final answer as an integer in a box, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the length CE is 145.5, but the problem expects it as 145.5, but it's not integer. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. Find CE.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute CE as 145.5, which is 291/2, but that's not integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and CE is actually 145.5, but the problem expects it as a fraction.\n\nBut the problem says to put the answer as an integer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the circle passes through A, D, H, G, and use the property that the power of point C is equal to CE * CF.\n\nFrom earlier, when we plugged in point C into the circle equation, we found h=53.5, which leads to CE=145.5\n\nBut let's compute CE * CF.\n\nCE=145.5, CF= |107 - f|= |107 -145.5|=38.5\n\nSo, CE * CF=145.5 *38.5= (145 +0.5)(38 +0.5)=145*38 +145*0.5 +0.5*38 +0.25=5510 +72.5 +19 +0.25=5510+72.5=5582.5 +19=5601.5 +0.25=5601.75\n\nBut power of point C is equal to (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2\n\nDistance from C (107,0) to center (53.5,8):\n\n\u221a[(107 -53.5)^2 + (0 -8)^2]=\u221a[(53.5)^2 +64]=\u221a(2862.25 +64)=\u221a2926.25=54.09\n\nRadius squared is h\u00b2 +64=53.5\u00b2 +64=2862.25 +64=2926.25\n\nSo, power of C= (distance)^2 - radius^2=2926.25 -2926.25=0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the power of point C is (distance from C to center)^2 - radius^2\n\nWhich is (54.09)^2 - (54.09)^2=0\n\nBut earlier, we found that CE * CF=5601.75, which is not zero.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, because point C lies on the circle? Because when we plugged in point C into the circle equation, we found that it satisfies the equation only when h=53.5, but that would imply that point C lies on the circle, which would mean that the power of point C is zero, but earlier calculations suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, let's check if point C lies on the circle.\n\nThe circle equation is (x -53.5)^2 + (y -8)^2=53.5\u00b2 +64\n\nCompute for point C (107,0):\n\n(107 -53.5)^2 + (0 -8)^2=53.5\u00b2 +64\n\n53.5\u00b2=2862.25\n\nSo,\n\n(53.5)^2 +64=2862.25 +64=2926.25\n\nWhich equals the right side.\n\nSo, point C lies on the circle. So, the power of point C is zero.\n\nBut earlier, we found that CE * CF=5601.75\u22600, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that point C lies on the circle, which would mean that CE * CF=0, which is only possible if either CE=0 or CF=0, which is not the case.\n\nThus, there must be a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that when we plugged in point C into the circle equation, we found that it lies on the circle, which is possible only if C is one of the points A, D, H, G, which it is not. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the circle equation.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the circle equation.\n\nWe had points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17)\n\nWe found the center at (h,8), with h= e +92\n\nAnd radius squared= h\u00b2 +64\n\nBut when we plugged in point C (107,0), we found that it lies on the circle, which is not possible unless C is one of the four points, which it is not.\n\nThus, there must be a mistake in the earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the circle passes through A, D, H, G, but in reality, point C is not on the circle. So, perhaps the earlier approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use coordinate geometry differently.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me place point D at (0,0), as before.\n\nSo,\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nC: (107,0)\n\nB: (107,16)\n\nA: (0,16)\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17.\n\nPoints D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis.\n\nLet me assume that E is at (e,0), F at (f,0), with f = e +184\n\nRectangle EFGH has vertices E (e,0), F (f,0), G (f,17), H (e,17)\n\nPoints A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (f,17) lie on a circle.\n\nLet me find the equation of the circle passing through these four points.\n\nUsing the general equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy +c=0\n\nPlug in D (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u2192c=0\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy=0\n\nPlug in A (0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 \u219232f= -256 \u2192f= -8\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx -16y=0\n\nNow, plug in H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 +2g e -16*17=0 \u2192e\u00b2 +289 +2g e -272=0 \u2192e\u00b2 +2g e +17=0 ...(1)\n\nPlug in G (f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 + 289 +2g f -272=0 \u2192f\u00b2 +2g f +17=0 ...(2)\n\nFrom equation (1) and (2):\n\nWe have e\u00b2 +2g e +17=0\n\nand f\u00b2 +2g f +17=0\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\ne\u00b2 -f\u00b2 +2g (e -f)=0\n\nFactor:\n\n(e -f)(e +f) +2g (e -f)=0\n\nFactor out (e -f):\n\n(e -f)(e +f +2g)=0\n\nSince e \u2260f (because EF=184\u22600), we have e +f +2g=0 \u21922g= - (e +f)\n\nSo, g= -(e +f)/2\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 +2g e +17=0\n\nSubstitute g= -(e +f)/2:\n\ne\u00b2 +2*(-(e +f)/2)*e +17=0 \u2192e\u00b2 -e(e +f) +17=0 \u2192e\u00b2 -e\u00b2 -e f +17=0 \u2192-e f +17=0 \u2192e f=17 ...(3)\n\nBut we know that f= e +184 from EF=184.\n\nSo, f= e +184\n\nSubstitute into equation (3):\n\ne*(e +184)=17 \u2192e\u00b2 +184 e -17=0\n\nWhich is the same quadratic as before.\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2= [-184 \u00b1\u221a(33856 +68)]/2= [-184 \u00b1\u221a33924]/2\n\nAs before, \u221a33924= 184.22, approximately.\n\nSo, e\u2248(-184 +184.22)/2\u22480.11 or e\u2248(-184 -184.22)/2\u2248-184.11\n\nThus, f\u22480.11 +184\u2248184.11 or f\u2248-184.11 +184\u2248-0.11\n\nNow, from equation g= -(e +f)/2\n\nIf e\u22480.11, f\u2248184.11:\n\ng\u2248 -(0.11 +184.11)/2\u2248-184.22/2\u2248-92.11\n\nIf e\u2248-184.11, f\u2248-0.11:\n\ng\u2248-(-184.11 -0.11)/2\u2248184.22/2\u224892.11\n\nNow, the circle center is at (-g, -f)= (92.11,8) or (-92.11,8)\n\nWait, no, in the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +2gx +2fy=0, the center is at (-g, -f)\n\nSo, for the first case, g\u2248-92.11, f=-8\n\nCenter\u2248(92.11,8)\n\nFor the second case, g\u224892.11, f=-8\n\nCenter\u2248(-92.11,8)\n\nNow, check if point C (107,0) lies on the circle.\n\nUsing the first case, center\u2248(92.11,8)\n\nDistance from C (107,0) to center\u2248\u221a[(107 -92.11)^2 + (0 -8)^2]=\u221a[(14.89)^2 +64]\u2248\u221a(221.71 +64)=\u221a285.71\u224816.90\n\nRadius\u2248\u221a[(92.11)^2 + (-8)^2]=\u221a(8483.05 +64)=\u221a8547.05\u224892.45\n\nSo, 16.90\u226092.45, so point C is not on the circle.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case, center\u2248(-92.11,8)\n\nDistance from C (107,0) to center\u2248\u221a[(107 +92.11)^2 + (0 -8)^2]=\u221a[(199.11)^2 +64]\u2248\u221a(39644.81 +64)=\u221a39708.81\u2248199.27\n\nRadius\u2248\u221a[(-92.11)^2 + (-8)^2]= same as before\u224892.45\n\nSo, 199.27\u226092.45, so point C is not on the circle.\n\nThus, earlier conclusion that point C lies on the circle was incorrect.

So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 145.5, which can be expressed as 291/2, but the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the answer is 145 or 146.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 145.5, and the problem expects it as 291/2, but the instructions say to put the answer as an integer.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is designed so that CE is 145.5, which is 291/2, and the answer is 291/2, but the problem says integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the calculations again.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, e= [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*17)]/2= [-184 \u00b1\u221a(33856 +68)]/2= [-184 \u00b1\u221a33924]/2\n\nBut \u221a33924=184.22, so e= (-184 +184.22)/2=0.22/2=0.11 or e= (-184 -184.22)/2=-368.22/2=-184.11\n\nThus, CE=107 -e=107 - (-184.11)=291.11\n\nBut this is approximately 291.11, which is close to 291.\n\nBut earlier, when we plugged in point C, we found that CE * CF=5601.75, which is approximately 5602, which factors as 2*2801.\n\nBut 2801 is a prime number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value of CE is (291 +\u221a8481)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should express CE in terms of \u221a8481.\n\nFrom earlier, CE=199 +\u221a8481\n\nBut \u221a8481=92.11, so CE\u2248291.11\n\nBut the problem expects an integer, so perhaps the answer is 145.5, but that's not integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 145.5, and the problem expects it as 291/2, but the instructions say to put the answer as an integer.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, and the correct answer is 145.5, which is 291/2, but I'll put that as the answer.\n\n\nThe length of \\( CE \\) is \\( \\boxed{145.5} \\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out what's going on. \n\nWe have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. \n\nGiven lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. So, AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. That makes ABCD a rectangle where AB is the length and BC is the width. So, AB is longer than BC. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. EF is 184 and FG is 17, so EF is the longer side and FG is the shorter side.\n\nNow, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, that's a straight line. So, D is one point, then E, then C, then F on that line. So, the order is D-E-C-F? Or maybe another order? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but I think it's important.\n\nSince ABCD is a rectangle, AB is the length, so AB is 107, BC is 16. So, the rectangle is 107 units long and 16 units wide. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG =17. So, EF is 184, which is the length, and FG is 17, the width.\n\nSince A, D, H, G lie on a circle, this implies that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. So, the opposite angles of ADHG must add up to 180 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the property that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct property is that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the opposite sides if and only if it's a kite, which isn't necessarily the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the power of a point or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, since A, D, H, G are concyclic, then perhaps the power of point C with respect to that circle can be applied. Because point C lies on the line DF, which intersects the circle at D and G. Wait, but C is not on the circle, so maybe using the power of point C with respect to the circle ADHG.\n\nPower of a point says that for a point outside the circle, the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points is equal for any two lines through the point intersecting the circle. In this case, if line CG intersects the circle at H and G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, line CF passes through D and F, but F is not on the circle. Wait, maybe it's the line CE that passes through E, which is on the line DF, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to the points to model this situation. Coordinates might make it easier to calculate distances and use the circle condition.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let me assume that the line D-E-C-F is the x-axis. So, I can place point D at the origin (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16, so the coordinates of A would be (0, 16), B would be (107, 16), and C would be (107, 0). Wait, but if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the x-axis, so C would be at (x, 0) for some x. Wait, AB is 107, which is the length, so the sides AB and CD are both 107. So, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), and then B would be at (107, 16), and A at (0, 16). That makes sense.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH is such that E, F are on the same line as D and C, which is the x-axis. So, points D (0,0), E, C (107,0), F are collinear on the x-axis.\n\nSo, let me assign coordinates to E and F. Let's say E is at (e, 0) and F is at (f, 0). Since E and F are on the x-axis, their y-coordinates are zero.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. Wait, EF is a side of the rectangle, so EF is either the length or the width. Since EF is 184, which is much longer than FG=17, so EF is the length, FG is the width. So, from point F, moving up 17 units to point G, which would be at (f,17), and then moving left 184 units to point H, which would be at (f - 184, 17), and then down to point E, which would be at (f - 184, 0). Wait, but E is on the x-axis, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but in rectangle EFGH, EF is the base, FG is the height. So, from E, moving to F is along the x-axis, then from F, moving up to G, then from G, moving left to H, then from H down to E. So, if E is at (e,0), then F is at (e + 184, 0), because EF is 184. Then, from F, moving up 17 units to G at (e + 184, 17), and then from G moving left 184 units to H at (e, 17), and then down to E. Wait, that can't be because then H would be at (e, 17), and then from H moving down to E, which is at (e,0). That makes sense.\n\nWait, but then E is at (e, 0), F is at (e + 184, 0), G is at (e + 184, 17), H is at (e, 17). So, the rectangle EFGH is placed such that its base EF is along the x-axis from E to F, and its height is 17 units upwards.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I placed point C at (107, 0), and D at (0,0). So, in the line D-E-C-F, the order is D (0,0), E, C (107,0), F. So, E must be somewhere between D and C, or beyond C. Hmm, but EFGH is another rectangle. So, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.\n\nWait, because if E is between D and C, then F would be at E + 184 along the x-axis, which would be beyond C, since E is between D and C.\n\nSo, let me denote E as being at (k, 0), where k is between 0 and 107. Then, F would be at (k + 184, 0). But since C is at (107, 0), then F is at (k + 184, 0). But for F to be beyond C, k + 184 must be greater than 107. So, k must be greater than 107 - 184, which is negative. So, as long as E is at (k,0) with k between 0 and 107, then F is at (k+184, 0), which is beyond C at (107,0). So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, E is between D (0,0) and C (107,0), and F is beyond C at (k+184, 0).\n\nNow, the rectangle EFGH has points E at (k,0), F at (k+184,0), G at (k+184,17), H at (k,17).\n\nNow, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (k,17), G is at (k+184,17).\n\nSo, four points: A (0,16), D (0,0), H (k,17), G (k+184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nI need to find the value of k such that these four points are concyclic. Once I have k, I can find CE, which is the distance from C (107,0) to E (k,0), so it's |107 - k|.\n\nSo, the plan is to determine k such that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Then, compute CE as 107 - k, assuming E is between D and C.\n\nSo, how can I find k? Well, since four points lie on a circle, the condition is that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:\n\n|x   y   x\u00b2+y\u00b2   1|\n|0   16  0\u00b2+16\u00b2 1|\n|0   0   0\u00b2+0\u00b2  1|\n|k   17  k\u00b2+17\u00b2 1|\n|k+184 17 (k+184)^2 +17\u00b2 1|\n\nWait, but that's a 4x4 determinant, which might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties.\n\nAlternatively, since three points define a circle, I can find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, and then check whether G lies on it.\n\nLet me find the equation of the circle passing through A (0,16), D (0,0), and H (k,17).\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.\n\nPlugging in D (0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0.\n\nSo, the equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in A (0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 + 2g*0 + 2f*16 = 0 \u21d2 256 + 32f = 0 \u21d2 32f = -256 \u21d2 f = -8.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNow, plugging in H (k,17):\n\nk\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g*k -16*17 = 0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + 289 + 2gk - 272 = 0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + 2gk + 17 = 0.\n\nSo, equation is k\u00b2 + 2gk +17 = 0.\n\nNow, we need point G (k+184, 17) to lie on the same circle. So, plugging G into the circle equation:\n\n(k+184)^2 + 17^2 + 2g(k+184) -16*17 = 0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(k+184)^2 = k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 368k + 33856.\n\n17^2 = 289.\n\n2g(k+184) = 2gk + 368g.\n\n-16*17 = -272.\n\nAdding all these together:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + 33856 + 289 + 2gk + 368g - 272 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368k + 2gk) + (33856 + 289 - 272) + 368g = 0.\n\nCompute constants: 33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)k + 33873 + 368g = 0.\n\nBut from earlier, we have another equation from point H: k\u00b2 + 2gk +17 = 0.\n\nSo, let's write both equations:\n\n1) From H: k\u00b2 + 2gk +17 = 0.\n\n2) From G: k\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)k + 33873 + 368g = 0.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate k\u00b2:\n\n(k\u00b2 + (368 + 2g)k + 33873 + 368g) - (k\u00b2 + 2gk +17) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(0) + (368k) + (33873 -17) + 368g = 0 \u21d2 368k + 33856 + 368g = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\nk + (33856 / 368) + g = 0.\n\nCompute 33856 \u00f7 368:\n\nLet me see, 368 * 92 = 368*(90+2) = 33120 + 736 = 33856.\n\nSo, 33856 / 368 = 92.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nk + 92 + g = 0 \u21d2 g = - (k +92).\n\nNow, substitute g = - (k +92) into equation 1:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2*(-(k +92)) *k +17 = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nk\u00b2 -2k(k +92) +17 =0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 -2k\u00b2 -184k +17 =0 \u21d2 -k\u00b2 -184k +17 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nk\u00b2 + 184k -17 = 0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation for k:\n\nk = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\n4*1*17 =68.\n\nSo, discriminant = 33856 +68 = 33924.\n\nWhat's sqrt(33924)?\n\nLet me compute 184\u00b2 is 33856, 185\u00b2 is 34225. So, sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 185.\n\nCompute 184.5\u00b2: 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.5 + 0.5\u00b2 =33856 + 184 +0.25=34040.25. That's larger than 33924.\n\nWait, maybe 184.2\u00b2 = ?\n\n184^2=33856.\n\n184.2^2 = (184 +0.2)^2=184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2\u00b2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64.\n\nHmm, 33929.64 is higher than 33924. So, sqrt(33924) is less than 184.2.\n\nCompute 184.1^2: 184^2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1^2=33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81.\n\nStill higher than 33924? Wait no, 33892.81 is less than 33924. So, sqrt(33924) is between 184.1 and 184.2.\n\nWait, let me check 184.15^2.\n\n= (184 +0.15)^2=184^2 + 2*184*0.15 +0.15^2=33856 +55.2 +0.0225=33911.2225.\n\nStill less than 33924.\n\nCompute 184.16^2:\n\n= (184 +0.16)^2=33856 + 2*184*0.16 +0.16^2.\n\n2*184*0.16= 368*0.16=58.88.\n\n0.16^2=0.0256.\n\nSo total: 33856 +58.88 +0.0256=33914.9056.\n\nStill less than 33924.\n\n184.17^2: 2*184*0.17= 368*0.17=62.56. 0.17^2=0.0289.\n\nSo, 33856 +62.56 +0.0289=33918.5889.\n\nStill less than 33924.\n\n184.18^2: 2*184*0.18= 368*0.18=66.24; 0.18^2=0.0324.\n\nSo, 33856 +66.24 +0.0324=33922.2724.\n\nStill less than 33924.\n\n184.19^2: 2*184*0.19= 368*0.19=69.92; 0.19^2=0.0361.\n\nSo, 33856 +69.92 +0.0361=33925.9561.\n\nNow, that's higher than 33924.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924) is between 184.18 and 184.19.\n\nLet me compute 184.18 + (33924 -33922.2724)/(33925.9561 -33922.2724).\n\nDifference between 33924 and 33922.2724 is 1.7276.\n\nThe interval is 33925.9561 -33922.2724=3.6837.\n\nSo, fraction is 1.7276/3.6837 \u22480.468.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924) \u2248184.18 +0.468*(0.01)=184.18468.\n\nApproximately 184.1847.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=\u2248184.1847.\n\nThus, k = [ -184 \u00b1184.1847 ] /2.\n\nLet's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the positive root:\n\nk = [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2 \u2248 (0.1847)/2\u22480.09235.\n\nSecond, the negative root:\n\nk = [ -184 -184.1847 ] /2\u2248 (-368.1847)/2\u2248-184.09235.\n\nBut in our setup, E is between D (0,0) and C (107,0), so k must be between 0 and 107. So, the negative root is discarded, and k\u22480.09235.\n\nSo, E is at approximately (0.09235,0), which is very close to D (0,0). Hmm, but that might not make sense because EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184, so F would be at k +184 \u22480.09235+184\u2248184.09235, which is way beyond C at (107,0). So, that's okay.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. So, E is at approximately (0.09235, 0), very close to D. Then, C is at (107,0), so CE would be 107 -0.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut that seems almost 107. But let me check whether this is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the coordinates. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order could be D-E-C-F, but I assumed E is between D and C, but perhaps E is beyond C, making the order D-C-E-F. Hmm, that could change things.\n\nWait, if E is beyond C, then F would be beyond E, but since EF is 184, E would be at (107 + x, 0), and F at (107 + x +184, 0). But then, H would be at (107 + x, 17), and G at (107 + x +184, 17).\n\nBut in that case, point H would be at (107 +x,17), and G at (107 +x +184,17).\n\nBut then, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (107 +x,17), G (107 +x +184,17) would lie on a circle. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBut earlier, I assumed E is between D and C, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not fix D at (0,0). Maybe I should assign coordinates differently. Maybe assigning D at (0,0), C at (c,0), E at (e,0), F at (f,0), with e between 0 and c, or beyond c.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that I placed point C at (107,0) because BC is 16, but AB is 107. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length, so AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), B at (107,16), and A at (0,16).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH is such that E and F are on the same line as D and C, which is the x-axis. So, E is at (e,0), F at (f,0). Since EF is 184, then f - e =184.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nE: (e,0)\n\nF: (e+184, 0)\n\nG: (e+184,17)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nNow, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (e+184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nSo, I can use the condition that four points lie on a circle. Let's use the determinant method.\n\nThe condition for four points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4) to lie on a circle is that the determinant of the following matrix is zero:\n\n|x1 y1 x1\u00b2+y1\u00b2 1|\n|x2 y2 x2\u00b2+y2\u00b2 1|\n|x3 y3 x3\u00b2+y3\u00b2 1|\n|x4 y4 x4\u00b2+y4\u00b2 1|\n\nSo, plugging in the points:\n\nPoint D: (0,0,0,1)\n\nPoint A: (0,16, (0)^2 +16^2=256,1)\n\nPoint H: (e,17, e\u00b2+17\u00b2,1)\n\nPoint G: (e+184,17, (e+184)^2 +17\u00b2,1)\n\nSo, the determinant is:\n\n|0   0    0     1|\n|0  16  256    1|\n|e  17  e\u00b2+289 1|\n|e+184 17 (e+184)^2 +289 1|\n\nThis determinant should be zero.\n\nCalculating a 4x4 determinant can be tedious, but perhaps we can expand it.\n\nAlternatively, since three points define a circle, we can find the equation of the circle passing through D, A, H, and then see the condition for G to lie on it.\n\nThe equation of the circle passing through D (0,0), A (0,16), and H (e,17) can be found.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.\n\nPlugging D (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nSo, equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy =0.\n\nPlugging A (0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 \u21d2 256 +32f=0 \u21d2 f= -8.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx -16y =0.\n\nPlugging H (e,17): e\u00b2 + 289 + 2ge -16*17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +2ge -272=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +2ge +17=0.\n\nSo, equation for H: e\u00b2 + 2ge +17=0.\n\nNow, point G (e+184,17) must lie on this circle. So, plugging into the equation:\n\n(e+184)^2 +17^2 +2g(e+184) -16*17=0.\n\nExpanding:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 184\u00b2 + 289 + 2ge + 368g -272=0.\n\nCompute constants:\n\n184\u00b2=33856.\n\n33856 +289=34145.\n\n34145 -272=33873.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ne\u00b2 +368e +33873 +2ge +368g=0.\n\nFrom earlier, we have e\u00b2 +2ge +17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +2ge= -17.\n\nSubstitute e\u00b2 +2ge = -17 into the equation:\n\n(-17) +368e +33873 +368g=0 \u21d2 368e +368g +33856=0.\n\nDivide both sides by 368:\n\ne +g + (33856/368)=0.\n\nCompute 33856 \u00f7368: 33856 \u00f7368 =92 (since 368*92=33856).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\ne +g +92=0 \u21d2 g= - (e +92).\n\nNow, substitute g= - (e +92) into e\u00b2 +2ge +17=0.\n\nSo:\n\ne\u00b2 +2*(-e -92)*e +17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -2e\u00b2 -184e +17=0 \u21d2 -e\u00b2 -184e +17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation for e:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*1*17)] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2=33856.\n\n4*17=68.\n\nSo, discriminant=33856 +68=33924.\n\nsqrt(33924)= approximately 184.1847 as before.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1184.1847 ] /2.\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\ne = [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2 \u2248 (0.1847)/2\u22480.09235.\n\nThe negative root would give e\u2248(-184 -184.1847)/2\u2248-184.09235, which is negative, so we discard it.\n\nSo, e\u22480.09235.\n\nSo, point E is at (0.09235, 0), which is just a little to the right of D (0,0).\n\nNow, point C is at (107,0). So, the distance CE is |107 - e| \u2248107 -0.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem is asking for an exact value, not an approximate. So, let me compute it exactly.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nCompute sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17)=sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924).\n\nWait, can 33924 be factored into a perfect square? Let me check.\n\n33924 divided by 4 is 8481.\n\n8481: Let's see, 8481 \u00f73=2827. 2827 \u00f77=403.857, not integer. Hmm, 8481 \u00f7 11=771, since 11*771=8481.\n\nWait, 771 \u00f73=257, which is a prime. So, 33924=4*3*11*257.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).\n\nBut 8481=3*11*257. These are all primes, so sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(3*11*257), which doesn't simplify further.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 + 2*sqrt(8481) ] /2= -92 + sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, because sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). So, e = (-184 + 2*sqrt(8481))/2= (-184/2) + (2*sqrt(8481))/2= -92 + sqrt(8481).\n\nSo, e= sqrt(8481) -92.\n\nSo, CE is |107 - e|=107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)=107 +92 -sqrt(8481)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but let's compute sqrt(8481). Wait, 92\u00b2=8464, 93\u00b2=8649. So, sqrt(8481)=92.11 approximately, as 92^2=8464, so 8481-8464=17, so sqrt(8481)=92 +17/(2*92)\u224892 +0.09235=92.09235.\n\nSo, e=92.09235 -92=0.09235, which matches our earlier approximation.\n\nSo, CE=199 - sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but let's check: 92^2=8464, 8481=8464+17, so sqrt(8481)=sqrt(92\u00b2 +17)= approximately 92 + 17/(2*92)=92 + 0.09235=92.09235.\n\nSo, CE=199 -92.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the exact value. So, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Since e= sqrt(8481) -92, and CE=107 -e=107 - (sqrt(8481)-92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut wait, 199 is 107+92. That makes sense.\n\nSo, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut let me check if 8481 is a perfect square. Wait, 92\u00b2=8464, 93\u00b2=8649. So, no, 8481 isn't a perfect square. So, the exact value is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, when I substituted g = - (e +92) into e\u00b2 + 2ge +17=0, I got:\n\ne\u00b2 +2*(-e -92)*e +17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -2e\u00b2 -184e +17=0 \u21d2 -e\u00b2 -184e +17=0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184e -17=0.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, e = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nWhich is [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924) ] /2.\n\nSo, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481), so e= [ -184 \u00b12*sqrt(8481) ] /2= -92 \u00b1sqrt(8481).\n\nSince e must be positive (as it's between 0 and 107), we take e= sqrt(8481) -92.\n\nSo, CE=107 - e=107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut let me compute sqrt(8481) again. Wait, 92\u00b2=8464, 92.1\u00b2=92\u00b2 + 2*92*0.1 +0.1\u00b2=8464+18.4+0.01=8482.41, which is more than 8481. So, sqrt(8481) is between 92 and 92.1.\n\nWait, 92.09\u00b2= (92 +0.09)^2=92\u00b2 + 2*92*0.09 +0.09\u00b2=8464 +16.56 +0.0081=8480.5681.\n\nWhich is less than 8481.\n\nThen, 92.09 + delta)^2=8481.\n\nLet me compute 92.09^2=8480.5681.\n\nSo, 8481 -8480.5681=0.4319.\n\nSo, 2*92.09*delta + delta\u00b2=0.4319.\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta\u00b2 is negligible.\n\nSo, 2*92.09*delta\u22480.4319 \u21d2 delta\u22480.4319/(2*92.09)=0.4319/184.18\u22480.002345.\n\nSo, sqrt(8481)=92.09 +0.002345\u224892.092345.\n\nSo, CE=199 -92.092345\u2248106.907655, which is approximately 106.9077.\n\nBut the problem expects an exact value, so CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but perhaps 8481 can be expressed in terms of other squares or factors. Let me check 8481.\n\n8481 \u00f73=2827.\n\n2827 \u00f77=403.857\u2026 Not integer.\n\n2827 \u00f713=217.461\u2026 Not integer.\n\nWait, 2827 \u00f717=166.294\u2026 Not integer.\n\nHmm, perhaps 8481 is 93^2=8649, no. 8481 is 92.092345^2, which isn't an integer. So, I think we have to leave it as sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but 8481= 92^2 +17=8464+17=8481.\n\nSo, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(92^2 +17).\n\nBut that doesn't help in simplifying.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 199 - sqrt(8481). But let me compute sqrt(8481) again.\n\nWait, 92^2=8464, 92*93=8556. So, 92*93=8556, which is more than 8481. So, no, that approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using similar triangles or other geometric properties without assigning coordinates.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, then angle ADG is equal to angle AHG because they subtend the same chord AG.\n\nWait, point A is (0,16), D is (0,0), H is (e,17), G is (e+184,17).\n\nHmm, maybe using slopes or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle ADHG.\n\nPower of a point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the distances from C to D and C to F, since D and F are the points where line DF (which passes through C) intersects the circle.\n\nWait, but point C is on DF, and D and F are points on the line. So, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF.\n\nBut also, the power of point C can be expressed as CA * CB if CA and CB are tangent lengths, but I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nWait, no, the power of a point C with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from C to the two intersection points of any line through C with the circle.\n\nIn this case, line CG passes through C and G, but G is on the circle. So, line CG intersects the circle at G and another point. Wait, no, because G is on the circle, but CG is a tangent? No, because if CG passes through G, which is on the circle, then CG is a secant line, but since G is on the circle, it's a tangent if CG touches the circle only at G, which it does. So, in that case, the power of point C would be CG^2.\n\nWait, no, if CG is a tangent, then the power is CG^2. But if CG is a secant, it's CG * CH, where H is another intersection point. But in this case, CG intersects the circle only at G, because G is on the circle, but H is also on the circle. Wait, no, H is another point on the circle.\n\nWait, let me think again. The line CG passes through points C, G, and H. Wait, no, because in our coordinate setup, G is at (e+184,17), and H is at (e,17). So, line CG would go from C (107,0) to G (e+184,17), and H is at (e,17). So, line CG passes through G and H? No, because H is at (e,17), which is a different point. So, line CG passes through C, G, but not H. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF.\n\nWait, line DF passes through D, E, C, F. So, points D and F are on the line DF, and C is a point on DF between D and F.\n\nSo, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF = (distance from C to D) * (distance from C to F).\n\nBut also, the power of point C can be calculated as CG^2 - r^2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CA * CB, but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with the coordinate approach. From that, we have CE=199 -sqrt(8481). But let me compute sqrt(8481) again to see if it's a perfect square.\n\nWait, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 8481 is between them. Let me see, 92*93=8556, which is higher than 8481. So, 8481 is not a perfect square.\n\nHmm, so CE=199 -sqrt(8481). But perhaps this can be simplified further. Let me compute 8481.\n\nWait, 8481 \u00f7 3=2827.\n\n2827 \u00f7 7=403.857\u2026 Not integer.\n\n2827 \u00f7 13=217.461\u2026 Not integer.\n\n2827 \u00f7 17=166.294\u2026 Not integer.\n\n2827 \u00f7 19=148.789\u2026 Not integer.\n\nHmm, perhaps 8481= 8481= 9*942.333\u2026 Not helpful.\n\nWait, 8481= 81*104.703\u2026 Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 8481= (something)^2 + something else.\n\nBut I don't think that helps. So, perhaps the exact answer is 199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again because the answer seems a bit messy, and I might have made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, when I set up the coordinates, I placed D at (0,0), C at (107,0), E at (e,0), F at (e+184,0). Then, H is at (e,17), G at (e+184,17).\n\nThen, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (e+184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nSo, the condition is that these four points lie on a circle, leading to the equation which gave e= sqrt(8481) -92.\n\nSo, CE=107 -e=107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but let me compute 199 -sqrt(8481):\n\nsqrt(8481)= approximately 92.09235.\n\nSo, 199 -92.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem expects an exact value. So, perhaps the answer is 107 - e=107 - (sqrt(8481)-92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the correct answer is 107 - (sqrt(8481)-92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem without coordinates.\n\nLet me think again. Since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, then the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CD * CF.\n\nWait, point C lies on line DF, which intersects the circle at D and F. Wait, but F is not on the circle. Wait, no, F is a point on the line DF, but not necessarily on the circle. So, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF.\n\nBut also, the power of point C can be expressed as CG^2 - r^2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the property that the power of point C is equal to CA * CB, but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nPower of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF.\n\nBut CD is the distance from C to D, which is 107 units (since CD is the length of the rectangle ABCD, which is 107).\n\nCF is the distance from C to F. Since F is on the x-axis at (e+184,0), and C is at (107,0), CF= |e+184 -107|=|e +77|.\n\nSo, power of C is CD * CF=107*(e +77).\n\nBut also, the power of point C can be calculated as CG^2 - r^2, where CG is the distance from C to G, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nBut I don't know the radius, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that CG is the distance from C to G, which is sqrt( (e+184 -107)^2 + (17 -0)^2 )=sqrt( (e+77)^2 + 17^2 ).\n\nSo, CG^2= (e+77)^2 + 289.\n\nBut the power of point C is also equal to CG^2 - r^2, but without knowing r, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power of point C is equal to CA * CB, but CA and CB are not necessarily tangent lengths.\n\nWait, point A is on the circle, so CA is a secant. Wait, no, point A is on the circle, so CA is a tangent? No, because point A is on the circle, so the tangent at A would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me get back to the coordinate approach.\n\nFrom earlier, we have CE=199 -sqrt(8481). But let me compute sqrt(8481) exactly.\n\nWait, 8481=92^2 +17, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps 8481= (92 + x)^2=92^2 +184x +x^2.\n\nSet 92^2 +184x +x^2=8481.\n\nSo, 8464 +184x +x^2=8481 \u21d2 x^2 +184x + (8464 -8481)=0 \u21d2 x^2 +184x -17=0.\n\nWhich is the same quadratic equation as before, giving x= [ -184 \u00b1sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nWhich is the same as e= sqrt(8481) -92.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nThus, CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects an integer answer. So, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again.\n\nFrom the condition that four points lie on a circle, I arrived at e^2 +184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e= [ -184 + sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ] /2= [ -184 + sqrt(33856 +68) ] /2= [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] /2.\n\nBut sqrt(33924)=184.1847, so e\u22480.09235.\n\nThus, CE=107 -e\u2248107 -0.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut since the problem gives all integer lengths, perhaps the answer is 107.\n\nBut that seems too close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me check the initial setup again.\n\nI placed D at (0,0), C at (107,0), E at (e,0), F at (e+184,0). Then, H at (e,17), G at (e+184,17).\n\nPoints A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (e+184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nSo, the condition is that these four points are concyclic. So, I used the determinant approach and ended up with e\u22480.09235, leading to CE\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut perhaps the exact value is 107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but 199 -sqrt(8481)=199 -92.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact value in terms of the given lengths, perhaps involving the Pythagorean theorem or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach using similar triangles or other properties.\n\nWait, let me consider triangles ADG and EFG.\n\nWait, rectangle ABCD has AB=107, BC=16. So, AD=BC=16, AB=107.\n\nRectangle EFGH has EF=184, FG=17. So, EH=FG=17, EF=184.\n\nSo, perhaps triangle ADG is similar to triangle EFG, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that AD=16, EH=17, but I don't see a direct relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance between the two rectangles is such that the circles align in a particular way.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing a clear geometric relation here. So, perhaps the coordinate approach is the way to go, leading to CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut 8481= 9*942.333\u2026 Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 8481= 3*2827, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the determinant. Let me re-examine that.\n\nThe determinant for the four points being concyclic is:\n\n|0   0    0     1|\n|0  16  256    1|\n|e  17  e\u00b2+289 1|\n|e+184 17 (e+184)^2 +289 1|\n\nExpanding this determinant:\n\nThe determinant of a 4x4 matrix can be expanded, but it's quite involved. Alternatively, using the property that if four points lie on a circle, the cross product condition holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the power of point C.\n\nWait, the power of point C with respect to the circle is CD * CF = 107*(e + 184 -107)=107*(e +77).\n\nBut also, the power of point C can be expressed as CA^2 - r^2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, point A is on the circle, so the power of point C with respect to the circle is equal to CA^2 - r^2, but I don't know r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that CA is a secant from C to the circle, passing through A and D. So, power of point C is CA * CD.\n\nWait, but CA is the distance from C to A, which is sqrt(107^2 +16^2)=sqrt(11449 +256)=sqrt(11705).\n\nAnd CD is the distance from C to D, which is 107.\n\nSo, power of point C is CA * CD= sqrt(11705)*107.\n\nBut also, power of point C is equal to CG^2 - r^2, but without knowing r, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the power of point C is equal to CG * CH, where H is another intersection point on line CG.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure where H is. H is at (e,17), so line CG goes from C (107,0) to G (e+184,17), but H is at (e,17), which is not on line CG unless e+184=e, which is not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nLet me go back to the coordinate approach and accept that CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut wait, 8481= 92^2 +17, and 92 is BC=16? No, BC is 16, but 92 is from the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me recompute the quadratic equation.\n\nFrom the condition that four points lie on a circle, we derived:\n\ne^2 + 184e -17=0.\n\nSo, e= [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184^2 +4*17) ] /2.\n\nWhich is [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(33856 +68) ] /2= [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924) ] /2.\n\nsqrt(33924)=184.1847, so e= [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2\u22480.1847/2\u22480.09235.\n\nThus, CE=107 -0.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem expects an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the order of the points is different. Maybe E is beyond C, so the line is D-C-E-F, making E at (107 +x,0), and F at (107 +x +184,0).\n\nIn that case, point H would be at (107 +x,17), and G at (107 +x +184,17).\n\nThen, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (107 +x,17), G (107 +x +184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nSo, point E is at (107 +x,0), F at (107 +x +184,0).\n\nH is at (107 +x,17), G at (107 +x +184,17).\n\nSo, now, the four points on the circle are:\n\nA (0,16), D (0,0), H (107 +x,17), G (107 +x +184,17).\n\nSo, let's find the condition for these four points to lie on a circle.\n\nUsing the general equation of the circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c=0.\n\nPlugging in D (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nSo, equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy=0.\n\nPlugging in A (0,16): 0 +256 +0 +32f=0 \u21d232f= -256 \u21d2f= -8.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx -16y=0.\n\nPlugging in H (107 +x,17):\n\n(107 +x)^2 +17^2 +2g(107 +x) -16*17=0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(107 +x)^2=107\u00b2 +214x +x\u00b2=11449 +214x +x\u00b2.\n\n17\u00b2=289.\n\n2g(107 +x)=214g +2gx.\n\n-16*17= -272.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n11449 +214x +x\u00b2 +289 +214g +2gx -272=0 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (214 +2g)x + (11449 +289 -272) +214g=0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n11449 +289=11738; 11738 -272=11466.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + (214 +2g)x +11466 +214g=0.\n\nNow, plugging in G (107 +x +184,17)= (291 +x,17).\n\nSo, x=291 +x? Wait, no, the x here is the variable in the equation, but the point's x-coordinate is 291 +x. Wait, perhaps I should use a different variable.\n\nWait, let me denote the x-coordinate of G as X=107 +x +184=291 +x.\n\nSo, plugging G (291 +x,17) into the circle equation:\n\n(291 +x)^2 +17^2 +2g(291 +x) -16*17=0.\n\nExpanding:\n\n(291 +x)^2=291\u00b2 +2*291x +x\u00b2=84681 +582x +x\u00b2.\n\n17\u00b2=289.\n\n2g(291 +x)=582g +2gx.\n\n-16*17= -272.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n84681 +582x +x\u00b2 +289 +582g +2gx -272=0 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (582 +2g)x + (84681 +289 -272) +582g=0.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n84681 +289=84970; 84970 -272=84698.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 + (582 +2g)x +84698 +582g=0.\n\nNow, we have two equations from H and G:\n\n1) From H: x\u00b2 + (214 +2g)x +11466 +214g=0.\n\n2) From G: x\u00b2 + (582 +2g)x +84698 +582g=0.\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (582 +2g)x +84698 +582g) - (x\u00b2 + (214 +2g)x +11466 +214g)=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + (582 -214)x + (84698 -11466) + (582g -214g)=0.\n\nSo:\n\n368x +73232 +368g=0.\n\nDivide by 368:\n\nx + (73232 /368) +g=0.\n\nCompute 73232 \u00f7368:\n\n368*200=73,600. So, 368*199=73,600 -368=73,232.\n\nSo, 73232 \u00f7368=199.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nx +199 +g=0 \u21d2g= -x -199.\n\nNow, substitute g= -x -199 into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + (214 +2*(-x -199))x +11466 +214*(-x -199)=0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + (214 -2x -398)x +11466 -214x -42676=0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(214 -2x -398)x= (-184 -2x)x= -184x -2x\u00b2.\n\n11466 -42676= -31210.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 -184x -2x\u00b2 -214x -31210=0 \u21d2 -x\u00b2 -398x -31210=0 \u21d2x\u00b2 +398x +31210=0.\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation:\n\nx = [ -398 \u00b1 sqrt(398^2 -4*1*31210) ] /2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n398^2=158,404.\n\n4*31210=124,840.\n\nSo, discriminant=158,404 -124,840=33,564.\n\nsqrt(33,564)=183.2, because 183^2=33,489, 184^2=33,856. So, sqrt(33,564)=183.2 approximately.\n\nWait, but let me compute it exactly.\n\n183^2=33,489.\n\n33,564 -33,489=75.\n\nSo, sqrt(33,564)=183 +75/(2*183)=183 +75/366\u2248183 +0.205=183.205.\n\nSo, x= [ -398 \u00b1183.205 ] /2.\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\nx= [ -398 +183.205 ] /2= [ -214.795 ] /2\u2248-107.3975.\n\nBut x represents the distance beyond C, so it should be positive. The negative root would give x\u2248(-398 -183.205)/2\u2248-581.1025/2\u2248-290.55125, which is negative and thus invalid.\n\nSo, x\u2248-107.3975, which is negative, which doesn't make sense in this setup because E is beyond C, so x should be positive.\n\nThis suggests that there's no solution in this case, meaning that E cannot be beyond C. Therefore, the earlier assumption that E is between D and C must be correct, leading to CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut the problem expects an integer answer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is D-E-C-F, with E between D and C, and F beyond C.\n\nSo, E is at (e,0), F at (e +184,0).\n\nPoint C is at (107,0).\n\nSo, since E is between D and C, e is between 0 and 107.\n\nThus, CE=107 -e.\n\nFrom earlier, e= sqrt(8481) -92\u22480.09235.\n\nThus, CE\u2248107 -0.09235\u2248106.90765.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact value, so CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nWait, but perhaps 199 -sqrt(8481)=107 +92 -sqrt(8481)=107 + (92 -sqrt(8481)).\n\nBut sqrt(8481)=92.09235, so 92 -sqrt(8481)= -0.09235.\n\nThus, 107 -0.09235=106.90765.\n\nBut this is approximately 107, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the exact value is 107.\n\nWait, but in the coordinate approach, the answer is 199 -sqrt(8481), which is approximately 106.90765, which is very close to 107, but not exactly.\n\nGiven that all the given lengths are integers, perhaps the answer is 107, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the exact value in terms of sqrt(8481), so CE=199 -sqrt(8481).\n\nBut I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I think the answer is 107, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given rectangles and the circle condition. By assigning coordinates and using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we derive the length of CE as \\(199 - \\sqrt{8481}\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{199 - \\sqrt{8481}}",
