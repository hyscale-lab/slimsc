      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB\u00b7AC.\n\nHmm, okay. So we're dealing with a triangle ABC, and we're given some specific conditions. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. Also, the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. We need to find the product of sides AB and AC.\n\nFirst, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.\n\nGiven that IA is perpendicular to OI, this seems like an important condition. I might need to use coordinate geometry or vector methods, but maybe there's a synthetic approach. Let me think.\n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me confirm. Oh, yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, in this case, OI would be sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13). That's useful.\n\nBut wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, we have IA perpendicular to OI. That means triangle IOA is a right triangle at I. So, by Pythagoras, OA\u00b2 = IO\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. So, 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2. Therefore, IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156. So IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Okay, so IA is 2\u221a39.\n\nBut IA is the length of the inradius in the direction from I to A. Wait, no. IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A. So, IA is actually the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is not the same as the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, like the altitude from I to BC, AC, or AB.\n\nSo, IA is the distance from I to A. I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and the inradius. Let me recall the formula. I think it's IA = r / sin(A/2). Let me verify that.\n\nYes, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since we found IA to be 2\u221a39, and r is 6, we can write:\n\n2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let me compute it step by step. So,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2\u221a39) = 3 / \u221a39.\n\nWe can rationalize the denominator:\n\n3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nOkay, so now we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x = 1.\n\nSo, cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = \u221a(130)/13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = \u221a130 /13.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to find AB \u00b7 AC. Let's denote the sides opposite to angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So, BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.\n\nWait, no, actually, the standard notation is BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. So, the side opposite angle A is a, opposite B is c, opposite C is b? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. So, BC is side a, AC is side b, AB is side c.\n\nSo, AB is side c, AC is side b, BC is side a. So, the product AB \u00b7 AC is c\u00b7b. So, we need to find bc.\n\nWe need to find bc. Hmm. Let me think about how to relate this to the given information.\n\nI know that in a triangle, several formulas relate the sides to the inradius and circumradius. For example, the area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area is (a b c) / (4R). So, these could be useful.\n\nLet me write down some key formulas:\n\n1. Area (\u0394) = r * s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\n2. Area (\u0394) = (a b c) / (4 R).\n\n3. The Law of Sines: a / sin A = 2 R, similarly for b and c.\n\nSo, a = 2 R sin A, b = 2 R sin B, c = 2 R sin C.\n\nSo, bc = (2 R sin B)(2 R sin C) = 4 R\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, since we have information about angles, maybe using trigonometric identities related to angle A would help.\n\nWait, we found sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). So, perhaps we can find angle A, or at least express other terms in terms of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for IA. Wait, I used IA = r / sin(A/2), but perhaps there are other expressions for IA in terms of the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier. Let me try that.\n\nLet me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, since OA is the circumradius, all the vertices lie on a circle of radius 13.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s place vertex A somewhere on the circle. Let me place it at (13, 0) for simplicity. Then, points B and C are somewhere on the circle of radius 13.\n\nThe incenter I has coordinates (x, y), and the line IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI.\n\nSince O is at (0,0) and I is at (x,y), the vector OI is (x,y). The vector IA is A - I, which is (13 - x, 0 - y).\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo,\n\n(13 - x) * x + (0 - y) * y = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n13x - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 0\n\nBut also, since I is the incenter, it must satisfy the inradius condition. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.\n\nBut maybe that's a bit complicated to handle in coordinates. Alternatively, since I is the incenter, its coordinates can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, in barycentric coordinates, the incenter has coordinates proportional to the sides a, b, c. But maybe that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since the inradius is 6, and the area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and the area is also (a b c)/(4 R). So, perhaps I can write:\n\n\u0394 = r*s = 6*s\n\n\u0394 = (a b c)/(4 *13) = (a b c)/52\n\nSo, 6*s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.\n\nHmm, but I don't know s yet, so that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express bc in terms of angle A.\n\nWait, using the Law of Sines, a = 2 R sin A = 26 sin A.\n\nSimilarly, b = 26 sin B, c = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, bc = 26\u00b2 sin B sin C.\n\nAlso, since in any triangle, angles A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C can be expressed in terms of angle A.\n\nRecall that sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A,\n\ncos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A.\n\nSo, sin B sin C = [cos(B - C) + cos A]/2.\n\nHmm, but that introduces cos(B - C), which I don't know yet. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we know angle A/2, maybe using product-to-sum formulas or other identities.\n\nWait, we have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), so maybe we can find expressions involving angle A.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the formula for the inradius r = (\u0394)/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWe also have the formula for the area in terms of the circumradius: \u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R). So, 6 = \u0394 / s => \u0394 = 6 s.\n\nSo, 6 s = (a b c)/(4 *13) => a b c = 6 s *52 = 312 s.\n\nBut without knowing s, it's still tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A. We had IA = 2\u221a39, which we expressed as r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39. So, sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39 = \u221a39/13.\n\nSo, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13, as before.\n\nFrom here, we can find cos(A/2) = \u221a(1 - (\u221a39/13)^2) = \u221a(1 - 39/169) = \u221a(130/169) = \u221a130 /13.\n\nSo, cos(A/2) = \u221a130 /13.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, angle A is at vertex A, and we have the inradius and the distance from inradius to A.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, we already did that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the sides in terms of the angles.\n\nWait, let me recall that in a triangle,\n\ncos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). Wait, yes, that's the double-angle formula. So,\n\ncos A = 1 - 2*( (\u221a39)/13 )\u00b2 = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169.\n\nSo, cos A = 91/169.\n\nHmm, so angle A has cosine 91/169. That might be useful.\n\nSo, cos A = 91/169. So, sin A can be found using sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A =1.\n\nsin A = sqrt(1 - (91/169)^2) = sqrt( (169\u00b2 - 91\u00b2)/169\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (28561 - 8281)/28561 ) = sqrt(20280/28561 ).\n\nSimplify sqrt(20280/28561):\n\n20280 = 4*5070 = 4*5*1014 = 4*5*2*507 = 4*5*2*3*169 = 4*5*2*3*13\u00b2.\n\nSo, sqrt(20280) = sqrt(4*5*2*3*13\u00b2) = 2*sqrt(5*2*3)*13 = 2*sqrt(30)*13.\n\nWait, let me compute 20280: 20280 divided by 4 is 5070. 5070 divided by 2 is 2535. 2535 divided by 5 is 507. 507 divided by 3 is 169, which is 13\u00b2. So, 20280 = 4 * 2 * 5 * 3 *13\u00b2. So,\n\nsqrt(20280) = sqrt(4 * 2 *5 *3 *13\u00b2) = 2 * sqrt(60) *13.\n\nWait, 60 = 4*15, so sqrt(60)=2*sqrt(15). So,\n\nsqrt(20280) = 2 * 2 * sqrt(15) *13 = 4 *13 * sqrt(15) = 52 sqrt(15).\n\nTherefore, sqrt(20280/28561) = 52 sqrt(15) / 169.\n\nSo, sin A = 52\u221a15 /169.\n\nSimplify: 52 and 169 have a common factor of 13. 52 \u00f713=4, 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, sin A = (4\u221a15)/13.\n\nSo, sin A = 4\u221a15/13.\n\nNow, using the Law of Sines, a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*(4\u221a15/13) = 2*4\u221a15 = 8\u221a15.\n\nSo, side a (which is BC) is 8\u221a15.\n\nHmm, okay. So, a = 8\u221a15.\n\nNow, we need to find bc. Since sides b and c are AC and AB respectively, which are opposite angles B and C.\n\nWe can express b and c in terms of angles B and C.\n\nFrom the Law of Sines:\n\nb = 2 R sin B = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nSo, bc = (26 sin B)(26 sin C) = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, bc = 676 sin B sin C.\n\nWe need to find sin B sin C.\n\nBut we know that angles B + C = \u03c0 - A. So, we can use the identity for sin B sin C.\n\nRecall that:\n\nsin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - cos(B + C)] / 2.\n\nSince B + C = \u03c0 - A,\n\ncos(B + C) = cos(\u03c0 - A) = -cos A = -91/169.\n\nSo,\n\nsin B sin C = [cos(B - C) - (-91/169)] / 2 = [cos(B - C) + 91/169]/2.\n\nBut this still leaves us with cos(B - C), which we don't know. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using another identity. Let me think.\n\nWe also know that in triangle ABC, the product bc can be related to other terms.\n\nWait, we have a, b, c, R, r, and other elements. Let me see.\n\nWe have a = 8\u221a15, R =13, r=6.\n\nWe also have the formula for area:\n\n\u0394 = r*s = 6s,\n\n\u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R) = (8\u221a15 * b * c)/(4*13) = (8\u221a15 bc)/52 = (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 6s = (2\u221a15 bc)/13 => bc = (6s *13)/(2\u221a15) = (78 s)/(2\u221a15) = (39 s)/\u221a15.\n\nBut we also have s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nHmm, but without knowing b and c individually, it's hard to proceed. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from the inradius to vertex A.\n\nWait, earlier we found IA = 2\u221a39, and we used IA = r / sin(A/2). But perhaps there's another formula involving IA, like in terms of the sides.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be expressed as:\n\nIA = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2),\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Hmm, yes, I think that's a formula. The distance from the inradius to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2.\n\nWe know IA\u00b2 = (2\u221a39)^2 = 4*39 = 156.\n\nr\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 => (s - a)^2 = 156 -36 = 120 => s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, s - a = 2\u221a30.\n\nBut s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30.\n\nSo, (b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30 => b + c - a = 4\u221a30.\n\nBut a =8\u221a15, so:\n\nb + c = a +4\u221a30 =8\u221a15 +4\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay. So, b + c =8\u221a15 +4\u221a30.\n\nBut we also know that the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nSo, s = [8\u221a15 + b + c]/2 = [8\u221a15 + (8\u221a15 +4\u221a30)] /2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because b + c =8\u221a15 +4\u221a30, so:\n\ns = [a + b + c]/2 = [8\u221a15 + (8\u221a15 +4\u221a30)] /2 = [16\u221a15 +4\u221a30]/2 =8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s =8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, now, let's write down what we have:\n\ns =8\u221a15 +2\u221a30,\n\na =8\u221a15,\n\nand we have bc = (39 s)/\u221a15, from earlier.\n\nSo, bc = (39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30))/\u221a15.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\n39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30) = 39*8\u221a15 + 39*2\u221a30 = 312\u221a15 +78\u221a30.\n\nThen, divide by \u221a15:\n\n(312\u221a15 +78\u221a30)/\u221a15 = [312\u221a15 / \u221a15] + [78\u221a30 / \u221a15] = 312 + 78\u221a(30/15) = 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, bc = 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nHmm, but let me check the computation again, because 312 +78\u221a2 seems a bit strange, but let's see.\n\nWait, bc = (39 s)/\u221a15, and s =8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo,\n\n(39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30))/\u221a15 =39*(8\u221a15)/\u221a15 + 39*(2\u221a30)/\u221a15.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 39*8\u221a15 / \u221a15 = 39*8 = 312.\n\nSecond term: 39*2\u221a30 / \u221a15 = 78 * (\u221a30 / \u221a15) =78 * \u221a(30/15) =78 *\u221a2.\n\nSo, indeed, bc = 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I thought the answer would be an integer, but 312 +78\u221a2 is not an integer. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check.\n\nWait, bc = (39 s)/\u221a15, and s is 8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, 39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30) =39*8\u221a15 +39*2\u221a30 =312\u221a15 +78\u221a30.\n\nThen, dividing each term by \u221a15:\n\n312\u221a15 / \u221a15 =312,\n\n78\u221a30 / \u221a15 =78*(\u221a30 / \u221a15)=78*(\u221a(30/15))=78*\u221a2.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nHmm, but the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, so that's 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut wait, that's not an integer, which is a bit odd because in Olympiad problems, the answer is usually an integer. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me retrace.\n\nWe had IA perpendicular to OI, which led us to find that IA=2\u221a39.\n\nThen, using IA = r / sin(A/2), we found sin(A/2)=\u221a39 /13.\n\nThen, from that, we found cos(A/2)=\u221a130 /13.\n\nThen, we found cos A =1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2)=1 - 2*(39/169)=1 -78/169=91/169.\n\nThen, sin A = sqrt(1 - (91/169)^2)=sqrt( (28561 - 8281)/28561 )=sqrt(20280/28561)=sqrt(20280)/169.\n\nWe found sqrt(20280)=52\u221a15, so sin A=52\u221a15/169=4\u221a15/13.\n\nSo, a=2R sin A=26*(4\u221a15/13)=8\u221a15. That seems correct.\n\nThen, we tried to find bc.\n\nWe used the formula for the area: \u0394=6s= (a b c)/(4*13)= (8\u221a15 bc)/52= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 6s=(2\u221a15 bc)/13 => bc=(6s *13)/(2\u221a15)= (78s)/(2\u221a15)=39s/\u221a15.\n\nThen, we found s by using the formula IA\u00b2=r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2=156=36 + (s -a)^2 => s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s= (a +b +c)/2.\n\nBut since b +c -a=4\u221a30,\n\nThen, s=(a +b +c)/2 = (a + (b +c))/2 = (a + (a +4\u221a30))/2= (2a +4\u221a30)/2= a +2\u221a30.\n\nBut a=8\u221a15, so s=8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nThen, bc=39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)/\u221a15.\n\nWhich gives bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nWait, is that formula correct? Let me check.\n\nYes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2). So, IA\u00b2=r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the area formula. Let me double-check.\n\nArea \u0394= r*s=6s.\n\nAlso, \u0394= (a b c)/(4 R)= (8\u221a15 *b*c)/(4*13)= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 6s= (2\u221a15 bc)/13 => bc= (6s *13)/(2\u221a15)= (78 s)/(2\u221a15)= 39 s /\u221a15.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, s=8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, bc=39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)/\u221a15= 39*(8\u221a15 /\u221a15 + 2\u221a30 /\u221a15)=39*(8 + 2\u221a2)=39*8 +39*2\u221a2=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but the problem says to find AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, so the answer would be 312 +78\u221a2. But that doesn't seem to be an integer, which is unexpected. Maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps my coordinate approach was incorrect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, earlier, I placed vertex A at (13,0), O at (0,0), and I at (x,y). Then, IA is perpendicular to OI, so (13 -x)x + (0 - y)y=0.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to model this. Alternatively, perhaps I can use trigonometric identities in triangle AIO.\n\nWait, triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so OA\u00b2=OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nWe had OA=13, OI=\u221a13, IA=2\u221a39.\n\nSo, 13\u00b2= (\u221a13)^2 + (2\u221a39)^2 => 169=13 +4*39=13+156=169. So that's correct.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the sides using other relationships. Let me think.\n\nWe have a=8\u221a15.\n\nWe have s=8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, s= a +2\u221a30.\n\nBut s= (a +b +c)/2= (8\u221a15 +b +c)/2.\n\nSo, 8\u221a15 +b +c=2s=2*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)=16\u221a15 +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b +c=16\u221a15 +4\u221a30 -8\u221a15=8\u221a15 +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, b +c=8\u221a15 +4\u221a30.\n\nSo, we have b +c=8\u221a15 +4\u221a30,\n\nand bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Heron's formula.\n\nWe can compute the area in two ways: \u0394=6s=6*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)=48\u221a15 +12\u221a30.\n\nAlso, \u0394= (a b c)/(4R)= (8\u221a15 * bc)/(4*13)= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 48\u221a15 +12\u221a30 = (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\n13*(48\u221a15 +12\u221a30)=2\u221a15 bc.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n13*48\u221a15=624\u221a15,\n\n13*12\u221a30=156\u221a30.\n\nSo, 624\u221a15 +156\u221a30=2\u221a15 bc.\n\nDivide both sides by 2\u221a15:\n\n(624\u221a15 +156\u221a30)/(2\u221a15)= bc.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n624\u221a15 / (2\u221a15)=624/2=312,\n\n156\u221a30 / (2\u221a15)=78*(\u221a30/\u221a15)=78*\u221a2.\n\nSo, bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, despite bc being an expression with a radical, it's correct. So, the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nWait, but the problem says to find AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, and that's equal to 312 +78\u221a2. But the problem might expect an integer, so maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me see.\n\n312 +78\u221a2= 78*(4) +78\u221a2=78*(4 +\u221a2). Hmm, 78 is 39*2, but not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, but 312=78*4, so 312 +78\u221a2=78*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nSo, bc=78*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nHmm, but the problem is asking for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, so that's the answer. But wait, 78*(4 +\u221a2) is 312 +78\u221a2, which is approximately 312 + 111.1 = 423.1, which is roughly an integer, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beginning. Let me check the area expressions again.\n\nWe have \u0394=6s and \u0394=(a b c)/(4 R).\n\nSo, 6s= (a b c)/(4 R) => a b c=24 R s.\n\nWait, no, 6s= (a b c)/(4 R) => a b c=24 R s.\n\nWait, 6s= (a b c)/(4 R) => multiply both sides by 4 R: 24 R s= a b c.\n\nSince R=13, 24*13=312, so a b c=312 s.\n\nWait, earlier I had a b c=312 s, which is correct.\n\nBut then, from the Law of Sines, a=8\u221a15, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.\n\nSo, a b c=8\u221a15 *26 sin B *26 sin C=8\u221a15 *676 sin B sin C=5408\u221a15 sin B sin C.\n\nBut from earlier, a b c=312 s=312*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)=2496\u221a15 +624\u221a30.\n\nSo, 5408\u221a15 sin B sin C=2496\u221a15 +624\u221a30.\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a15:\n\n5408 sin B sin C=2496 +624\u221a2.\n\nSo, sin B sin C=(2496 +624\u221a2)/5408.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 8:\n\n(312 +78\u221a2)/676.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(312/676) + (78\u221a2)/676= (78*4 +78\u221a2)/ (78*8.666...).\n\nWait, 676 is 26\u00b2, which is 4*169=4*13\u00b2.\n\nWait, 312=78*4, 676=78*8.666... Hmm, maybe factor 78:\n\n78=6*13.\n\nSo, 312=6*13*4,\n\n676=6*13*8.666... Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\n(312 +78\u221a2)/676= (78*(4 +\u221a2))/ (78*8.666...).\n\nWait, 676 divided by 78 is 676/78=8.666..., which is 26/3.\n\nWait, 78*8.666...=78*(26/3)= (78/3)*26=26*26=676.\n\nSo, sin B sin C=(4 +\u221a2)/(26/3)= (4 +\u221a2)*3/26= (12 +3\u221a2)/26.\n\nHmm, but earlier we had bc=676 sin B sin C.\n\nSo, bc=676*(12 +3\u221a2)/26= (676/26)*(12 +3\u221a2)=26*(12 +3\u221a2)=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, despite bc being 312 +78\u221a2, which is approximately 312 +111.1=423.1, the exact value is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for AB\u00b7AC, which is bc, so that's 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in using the formula IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2).\n\nSo, IA\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2=36 + (s -a)^2=156.\n\nSo, (s -a)^2=120, so s -a=2\u221a30.\n\nThus, s= a +2\u221a30=8\u221a15 +2\u221a30.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is indeed 312 +78\u221a2, but I was expecting an integer. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 78(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the form, so maybe that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step of calculating OI.\n\nWait, Euler's formula: OI\u00b2= R(R - 2r).\n\nSo, R=13, r=6,\n\nOI\u00b2=13*(13-12)=13*1=13,\n\nso OI=\u221a13. Correct.\n\nThen, triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so OA\u00b2=OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2,\n\n13\u00b2=13 + IA\u00b2,\n\nso IA\u00b2=169 -13=156,\n\nIA=\u221a156=2\u221a39. Correct.\n\nSo, that part is correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct, so the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut let me check once more.\n\nWait, bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 78 out: 78*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut 78 is 6*13, so maybe 6*13*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, which is approximately 312 + 111.1 =423.1.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the form, so perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I can rationalize or find another expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, which is 78*(4 +\u221a2). But that's as simplified as it gets.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the area formula.\n\nWait, \u0394= r*s=6s,\n\n\u0394= (a b c)/(4R)= (8\u221a15 *b *c)/(4*13)= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 6s= (2\u221a15 bc)/13,\n\n=> bc= (6s *13)/(2\u221a15)= (78 s)/(2\u221a15)=39 s /\u221a15.\n\nSo, bc=39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)/\u221a15.\n\nWhich is 39*8\u221a15 /\u221a15 +39*2\u221a30 /\u221a15=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut the problem states that the last line should be the integer answer in a box, so perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Maybe the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, but I need to see if that's an integer or if I missed a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute 78\u221a2 numerically to see if it's close to an integer.\n\n78\u221a2\u224878*1.4142\u224878*1.414\u2248110.532.\n\nSo, 312 +110.532\u2248422.532. Hmm, close to 423, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 423, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of bc.\n\nWait, bc=39 s /\u221a15,\n\ns=8\u221a15 +2\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\nbc=39*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)/\u221a15=39*(8\u221a15 /\u221a15 +2\u221a30 /\u221a15)=39*(8 + 2\u221a2)=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is indeed 312 +78\u221a2, so I should present that.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify the form, and it's a math competition problem, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as 78(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut let me think again about the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: Using trigonometric identities.\n\nWe have angle A, with cos A=91/169, sin A=4\u221a15/13.\n\nThen, using the formula for area:\n\n\u0394= (1/2)ab sin C, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABC, using the formula for the product of two sides.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula bc = a * (s -a) * (s -b) * (s -c) / s.\n\nWait, no, that's Heron's formula, which is \u0394= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)], but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula bc = 2\u0394 / sin A.\n\nWait, yes, since area \u0394= (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, perhaps:\n\n\u0394= (1/2)ab sin C, but not directly helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: Using the formula for the length of the angle bisector.\n\nWait, but perhaps not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the distance from I to A, which we did.\n\nWait, I think all the steps are correct, so perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut since the problem says to put the answer in a box as an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute bc=312 +78\u221a2 numerically and see if it's an integer.\n\nCompute 78\u221a2\u224878*1.41421356\u2248110.532.\n\nSo, 312 +110.532\u2248422.532, which is approximately 422.53.\n\nBut that's not an integer, so perhaps the answer is 423, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula IA = r / sin(A/2) is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r)/sin(A/2).\n\nYes, that's correct. Because in the inradius, the inradius is the distance from I to BC, and IA is the distance from I to A, which can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, IA=6 / sin(A/2)=2\u221a39,\n\nSo, sin(A/2)=6/(2\u221a39)=3/\u221a39=\u221a39/13.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should accept that the answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize or write it as 78*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut since the problem asks for the integer answer, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute bc=312 +78\u221a2=78*(4 +\u221a2).\n\nBut 78 is 6*13, so 78=6*13.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, which is the exact value.\n\nSo, perhaps I should write that as the final answer.\n\nBut the problem says to write the integer answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let me check bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nWait, 78\u221a2 is approximately 110.532, so 312+110.532\u2248422.532, which is close to 423, but not exactly.\n\nBut perhaps the exact answer is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, and that's the form we should present.\n\nBut since the problem says to write the integer answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area formula.\n\nWait, \u0394=6s=6*(8\u221a15 +2\u221a30)=48\u221a15 +12\u221a30.\n\nAnd \u0394= (a b c)/(4R)= (8\u221a15 * bc)/(4*13)= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, 48\u221a15 +12\u221a30= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by13:\n\n13*(48\u221a15 +12\u221a30)=2\u221a15 bc.\n\nWhich is 624\u221a15 +156\u221a30=2\u221a15 bc.\n\nDivide both sides by 2\u221a15:\n\n(624\u221a15 +156\u221a30)/(2\u221a15)= bc.\n\nWhich is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is indeed 312 +78\u221a2, and it's not an integer.\n\nBut the problem says to write the integer answer. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI, but maybe I got the direction wrong.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, I placed A at (13,0), O at (0,0), and I at (x,y). Then, the vector IA is (13 -x, -y), and OI is (x,y). Their dot product is (13 -x)x + (-y)y=0.\n\nWhich gives 13x -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2=0.\n\nBut since OI\u00b2=x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13,\n\nSo, from OI\u00b2=13,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13.\n\nAnd from IA perpendicular to OI,\n\n13x -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2=0.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=13,\n\nSo, substituting,\n\n13x -13=0 => x=1.\n\nSo, x=1.\n\nSo, x=1, so y\u00b2=13 -1=12 => y=\u00b12\u221a3.\n\nSo, the incenter I has coordinates (1, 2\u221a3) or (1, -2\u221a3).\n\nBut since in a triangle, the inradius is inside the triangle, and given the position of A at (13,0), the inradius is likely in the upper half, so y is positive. So, I is at (1,2\u221a3).\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\nA: (13,0),\n\nO: (0,0),\n\nI: (1,2\u221a3).\n\nSo, now, we can find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nBut this might help us find the sides.\n\nWait, since I is the incenter, it's located at the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nBut with coordinates of I, perhaps we can find the equations of the angle bisectors and find the coordinates of B and C.\n\nBut this seems complicated, but maybe we can find side lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the inradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nWait, but this might take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the coordinates of I, perhaps we can find the sides.\n\nWait, the inradius is 6, and the area is r*s=6s.\n\nBut with coordinates, perhaps we can compute the sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula that the distance from I to BC is r=6.\n\nBut in coordinate terms, the equation of BC can be found.\n\nBut given that I is at (1,2\u221a3), the distance from I to BC is 6.\n\nBut without knowing the equation of BC, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since A is at (13,0), and I is at (1,2\u221a3), the line AI is from (13,0) to (1,2\u221a3).\n\nThe slope of AI is (2\u221a3 -0)/(1 -13)= (2\u221a3)/(-12)= -\u221a3/6.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is from (0,0) to (1,2\u221a3), the slope of OI is (2\u221a3)/1=2\u221a3.\n\nThe product of the slopes of IA and OI should be -1.\n\nSlope of IA: -\u221a3/6,\n\nSlope of OI:2\u221a3.\n\nProduct: (-\u221a3/6)*(2\u221a3)= (-\u221a3 *2\u221a3)/6= (-2*3)/6= (-6)/6= -1.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the coordinates are consistent.\n\nSo, with A at (13,0), O at (0,0), and I at (1,2\u221a3).\n\nNow, let me consider that the inradius is 6, so the distance from I to BC is 6.\n\nBut the line BC is opposite to A, so it's the line passing through points B and C.\n\nBut without knowing B and C, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance from a point to a line.\n\nBut since we don't know the equation of BC, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area.\n\nWait, the area is 6s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nBut we also have the area as (a b c)/(4 R)= (8\u221a15 * bc)/52= (2\u221a15 bc)/13.\n\nSo, equating 6s= (2\u221a15 bc)/13,\n\nSo, bc= (6s *13)/(2\u221a15)=39 s /\u221a15.\n\nWhich we already did.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can accept that bc=312 +78\u221a2.\n\nBut the problem asks for an integer, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 312 +78\u221a2, which is approximately 422.53, but the exact value is 312 +78\u221a2.\n\nSo, I think I have to go with that.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) has circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), inradius \\( r = 6 \\), and \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\). We aim to find \\( AB \\cdot AC \\).\n\n1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:\n   Using Euler's formula, the distance \\( OI \\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \\implies OI = \\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Length of \\( IA \\)**:\n   Since \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), triangle \\( \\triangle IOA \\) is right-angled at \\( I \\). By the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \\implies 13^2 = (\\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \\implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \\implies IA^2 = 156 \\implies IA = 2\\sqrt{39}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Angle \\( A/2 \\)**:\n   The distance from the incenter to vertex \\( A \\) is given by \\( IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin(A/2)} \\). Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   2\\sqrt{39} = \\frac{6}{\\sin(A/2)} \\implies \\sin(A/2) = \\frac{6}{2\\sqrt{39}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\n   \\]\n   Using the identity \\( \\cos(A/2) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(A/2)} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\cos(A/2) = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{130}{169}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{130}}{13}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding \\( \\cos A \\)**:\n   Using the double-angle formula:\n   \\[\n   \\cos A = 1 - 2\\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{13}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{78}{169} = \\frac{91}{169}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Side \\( a \\) (BC)**:\n   Using the Law of Sines:\n   \\[\n   a = 2R \\sin A = 26 \\cdot \\frac{4\\sqrt{15}}{13} = 8\\sqrt{15}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Semiperimeter \\( s \\)**:\n   Using the formula \\( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   156 = 36 + (s - 8\\sqrt{15})^2 \\implies (s - 8\\sqrt{15})^2 = 120 \\implies s - 8\\sqrt{15} = 2\\sqrt{30} \\implies s = 8\\sqrt{15} + 2\\sqrt{30}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\)**:\n   Using the area formulas \\( \\Delta = r \\cdot s \\) and \\( \\Delta = \\frac{abc}{4R} \\):\n   \\[\n   6s = \\frac{8\\sqrt{15} \\cdot bc}{52} \\implies bc = \\frac{39s}{\\sqrt{15}} = \\frac{39(8\\sqrt{15} + 2\\sqrt{30})}{\\sqrt{15}} = 312 + 78\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the product \\( AB \\cdot AC \\) is \\( 312 + 78\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n\\boxed{312 + 78\\sqrt{2}}",
