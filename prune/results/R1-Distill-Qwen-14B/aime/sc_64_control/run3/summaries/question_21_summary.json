      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem about something called \"b-eautiful\" integers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for.\n\nFirst, the problem says that for an integer b \u2265 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. So, that makes sense.\n\nThe task is to find the least integer b (\u2265 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. Also, each digit must be less than b. So, d1 can range from 1 to b-1, and d0 can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo, n can be written as:\nn = d1 * b + d0\n\nWhere 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1.\n\nNow, the second condition is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d0, equals the square root of n. So,\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n)\n\nBut n is equal to d1 * b + d0, so substituting:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\ns = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + d0\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can write:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + (s - d1)\n\nBecause d0 = s - d1.\n\nSo substituting:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1 * b + s - d1\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1 * (b - 1)\n\nSo, s\u00b2 - s = d1 * (b - 1)\n\nHmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me write that down:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1 (b - 1)  \u2192 Equation (1)\n\nSince d1 is a digit in base b, d1 can take values from 1 to b-1. So, for each base b, and for each possible s, we can check if this equation holds.\n\nWait, but s is the sum of d1 and d0, which are digits in base b. So, d1 is at least 1, d0 is at least 0, so s can range from 1 (if d1=1, d0=0) up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.\n\nBut s is also equal to sqrt(n), which is sqrt(d1 * b + d0). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. So, sqrt(n) can be up to sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b. So, s can be up to about b.\n\nWait, but s is d1 + d0, which is up to 2b - 2, but s is also sqrt(n), which is up to about b. So, s must be \u2264 b because n is less than b\u00b2, so sqrt(n) is less than b. Therefore, s must be \u2264 b - 1, since the maximum n is b\u00b2 -1, whose sqrt is just under b.\n\nWait, no, sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so s must be less than b. So, s can be from 1 up to floor(b - 1). Wait, but s can be up to 2b - 2, but the sqrt(n) is up to just under b, so s must be at most b - 1.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nBecause s is the sum of two digits, each digit can be up to b-1, so s can be up to 2(b-1). But s is also sqrt(n), which is sqrt(d1*b + d0). The maximum value of d1*b + d0 is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. So, sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just less than b. So, s must be less than b.\n\nTherefore, s can be at most b -1 because s must be an integer. So, s \u2208 {1, 2, ..., b-1}.\n\nSo, s ranges from 1 to b-1.\n\nNow, from Equation (1):\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1 (b - 1)\n\nWe can solve for d1:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer in [1, b-1].\n\nTherefore, for each s from 1 to b-1, we can compute (s\u00b2 - s) and see if it's divisible by (b-1). If it is, then d1 is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and then d0 = s - d1. Then, we can check if d0 is a valid digit (i.e., 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1).\n\nSo, the steps for a given base b would be:\n\n1. For s from 1 to b-1:\n   a. Compute numerator = s\u00b2 - s.\n   b. Check if (numerator) is divisible by (b - 1). If not, move to next s.\n   c. If divisible, compute d1 = numerator / (b - 1).\n   d. Check if d1 is between 1 and b-1. If not, move to next s.\n   e. Compute d0 = s - d1. Check if d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n   f. If all conditions are met, then n = d1 * b + d0 is a b-eautiful number.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can iterate through s from 1 to b-1 and check these conditions. The number of valid (d1, d0) pairs for each s will give the number of b-eautiful numbers.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b such that the total number of such n is more than 10.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can model this as a function f(b) which counts the number of b-eautiful integers for a given base b.\n\nWe need to find the smallest b where f(b) > 10.\n\nSo, I need to compute f(b) for increasing values of b until f(b) >10.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, let's think about Equation (1):\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1 (b -1)\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1). So, for each s, (s\u00b2 - s) must be a multiple of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, (b -1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s).\n\nSo, (b -1) | (s\u00b2 - s) \u2192 (b-1) divides s(s -1)\n\nWhich implies that (b-1) divides s(s -1).\n\nSo, for each s, b-1 must be a divisor of s(s-1). Therefore, b-1 must be a factor of s(s-1). But s can vary from 1 to b-1.\n\nWait, but for each b, s ranges from 1 to b-1.\n\nSo, for each s in 1..b-1, we check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). If yes, then d1 is (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1), and then check if d1 is within 1 to b-1 and d0 is within 0 to b-1.\n\nWait, but s ranges up to b-1, so s can be as big as b-1, which is the same as the denominator. So, for s = b-1:\n\ns = b-1 \u2192 s(s-1) = (b-1)(b-2)\n\nSo, b-1 divides (b-1)(b-2), which is always true. So, for s = b-1, d1 = ( (b-1)^2 - (b-1) ) / (b-1) ) = (b\u00b2 - 2b +1 -b +1 ) / (b-1) ) \u2192 Wait, let me compute that.\n\nWait, s = b-1:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = (b-1)^2 - (b-1) = (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) - (b -1) = b\u00b2 -3b +2.\n\nSo, d1 = (b\u00b2 -3b +2)/(b-1). Let's factor numerator: b\u00b2 -3b +2 = (b-1)(b-2). So, d1 = (b-1)(b-2)/(b-1) ) = b -2.\n\nSo, d1 = b-2. Then d0 = s - d1 = (b-1) - (b-2) = 1. So, d0 =1. Which is valid.\n\nSo, for s = b-1, we get a valid pair: d1 = b-2, d0=1, so n = (b-2)*b +1 = b\u00b2 - 2b +1 = (b-1)^2. So, sqrt(n) = b-1, which is s.\n\nSo, that's a valid solution for every b. So, that's one solution for each b.\n\nSimilarly, let's take s=1:\n\ns=1: s\u00b2 -s = 0. So, d1 = 0/(b-1) = 0. But d1 must be at least 1, so this is invalid. So, s=1 doesn't contribute any solution.\n\ns=2:\n\ns=2: s\u00b2 -s =4-2=2. So, d1 = 2/(b-1). So, for d1 to be integer, b-1 must divide 2. So, b-1 \u2208 {1,2} \u2192 b \u2208 {2,3}.\n\nSo, for b=2: d1=2/(2-1)=2. But in base 2, the maximum digit is 1. So, d1=2 is invalid. So, no solution.\n\nFor b=3: d1=2/(3-1)=1. So, d1=1, which is valid. Then d0 = s -d1=2-1=1, which is also valid. So, n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, which is s=2. So, that works. So, for b=3, s=2 gives a valid solution.\n\nSo, in this case, for s=2, when b=3, we get a solution.\n\nSimilarly, let's take s=3:\n\ns=3: s\u00b2 -s=9-3=6. So, d1=6/(b-1). So, b-1 must divide 6. So, possible b-1 \u2208 {1,2,3,6} \u2192 b \u2208 {2,3,4,7}.\n\nCheck each b:\n\nb=2: d1=6/(1)=6, but in base 2, digits can be only 0 or 1. So, invalid.\n\nb=3: d1=6/2=3. But in base 3, digits can be 0,1,2. So, d1=3 is invalid.\n\nb=4: d1=6/3=2. Which is valid. Then d0=3-2=1. So, n=2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3, which is s=3. So, valid.\n\nb=7: d1=6/6=1. Then d0=3-1=2. So, n=1*7 +2=9. sqrt(9)=3, which is s=3. So, valid.\n\nSo, for s=3, b=4 and b=7 give valid solutions.\n\nSo, each s will contribute some possible b's where d1 is valid.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to find for a fixed b, how many s's in 1..b-1 satisfy that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and that d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in 1..b-1 where (b-1) divides s(s-1), and d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit abstract. Maybe another approach is to note that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are \u2264 b-1 and satisfy certain conditions. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the number of solutions for a given b as the number of s in 1..b-1 where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of such s is equal to the number of s in [1, b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, since (b-1) divides s(s-1), we can think that s \u2261 0 or 1 mod (b-1). Wait, because s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. So, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1.\n\nWait, yes. Because s and s-1 are consecutive, so their GCD is 1. Therefore, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1.\n\nSo, for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) must divide s-1.\n\nTherefore, s \u2261 0 mod (b-1) or s \u2261 1 mod (b-1).\n\nBut since s is in [1, b-1], s can only be 1 or b-1 to satisfy s \u2261 1 mod (b-1) or s \u22610 mod (b-1).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf (b-1) divides s, then s must be a multiple of (b-1). Since s \u2264 b-1, the only multiple is s = b-1.\n\nSimilarly, if (b-1) divides s-1, then s-1 must be a multiple of (b-1). Since s \u2264 b-1, s-1 can be 0, which implies s=1.\n\nSo, the only s in [1, b-1] that satisfy (b-1) divides s(s-1) are s=1 and s=b-1.\n\nWait, that's a big insight! So, for each b, the only possible s that satisfy the condition are s=1 and s=b-1.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the case of s=2 for b=3, we had a solution. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning. Let me check.\n\nEarlier, for b=3, s=2 gave a solution. But according to the above logic, s should only be 1 or 2 (since b-1=2). So, for b=3, s=2 is allowed, but s=2 is equal to b-1, which is 2. So, s=2 is allowed because (b-1) divides s(s-1) = 2*1 = 2, which is divisible by 2 (since b-1=2). So, yes, that works.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example of b=4 and s=3:\n\ns=3, b-1=3. So, 3 divides 3*2=6. Yes, that's correct. So, for s=3, which is equal to b-1, it's allowed.\n\nBut earlier, for s=2 in b=3, s=2 is equal to b-1, which is 2. So, that also works.\n\nWait, but in the case of s=3, b=4: s=3, which is equal to b-1=3. So, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought of s=3 for b=4, I thought that s=3 is equal to b-1, which is 3, so that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier case of s=2 for b=3, which is s=2, b-1=2, so that's allowed.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, for each b, the only possible s that satisfy (b-1) divides s(s-1) are s=1 and s=b-1.\n\nBut in the case of b=3, s=2 is allowed, which is s=b-1.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of s=2 for b=3, which is s=2, which is equal to b-1. So, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but when I thought of s=3 for b=4, s=3 is equal to b-1=3, which is allowed.\n\nBut then, for s=3 in b=4, it's allowed. So, perhaps my initial conclusion is correct: for each b, only s=1 and s=b-1 satisfy the condition that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nWait, but in the case of b=7, when s=3, which is not equal to 6, which is b-1. So, for b=7, s=3, which is less than b-1=6. But in that case, 6 divides 3*2=6. So, 6 divides 6, which is true. So, s=3 is allowed.\n\nWait, so my earlier conclusion that only s=1 and s=b-1 are possible is incorrect.\n\nHmm, that suggests that my earlier reasoning was wrong. Because in the case of b=7, s=3 is allowed, which is neither 1 nor 6.\n\nWait, so perhaps the condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but only if the factors of (b-1) are in s or s-1.\n\nWait, but since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. But (b-1) could have factors that are in s or s-1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. Let me take an example: b=7, so b-1=6. s=3.\n\ns(s-1)=3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So, yes, 6 divides 6. So, s=3 is allowed.\n\nBut 6 divides 6, but 6 doesn't divide 3 or 2. Wait, but 6 divides 6, which is s(s-1). So, in this case, s=3, s-1=2. 6 divides 6, which is the product. So, in this case, 6 is a factor of 6, which is the product.\n\nBut 6 doesn't divide 3 or 2 individually, but it divides their product. So, my earlier conclusion that (b-1) must divide s or s-1 is incorrect because in this case, (b-1)=6 doesn't divide s=3 or s-1=2, but it divides their product.\n\nSo, my mistake earlier was assuming that because s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide one of them. But that's only true if (b-1) is square-free. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, for example, if (b-1) is 4, which is not square-free. Then s=2 and s-1=1: 4 divides 2*1=2? No. So, 4 doesn't divide 2. But if s=3, s-1=2: 4 doesn't divide 3*2=6. So, in that case, no solution for s=2 or 3. But if s=4, which is equal to b-1=4, then 4 divides 4*3=12, yes. So, s=4 is allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). So, for each s, we check whether s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1). So, perhaps for each b, the number of s's where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in the range [1, b-1], but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as:\n\nFor each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [1, b-1] such that s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as s(s-1) \u2261 0 mod (b-1).\n\nSo, for each s, we need s \u2261 0 mod k or s \u2261 1 mod k, where k is a divisor of (b-1). Wait, perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, more accurately, since s and s-1 are consecutive, their product is divisible by (b-1). So, (b-1) must divide s(s-1). So, for each s, s must be such that s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b-1). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) in the range [1, b-1], but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of solutions being equal to the number of s in [1, b-1] where s \u2261 0 mod k or s \u2261 1 mod k, for each divisor k of (b-1). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) plus 1 or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe I should try small values of b and see how many solutions each has, then look for a pattern.\n\nLet me try b=2:\n\nb=2, so b-1=1.\n\nWe need s in [1,1].\n\ns=1:\n\ns\u00b2 -s = 0. So, d1=0, which is invalid. So, no solutions.\n\nSo, f(2)=0.\n\nb=3:\n\nb-1=2.\n\ns can be 1 or 2.\n\ns=1: s\u00b2 -s=0. d1=0 invalid.\n\ns=2: s\u00b2 -s=2. d1=2/2=1. Then d0=2-1=1.\n\nSo, n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, which is s=2. So, valid.\n\nSo, f(3)=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nb-1=3.\n\ns can be 1,2,3.\n\ns=1: 1-1=0. d1=0 invalid.\n\ns=2: 4-2=2. d1=2/3, which is not integer. So, invalid.\n\ns=3: 9-3=6. d1=6/3=2. Then d0=3-2=1.\n\nn=2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3. So, valid.\n\nSo, f(4)=1.\n\nWait, but earlier for b=4, s=3 gives a solution. Are there any others?\n\nWait, s=2: 2\u00b2 -2=2. 2 divided by 3 is not integer, so invalid.\n\nSo, only s=3 gives a solution. So, f(4)=1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for b=4, s=3 gives a solution, but in another case, perhaps there's another s.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check s=2 for b=4:\n\ns=2: s\u00b2 -s=4-2=2. So, d1=2/(4-1)=2/3, which is not integer. So, invalid.\n\nSo, only s=3 gives a solution. So, f(4)=1.\n\nb=5:\n\nb-1=4.\n\ns can be 1,2,3,4.\n\ns=1: 1-1=0 \u2192 d1=0 invalid.\n\ns=2:4-2=2. d1=2/4=0.5, invalid.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. d1=6/4=1.5, invalid.\n\ns=4:16-4=12. d1=12/4=3. d0=4-3=1.\n\nn=3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4. So, valid.\n\nSo, f(5)=1.\n\nWait, that's only one solution.\n\nWait, but earlier for b=3, we had s=2, which is b-1=2. For b=4, s=3, which is b-1=3. For b=5, s=4, which is b-1=4. So, each time, only s=b-1 gives a solution.\n\nBut earlier, for b=7 and s=3, we had a solution. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's check b=6:\n\nb=6, b-1=5.\n\ns ranges from 1 to 5.\n\ns=1: 0 \u2192 d1=0 invalid.\n\ns=2:4-2=2. d1=2/5=0.4 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. d1=6/5=1.2 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=4:16-4=12. d1=12/5=2.4 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=5:25-5=20. d1=20/5=4. d0=5-4=1.\n\nn=4*6 +1=25. sqrt(25)=5. So, valid.\n\nSo, f(6)=1.\n\nWait, so for b=3,4,5,6, each has only one solution, s=b-1.\n\nBut earlier, for b=7, s=3 was a solution.\n\nLet me check b=7:\n\nb=7, b-1=6.\n\ns ranges from 1 to 6.\n\ns=1: 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=2:4-2=2. d1=2/6=0.333... \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. d1=6/6=1. d0=3-1=2.\n\nn=1*7 +2=9. sqrt(9)=3. So, valid.\n\ns=4:16-4=12. d1=12/6=2. d0=4-2=2.\n\nn=2*7 +2=16. sqrt(16)=4. So, valid.\n\ns=5:25-5=20. d1=20/6\u22483.333 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=6:36-6=30. d1=30/6=5. d0=6-5=1.\n\nn=5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6. So, valid.\n\nSo, for b=7, we have s=3, s=4, and s=6 giving valid solutions. So, f(7)=3.\n\nWait, that's more than one solution. So, for b=7, there are three solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps for some b, there are multiple s's that satisfy the condition.\n\nSo, let's try to find a pattern here.\n\nLooking back, for b=7, we have s=3,4,6.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor s=3:\n\nd1=1, d0=2.\n\nFor s=4:\n\nd1=2, d0=2.\n\nFor s=6:\n\nd1=5, d0=1.\n\nSo, three solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps for b=7, f(b)=3.\n\nSimilarly, let's try b=8:\n\nb=8, b-1=7.\n\ns ranges from 1 to 7.\n\ns=1: invalid.\n\ns=2:4-2=2. d1=2/7 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=3:9-3=6. d1=6/7 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=4:16-4=12. d1=12/7 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=5:25-5=20. d1=20/7\u22482.857 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=6:36-6=30. d1=30/7\u22484.285 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=7:49-7=42. d1=42/7=6. d0=7-6=1.\n\nn=6*8 +1=49. sqrt(49)=7. So, valid.\n\nSo, only s=7 gives a solution. So, f(8)=1.\n\nHmm, so b=7 has 3 solutions, but b=8 has 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions depends on the number of divisors of (b-1).\n\nWait, for b=7, b-1=6, which has divisors 1,2,3,6. So, four divisors.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the number of solutions?\n\nWait, for each divisor d of (b-1), perhaps we can have s such that s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each divisor d of (b-1) corresponds to a possible s where s = d or s = d +1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's consider b=7, b-1=6.\n\nThe divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSo, for each divisor d of 6, we can have s such that s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d.\n\nBut s must be in 1..6.\n\nSo, for d=1:\n\ns \u22610 mod 1 \u2192 all s are allowed.\n\ns \u22611 mod 1 \u2192 all s are allowed.\n\nSo, that's redundant.\n\nFor d=2:\n\ns \u22610 mod 2 \u2192 s=2,4,6.\n\ns \u22611 mod 2 \u2192 s=1,3,5.\n\nFor d=3:\n\ns \u22610 mod 3 \u2192 s=3,6.\n\ns \u22611 mod 3 \u2192 s=1,4.\n\nFor d=6:\n\ns \u22610 mod 6 \u2192 s=6.\n\ns \u22611 mod 6 \u2192 s=1.\n\nNow, for each s, we can check whether (b-1)=6 divides s(s-1).\n\nLooking at s=3:\n\ns=3, s-1=2. 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\ns=4:\n\ns=4, s-1=3. 4*3=12, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\ns=6:\n\ns=6, s-1=5. 6*5=30, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\nSo, for b=7, s=3,4,6 are valid, giving three solutions.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [1, b-1] where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). And for each such s, we get a valid solution.\n\nSo, for b=7, we have three solutions.\n\nSimilarly, let's try b=9, so b-1=8.\n\nDivisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8.\n\nSo, for each s in 1..8, check if 8 divides s(s-1).\n\ns=1: 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=2:2*1=2 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 2.\n\ns=3:3*2=6 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 6.\n\ns=4:4*3=12 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 12.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 20.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 30.\n\ns=7:7*6=42 \u2192 8 doesn't divide 42.\n\ns=8:8*7=56 \u2192 8 divides 56.\n\nSo, only s=8 gives a solution. So, f(9)=1.\n\nHmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a b where (b-1) has many small factors, so that s(s-1) is often divisible by (b-1).\n\nWait, for example, let's try b=13, as in the example.\n\nb=13, b-1=12.\n\nDivisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nSo, for s in 1..12:\n\ns=1: 0 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=2:2*1=2 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 2.\n\ns=3:3*2=6 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 6.\n\ns=4:4*3=12 \u2192 12 divides 12. So, valid.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 20.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 30.\n\ns=7:7*6=42 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 42.\n\ns=8:8*7=56 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 56.\n\ns=9:9*8=72 \u2192 12 divides 72. So, valid.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 90.\n\ns=11:11*10=110 \u2192 12 doesn't divide 110.\n\ns=12:12*11=132 \u2192 12 divides 132. So, valid.\n\nSo, for b=13, s=4,9,12 give solutions. So, f(13)=3.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem was 81 being 13-eautiful. Let me check that.\n\n81 in base 13 is 6*13 +3=81. So, d1=6, d0=3. Sum is 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81)=9. So, that's a solution.\n\nSo, for s=9, d1=6, d0=3.\n\nWait, let's see how that comes from our earlier approach.\n\nFor s=9 in b=13:\n\ns=9, b-1=12.\n\ns(s-1)=9*8=72, which is divisible by 12. So, d1=72/12=6. Then, d0=9-6=3. So, valid.\n\nSimilarly, for s=4:\n\ns=4, s(s-1)=12. d1=12/12=1. d0=4-1=3.\n\nn=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4. So, valid.\n\nFor s=12:\n\ns=12, s(s-1)=12*11=132. d1=132/12=11. d0=12-11=1.\n\nn=11*13 +1=143 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12. So, valid.\n\nSo, three solutions for b=13.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's stated that 81 is 13-eautiful, which is one of the solutions. So, f(13)=3.\n\nWait, but we need to find the smallest b where f(b) >10. So, let's try to find a b where f(b) is greater than 10.\n\nBut trying each b one by one is time-consuming. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for b=7, (b-1)=6, which has four divisors:1,2,3,6. The number of solutions was 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are greater than 1 and less than (b-1).\n\nWait, for b=7, the divisors are 1,2,3,6. The divisors greater than 1 and less than 6 are 2,3. So, two divisors. But f(b)=3, which includes s=3,4,6.\n\nHmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [2, b-2] where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nWait, but in b=7, s=3 and s=4 are in [2,5], and s=6 is at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, but that seems restrictive.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For each b, the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d0) such that d1 + d0 = s, and s\u00b2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as s\u00b2 = d1*b + (s - d1) \u2192 s\u00b2 - s = d1*(b-1).\n\nSo, for each s, d1 must be (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d1 must be integer, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\nSo, for each b, the number of s in [1, b-1] where (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1).\n\nSo, the number of s in [1, b-1] where s \u22610 mod k or s \u22611 mod k, for each k dividing (b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but the idea is that s and s-1 are coprime, so for each prime p dividing (b-1), p must divide either s or s-1.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) multiplied by something.\n\nWait, for example, for b=7, (b-1)=6, which has four divisors. And f(b)=3. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, but that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), there are two possible s's: one where s=d, and another where s=d+1.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nTake b=7, (b-1)=6.\n\nDivisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.\n\nFor each d, consider s=d and s=d+1.\n\nd=1: s=1 and s=2.\n\ns=1: invalid.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2, which is not divisible by 6. So, invalid.\n\nd=2: s=2 and s=3.\n\ns=2: invalid.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\nd=3: s=3 and s=4.\n\ns=3: valid.\n\ns=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\nd=6: s=6 and s=7 (but s can't be 7 as b-1=6).\n\ns=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by 6. So, valid.\n\nSo, from this approach, we have s=3,4,6 as valid, which are three solutions. So, f(7)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for b=13, (b-1)=12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1: s=1 invalid; s=2: 2*1=2 not divisible by 12.\n\nd=2: s=2 invalid; s=3:3*2=6 not divisible by 12.\n\nd=3: s=3 invalid; s=4:4*3=12 divisible by 12 \u2192 valid.\n\nd=4: s=4 invalid; s=5:5*4=20 not divisible by 12.\n\nd=6: s=6 invalid; s=7:7*6=42 not divisible by 12.\n\nd=12: s=12 valid; s=13 invalid.\n\nSo, from this approach, we get s=4 and s=12 as valid. But earlier, we had s=9 as a solution. Wait, perhaps this approach misses some solutions.\n\nWait, because for d=4, s=4:4*3=12, which is divisible by 12. So, s=4 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, for d=3, s=4 is a solution because 4 is d+1 for d=3.\n\nWait, so perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), if d+1 \u2264 b-1, then s=d+1 is a solution if (d+1)*d is divisible by (b-1).\n\nSo, for each d, s=d+1 could be a solution.\n\nSimilarly, s=d could be a solution if d*(d-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nWait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2, multiplied by 2, minus 1 if (b-1) is a square.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than sqrt(b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers.\n\nBut that seems too restrictive.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Since s(s-1) must be a multiple of (b-1), and s can be up to b-1, then (b-1) must be \u2264 s(s-1). But since s \u2264 b-1, the maximum s(s-1) is (b-1)(b-2). So, (b-1) \u2264 (b-1)(b-2) \u2192 which is always true for b \u22653.\n\nSo, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of s in [2, b-1] such that s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nWait, but how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2, because each such divisor d would correspond to s = d+1.\n\nWait, let's test this with b=7, where (b-1)=6, which has divisors 1,2,3,6.\n\nDivisors \u2264 3 (which is 6/2=3) are 1,2,3.\n\nSo, number of such divisors is 3, which matches f(7)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for b=13, (b-1)=12, divisors \u22646 are 1,2,3,4,6. So, five divisors. But f(13)=3, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, that doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are greater than 1 and less than (b-1).\n\nFor b=7, (b-1)=6, divisors greater than 1 and less than 6 are 2,3. So, two divisors. But f(b)=3, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, but that seems too restrictive.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that for each s, s(s-1) must be a multiple of (b-1). So, for each s, (b-1) must divide s(s-1). So, for each s, we can compute the number of b's where (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nBut since we are looking for a fixed b, perhaps it's better to find for each b, the number of s's where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nSo, perhaps the number of such s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are \u2264 (b-1).\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try more examples.\n\nLet me try b=15:\n\nb=15, b-1=14.\n\nDivisors of 14:1,2,7,14.\n\ns ranges from 1 to14.\n\nCheck for each s:\n\ns=1:0 \u2192 invalid.\n\ns=2:2*1=2 \u219214 doesn't divide 2.\n\ns=3:3*2=6 \u219214 doesn't divide 6.\n\ns=4:4*3=12 \u219214 doesn't divide 12.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u219214 doesn't divide 20.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 \u219214 doesn't divide 30.\n\ns=7:7*6=42 \u219214 divides 42 (42/14=3).

But we need more than 10.\n\nLet's try b=61:\n\nb=61, b-1=60.\n\nDivisors of 60: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nSo, s ranges from1 to60.\n\nWe need s where s(s-1) is divisible by60.\n\nThis could take a while, but perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nFor s where s \u22610 or 1 mod 4, mod 3, mod 5.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of s where s \u22610 mod 4 and s \u22611 mod 3 and s \u22611 mod5, but that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) multiplied by something.\n\nWait, for b=31, (b-1)=30, which has 8 divisors. But f(b)=7.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, but that seems too restrictive.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For each b, the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, which would be s(s-1) = k*(k-1) = (b-1). But that's only possible if (b-1) is a product of two consecutive integers, which is rare.\n\nWait, for example, 6=2*3, so b=7 would have s=3 and s=4 as solutions. Similarly, 12=3*4, so b=13 would have s=4 and s=9 as solutions. Hmm, but that doesn't explain all cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I can find a formula for f(b) in terms of the number of divisors of (b-1).\n\nWait, from the earlier examples, for b=7, f(b)=3; for b=13, f(b)=3; for b=31, f(b)=7.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than sqrt(b-1) plus the number of divisors greater than sqrt(b-1), but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers. But for example, 6=2*3, which gives s=3 and s=4 as solutions. Similarly, 12=3*4, which gives s=4 and s=9 as solutions. Wait, but 9 isn't 12+1.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), where d \u2264 sqrt(b-1), there are two solutions: s=d+1 and s= (b-1)/d.\n\nWait, for example, for b=7, (b-1)=6.\n\nDivisors \u2264sqrt(6)\u22482.449 are 1,2.\n\nFor d=1: s=2 and s=6/1=6.\n\nBut s=2:2*1=2 not divisible by6. So, invalid.\n\ns=6:6*5=30, which is divisible by6. So, valid.\n\nFor d=2: s=3 and s=6/2=3.\n\ns=3:3*2=6, which is divisible by6. So, valid.\n\nSo, that gives s=3 and s=6.\n\nWait, but earlier, for b=7, we had s=3,4,6.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), we can have s=d+1 and s=(b-1)/d.\n\nBut for d=3, which is a divisor of6, s=4 and s=2. But s=2 is invalid, and s=4 is valid.\n\nSo, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1) where d < (b-1), we can get s=d+1 and s=(b-1)/d +1.\n\nBut this might not always work.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to accept that calculating f(b) for each b is time-consuming, and instead, look for a b where (b-1) has many small factors, leading to many s's where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nLooking back, for b=31, f(b)=7. We need more than 10, so perhaps we need a larger b.\n\nLet me try b=121:\n\nb=121, b-1=120.\n\nDivisors of120:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120.\n\nSo, s ranges from1 to120.\n\nWe need s where s(s-1) is divisible by120.\n\nLet's find such s:\n\nWe can think of s where s \u22610 mod 5 and s\u22611 mod 4 and s\u22611 mod 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to find s where s(s-1) is a multiple of 120.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 not divisible by120.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 \u2192 no.\n\ns=8:8*7=56 \u2192 no.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 \u2192 no.\n\ns=12:12*11=132 \u2192 no.\n\ns=15:15*14=210 \u2192 no.\n\ns=16:16*15=240 \u2192 240/120=2 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=20:20*19=380 \u2192 no.\n\ns=21:21*20=420 \u2192 420/120=3.5 \u2192 no.\n\ns=24:24*23=552 \u2192552/120=4.6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=25:25*24=600 \u2192600/120=5 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=30:30*29=870 \u2192870/120=7.25 \u2192 no.\n\ns=31:31*30=930 \u2192930/120=7.75 \u2192 no.\n\ns=40:40*39=1560 \u21921560/120=13 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=48:48*47=2256 \u21922256/120=18.8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=60:60*59=3540 \u21923540/120=29.5 \u2192 no.\n\ns=61:61*60=3660 \u21923660/120=30.5 \u2192 no.\n\ns=120:120*119=14280 \u219214280/120=119 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, the valid s's are s=16,25,40,120.\n\nWait, that's four solutions.

where (b-1) is a multiple of 60, which has many factors, but even then, f(b)=5.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b where f(b) >10 is higher than 241. But this is taking too long, and I'm not making progress.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the minimal b is 121, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The number of solutions f(b) is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as s(s-1), which can be rewritten as s\u00b2 -s - (b-1)=0.\n\nThe discriminant is 1 +4(b-1)=4b-3.\n\nFor s to be integer, 4b-3 must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, 4b-3 =k\u00b2.\n\nThus, b=(k\u00b2 +3)/4.\n\nSo, for b to be integer, k must be odd: let k=2m+1.\n\nThen, b=((4m\u00b2 +4m +1)+3)/4=(4m\u00b2 +4m +4)/4=m\u00b2 +m +1.\n\nSo, b=m\u00b2 +m +1.\n\nThen, s=(1 +k)/2=(1 +2m+1)/2=m+1.\n\nSo, s=m+1.\n\nThus, for each integer m \u22651, b=m\u00b2 +m +1.\n\nAnd for each such b, s=m+1 is a solution.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there are other solutions.\n\nWait, so for each m, b=m\u00b2 +m +1, s=m+1.\n\nSo, for m=1: b=1+1+1=3, s=2.\n\nWhich matches the earlier example.\n\nFor m=2: b=4+2+1=7, s=3.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor m=3: b=9+3+1=13, s=4.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor m=4: b=16+4+1=21, s=5.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor m=5: b=25+5+1=31, s=6.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor m=6: b=36+6+1=43, s=7.\n\nSo, for each such b, there is at least one solution.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that for b=7, there are three solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps for some m, there are additional solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps when (b-1) has multiple factors, leading to more s's.\n\nBut this approach might not capture all solutions.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should conclude that the minimal b where f(b) >10 is 31, but f(31)=7, which is less than 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but f(121)=6.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a larger b where (b-1) is a multiple of many small numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps b=211, (b-1)=210.\n\nDivisors of210:1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210.\n\nSo, s ranges from1 to210.\n\nLet me find s where s(s-1) is divisible by210.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 no.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 \u2192

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. The problem is about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what a b-eautiful integer is. From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, n can be written as a two-digit number in base b, which means it's of the form a* b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b.\n\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, a + c = sqrt(n).\n\nGiven that, the problem is asking for the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote n as a two-digit number in base b. So, n can be written as:\n\nn = a * b + c\n\nwhere a and c are digits in base b, so 0 \u2264 a, c < b, and a \u2260 0 because it's a two-digit number.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n:\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nSo, substituting n from the first equation into the second condition:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nLet me group terms:\n\na\u00b2 - a*b + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor some terms:\n\na(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe instead, I can express b in terms of a and c.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me solve for b:\n\na*b = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c\n\nSo,\n\nb = (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nSince b must be an integer, the term (c\u00b2 - c)/a must be an integer. So, (c\u00b2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nBut a is a digit in base b, so a can range from 1 to b-1. Similarly, c can range from 0 to b-1.\n\nWait, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, and a is the first digit, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be at least 0 and at most b-1.\n\nSo, to find possible values of a and c, we need that (c\u00b2 - c) is divisible by a.\n\nAlternatively, since a divides (c\u00b2 - c), we can write:\n\n(c\u00b2 - c) mod a = 0\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). Since c and c-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, the divisors of c(c - 1) are the products of the divisors of c and c-1.\n\nBut a is a digit in base b, so a \u2264 b-1, and since a is at least 1, we can think of a as a factor of c(c-1).\n\nThis might be a way to approach the problem. For each possible c, find the possible a's that divide c(c-1), then compute b as per the equation.\n\nBut since we don't know b yet, perhaps we can parameterize in terms of a and c, and then find constraints on b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express b in terms of a and c, and then find for each a and c, the possible b's.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nBut since b must be an integer, (c\u00b2 - c)/a must be an integer. Let me denote k = (c\u00b2 - c)/a, where k is an integer.\n\nSo, then:\n\nb = a + 2c + k\n\nBut since a is a positive integer (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1) and c is a non-negative integer (0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1), and k is an integer, perhaps positive or negative.\n\nWait, but since b must be at least 2, and a is at least 1, c can be 0 or higher.\n\nBut looking back at the equation for b:\n\nb = a + 2c + k\n\nWe can write k = (c\u00b2 - c)/a.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nLet me factor out c\u00b2 - c:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c(c - 1))/a\n\nHmm. Maybe I can write this as:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c(c - 1))/a\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nb = (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)) / a\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c)/a = a + 2c + (c\u00b2 - c)/a. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the numerator is a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c.\n\nWhich can be written as a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c.\n\nWait, a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 is (a + c)^2, so it's (a + c)^2 - c.\n\nSo,\n\nb = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about possible a and c values.\n\nGiven that a and c are digits in base b, so a < b, c < b.\n\nAnd since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = a*b + c, which must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (since a + c = sqrt(n)).\n\nWait, wait, actually, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a + c is an integer, so n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and it's a two-digit number in base b.\n\nSo, n must satisfy that n is a perfect square, and in base b, it's two digits.\n\nSo, let me think: for a given base b, n can range from b (which is 10_b) up to (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nSo, n is between b and b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBut n is a perfect square, so n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, and n must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, the perfect squares in that range are (sqrt(b))\u00b2 up to (sqrt(b\u00b2 -1))\u00b2. Wait, sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so the perfect squares in that range are from (floor(sqrt(b)) + 1)^2 up to (b -1)^2.\n\nWait, for example, if b=10, then n ranges from 10 to 99. The perfect squares there are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n\nSo, for each base b, the two-digit numbers in base b that are perfect squares are the squares from ceil(sqrt(b))\u00b2 up to (b-1)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that n must be a square, say k\u00b2, where k is an integer, and n = k\u00b2 must satisfy b \u2264 k\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 1.\n\nSo, k must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1), which is approximately b - something. But sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b by a small amount.\n\nWait, sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is approximately b - 1/(2b). So, the integer k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)).\n\nBut since b is an integer, sqrt(b) is not necessarily integer. Let me think of specific examples.\n\nTake b=10: sqrt(10) is about 3.16, so k starts from 4. sqrt(99) is about 9.949, so k goes up to 9. So, k=4,5,6,7,8,9. So, six values of k, each corresponding to n=16,25,...,81.\n\nIn the example given, 81 is 63_13, which is 6*13 +3=81. So, a=6, c=3, and a + c =9= sqrt(81). So, that's how it works.\n\nSo, for each base b, the possible k's are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)), which is b-1.\n\nSo, the number of possible k's is (b-1) - ceil(sqrt(b)) +1 = b - ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nWait, but for b=10, ceil(sqrt(10))=4, so number of k's is 9-4 +1=6, which matches.\n\nSo, in general, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of integers k such that k\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of the digits of k\u00b2 in base b equals k.\n\nWait, but the sum of the digits is equal to k, which is sqrt(n). So, for each k in that range, we can check whether the digits a and c of k\u00b2 in base b satisfy a + c = k.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can compute how many such k satisfy this condition.\n\nThe problem is asking for the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   a. Find all k such that k\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b. That is, k\u00b2 must be in [b, b\u00b2 -1].\n\n   b. For each such k, express k\u00b2 in base b as a two-digit number, get digits a and c.\n\n   c. Check if a + c = k.\n\n   d. Count how many such k satisfy this condition.\n\n2. Find the smallest b where this count is greater than 10.\n\nSo, to proceed, perhaps I can try to model this mathematically.\n\nGiven that n = k\u00b2 = a*b + c, and a + c = k.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nand\n\nk = a + c\n\nSo, substituting c = k - a into the first equation:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + (k - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + k - a\n\nRearranging:\n\nk\u00b2 - k = a*(b -1)\n\nSo,\n\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (k\u00b2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer a such that 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, for a given k, we have:\n\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nWhich must be an integer, and a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nAdditionally, since n = a*b + c = a*b + (k - a) = (a)(b) + (k - a) = a*(b - 1) + k.\n\nWait, but from the previous equation, a*(b -1) = k\u00b2 -k, so n = (k\u00b2 -k) + k = k\u00b2, which checks out.\n\nSo, the key equation is:\n\na = (k\u00b2 - k)/(b -1)\n\nWhich must be an integer. So, for each k, (k\u00b2 -k) must be divisible by (b -1). Therefore, (b -1) must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 -k).\n\nSo, for a given b, we can find all k such that:\n\n1. k\u00b2 is in [b, b\u00b2 -1], i.e., k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1]\n\n2. (b -1) divides (k\u00b2 -k), i.e., (k\u00b2 -k) mod (b -1) = 0\n\n3. Then, a = (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1) must be an integer, and 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\n4. Also, since c = k - a, c must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, c = k - a = k - (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1)\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\nc = [k*(b -1) - (k\u00b2 -k)] / (b -1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nk*(b -1) - k\u00b2 +k = k*b -k -k\u00b2 +k = k*b -k\u00b2 = k(b -k)\n\nSo,\n\nc = [k(b -k)] / (b -1)\n\nWhich must also be an integer, and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, now we have two conditions:\n\n1. (b -1) divides (k\u00b2 -k)\n\n2. (b -1) divides k(b -k)\n\nWait, but since (b -1) divides (k\u00b2 -k) and (b -1) divides k(b -k), perhaps there's a relationship between these two.\n\nWait, note that (k\u00b2 -k) = k(k -1), and k(b -k) = k(b -k). So, perhaps we can write:\n\nFrom condition 1: (b -1) divides k(k -1)\n\nFrom condition 2: (b -1) divides k(b -k)\n\nSo, (b -1) must divide both k(k -1) and k(b -k).\n\nSo, perhaps (b -1) divides the greatest common divisor (gcd) of k(k -1) and k(b -k).\n\nWait, let's compute gcd(k(k-1), k(b -k)).\n\nThe gcd is k * gcd(k -1, b -k). Because both terms have a factor of k.\n\nSo, gcd(k(k-1), k(b -k)) = k * gcd(k-1, b -k)\n\nSo, for (b -1) to divide both, it must divide k * gcd(k-1, b -k).\n\nBut this might not be the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this for specific values of b.\n\nWait, but since the problem is to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a formula or pattern for the number of valid k's for a given b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this in terms of b. Let me try to express b in terms of k and a.\n\nFrom a = (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1), we can rearrange:\n\nb -1 = (k\u00b2 -k)/a\n\nSo,\n\nb = (k\u00b2 -k)/a + 1\n\nBut since b must be an integer, (k\u00b2 -k)/a must be an integer, so a must divide (k\u00b2 -k).\n\nSo, for each k, a must be a divisor of (k\u00b2 -k) = k(k -1).\n\nSince k and k-1 are coprime, the divisors of k(k -1) are the products of the divisors of k and k-1.\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of k(k -1), and since a must be less than or equal to b -1, which is equal to (k\u00b2 -k)/a, we have:\n\na \u2264 (k\u00b2 -k)/a\n\nWhich implies:\n\na\u00b2 \u2264 k\u00b2 -k\n\nSo,\n\na \u2264 sqrt(k\u00b2 -k)\n\nWhich is approximately k - 0.5 for large k.\n\nBut since a must be a positive integer, and also, a must be at least 1, this gives a range for a.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to consider for each b, how many k's satisfy the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of k's where (b -1) divides k(k -1) and (b -1) divides k(b -k), and a and c are within the digit ranges.\n\nBut this still feels a bit tangled. Maybe another approach: for each b, iterate over possible k's, compute a and c, check if they are digits, and count the number of valid cases.\n\nBut since this is a problem-solving scenario, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, let's consider the equation:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nand a + c = k.\n\nFrom the second equation, c = k - a.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:\n\nk\u00b2 = a*b + (k - a)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk\u00b2 -k = a*(b -1)\n\nSo,\n\na = (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1)\n\nWhich must be an integer, and a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1.\n\nSimilarly, c = k - a = k - (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1)\n\nWhich must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, and for each k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can check if (k\u00b2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and then check if a and c are within their digit ranges.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides (k\u00b2 -k), and a and c are digits (i.e., a between 1 and b-1, c between 0 and b-1).\n\nSo, let's denote d = b -1. Then, for each k, d must divide (k\u00b2 -k), and a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d +1 (since b = d +1, so a \u2264 d).\n\nWait, no: since a must be \u2264 b -1 = d.\n\nSo, a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 d.\n\nSimilarly, c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 d.\n\nSo, for each d, we can find the number of k's where:\n\n1. k\u00b2 -k is divisible by d.\n\n2. a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d is between 1 and d.\n\n3. c = k - a is between 0 and d.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each d \u22651 (since b = d +1 \u22652), find the number of k's where k is in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d], such that d divides (k\u00b2 -k), and a and c as defined above are within their ranges.\n\nBut this is still a bit abstract. Perhaps I can find a way to model the number of solutions for each d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each k, we can find the possible d's that satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut since the problem is to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps it's better to compute for each b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of b-eautiful integers, and stop when we find the first b where the count is >10.\n\nBut doing this manually for each b would be time-consuming, so perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express d as a factor of k(k-1), which is d | k(k-1). So, for each k, d can be any divisor of k(k-1), and then check if a and c are within the required ranges.\n\nBut this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each k, the number of possible d's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are less than or equal to k, because d must be less than or equal to k (since k \u2264 d +1? Wait, no, because d = b -1, and k can be up to d.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the possible d's are the divisors of k(k-1) such that d >= k, since k must be at least ceil(sqrt(d +1)), which is roughly sqrt(d).\n\nWait, but d = b -1, and k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), d], so for each k, d must be at least k^2, since b = d +1, and k is at least ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2248 sqrt(d +1).\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to take a step back.\n\nLet me try small values of b and see how the count increases.\n\nFor example:\n\nTake b=2:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 2 are 10_2 = 2, 11_2=3.\n\nCheck if they are perfect squares:\n\n2 is not a perfect square.\n\n3 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, count is 0.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10_3=3, 11_3=4, 12_3=5, 20_3=6, 21_3=7, 22_3=8.\n\nCheck which are perfect squares:\n\n4=2\u00b2.\n\nCheck digits: 1 and 1 (11_3). Sum is 2, which equals sqrt(4)=2. So, count is 1.\n\nOther numbers: 3,5,6,7,8 are not squares.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 4: 10=4, 11=5, 12=6, 13=7, 20=8, 21=9, 22=10, 23=11, 30=12, 31=13, 32=14, 33=15.\n\nPerfect squares in this range: 4,9.\n\nCheck 4: 10_4, digits 1 and 0. Sum=1\u22602.\n\nSo, not b-eautiful.\n\nCheck 9: 21_4, digits 2 and 1. Sum=3\u22603 (sqrt(9)=3). Wait, 2+1=3=3. So, yes, it's b-eautiful.\n\nSo, count=1.\n\nWait, but 4 is 10_4, sum is 1\u22602. So, only 9 is valid. So, count=1.\n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 5: from 5 to 24.\n\nPerfect squares: 9,16.\n\nCheck 9: 14_5, digits 1 and 4. Sum=5\u22603. So, no.\n\n16: 31_5, digits 3 and 1. Sum=4\u22604 (sqrt(16)=4). Yes, 3+1=4. So, count=1.\n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 6 to 35.\n\nPerfect squares: 9, 16, 25.\n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 13_6. 1+3=4\u22603.\n\n16: 24_6. 2+4=6\u22604.\n\n25: 41_6. 4+1=5\u22605. Wait, 4+1=5, sqrt(25)=5. So, yes. So, count=1.\n\nb=7:\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 7 to 48.\n\nPerfect squares: 9, 16, 25, 36.\n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 12_7. 1+2=3\u22603. Wait, 1+2=3=3. So, yes. So, count=1.\n\n16: 22_7. 2+2=4\u22604. Yes, 2+2=4. So, count=2.\n\n25: 34_7. 3+4=7\u22605. No.\n\n36: 51_7. 5+1=6\u22606. Yes, 5+1=6. So, count=3.\n\nWait, so for b=7, we have three b-eautiful numbers: 9,16,36.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nn=9: in base 7 is 12_7. 1+2=3= sqrt(9). So yes.\n\nn=16: in base 7 is 22_7. 2+2=4= sqrt(16). Yes.\n\nn=36: in base 7 is 51_7. 5+1=6= sqrt(36). Yes.\n\nSo, count=3.\n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:8 to 63.\n\nPerfect squares:9,16,25,36,49.\n\nCheck each:\n\n9:11_8. 1+1=2\u22603. No.\n\n16:20_8. 2+0=2\u22604. No.\n\n25:31_8.3+1=4\u22605. No.\n\n36:44_8.4+4=8\u22606. No.\n\n49:61_8.6+1=7\u22607. Yes, 6+1=7. So, count=1.\n\nb=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:9 to 80.\n\nPerfect squares:9,16,25,36,49,64.\n\nCheck each:\n\n9:10_9.1+0=1\u22603.

So, count=1.\n\nb=10:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:10 to 99.\n\nPerfect squares:16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16:16_10.1+6=7\u22604. No.\n\n25:25_10.2+5=7\u22605. No.\n\n36:36_10.3+6=9\u22606. No.\n\n49:49_10.4+9=13\u22607. No.\n\n64:64_10.6+4=10\u22608. No.\n\n81:81_10.8+1=9=9. Yes. So, count=1.\n\nWait, but earlier when b=7, the count was 3. Let me check higher b's.\n\nb=11:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:11 to 120.\n\nPerfect squares:16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121.\n\nBut 121 is 121_10, which in base 11 is 11^2 +0= 100_11. So, 100_11 is 121.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16:15_11.1+5=6\u22604. No.\n\n25:23_11.2+3=5\u22605. Yes. So, count=1.\n\n36:33_11.3+3=6\u22606. Yes. Count=2.\n\n49:45_11.4+5=9\u22607. No.\n\n64:59_11.5+9=14\u22608. No.\n\n81:74_11.7+4=11\u22609. No.\n\n100:91_11.9+1=10\u226010. Yes. Count=3.\n\n121:100_11.1+0+0=1\u226011. Wait, no, in base 11, 121 is 100_11, which is a three-digit number. So, it's not a two-digit number. So, we can ignore it.\n\nSo, for b=11, we have three b-eautiful numbers:25,36,100.\n\nWait, but 100 in base 11 is 100_11, which is three digits, so it's not considered. So, only 25 and 36.\n\nWait, no, 25 in base 11 is 23_11, which is two digits. 36 is 33_11. 49 is 45_11. 64 is 59_11. 81 is 74_11. 100 is 91_11, which is two digits.\n\nWait, 100 in base 11 is 9*11 +1= 99+1=100. So, yes, 91_11 is two digits. So, 9+1=10= sqrt(100). So, yes, that's valid.\n\nSo, for b=11, the valid numbers are 25,36,100. So, count=3.\n\nWait, but 100 is 91_11, which is two digits. So, yes, that's valid. So, count=3.\n\nb=12:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:12 to 143.\n\nPerfect squares:16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16:14_12.1+4=5\u22604. No.\n\n25:21_12.2+1=3\u22605.

No.\n\n144:100_12.1+0+0=1\u226012. No.\n\nWait, but 144 in base 12 is 100_12, which is three digits, so not considered.\n\nSo, no valid numbers for b=12. Count=0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check:\n\nWait, 16 in base 12 is 14_12: 1+4=5\u22604.\n\n25 in base 12 is 21_12: 2+1=3\u22605.\n\n36 in base 12 is 30_12: 3+0=3\u22606.\n\n49 in base 12 is 37_12: 3+7=10\u22607.\n\n64 in base 12 is 54_12:5+4=9\u22608.\n\n81 in base 12 is 69_12:6+9=15\u22609.\n\n100 in base 12 is 84_12:8+4=12\u226010.\n\n121 in base 12 is 101_12:1+0+1=2\u226011.\n\n144 is three digits, so not considered.\n\nSo, indeed, count=0 for b=12.\n\nHmm, that's unexpected. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check for b=13, as per the example given.\n\nb=13:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:13 to 168.\n\nPerfect squares:16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16:13_13.1+3=4=4. Yes. Count=1.\n\n25:29_13.2+9=11\u22605. No.\n\n36:210_13? Wait, no, 36 in base 13 is 2*13 +10=36. So, 2A_13. But digits must be 0-12, so 10 is represented as 'A'. But the problem says digits, so perhaps using letters is acceptable, but the sum would be 2 +10=12\u22606. So, no.\n\nWait, but wait: 36 in base 13 is 2*13 +10=36, so digits are 2 and 10. Sum is 12\u22606. So, no.\n\n49:310_13? Wait, 3*13=39, 39+10=49. So, 3A_13. Sum is 3+10=13\u22607. No.\n\n64:412_13? Wait, 4*13=52, 52+12=64. So, 4C_13. Sum is 4+12=16\u22608. No.\n\n81:63_13.6+3=9=9. Yes. Count=2.\n\n100:79_13.7+9=16\u226010. No.\n\n121:94_13.9+4=13\u226011. No.\n\n144:108_13.1+0+8=9\u226012. No.\n\n169:130_13.1+3+0=4\u226013. No.\n\nSo, for b=13, we have two b-eautiful numbers:16 and 81. So, count=2.\n\nWait, but the example says 81 is 13-eautiful. So, that's correct.\n\nBut the count is 2, which is less than 10.\n\nSo, continuing:\n\nb=14:\n\nTwo-digit numbers:14 to 195.\n\nPerfect squares:16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16:12_14.1+2=3\u22604. No.\n\n25:111_14? Wait, 25 in base 14 is 1*14 +11=25. So, 1B_14. Sum is 1+11=12\u22605. No.\n\n36:28_14.2+8=10\u22606. No.\n\n49:37_14.3+7=10\u22607. No.\n\n64:48_14.4+8=12\u22608.

No.\n\n25:110_15? Wait, 25 in base 15 is 1*15 +10=25. So, 1A_15. Sum is 1+10=11\u22605. No.\n\n36:26_15.2+6=8\u22606. No.\n\n49:34_15.3+4=7\u22607. Yes. Count=1.\n\n64:44_15.4+4=8\u22608. Yes.

No.\n\n196:131_15.1+3+1=5\u226014. No.\n\n225:150_15.1+5+0=6\u226015. No.\n\nSo, for b=15, count=3.\n\nHmm, this is taking a while. Maybe I should find a better approach.\n\nWait, from the earlier equation:\n\nk\u00b2 -k = a*(b-1)\n\nSo, for each b, the number of valid k's is the number of divisors d = b-1 of (k\u00b2 -k) for k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], such that a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d is \u2264 d, and c = k - a is between 0 and d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are equal to d.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find that for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of integers k where d divides k(k-1), and 1 \u2264 a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d \u2264d, and 0 \u2264 c =k -a \u2264d.\n\nWait, but this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each d, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k's where d divides k(k-1), and a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d is \u2264d, and c = k - a is \u22650.\n\nSo, for each d, we can find the number of k's such that:\n\n1. d divides k(k-1)\n\n2. a = (k\u00b2 -k)/d \u2264d\n\n3. c = k - a \u22650\n\nSo, perhaps for each d, the number of valid k's is the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that d divides k(k-1), and a and c are within their ranges.\n\nBut this is still a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for a given d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors of d that are \u2264 sqrt(d+1).\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each divisor m of d, there's a corresponding k such that m = k or m = k-1.\n\nWait, since d divides k(k-1), and k and k-1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors from k and k-1.\n\nSo, for each divisor m of d, we can set m =k, and d/m =k-1, or m=k-1 and d/m =k.\n\nSo, for each divisor m of d, we can solve for k:\n\nCase 1: m =k, and d/m =k-1 \u2192 m =k, and d/m =k-1 \u2192 d = m*(k-1) = m*(m -1)\n\nSo, d = m(m -1). So, for each m, d must be equal to m(m -1). So, for a given d, if d can be expressed as m(m -1), then k=m is a solution.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: m =k-1, and d/m =k \u2192 m =k-1, and d/m =k \u2192 d = m*k =m*(m +1)\n\nSo, d = m(m +1). So, for each m, d must be equal to m(m +1), then k=m+1 is a solution.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of m's such that d =m(m-1) or d=m(m+1).\n\nWait, this seems promising.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of solutions is the number of integers m where d =m(m-1) or d=m(m+1).\n\nEach such m gives a valid k, either k=m or k=m+1.\n\nSo, for example, if d=6:\n\nCase 1: d =m(m-1). Let's see:\n\nm=3: 3*2=6 \u2192 yes. So, k=3.\n\nCase 2: d=m(m+1). m=2: 2*3=6 \u2192 yes. So, k=3.\n\nWait, but wait, for d=6, from case 1, m=3 gives k=3. From case 2, m=2 gives k=3. So, both cases give k=3. But we have to check if k=3 is within the range [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d]. d=6, so sqrt(7)\u22482.64, so ceil is 3. So, k=3 is valid.\n\nSo, for d=6, we have one solution.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nd=6, so b=7.\n\nk=3: n=3\u00b2=9. In base 7, 9 is 12_7. 1+2=3= sqrt(9). So, yes, valid.\n\nAnother possible k: from d=6, m=2 gives k=3 as well. So, perhaps it's a single solution.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of ways to express d as m(m-1) or m(m+1), which would be the number of integer solutions m for each case.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of valid k's is the number of integer m's such that d =m(m-1) or d=m(m+1).\n\nEach such m gives a k, either k=m or k=m+1.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nd=6: m=3 (d=m(m-1)), and m=2 (d=m(m+1)). Both give k=3. So, one unique k.\n\nSimilarly, d=12:\n\nCase 1: m(m-1)=12 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -12=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b1sqrt(1+48))/2=(1\u00b17)/2 \u2192 m=4 or m=-3. So, m=4.\n\nCase 2: m(m+1)=12 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -12=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(1+48))/2=(-1\u00b17)/2 \u2192 m=3 or m=-4. So, m=3.\n\nSo, for d=12, we have two solutions: k=4 (from case 1, m=4) and k=4 (from case 2, m=3: k=m+1=4). Wait, no: case 2 gives k=m+1=4, same as case 1.\n\nWait, but wait, for d=12:\n\nFrom case 1: m=4, k=4.\n\nFrom case 2: m=3, k=4.\n\nSo, both cases give k=4. So, only one unique solution.\n\nSo, for d=12, b=13, k=4.\n\nCheck n=16 in base 13: 13 +3=16. Digits 1 and 3. 1+3=4= sqrt(16). So, yes.\n\nAnother possible k: from d=12, is there another k?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps for d=12, m=4 gives k=4, and m=3 gives k=4. So, only one k.\n\nWait, but maybe I can have m= -3 or m=-4, but those would give negative k's, which are invalid.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of positive integer solutions m for d=m(m-1) and d=m(m+1), which can be either zero, one, or two, depending on whether d can be expressed as m(m-1) or m(m+1).\n\nWait, but in the case of d=6, both cases gave the same k=3. So, perhaps each d can have up to two solutions, but sometimes they coincide.\n\nSo, the number of valid k's for a given d is equal to the number of integer solutions m where m is positive and d=m(m-1) or d=m(m+1).\n\nSo, for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of such m's.\n\nSo, the maximum number of k's per d is 2, but sometimes it's 1, and sometimes 0.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nd=2: m(m-1)=2 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -2=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b13)/2 \u2192 m=2 or m=-1. So, m=2. So, k=2.\n\nCheck: n=4 in base 3: 11_3. 1+1=2= sqrt(4). So, valid.\n\nd=2 also can be expressed as m(m+1)=2 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -2=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(1+8))/2=(-1\u00b13)/2 \u2192 m=1 or m=-2. So, m=1. Then, k=m+1=2.\n\nSo, for d=2, we have two m's, but both give k=2. So, only one unique solution.\n\nSimilarly, for d=6, we have two m's, but both give k=3.\n\nSo, perhaps for each d, the number of valid k's is either 0, 1, or 2.\n\nBut wait, let's check d=12:\n\nFrom case 1: m=4 \u2192 k=4.\n\nFrom case 2: m=3 \u2192 k=4.\n\nSo, same k, so count=1.\n\nAnother example, d=30:\n\nCase 1: m(m-1)=30 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -30=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b1sqrt(1+120))/2=(1\u00b111)/2 \u2192 m=6 or m=-5. So, m=6 \u2192k=6.\n\nCase 2: m(m+1)=30 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -30=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(1+120))/2=(-1\u00b111)/2 \u2192 m=5 or m=-6. So, m=5 \u2192k=6.\n\nSo, both cases give k=6.\n\nSo, for d=30, count=1.\n\nAnother example, d=2:\n\nAs above, count=1.\n\nd=6: count=1.\n\nd=12: count=1.\n\nWait, but what about d=210?\n\nCase 1: m(m-1)=210 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -210=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b1sqrt(1+840))/2=(1\u00b129)/2 \u2192 m=15 or m=-14. So, m=15 \u2192k=15.\n\nCase 2: m(m+1)=210 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -210=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(1+840))/2=(-1\u00b129)/2 \u2192 m=14 or m=-15. So, m=14 \u2192k=15.\n\nSo, both cases give k=15. So, count=1.\n\nHmm, seems like for these examples, each d gives at most one valid k.\n\nWait, but let me check d=0: not applicable since b\u22652.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of valid k's per d is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier when d=6, both cases gave the same k=3. So, perhaps for each d, there is at most one valid k.\n\nWait, but let me check d=1:\n\nCase 1: m(m-1)=1 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -1=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b1sqrt(5))/2. Not integer.\n\nCase 2: m(m+1)=1 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -1=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(5))/2. Not integer.\n\nSo, no solutions. So, count=0.\n\nd=3:\n\nCase 1: m(m-1)=3 \u2192 m\u00b2 -m -3=0 \u2192 m=(1\u00b1sqrt(13))/2. Not integer.\n\nCase 2: m(m+1)=3 \u2192 m\u00b2 +m -3=0 \u2192 m=(-1\u00b1sqrt(13))/2.

Not integer.\n\nSo, count=0.\n\nd=12: as before, count=1.\n\nSo, from these examples, it seems that for d=6,12, etc., we have one valid k.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of valid k's per d is either 0 or 1.\n\nThus, for each d, the number of valid k's is either 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful integers is equal to the number of d's (where d = b -1) for which there exists a valid k.\n\nBut wait, this contradicts earlier examples where for b=7, we had three valid numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.\n\nWait, in the case of b=7, d=6. From earlier, d=6 has one valid k=3.\n\nBut when b=7, we found three valid numbers:9,16,36.\n\nWait, that suggests that my earlier approach is missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation k\u00b2 -k = a*d, where a is a digit in base b (i.e., a \u2264d).\n\nBut for a given d, there can be multiple a's that satisfy the equation, leading to multiple k's.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of divisors a of (k\u00b2 -k) such that a \u2264d and c =k -a is \u2264d.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of solutions to the equation k\u00b2 -k = a*d, where a is a positive integer \u2264d, and c =k -a is between 0 and d.\n\nSo, for each d, the number of valid k's is the number of a's in [1,d] such that k\u00b2 -k =a*d has integer solutions k.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that for each a, k must satisfy k\u00b2 -k =a*d.\n\nSo, for each a, the quadratic equation k\u00b2 -k -a*d=0 must have integer solutions.\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is 1 +4a*d.\n\nFor k to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nSo, 1 +4a*d must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me denote m\u00b2 =1 +4a*d.\n\nSo, m\u00b2 =1 +4a*d.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4a*d =m\u00b2 -1.\n\nSo,\n\nd = (m\u00b2 -1)/(4a)\n\nSince d must be an integer, (m\u00b2 -1) must be divisible by 4a.\n\nBut a is a positive integer \u2264d.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but perhaps I can find a way to parameterize m and a.\n\nLet me consider that m must be odd, because m\u00b2 -1 must be divisible by 4.\n\nIndeed, m\u00b2 \u22611 mod 4 for any odd m.\n\nSo, m must be odd. Let me set m=2t +1, where t is a non-negative integer.\n\nThen,\n\nm\u00b2 = (2t +1)^2 =4t\u00b2 +4t +1.\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2 -1=4t\u00b2 +4t =4t(t +1).\n\nSo,\n\nd = [4t(t +1)]/(4a) = t(t +1)/a.\n\nSo, d must be equal to t(t +1)/a.\n\nSince d must be an integer, a must be a divisor of t(t +1).\n\nBut t and t+1 are coprime, so a must be a product of factors of t and t+1.\n\nAlso, since a \u2264d, and d= t(t +1)/a, we have:\n\na \u2264 t(t +1)/a \u2192 a\u00b2 \u2264 t(t +1).\n\nSo, a \u2264 sqrt(t(t +1)).\n\nBut since t and t+1 are consecutive integers, sqrt(t(t +1)) is approximately t +0.5.\n\nSo, a can range from 1 up to t.\n\nWait, but a must also be a divisor of t(t +1).\n\nSo, for each t, and for each divisor a of t(t +1) with a \u2264t, we can compute d= t(t +1)/a.\n\nThen, for each such d, we have a corresponding k.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, k=(1 +m)/2=(1 +2t +1)/2= t +1.\n\nWait, because m=2t +1, so k=(1 + (2t +1))/2=(2t +2)/2=t +1.\n\nSo, for each t and a where a divides t(t +1) and a \u2264t, we have a solution k=t +1, and d= t(t +1)/a.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of valid a's is equal to the number of divisors of t(t +1) that are \u2264t.\n\nEach such a gives a valid d= t(t +1)/a, and thus a valid b= d +1.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of valid a's is equal to the number of divisors of t(t +1) that are \u2264t.\n\nEach such a corresponds to a valid b, and for that b, k=t +1 is a valid solution.\n\nThus, for each t, the number of b's that have at least one valid k is equal to the number of divisors a of t(t +1) that are \u2264t.\n\nBut we are looking for the number of valid k's for a given b. So, perhaps for each b, the number of valid k's is equal to the number of t's such that d= t(t +1)/a for some a dividing t(t +1), and b=d +1.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each t, the number of valid b's is equal to the number of a's that divide t(t +1) and are \u2264t.\n\nEach such a gives a unique b= t(t +1)/a +1.\n\nAnd for each such b, k=t +1 is a valid solution.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of b's that have at least one valid k is equal to the number of a's that divide t(t +1) and are \u2264t.\n\nThus, the total number of valid b's up to a certain point can be computed by considering all t's and their corresponding a's.\n\nBut our goal is to find the minimal b where the number of valid k's exceeds 10.\n\nSo, perhaps for each t, we can compute the number of a's that divide t(t +1) and are \u2264t, and then for each such a, compute b= t(t +1)/a +1, and count how many times each b appears across different t's.\n\nThe count for each b would be the number of t's for which b= t(t +1)/a +1 for some a dividing t(t +1) and a \u2264t.\n\nSo, the count for each b is the number of such t's and a's.\n\nThus, the count for b is the number of ways to express (b -1) as t(t +1)/a, where a divides t(t +1) and a \u2264t.\n\nSo, for example, when b=7, d=6.\n\nWe can have t=2:\n\nt=2, t+1=3. So, t(t+1)=6.\n\nDivisors a of 6 that are \u22642: a=1,2.\n\nFor a=1: d=6/1=6 \u2192 b=7.\n\nFor a=2: d=6/2=3 \u2192 b=4.\n\nSo, for t=2, we get two b's:7 and4.\n\nBut wait, when a=2, d=3, b=4.\n\nBut earlier, for b=4, we had k=3, which was valid.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of a's gives the number of b's that have a valid k.\n\nSo, for each t, the number of b's is equal to the number of a's.\n\nThus, the count for each b is the number of t's for which (b -1)=t(t +1)/a, with a dividing t(t +1) and a \u2264t.\n\nSo, to find the count for each b, we can iterate over t and a, compute b= t(t +1)/a +1, and count how many times each b appears.\n\nThe b with the highest count will be the one we're looking for.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, but perhaps we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each t, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of t(t +1) that are \u2264t.\n\nSince t and t+1 are coprime, the number of divisors a of t(t +1) that are \u2264t is equal to the number of divisors of t plus the number of divisors of t+1 that are \u2264t.\n\nWait, no. Because t and t+1 are coprime, the divisors of t(t +1) are the products of the divisors of t and t+1.\n\nSo, any divisor a of t(t +1) can be written as a= d1*d2, where d1 divides t and d2 divides t+1.\n\nBut since a must be \u2264t, and d1 \u2264t and d2 \u2264t+1, but a= d1*d2 \u2264t.\n\nThis is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for small t's, we can compute the number of a's and thus the number of b's.\n\nLet me try t=1:\n\nt=1, t+1=2.\n\nt(t+1)=2.\n\nDivisors a of 2 that are \u22641: a=1.\n\nSo, a=1: d=2/1=2 \u2192 b=3.\n\nSo, for t=1, we have one b:3.\n\nt=2:\n\nt=2, t+1=3.\n\nt(t+1)=6.\n\nDivisors a of 6 that are \u22642: a=1,2.\n\nSo, a=1: d=6/1=6 \u2192b=7.\n\na=2: d=6/2=3 \u2192b=4.\n\nSo, two b's:7,4.\n\nt=3:\n\nt=3, t+1=4.\n\nt(t+1)=12.\n\nDivisors a of 12 that are \u22643: a=1,2,3.\n\na=1: d=12/1=12 \u2192b=13.\n\na=2: d=12/2=6 \u2192b=7.\n\na=3: d=12/3=4 \u2192b=5.\n\nSo, three b's:13,7,5.\n\nt=4:\n\nt=4, t+1=5.\n\nt(t+1)=20.\n\nDivisors a of 20 that are \u22644: a=1,2,4,5 (wait, 5>4, so a=1,2,4).\n\nWait, 20's divisors are 1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\nAmong these, a must be \u22644, so a=1,2,4.\n\na=1: d=20 \u2192b=21.\n\na=2: d=10 \u2192b=11.\n\na=4: d=5

d=21 \u2192b=22.\n\nSo, twelve b's:421,211,141,106,85,71,61,43,36,31,29,22.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite extensive, but perhaps we can see a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the counts for each t:\n\nt=1:1 b\n\nt=2:2 b's\n\nt=3:3 b's\n\nt=4:3 b's\n\nt=5:4 b's\n\nt=6:4 b's\n\nt=7:4 b's\n\nt=8:6 b's\n\nt=9:6 b's\n\nt=10:4 b's\n\nt=11:6 b's\n\nt=12:6 b's\n\nt=13:4 b's\n\nt=14:8 b's\n\nt=15:10

mean that b=22 has 12 counts? Wait, no, each t gives multiple b's, but each b can be generated by multiple t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each t contributes to the count of a specific b.\n\nWait, no, each t contributes to multiple b's. So, for example, t=2 contributes to b=4 and b=7.\n\nBut the count for each b is the number of t's that generate it.\n\nSo, for example, b=7 is generated by t=2 (a=2) and t=3 (a=3). So, count for b=7 is 2.\n\nSimilarly, b=13 is generated by t=3 (a=1) and t=11 (a=11). So, count for b=13 is 2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier manual count for b=7, we found three valid numbers, which suggests that the count for b=7 is 3. But according to this method, it's generated by t=2 and t=3, so count=2. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is missing something. Because when I manually checked b=7, I found three valid numbers:9,16,36.\n\nBut according to this approach, for b=7, the count should be 2.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is missing some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is correct, and the manual count was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's recheck b=7.\n\nb=7, d=6.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nFrom t=2, a=2: d=6, k=3.\n\nFrom t=3, a=3: d=4, but that would be for b=5, not 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each t, the b's generated are unique, and the count for each b is the number of t's that generate it.\n\nSo, for b=7, it's generated by t=2 (a=2) and t=3 (a=1).\n\nWait, no, t=3, a=1: d=12/1=12 \u2192b=13.\n\nSo, perhaps b=7 is generated only by t=2, a=2, which gives d=3 \u2192b=4. Wait, no, that's for a=2, d=3 \u2192b=4.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count for each b is the number of t's that generate it, which is the number of ways to write (b-1)=t(t+1)/a, with a dividing t(t+1) and a \u2264t.\n\nSo, for b=7, d=6.\n\nWe need to find all t and a such that 6= t(t+1)/a.\n\nSo, t(t+1)=6a.\n\nPossible t's:\n\nt=2: 2*3=6=6a \u2192a=1.\n\nt=1:1*2=2=6a \u2192a=1/3, not integer.\n\nt=3:3*4=12=6a \u2192a=2.\n\nSo, for t=2, a=1: valid.\n\nFor t=3, a=2: valid.\n\nSo, two t's contribute to b=7.\n\nThus, count=2.\n\nBut earlier manual count found three valid numbers for b=7, which suggests that count should be 3.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is correct, and the manual count was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's recheck b=7.\n\nb=7, d=6.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nFrom t=2, a=1: d=6, k=3.\n\nFrom t=3, a=2: d=6, k=4.\n\nWait, no, t=3, a=2: d=3*4/2=6 \u2192b=7.\n\nSo, k=4.\n\nSo, for b=7, we have two valid k's:3 and4.\n\nBut earlier manual count found three valid numbers:9,16,36.\n\nWait, this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let's re-express the numbers:\n\nFor b=7, two-digit numbers are from 7 to 48.\n\nPerfect squares:9,16,25,36,49.\n\nCheck each:\n\n9:12_7 \u21921+2=3=3. Valid.\n\n16:22_7 \u21922+2=4=4. Valid.\n\n25:34_7 \u21923+4=7\u22605. Not valid.\n\n36:51_7 \u21925+1=6\u22606. Wait, 5+1=6=6. So, valid.\n\n49:100_7 \u2192 three digits, invalid.\n\nSo, for b=7, valid numbers are 9,16,36. So, count=3.\n\nBut according to the approach, it should be 2.\n\nSo, the approach is missing one.\n\nThus, the approach is incomplete.\n\nPerhaps the earlier approach misses some cases where d is not of the form t(t+1)/a, but perhaps another form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with the earlier manual counting, but it's clear that for higher t's, the counts per b increase.\n\nFrom the t=15 case, we saw that b=17 is generated by t=15, a=15: d=240/15=16 \u2192b=17.\n\nBut when t=15, a=15, then k=16.\n\nSo, for b=17, d=16.\n\nCheck if there are multiple k's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count for b=17 is the number of t's that generate it, which for t=15, a=15 gives one k=16.\n\nBut earlier manual count for b=17 wasn't done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b where the count exceeds 10 is b=211, but that seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 211.\n\nBut looking back, when t=14, a=1, b=211 is generated, and t=14, a=2 gives b=106, etc.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 211, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 211, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for the first b that appears more than 10 times in the list generated by all t's.\n\nFrom the earlier t's:\n\nt=1: b=3\n\nt=2: b=4,7\n\nt=3: b=5,7,13\n\nt=4: b=5,6,7,11\n\nt=5: b=5,6,7,11,16\n\nt=6: b=7,8,11,15\n\nt=7: b=9,13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the count for b=21 is high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 211.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the minimal b is 211.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \\( b \\) such that there are more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful integers. A \\( b \\)-eautiful integer \\( n \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\) where the sum of its digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding \\( b \\)-eautiful Numbers**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is \\( b \\)-eautiful if it can be expressed as \\( n = a \\cdot b + c \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\) (i.e., \\( 0 \\leq a, c < b \\) and \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n   - The sum of the digits \\( a + c \\) must equal \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - Given \\( n = a \\cdot b + c \\) and \\( a + c = \\sqrt{n} \\), we derive the equation:\n     \\[\n     (a + c)^2 = a \\cdot b + c\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging, we get:\n     \\[\n     a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a \\cdot b - c = 0\n     \\]\n   - This can be further simplified to:\n     \\[\n     b = a + 2c + \\frac{c^2 - c}{a}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{c^2 - c}{a} \\) must be an integer.\n\n3. **Finding Valid \\( b \\)**:\n   - For each base \\( b \\), we check all possible two-digit numbers \\( n \\) in base \\( b \\) that are perfect squares.\n   - For each perfect square \\( n \\), we express it in base \\( b \\) and check if the sum of its digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Counting \\( b \\)-eautiful Numbers**:\n   - We systematically check each base \\( b \\) starting from 2, counting the number of \\( b \\)-eautiful integers.\n   - The goal is to find the smallest \\( b \\) where this count exceeds 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_beautiful(n, b):\n    s = n\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        digits.append(n % b)\n        n = n // b\n    a = digits[-1]\n    c = digits[-2] if len(digits) >= 2 else 0\n    return a + c == math.isqrt(s)\n\ndef count_beautiful(b):\n    count = 0\n    lower = math.ceil(math.sqrt(b))\n    upper = b * b - 1\n    for k in range(lower, b):\n        n = k * k\n        if n > upper:\n            continue\n        a = n // b\n        c = n % b\n        if a == 0:\n            continue\n        if a + c == k:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nb = 2\nwhile True:\n    cnt = count_beautiful(b)\n    if cnt > 10:\n        print(b)\n        break\n    b += 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function `is_beautiful(n, b)`**:\n   - Checks if a number \\( n \\) is \\( b \\)-eautiful by converting \\( n \\) to base \\( b \\) and verifying if the sum of its digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n2. **Function `count_beautiful(b)`**:\n   - Counts the number of \\( b \\)-eautiful integers by iterating over possible values of \\( k \\) (where \\( k = \\sqrt{n} \\)) and checking each condition.\n\n3. **Main Loop**:\n   - Starts from \\( b = 2 \\) and increments \\( b \\) until it finds a base where the count of \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers exceeds 10.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest base \\( b \\) meeting the problem's criteria.",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nAn example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).\n\nSo, our goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I need to express n in base b as a two-digit number. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, right? So d1 is at least 1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, n = d1 * b + d0.\n\nThe second condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Let's denote s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s^2.\n\nPutting it together, we have:\ns^2 = d1 * b + d0.\n\nBut since s = d1 + d0, we can write:\ns^2 = d1 * b + (s - d1).\n\nLet me rearrange that equation to solve for b.\n\ns^2 = d1 * b + s - d1\n=> s^2 - s + d1 = d1 * b\n=> b = (s^2 - s + d1) / d1\n\nSimplify that:\nb = (s^2 - s)/d1 + 1\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Alternatively, maybe express b in terms of s and d1.\n\nBut wait, since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, we have constraints:\n- d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1.\n- d0 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nBut since d0 = s - d1, we can write:\n0 \u2264 s - d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nWhich implies:\nd1 \u2264 s \u2264 d1 + (b - 1)\n\nAlso, since d1 must be at least 1, s must be at least 1 + 0 = 1, but since n is a positive integer, s must be at least 1. However, s is sqrt(n), so n must be a perfect square. So s is an integer because n is a perfect square. So s is an integer \u2265 1.\n\nWait, let's think again. Because n is a two-digit number in base b, n is between b (10_b) and b^2 - 1 (which is (b^2 - 1)_b). So n is in [b, b^2 - 1]. Since n = s^2, s must be in [sqrt(b), sqrt(b^2 - 1)]. So s is in [sqrt(b), b - 1], because sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just less than b.\n\nSo s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose b is 2. Then n is between 2 and 3 (since 10_2 is 2, 11_2 is 3). So n must be 2 or 3, which are not perfect squares except 1, but 1 is less than 2. So in base 2, there are no b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's try to structure this.\n\nWe have n = s^2, and n is a two-digit number in base b. So n must satisfy b \u2264 s^2 \u2264 b^2 - 1.\n\nWhich implies that s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b^2 - 1) \u2248 b - (1/(2b)).\n\nSo s is an integer in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1].\n\nAdditionally, from the equation s^2 = d1 * b + d0, and d0 = s - d1.\n\nSo substituting d0 into the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1 * b + (s - d1)\n=> s^2 = d1 * b + s - d1\n=> s^2 - s = d1 * (b - 1)\n=> d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer (as it's a digit), (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So (b - 1) divides (s^2 - s).\n\nAlso, since d1 is a digit in base b, d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, we can write d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). Therefore, (s^2 - s) must be a multiple of (b - 1), and d1 must be at least 1 and at most b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, we can look for integers s such that:\n\n1. s is an integer with ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b - 1.\n\n2. (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1).\n\n3. The resulting d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\n4. Additionally, since d0 = s - d1, d0 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b - 1.\n\nSo, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s that satisfy these conditions.\n\nOur task is to find the smallest b such that this count is more than ten.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to iterate over possible bases starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute how many s satisfy the above conditions, and find the smallest b where this number exceeds 10.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the equation:\n\ns^2 - s = k*(b - 1), where k is d1, an integer between 1 and b - 1.\n\nSo, for each b, we can think of s^2 - s as a multiple of (b - 1). So, for each b, the number of valid s is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is between 1 and b - 1.\n\nAlternatively, since (b - 1) divides (s^2 - s), we can write s^2 \u2261 s mod (b - 1).\n\nWhich implies s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1).\n\nSo, s \u2261 0 mod (b - 1) or s \u2261 1 mod (b - 1).\n\nBut since s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], let's see:\n\nIf s \u2261 0 mod (b - 1), then s must be a multiple of (b - 1). But since s \u2264 b - 1, the only possibility is s = b - 1.\n\nSimilarly, if s \u2261 1 mod (b - 1), then s = 1 + k*(b - 1), but since s \u2264 b - 1, the only possibility is s = 1.\n\nBut wait, s is at least ceil(sqrt(b)), which for b >= 2 is at least 2 (since sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414, so ceil is 2). So s = 1 is not in the range. Therefore, the only possible s is s = b - 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the example given, b=13, s=9, which is less than 13-1=12.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my reasoning is flawed here.\n\nWait, let's think again. The equation s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1) doesn't necessarily mean that s \u2261 0 or 1 mod (b - 1), but rather that s \u2261 0 mod d or s \u2261 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of (b - 1). Because (b - 1) = d * m, so s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod d and mod m.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that since (b - 1) divides s(s - 1), which is the product of two consecutive integers, so (b - 1) must be a product of two consecutive integers or factors of such.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of possible s is equal to the number of divisors of (b - 1) that are less than or equal to s_max, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let's let m = b - 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\ns^2 - s = k * m, where k = d1 is an integer between 1 and m.\n\nSo, s^2 - s - k * m = 0.\n\nFor each m, we can look for integers s and k such that s^2 - s = k * m, with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m], since b = m + 1.\n\nWait, because b = m + 1, so s must be in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m].\n\nSo for each m, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (s, k) such that s^2 - s is divisible by m, k = (s^2 - s)/m is between 1 and m, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m].\n\nSo, perhaps for each m, we can find the number of s in that interval such that m divides s(s - 1), and k is within 1 to m.\n\nBut how do we count the number of such s?\n\nLet me think about m. Since m divides s(s - 1), and s and s - 1 are coprime (since consecutive integers), m must divide the product s(s - 1). Therefore, m must be a product of factors of s and s - 1, but since they are coprime, each prime factor of m must divide either s or s - 1, but not both.\n\nSo, m can be written as a product of two coprime numbers, say a and b, such that a divides s and b divides s - 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors a of m such that a divides s and (m/a) divides (s - 1), with s in the required range.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to approach this by considering that for each m, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m, because for each divisor a of m, we can set s \u2261 0 mod a and s \u2261 1 mod (m/a). Then, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there's a unique solution modulo m. But since s must be in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m], we can check whether that solution lies in the interval.\n\nWait, but m can be composite, so the number of possible s could be equal to the number of such divisors. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m that are less than or equal to m, but considering the constraints on s.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute for small m and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWait, let's think about the example given: b=13, so m=12.\n\nIn this case, m=12, and the number of solutions s is 1 (since s=9 is the only solution). But wait, in the example, 81 is 13-eautiful because s=9, and d1=6, d0=3. Let's see:\n\nFrom the equation, s=9, m=12.\n\nSo, s^2 - s = 81 - 9 =72.\n\n72 = d1 * 12.\n\nSo, d1 = 72 / 12 = 6, which is valid because d1 must be \u226412.\n\nSo, for m=12, s=9 is a solution.\n\nBut are there others? Let's check.\n\nWe can try s=1: s=1, s^2 - s=0, which would make d1=0, but d1 must be at least 1, so invalid.\n\ns=2: 4 - 2 = 2. 2 must be divisible by 12? No, 2/12=1/6, not integer.\n\ns=3: 9 -3=6. 6/12=0.5, not integer.\n\ns=4: 16 -4=12. 12/12=1. So d1=1. Then d0 = s - d1=4 -1=3.\n\nSo, n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which is s=4. So 16 is 13-eautiful.\n\nWait, so for m=12, there are at least two solutions: s=4 and s=9.\n\nWait, let's check s=5: 25 -5=20. 20/12\u22481.666, not integer.\n\ns=6: 36 -6=30. 30/12=2.5, not integer.\n\ns=7: 49 -7=42. 42/12=3.5, nope.\n\ns=8:64-8=56. 56/12\u22484.666, nope.\n\ns=9:81-9=72. 72/12=6, which is integer. So d1=6, d0=3. So n=6*13 +3=81, which is 9^2.\n\ns=10:100 -10=90. 90/12=7.5, nope.\n\ns=11:121 -11=110. 110/12\u22489.166, nope.\n\ns=12:144 -12=132. 132/12=11. So d1=11, d0=12 -11=1. Then n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144, which is 12^2. So, 144 is 13-eautiful as well.\n\nWait, so for m=12, we have s=4,9,12 as possible solutions. Wait, s=12 is allowed because s \u2264 m=12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought s must be \u2264 b-1, which is 12, so s=12 is allowed.\n\nSo, for m=12, we have s=4,9,12.\n\nWait, let me check s=12:\n\ns=12, d1=11, d0=1. n=11*13 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12, which matches s=12.\n\nSo, for m=12, there are three solutions: s=4,9,12.\n\nWait, but earlier when s=4, n=16, which is 4^2, and 16 is 13 in base 13? Wait, no, 16 in base 13 is 1*13 +3=16, right? So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for m=12, we have three solutions. So in base 13, there are three b-eautiful numbers.\n\nBut the problem says that the example is 81, which is one of them. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in counting.\n\nWait, let me recast this: for each m, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of m that are less than or equal to m, but perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m, because for each divisor a of m, there is a solution s \u2261 1 mod a and s \u2261 0 mod (m/a), but this might not always hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors a and b, such that a divides s and b divides s-1. So for each such pair (a,b), we can find a solution s.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me try to compute for small m and see.\n\nLet's start with m=1 (b=2):\n\nm=1: Then, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(2)),1], but sqrt(2)\u22481.414, so ceil is 2, but s must be \u22641. So no solutions.\n\nm=2 (b=3):\n\ns must be in [ceil(sqrt(3))=2,2].\n\nCheck s=2:\n\ns^2 - s =4-2=2. m=2, so d1=2/2=1. d1=1 is valid. d0=2-1=1.\n\nn=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, correct.

Correct.\n\nSo, for m=6, we have three solutions: s=3,4,6.\n\nWait, that's three solutions.

Correct.\n\nSo only one solution here: s=16.\n\nWait, but earlier for m=12, we had three solutions. So perhaps the number of solutions depends on the number of divisors of m.\n\nWait, m=12 has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. So six divisors. But we found three solutions. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each pair of divisors a and b where a*b = m and a and b are coprime, we can have a solution. So the number of solutions is equal to the number of such pairs.\n\nWait, for m=12, the coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=12 are:\n\n(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1).\n\nEach of these pairs would give a solution s.\n\nSo for (1,12):\n\ns \u2261 0 mod 1 and s \u2261 1 mod 12. So s \u22611 mod 12. But s \u226412, so s=1, which is below the minimum s=4. So invalid.\n\nFor (3,4):\n\ns \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nLooking for s in [4,12].\n\ns=9: 9 mod3=0, 9 mod4=1. Yes.\n\nSo s=9 is a solution.\n\nFor (4,3):\n\ns\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLooking for s in [4,12].\n\ns=4: 4 mod4=0, 4 mod3=1. So s=4 is a solution.\n\ns=4 + lcm(3,4)=12. Next would be s=16, which is beyond m=12.\n\nSo s=4 is another solution.\n\nFor (12,1):\n\ns\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. Since mod1 is always 0, but s\u22611 mod1 is always 0, so s must be 0 mod12 and 0 mod1, which is s=12.\n\nSo s=12 is a solution.\n\nSo for m=12, we have three solutions: s=4,9,12.\n\nSimilarly, for m=6:\n\nDivisors: 1,2,3,6.\n\nCoprime pairs (a,b):\n\n(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1).\n\nFor (1,6): s\u22610 mod1, s\u22611 mod6. s=1, which is below s_min=3.\n\nFor (2,3): s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLooking for s in [3,6].\n\ns=4: 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1. So s=4 is a solution.\n\ns=4 + lcm(2,3)=6. So s=10, which is beyond m=6.\n\nFor (3,2): s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod2.\n\nLooking for s in [3,6].\n\ns=3: 3 mod3=0, 3 mod2=1. So s=3 is a solution.\n\ns=3 + lcm(3,2)=6. s=6: 6 mod3=0, 6 mod2=0. Not 1 mod2. So no.\n\nWait, s=6: 6 mod2=0\u22601. So only s=3 and s=4 are solutions.\n\nWait, but earlier for m=6, we had s=3,4,6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, for m=6, when (a,b)=(6,1):\n\ns\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod1. Since mod1 is always 0, but s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22610 mod1, so s=6 is a solution.\n\nSo s=6 is another solution.\n\nSo for m=6, the solutions are s=3,4,6.\n\nSo the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=m, and s in the required range.\n\nSo, for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime pairs where the resulting s is within the required range.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime numbers a and b, and then solving the congruence s \u22610 mod a and s\u22611 mod b, and checking if s is within the required range.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) such that a*b=m and s is in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nBut this might be complicated to compute for each m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of m plus one, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of solutions for m from 1 upwards until we find the smallest m where the count exceeds 10.\n\nSo let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\nm | b | Number of solutions\n---|----|---\n1 |2|0\n2 |3|1\n3 |4|1\n4 |5|1\n5 |6|1\n6 |7|3\n7 |8|1\n8 |9|1\n9 |10|1\n10 |11|3\n11 |12|?\nWait, let's compute m=11 (b=12):\n\ns in [4,11].\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=4:16-4=12. 12/11\u22481.09, no.\n\ns=5:25-5=20. 20/11\u22481.818, no.\n\ns=6:36-6=30. 30/11\u22482.727, no.\n\ns=7:49-7=42. 42/11\u22483.818, no.\n\ns=8:64-8=56. 56/11\u22485.09, no.\n\ns=9:81-9=72. 72/11\u22486.545, no.\n\ns=10:100-10=90. 90/11\u22488.181, no.\n\ns=11:121-11=110. 110/11=10. d1=10, d0=11-10=1.\n\nn=10*12 +1=121=11^2.

Correct.\n\nSo for m=20, three solutions: s=5,16,20.\n\nHmm, so m=20 has three solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions depends on the number of divisors of m. For m=6,12,10,14,15,18,20, which are all composite numbers with multiple factors, we have three solutions each. While primes and some composites have one solution.\n\nBut we need to find the smallest m where the number of solutions exceeds ten. So far, the maximum number of solutions we've found is three. So we need to find m where the number of solutions is more than ten.\n\nWait, perhaps when m has many small factors, the number of solutions increases.\n\nWait, let's try m=24 (b=25).\n\nm=24.\n\ns in [5,24].\n\nWe need to find s such that 24 divides s(s-1).\n\nSo s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, 24 must divide either s or s-1, but since 24 is composite, it's possible that s is a multiple of a factor of 24, and s-1 is a multiple of another factor.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find all s in [5,24] where s(s-1) is divisible by 24.\n\nLet's list s from 5 to 24 and check if 24 divides s(s-1).\n\ns=5:5*4=20. 20/24=0.833, no.\n\ns=6:6*5=30. 30/24=1.25, no.\n\ns=7:7*6=42. 42/24=1.75, no.\n\ns=8:8*7=56. 56/24\u22482.333, no.\n\ns=9:9*8=72. 72/24=3.

Correct.\n\nSo for m=24, three solutions: s=9,16,24.\n\nHmm, still only three solutions. Not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a base where m has many small factors, leading to more solutions.\n\nWait, let's try m=30 (b=31).\n\nm=30.\n\ns in [6,30].\n\nWe need s such that 30 divides s(s-1).\n\nSince 30=2*3*5, and s and s-1 are coprime, one of them must be divisible by 2, another by 3, and another by 5.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so 2 divides one of them. Then, one of them must be divisible by 3, and one by 5.\n\nSo s must satisfy s \u22610 or 1 mod 3, and s\u22610 or 1 mod5.\n\nBut let's find s in [6,30] such that 30 divides s(s-1).\n\nAlternatively, since 30 divides s(s-1), s must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod 30, but s \u226430.\n\nSo s=1: too small.\n\ns=0: invalid.\n\nWait, but s must be at least 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps s must be such that s \u22610 mod a and s\u22611 mod b, where a and b are factors of 30.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m that are less than or equal to m.\n\nBut for m=30, the number of divisors is 8: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nBut how does that translate to the number of solutions?\n\nWait, perhaps for each divisor d of m, we can have a solution s where s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (m/d). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors a and b, and then solving s \u22610 mod a and s\u22611 mod b.\n\nFor m=30, the coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=30 are:\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1).\n\nFor each pair, we can solve for s.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. (1,30): s \u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod30. So s=30k +1. In [6,30], s=1,31,... Only s=1 is below 6, so no solution.\n\n2. (2,15): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=16: 16 mod2=0, 16 mod15=1. So s=16 is a solution.\n\nNext would be s=16 + lcm(2,15)=30. s=46, which is beyond m=30.\n\nSo s=16 is a solution.\n\n3. (3,10): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=21: 21 mod3=0, 21 mod10=1. So s=21 is a solution.\n\nNext would be s=21 + lcm(3,10)=30. s=51, beyond m=30.\n\nSo s=21 is a solution.\n\n4. (5,6): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=16: 16 mod5=1\u22600. No.\n\ns=26: 26 mod5=1\u22600. No.\n\nWait, perhaps s=16 is not a solution for this pair. Let's think.\n\nWe need s \u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\nSo s=5k, and 5k \u22611 mod6.\n\n5k \u22611 mod6 => 5k \u22611 mod6 => Multiply both sides by 5^{-1} mod6. Since 5*5=25\u22611 mod6, inverse is 5.\n\nSo k \u22615*1=5 mod6.\n\nSo k=6m +5.\n\nThus, s=5*(6m +5)=30m +25.\n\nIn [6,30], s=25.\n\nCheck s=25: 25 mod5=0, 25 mod6=1. Yes.\n\nSo s=25 is a solution.\n\nNext would be s=55, which is beyond m=30.\n\n5. (6,5): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=6: 6 mod6=0, 6 mod5=1. So s=6 is a solution.\n\ns=6 + lcm(6,5)=30. s=36, beyond m=30.\n\nSo s=6 is a solution.\n\n6. (10,3): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=10: 10 mod3=1. Yes. s=10 is a solution.\n\ns=10 + lcm(10,3)=30. s=40, beyond m=30.\n\nSo s=10 is a solution.\n\n7. (15,2): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\nLooking for s in [6,30].\n\ns=15: 15 mod2=1. Yes. s=15 is a solution.\n\ns=15 + lcm(15,2)=30. s=45, beyond m=30.\n\nSo s=15 is a solution.\n\n8. (30,1): s\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod1. Since mod1 is always 0, s=30 is a solution.\n\nSo for m=30, the solutions are s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.\n\nWait, that's seven solutions.\n\nWait, let's verify each:\n\ns=6:\n\nd1=(36-6)/30=30/30=1. d0=6-1=5.\n\nn=1*31 +5=36=6^2.

Correct.\n\nSo for m=30, we have seven solutions: s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.\n\nThat's seven, which is more than ten? No, seven is less than ten.\n\nWe need more than ten, so let's try m=60 (b=61).\n\nWait, but m=60 is quite large. Let's see if there's a smaller m where the number of solutions exceeds ten.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=24 has more solutions.\n\nWait, earlier for m=24, I found three solutions, but perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let me recheck m=24.\n\nm=24, b=25.\n\ns in [5,24].\n\nWe need s such that 24 divides s(s-1).\n\nSo s must be such that s \u22610 or 1 mod factors of 24.\n\nLet me list all possible s where s(s-1) is divisible by 24.\n\ns=5:5*4=20. Not divisible by 24.\n\ns=6:6*5=30. Not divisible by 24.\n\ns=7:7*6=42. Not divisible by 24.\n\ns=8:8*7=56. Not divisible by 24.\n\ns=9:9*8=72. 72/24=3. Yes.\n\ns=10:10*9=90. 90/24=3.75.

No.\n\ns=24:24*23=552. 552/24=23. Yes.\n\nSo only three solutions: s=9,16,24.\n\nHmm, perhaps m=60 (b=61) will have more solutions.\n\nm=60.\n\ns in [8,60].\n\nWe need s such that 60 divides s(s-1).\n\nSince 60=2^2 *3 *5, and s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by 4, another by 3, and another by 5.\n\nSo possible s where s \u22610 or 1 mod 4, 3, 5.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m, which for m=60 is 12.\n\nBut wait, earlier for m=30, which has 8 divisors, we had seven solutions. So perhaps for m=60, we'll have more.\n\nBut let's try to find the number of solutions for m=60.\n\nThe coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=60 are:\n\n(1,60), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10), (10,6), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (60,1).\n\nFor each pair, solve s \u22610 mod a and s\u22611 mod b.\n\n1.

Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful integer is first.\n\nThe problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:\n1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.\n2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.\n\nHmm. So, let's break that down. If a number has exactly two digits in base b, that means it's of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. But wait, digits in base b can't be equal to or larger than b, right? So a and c must satisfy 0 \u2264 a, c < b. But since n is a positive integer with two digits, a can't be zero. So a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.\n\nSo n = a * b + c. The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, right? So n must be a perfect square. Let me write that down:\n\nn = a * b + c\nsqrt(n) = a + c\n\nSo, n = (a + c)^2.\n\nPutting that together, we get:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to see if I can find a relation between a, c, and b.\n\nExpanding the left side:\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express b in terms of a and c.\n\nLet me try to collect terms involving b:\n\na^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a * b\n\nSo, b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a\n= (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a\n= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nHmm, since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer. Because a, c are integers, and a is at least 1, so this fraction must result in an integer.\n\nLet me denote k = (c^2 - c)/a, where k must be an integer.\n\nSo, b = a + 2c + k\n\nBut k = (c^2 - c)/a, so substituting back:\n\nb = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of c. Let's see if I can express c in terms of a.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's express n as (a + c)^2 = a * b + c.\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(a + c)^2 - c = a * b\n\nWhich is:\n\na * b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nSo,\n\nb = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a\n\nSimplify that:\n\nb = [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a\n= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nSo, same as before. So, for b to be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). Because c(c - 1) = c^2 - c.\n\nSo, a divides c(c - 1). Also, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, but since b depends on a and c, maybe I need to find for each possible a and c, the corresponding b.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit tangled. Maybe I can approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about possible values of a and c. Since a is a digit in base b, a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1. But since n is two digits in base b, c can be zero as well.\n\nBut n is a perfect square, so sqrt(n) must be an integer, say s. So s = a + c, and n = s^2 = a * b + c.\n\nSo, s = a + c\nn = s^2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, substituting s into n:\n\ns^2 = a * b + c\nBut c = s - a, so substituting:\n\ns^2 = a * b + (s - a)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns^2 = a * b + s - a\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\na * b = s^2 - s + a\n\nFactor a:\n\na * (b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nSo,\n\nb - 1 = (s^2 - s)/a\n\nSo,\n\nb = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nHmm, this seems a more manageable equation. So, given s and a, b can be computed as (s^2 - s)/a + 1.\n\nBut since b must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by a. So a must be a divisor of s(s - 1).\n\nAlso, a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b - 1. But since b is in terms of a and s, this might complicate things.\n\nWait, but for each s, a can be any divisor of s(s - 1), and then b is determined as (s^2 - s)/a + 1.\n\nBut also, since in base b, the digits a and c must satisfy a < b and c < b. Since c = s - a, we must have c < b.\n\nSo,\n\ns - a < b\n\nBut b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1, so substituting:\n\ns - a < (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nMultiply both sides by a (since a is positive, inequality remains same):\n\na(s - a) < s^2 - s + a\n\nExpand left side:\n\na s - a^2 < s^2 - s + a\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na s - a^2 - s^2 + s - a < 0\n\nRearrange:\n\n(-a^2) + (a s - s^2) + (s - a) < 0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\n- a^2 + a s - s^2 + s - a = -(a^2 + (s^2) ) + a s + s - a\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe factor differently.\n\nAlternatively, collect like terms:\n\n(-a^2) + (a s - a) + (-s^2 + s) < 0\n\nFactor a from first two terms, and s from last two:\n\n- a(a - s + 1) - s(s - 1) < 0\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe instead, I can consider that for each s, a must be a divisor of s(s - 1), and then find the constraints on a and c.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each possible s, compute s(s - 1).\n2. Find all possible divisors a of s(s - 1).\n3. For each a, compute b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1.\n4. Check if c = s - a is less than b (since c must be a digit in base b).\n5. Also, a must be less than b, which is automatically satisfied since a is a digit in base b.\n\nWait, but a is a digit in base b, so a < b. So, a must be less than b. But since b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1, we can write:\n\na < (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na^2 < s^2 - s + a\n\nWhich is:\n\na^2 - a - s^2 + s < 0\n\nHmm, perhaps not the most straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible s and find the number of valid a's for each s, then sum them up until I find a b where the total number exceeds 10.\n\nWait, the question is to find the minimal base b where the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten. So, for each base b, count the number of n's that are b-eautiful, and find the smallest b where this count is >10.\n\nBut how to approach this? Maybe instead, for each b, find all possible s and a such that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can find for each s, the possible a's and then find the corresponding b's, and for each b, count how many s's contribute to it.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to fix s and find possible a's and b's, then for each b, accumulate the count. Then, look for the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, since s is the square root of n, and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b (10_b) and b^2 -1 (which is the maximum two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1).\n\nSo, n is between b and b^2 -1. Therefore, s = sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, s must be between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nWait, let's compute the range for s.\n\ns must satisfy:\n\ns^2 >= b (since n >= b)\ns <= sqrt(b^2 -1) < b.\n\nSo s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nBut for each b, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\nBut for each s, the possible a's are the divisors of s(s - 1) such that a <= s (since c = s - a must be non-negative, as c is a digit, so s - a >=0 => a <=s).\n\nAlso, since c = s - a must be less than b, because c is a digit in base b. So, s - a < b.\n\nBut b = (s^2 - s)/a +1, so:\n\ns - a < (s^2 - s)/a +1\n\nWhich I can rearrange as:\n\nMultiply both sides by a (positive, so inequality remains same):\n\na(s - a) < s^2 - s + a\n\nWhich is:\n\na s - a^2 < s^2 - s + a\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na s - a^2 - s^2 + s - a < 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(-a^2) + (a s - s^2) + (s - a) < 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms:\n\nLet me factor s from the second and third terms:\n\n- a^2 + s(a - s) + (s - a) <0\n\nWait, s(a - s) is s(a - s) = a s - s^2. Then, s - a is -(a - s). So:\n\n- a^2 + (a s - s^2) - (a - s) <0\n\nSo:\n\n- a^2 + a s - s^2 - a + s <0\n\nHmm, maybe rearrange:\n\n(-a^2 + a s - a) + (-s^2 + s) <0\n\nFactor a from first group and s from the second:\n\na(-a + s -1) + s(-s +1) <0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe plug in some small s and a to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of getting bogged down in algebra, I can think of this numerically.\n\nLet me think about how many b-eautiful numbers exist for a given base b.\n\nEach b-eautiful number corresponds to a pair (a, c) such that:\n\n1. n = a*b + c is a perfect square.\n2. a + c = sqrt(n)\n3. a < b, c < b.\n\nSo, for each base b, I can find all pairs (a, c) where a and c are digits in base b, a + c = sqrt(a*b + c), and sqrt(a*b + c) is integer.\n\nAlternatively, for each base b, iterate over possible s (which is sqrt(n)), and for each s, check if there exists a and c such that a + c = s, and a*b + c = s^2.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nc = s - a\n\nSo, a*b + (s - a) = s^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na*b = s^2 - s + a\n\nSo, a*(b - 1) = s^2 - s\n\nTherefore, a must divide s^2 - s.\n\nSo, for each s, find the divisors a of s(s - 1), and then compute b as (s^2 - s)/a +1.\n\nBut b must be an integer, and a must be less than b.\n\nWait, but b is computed from a and s, so perhaps for each s, a can be any divisor of s(s -1), and then b is determined.\n\nBut since we need a < b, let's see:\n\nb = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nSo, a < (s^2 - s)/a +1\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na^2 < s^2 - s + a\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\na^2 - a - s^2 + s < 0\n\nWhich is a quadratic in a:\n\na^2 - a + (s - s^2) <0\n\nHmm, solving for a, but perhaps not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can iterate over s and a, compute b, and then count how many b's have more than ten such numbers.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten. So, for each b, count the number of n's that satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count is >10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, find all possible a's and compute the corresponding b's, and for each b, keep a tally of how many s's contribute to it. Once a b's tally exceeds 10, we can stop and return that b.\n\nThis seems more efficient.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each s starting from 2 upwards (since s must be at least 2, because n is two-digit, so n >= b >=2, so s >=2), compute s(s-1).\n\n2. For each s, find all divisors a of s(s-1) such that a <= s (since c = s - a must be non-negative, so a <=s).\n\n3. For each such a, compute b = (s^2 - s)/a +1.\n\n4. For this b, check if c = s - a is less than b (since c must be a digit in base b). If yes, then this b has a valid n, so increment the count for b.\n\n5. Continue until for some b, the count exceeds 10, then return that b.\n\nWait, but how do I know when to stop? Because s can be large, but perhaps the count for a given b will eventually stop increasing as s increases beyond a certain point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute for s up to a certain limit, say s up to 100, and see how the counts for each b develop.\n\nBut let's think about how many s's can contribute to a particular b. Each s can contribute multiple a's, but each a gives a unique b.\n\nWait, perhaps each s can contribute one or more b's, depending on the number of a's.\n\nSo, the idea is to iterate over s, find all possible a's, compute b for each a, and then count how many times each b appears. The first b that has a count exceeding 10 is our answer.\n\nThis seems doable, but I need to make sure I don't miss any s's or a's.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps more clearly:\n\n- Initialize a dictionary to keep track of counts for each b. Let's call it count_b, initialized as empty.\n\n- For s starting from 2 upwards:\n\n   - Compute s_squared_minus_s = s*(s -1)\n\n   - Find all divisors a of s_squared_minus_s such that a <= s (since c = s - a must be >=0)\n\n   - For each such a:\n\n      - Compute b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\n      - Compute c = s - a\n\n      - Check if c < b (since c must be a valid digit in base b)\n\n      - If yes, then increment count_b[b] by 1\n\n   - After processing each s, check if any b in count_b has count >10. If yes, return the smallest such b.\n\nBut how high do I need to go with s? Theoretically, s can be as large as needed, but in practice, the counts for each b might not increase beyond a certain s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can precompute s up to a certain limit, say s=100, and see what happens.\n\nBut to make this efficient, maybe I can process s in order, and for each s, compute all possible a's, compute b, and then for each b, track the count. Once a b's count exceeds 10, we can stop.\n\nLet me try to code this in my mind.\n\nInitialize count_b as a dictionary: default 0.\n\ns starts at 2.\n\nFor s=2:\n\ns_squared_minus_s =

Maybe I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the least b where the number of b-eautiful integers exceeds 10. From the counts we've computed so far, the highest count is for b=43 with 6 counts, and b=31 with 9 counts. So, perhaps we need to go higher with s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\nn = (a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nSo, (a + c)^2 = a * b + c\n\nLet me denote s = a + c, so n = s^2.\n\nThus, s^2 = a * b + c\n\nBut c = s - a, so:\n\ns^2 = a*b + s - a\n\nRearranged:\n\ns^2 - s = a * (b - 1)\n\nSo, a must be a divisor of s^2 - s.\n\nAlso, b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1\n\nWe can see that for each s, the number of possible a's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are less than or equal to s.\n\nEach such a will contribute to a different b.\n\nSo, the number of b's contributed by each s is equal to the number of such a's.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal b with more than 10 counts, we need to find a b that is generated by multiple s's and a's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count for b increases as s increases, but I need to find when it crosses 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 32, but in our earlier counts, b=31 had 9 counts, and b=32 had 2 counts.\n\nWait, maybe I need to go higher.\n\nWait, let's consider that for each s, the number of a's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s.\n\nIf s is large, s(s-1) will have many divisors, so the number of a's per s increases.\n\nThus, for larger s, the same b can be generated by multiple s and a combinations.\n\nSo, perhaps for a base like 32, it's generated by multiple s's.\n\nWait, but how can I find the minimal b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 32, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but looking back, when s=36, a=30 gave b=43, which was the 6th count for b=43.\n\nBut I need to find when any b has more than 10 counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the number of a's for each s.\n\nThe number of a's for each s is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s.\n\nSo, for s(s-1), the number of divisors <=s is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s.\n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime, the number of divisors is equal to the product of the number of divisors of s and s-1.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of divisors of s(s-1) is equal to d(s)*d(s-1), where d(n) is the number of divisors of n.\n\nBut the number of a's is the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s.\n\nEach divisor a of s(s-1) can be paired with s(s-1)/a, which is >=s(s-1)/s = s-1.\n\nSo, the number of a's <=s is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s, which is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are >= s-1.\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, the number of such a's is equal to the number of divisors of s plus the number of divisors of s-1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of a's for each s is equal to the number of divisors of s plus the number of divisors of s-1, but that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, s and s-1 are coprime, so any divisor of s(s-1) is a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1.\n\nSo, the number of divisors of s(s-1) is d(s)*d(s-1).\n\nEach divisor can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1.\n\nNow, we need to count how many such d1*d2 are <=s.\n\nHmm, this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of a's for each s is equal to the number of divisors of s plus the number of divisors of s-1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for example, when s=6:\n\ns=6, s-1=5.\n\nDivisors of 6:1,2,3,6\n\nDivisors of 5:1,5\n\nSo, s(s-1)=30.\n\nDivisors of 30:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nNumber of a's <=6:1,2,3,5,6 \u2192 5 a's.\n\nWhich matches the earlier count for s=6: a=1,2,3,5,6.\n\nSo, for s=6, number of a's is 5.\n\nSimilarly, for s=5:\n\ns=5, s-1=4.\n\nDivisors of 5:1,5\n\nDivisors of 4:1,2,4\n\ns(s-1)=20.\n\nDivisors of 20:1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\na's <=5:1,2,4,5 \u2192 4 a's.\n\nWhich matches the earlier count for s=5: a=1,2,4,5.\n\nSo, the number of a's for each s is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are <=s.\n\nWhich, as s increases, tends to increase, especially when s is composite.\n\nSo, the number of a's per s can be multiple, and thus, each a contributes to a different b.\n\nTherefore, the count for each b is the number of times it is generated by different s and a.\n\nTo find the minimal b with count>10, perhaps I can find a b that is generated by multiple s's.\n\nLooking back, for s=36, a=30 gave b=43, which already had count 6.\n\nSimilarly, s=40, a=30 gave b=53, which had count 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 32, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, looking at the earlier counts, the maximum count for any b was 9 for b=31.\n\nWait, when s=36, a=30 gave b=43, which had count 6.\n\nWhen s=39, a=38 gave b=40, which had count 4.\n\nWhen s=40, a=30 gave b=53, which had count 2.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to
