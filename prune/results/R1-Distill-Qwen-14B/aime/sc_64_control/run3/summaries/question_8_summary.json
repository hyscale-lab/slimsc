      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the given equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nI notice that the second equation looks symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it or find a way to express it in terms of symmetric sums. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the second equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Hmm, I can factor this expression. Let's try:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo, the second equation becomes:\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b) = 6,000,000\n\nBut from the first equation, we know that a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So we can substitute these into the second equation.\n\nSubstituting, the equation becomes:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nLet me write that out:\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, maybe I can expand each term:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) = 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3\nSimilarly for the other terms.\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000\n\nLet me factor out the 300:\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, let's see if I can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of other symmetric sums.\n\nI remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 300, we have:\n\n300\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\nWhich means:\n90,000 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\nLet me denote S = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and P = ab + bc + ac.\n\nSo, S + 2P = 90,000. Therefore, S = 90,000 - 2P.\n\nNow, going back to the second equation, which is:\n\n300S - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nSo, I need to find a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S and P or something else.\n\nI recall that a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be expressed as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = 300\u00b3 = 27,000,000\n3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = 3 * 300 * P = 900P\n3abc is just 3abc.\n\nSo, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.\n\nPutting this into the equation:\n\n300S - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n300S - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n300S + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000\n300S + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000\n\nNow, let's factor out 3 from each term on the left:\n\n3(100S + 300P - abc) = 33,000,000\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100S + 300P - abc = 11,000,000\n\nBut earlier, we found that S = 90,000 - 2P. So substitute S:\n\n100*(90,000 - 2P) + 300P - abc = 11,000,000\n\nCompute 100*(90,000 - 2P):\n\n= 9,000,000 - 200P\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n9,000,000 - 200P + 300P - abc = 11,000,000\n\nSimplify the terms with P:\n\n(-200P + 300P) = 100P\n\nSo:\n\n9,000,000 + 100P - abc = 11,000,000\n\nSubtract 9,000,000 from both sides:\n\n100P - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSo:\n\nabc = 100P - 2,000,000\n\nHmm, so now we have expressions involving P and abc. Let me see if I can find another equation involving P.\n\nWait, earlier, we had S = 90,000 - 2P, and we also have expressions involving P and abc. Maybe I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express abc in terms of P. Wait, from this last equation: abc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, abc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can find another equation involving abc and P, I might be able to solve for P and abc.\n\nWait, I don't see another direct equation, so perhaps I can think of it differently.\n\nLet me think about the variables a, b, c. Since they are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, perhaps some of them are equal, or maybe two are equal and the third is different. Maybe I can consider cases where two variables are equal, or all three are equal.\n\nWait, but if all three are equal, then a = b = c = 100. Let me check what the second equation gives in that case.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b = c =100, each term is 100\u00b2 *100 = 1,000,000.\n\nThere are six terms, so total is 6,000,000, which matches the second equation. So (100,100,100) is a solution.\n\nBut are there other solutions? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, but let me think about the symmetry. The equation is symmetric in a, b, c, so any permutation of a solution is also a solution.\n\nSo, maybe the only solutions are the permutations of (100,100,100). But wait, that's only one triple, but considering permutations, it's still just one unique triple since all are equal.\n\nBut perhaps there are other triples where two variables are 100, and the third is 100 as well, which is the same as above.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider other cases where two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nSuppose, for example, that a = b \u2260 c. Then, let's let a = b = k, so c = 300 - 2k.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b = k, this becomes:\n\nk\u00b2k + k\u00b2c + k\u00b2k + k\u00b2c + c\u00b2k + c\u00b2k.\n\nSimplify:\n\nk\u00b3 + k\u00b2c + k\u00b3 + k\u00b2c + c\u00b2k + c\u00b2k\n\n= 2k\u00b3 + 2k\u00b2c + 2c\u00b2k\n\nFactor out 2k:\n\n2k(k\u00b2 + k c + c\u00b2)\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2k, let's substitute that:\n\n= 2k [k\u00b2 + k(300 - 2k) + (300 - 2k)^2]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nk\u00b2 + 300k - 2k\u00b2 + (90,000 - 1200k + 4k\u00b2)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk\u00b2 - 2k\u00b2 + 4k\u00b2 = 3k\u00b2\n300k -1200k = -900k\n+90,000\n\nSo inside the brackets: 3k\u00b2 -900k +90,000\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n2k (3k\u00b2 -900k +90,000) = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nk (3k\u00b2 -900k +90,000) = 3,000,000\n\nSo:\n\n3k\u00b3 -900k\u00b2 +90,000k -3,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nk\u00b3 -300k\u00b2 +30,000k -1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, so I have the equation:\n\nk\u00b3 - 300k\u00b2 +30,000k -1,000,000 = 0\n\nLet me try to find integer roots for this equation. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 over factors of 1, so integer divisors of 1,000,000.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it.\n\nLet me see if k=100 is a root:\n\n100\u00b3 -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 -300*10,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes, k=100 is a root. So (k -100) is a factor.\n\nLet's perform polynomial division or factorization.\n\nDivide the polynomial by (k -100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100=100\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -300 +100= -200\n\nMultiply by 100: -200*100= -20,000\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000)=10,000\n\nMultiply by 100: 10,000*100=1,000,000\n\nAdd to last term: -1,000,000 +1,000,000=0\n\nSo the polynomial factors as (k -100)(k\u00b2 -200k +10,000)\n\nNow, set equal to zero:\n\n(k -100)(k\u00b2 -200k +10,000)=0\n\nSo, either k=100, or k\u00b2 -200k +10,000=0\n\nLet me solve k\u00b2 -200k +10,000=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nk = [200 \u00b1 sqrt(200\u00b2 -4*1*10,000)] / 2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 sqrt(40,000 -40,000)] /2\n\n= [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100\n\nSo the only real roots are k=100 (double root). So the only solution is k=100.\n\nTherefore, when a = b, c must be 300 -2k = 300 -200=100.\n\nSo a = b = c =100.\n\nHmm, so in the case where two variables are equal, the only solution is when all three are equal. So that suggests that maybe the only solution is (100,100,100) and its permutations, but since all are equal, it's just one unique solution.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other solutions where all three variables are different. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation and see if it's minimized or maximized when variables are equal.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's assume that a, b, c are all equal. Then a = b = c =100, and that works as we saw earlier. So that's one solution.\n\nBut are there other solutions where a, b, c are not all equal?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that two variables are 100, and the third is 100 as well, but that's the same as all being equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the problem in terms of symmetric polynomials.\n\nLet me denote the variables as x, y, z for simplicity.\n\nWe have x + y + z = 300\n\nAnd x\u00b2y + x\u00b2z + y\u00b2x + y\u00b2z + z\u00b2x + z\u00b2y = 6,000,000.\n\nI can factor this expression as:\n\nxy(x + y) + yz(y + z) + zx(z + x)\n\nBut since x + y + z = 300, x + y = 300 - z, etc.\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\n\nxy(300 - z) + yz(300 - x) + zx(300 - y) = 6,000,000\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as:\n\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x\u00b2y + x\u00b2z + y\u00b2x + y\u00b2z + z\u00b2x + z\u00b2y + 3xyz\n\nSo, (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = sum of terms + 3xyz.\n\nTherefore, sum of terms = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\n\nSo, in our case:\n\nsum = (300)(P) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nWait, but earlier, we had:\n\n300S - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nBut from the symmetric sum, we have:\n\nsum = (x + y + z)(P) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nSo, 300P - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n100P - abc = 2,000,000\n\nWhich is consistent with what we had earlier.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nabc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nWe have:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. S = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2P\n3. 100P - abc = 2,000,000 => abc = 100P - 2,000,000\n\nSo, perhaps we can find another equation involving P and abc.\n\nWait, earlier, we also have a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.\n\nBut from the second equation, a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... =6,000,000, which we related to 300S - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) =6,000,000.\n\nWait, maybe that's the same as what we have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of P.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe have:\n\nabc = 100P - 2,000,000\n\nWe also have the equation from symmetric sums:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 -900P + 3abc.\n\nBut from the second equation:\n\n300S - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich we can write as:\n\n300S = 6,000,000 + a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3\n\nSubstituting S =90,000 - 2P:\n\n300*(90,000 -2P) =6,000,000 + a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3\n\nCompute left side:\n\n300*90,000 =27,000,000; 300*(-2P) = -600P\n\nSo,\n\n27,000,000 -600P =6,000,000 + a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3\n\nSubtract 6,000,000:\n\n21,000,000 -600P = a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3\n\nBut earlier, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 =27,000,000 -900P +3abc.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n21,000,000 -600P =27,000,000 -900P +3abc\n\nSubtract 27,000,000 from both sides:\n\n-6,000,000 -600P = -900P +3abc\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-6,000,000 -600P +900P -3abc=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-6,000,000 +300P -3abc=0\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n-2,000,000 +100P -abc=0\n\nWhich is:\n\nabc=100P -2,000,000\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, no new information.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think about possible values for a, b, c.\n\nSince a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, each can range from 0 to 300.\n\nBut the second equation is 6,000,000, which is a large number. So, likely, a, b, c must be relatively large numbers.\n\nWait, when a, b, c are all 100, the second equation is satisfied. What if one of them is larger than 100, and another is smaller?\n\nWait, let me test with a=101, b=100, c=99.\n\nCompute a + b + c =101+100+99=300.

      "full_content": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric expressions or factorizations. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow.\n\nLet me write down the second equation again: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see.\n\nI can factor out a from the first two terms: a\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b). Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), right? Because if a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b and a + b = 300 - c.\n\nSo, substituting those into the expression, I get:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c).\n\nSo the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me compute each term individually. Let's expand one of them: a\u00b2(300 - a) = 300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3. So the entire equation becomes:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo now I have:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe I can express this in terms of the sums of a, b, c, which I know is 300. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. I know that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be expressed in terms of S and the sum of products, ab + bc + ca.\n\nWait, yes, the identity is:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)\u00b2 - 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nSo, let's let P = ab + bc + ca. Then a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P = 300\u00b2 - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.\n\nSo substituting back into our equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 27,000,000 - 600P.\n\nAnd then subtract (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) from that:\n\n27,000,000 - 600P - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, rearranging:\n\n27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 600P + (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n21,000,000 = 600P + (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3).\n\nSo, 600P + (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 21,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I also know another identity involving a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3. The formula is:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nSo, substituting S = 300 and P = ab + bc + ca, we have:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*P + 3abc.\n\nLet me compute 300\u00b3: 300*300 = 90,000, 90,000*300 = 27,000,000. So,\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc.\n\nSo now, substituting this back into our earlier equation:\n\n600P + (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 21,000,000.\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n600P + 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc = 21,000,000.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(600P - 900P) + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000.\n\nSo,\n\n-300P + 27,000,000 + 3abc = 21,000,000.\n\nNow, subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:\n\n-300P + 3abc = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-300P + 3abc = -6,000,000.\n\nLet me factor out 3 from the left side:\n\n3(-100P + abc) = -6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n-100P + abc = -2,000,000.\n\nRearranging:\n\nabc - 100P = -2,000,000.\n\nHmm, okay. So I have:\n\nabc - 100P = -2,000,000.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nabc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, so now I have expressions involving P and abc. I need to find integer solutions for a, b, c given these constraints.\n\nLet me recap what I have so far:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300.\n\n2. P = ab + bc + ca.\n\n3. abc = 100P - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can express everything in terms of P, maybe I can find P and then solve for a, b, c.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure how to proceed directly. Maybe I can express abc in terms of P, but I also know that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So perhaps there's a way to bound the possible values of P or abc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a cubic equation. Since a, b, c are roots of the polynomial x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - abc = 0, which in this case would be x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Px - abc = 0.\n\nBut since abc = 100P - 2,000,000, I can substitute that into the equation:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nFactor terms with P:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 2,000,000 + P(x - 100) = 0.\n\nHmm, interesting. So,\n\nP(x - 100) = -x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 2,000,000.\n\nTherefore,\n\nP = (-x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 2,000,000)/(x - 100).\n\nWait, but x is a variable here, and P is a constant for given a, b, c. Maybe I can perform polynomial division on the numerator.\n\nLet me divide -x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 2,000,000 by (x - 100). Let's see.\n\nDivide -x\u00b3 by x to get -x\u00b2. Multiply (x - 100) by -x\u00b2: -x\u00b3 + 100x\u00b2.\n\nSubtract this from the numerator:\n\n(-x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 2,000,000) - (-x\u00b3 + 100x\u00b2) = (0x\u00b3) + (200x\u00b2) - 2,000,000.\n\nNow, bring down the next term (which is 0x). Now, divide 200x\u00b2 by x to get 200x. Multiply (x - 100) by 200x: 200x\u00b2 - 20,000x.\n\nSubtracting this from the current numerator:\n\n(200x\u00b2 - 2,000,000) - (200x\u00b2 - 20,000x) = 0x\u00b2 + 20,000x - 2,000,000.\n\nNow, divide 20,000x by x to get 20,000. Multiply (x - 100) by 20,000: 20,000x - 2,000,000.\n\nSubtracting this:\n\n(20,000x - 2,000,000) - (20,000x - 2,000,000) = 0x + 0.\n\nSo, the division works out perfectly. Therefore,\n\nP = (-x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 2,000,000)/(x - 100) = -x\u00b2 + 200x + 20,000.\n\nSo, P = -x\u00b2 + 200x + 20,000.\n\nBut wait, P is supposed to be a constant for given a, b, c, but x is a variable here. Hmm, perhaps I made a misstep.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the context of the cubic equation, x is a root, so when I write P in terms of x, it's specific to each root. But I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as, for each variable a, b, c, the same expression holds. But I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of a, b, c. Since they are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, each can range from 0 to 300. But the second equation is 6,000,000, which is quite large, so perhaps a, b, c can't be too small.\n\nWait, let me compute the second equation when a, b, c are as equal as possible. If a = b = c = 100, then a + b + c = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\nEach term would be 100\u00b2 * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so total is 6,000,000. Oh! So (100,100,100) is a solution.\n\nSo that's one triple. But the problem is asking for the number of triples, so maybe there are more.\n\nWait, but maybe all triples where a, b, c are permutations of (100,100,100). But since all are equal, it's just one unique triple. So that's only one solution, but perhaps there are others.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me test another case. Suppose one variable is 0. Let's say c = 0. Then a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = 6,000,000.\n\nFactor this as ab(a + b) = 6,000,000. Since a + b = 300, this is ab*300 = 6,000,000. So ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.\n\nSo, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let me solve for a and b.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nThe discriminant is 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. So sqrt(10,000) = 100.\n\nSo the solutions are x = [300 \u00b1 100]/2, which gives x = (400)/2 = 200 and x = (200)/2 = 100.\n\nSo a and b are 200 and 100. So the triple is (200,100,0). Since c=0, and a and b can be arranged, the possible triples are (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and (200,0,100), etc. So in this case, how many triples do we have?\n\nSince c is 0, the non-zero elements are a=200, b=100, so the number of distinct permutations is 3 (since the zero can be in any of the three positions). So that's 3 more triples.\n\nWait, but wait. If a and b are 200 and 100, with c=0, the number of distinct triples is the number of ways to arrange a, b, c where two are non-zero and one is zero. So that's 3 permutations: (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). Wait, that's 6 permutations, not 3. Because in each position, the zero can be in any of the three positions, and for each zero position, a and b can be arranged in two ways. So 3 positions * 2 arrangements = 6 triples.\n\nWait, let me check: For c=0, a=200, b=100: the possible triples are (200,100,0), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). So yes, 6 triples. So that's 6 solutions.\n\nSo far, we have the triple (100,100,100) and 6 triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100. So that's 7 triples.\n\nBut are there more? Let me see.\n\nSuppose two variables are zero. Let's say b = c = 0, then a = 300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2*0 + a\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*a + 0\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*a + 0\u00b2*a = 0, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So no solution in this case.\n\nSo no triples where two variables are zero.\n\nWhat about when none of the variables are zero? Let's see.\n\nWe already have the triple (100,100,100). Are there other triples where a, b, c are all positive integers, none are zero, and a + b + c = 300, and the second equation is satisfied?\n\nLet me think. Suppose one of them is 100, another is 100, and the third is 100. That's the case we already considered. What about other cases?\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. Let's suppose that one variable is 100, and the other two are x and y, where x + y = 200.\n\nWait, but then the second equation would be 100\u00b2x + 100\u00b2y + x\u00b2*100 + x\u00b2*y + y\u00b2*100 + y\u00b2*x.\n\nWait, let me compute this.\n\nSo, a=100, b=x, c=y, with x + y = 200.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= 100\u00b2x + 100\u00b2y + x\u00b2*100 + x\u00b2 y + y\u00b2 *100 + y\u00b2 x.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 10,000x + 10,000y + 100x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 y + 100y\u00b2 + y\u00b2 x.\n\n= 10,000(x + y) + 100(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + xy(x + y).\n\nSince x + y = 200,\n\n= 10,000*200 + 100(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + xy*200.\n\n= 2,000,000 + 100(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + 200xy.\n\nBut x + y = 200, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 40,000 - 2xy.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n= 2,000,000 + 100*(40,000 - 2xy) + 200xy.\n\n= 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 - 200xy + 200xy.\n\n= 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 + 0.\n\n= 6,000,000.\n\nSo, wow! So any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 will satisfy the second equation. So that includes the case where the other two are both 100, but also cases where they are different as long as they sum to 200.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered one variable being zero, I got 6 triples. Now, this suggests that if a=100, and b + c = 200, regardless of what b and c are (as long as they are nonnegative integers), then the second equation is satisfied. So that would include the cases where b=200, c=0 and permutations, but also other cases where b and c are positive integers adding up to 200.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered a=200, b=100, c=0, that was part of this. So perhaps this approach is a better way to count all possible triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nWait, but in the earlier case, when I set c=0, I found that a and b had to be 200 and 100. But according to this, any a=100, and b + c=200 would work, regardless of b and c being zero or positive. So that suggests that besides the case where a=100, b=100, c=100, there are other cases where a=100, and b and c are positive integers adding to 200.\n\nWait, but earlier when I set c=0, I found that a=200, b=100 is a solution, but according to this, a=100, b=200, c=0 would also be a solution. So perhaps I was mistaken earlier when I thought that the only solutions with one zero are when a=200, b=100, c=0, etc. Because according to this, any a=100, and b + c=200 would work, including when one of b or c is zero.\n\nWait, but wait, when a=100, and b=200, c=0, then a + b + c = 300, and the second equation gives 6,000,000 as shown earlier.\n\nSo perhaps all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 are solutions, regardless of whether the other two are zero or positive.\n\nSo, that suggests that the number of such triples is more than just 6.\n\nWait, so let me think: how many triples (a, b, c) are there where one of them is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nLet me consider each case where one variable is 100. Since the variables are symmetric, I can compute the number for one variable and multiply by 3.\n\nCase 1: a=100. Then b + c = 200.\n\nThe number of nonnegative integer solutions for b + c = 200 is 201 (from b=0, c=200 up to b=200, c=0).\n\nSimilarly, for each of the other variables set to 100, we have 201 solutions. So total would be 3*201=603.\n\nBut wait, but when a=100, b=100, c=100 is one of those solutions. So in each case, when the variable is 100, the other two can include 100 as well, as in (100,100,100).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we're looking for all triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. So that includes cases where the other two are both 100, which is the triple (100,100,100).\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered a=100, b=100, c=100, that's the only case where all three are 100. But when I'm considering a=100 and b + c=200, that includes the case where b=100 and c=100 as well as other cases where b and c are different.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the triple (100,100,100) is counted once, but when I count 3*201, I'm including it three times, once for each variable being 100. So that would overcount.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of triples where exactly one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, plus the triple where all three are 100.\n\nWait, but no, because when all three are 100, each of the variables is 100, so it's included in each of the three cases. So if I compute 3*201, I'm including (100,100,100) three times, once in each case where a=100, b=100, and c=100.\n\nBut in reality, (100,100,100) is just one unique triple. So to avoid overcounting, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\nTotal number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nBut this is getting a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that each of the three variables can be 100, and for each, the number of solutions where that variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, and then subtract the overcounts where two variables are 100, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 will satisfy the second equation, as shown earlier. So the number of such triples is 3*(number of solutions for b + c = 200), but subtracting the cases where more than one variable is 100.\n\nWait, no, let's think again. For each variable set to 100, the other two variables can be any nonnegative integers summing to 200. So for each variable (a, b, c), there are 201 possibilities (since b and c can range from 0 to 200, inclusive, adding to 200).\n\nSo for each variable, 201 triples where that variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. So total is 3*201=603.\n\nBut wait, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times in this count, once for each variable being 100. So to get the correct count, we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\nTotal number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is:\n\nNumber of triples where a=100, b + c=200: 201\n\nPlus number where b=100, a + c=200: 201\n\nPlus number where c=100, a + b=200: 201\n\nMinus the cases where two variables are 100, because those are counted twice.\n\nHow many cases where two variables are 100? For example, a=100, b=100, c=100. That's one case.\n\nSimilarly, a=100, b=100, c=100 is the only case where two variables are 100, because if a=100, b=100, then c=300 - 100 -100=100. So only one such case.\n\nSo using inclusion-exclusion, total is 3*201 - 3*1 + 1, but wait, no.\n\nWait, no, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nIn this context,\n\nA: a=100, b + c=200: 201 triples.\n\nB: b=100, a + c=200: 201 triples.\n\nC: c=100, a + b=200: 201 triples.\n\nA\u2229B: a=100, b=100, so c=100: 1 triple.\n\nSimilarly, A\u2229C: a=100, c=100, so b=100: 1 triple.\n\nB\u2229C: b=100, c=100, so a=100: 1 triple.\n\nA\u2229B\u2229C: a=100, b=100, c=100: 1 triple.\n\nSo applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 + 1.\n\nCompute that:\n\n201*3 = 603.\n\nSubtract 3*1 = 3: 603 - 3 = 600.\n\nAdd back 1: 600 +1 = 601.\n\nSo total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check: when I set a=100, and b + c=200, that includes the case where b=100 and c=100, which is the triple (100,100,100). Similarly for the other cases. So when I compute |A|, it includes (100,100,100). Same for |B| and |C|. So when I compute |A \u222a B \u222a C|, I'm counting all triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200. So that would include all possible cases where one or more variables are 100, as long as the other two sum to 200.\n\nBut wait, according to the earlier reasoning, any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 will satisfy the second equation, including when two variables are 100 and the third is 100 as well. So the total number of such triples is 601.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about a=200, b=100, c=0, that's part of this count. Specifically, when a=100, and b=200, c=0, which is included in |A| (a=100, b=200, c=0). Similarly, when b=100, a=200, c=0 is included in |B|, etc.\n\nSo, according to this, the total number of triples that satisfy both equations is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with another example. Suppose a=100, b=150, c=50. Then a + b + c = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50 + 150\u00b2*100 + 150\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*100 + 50\u00b2*150.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000.\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000.\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500*100 = 2,250,000.\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22,500*50 = 1,125,000.\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000.\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000.\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000.\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000.\n\n250,000 + 375,000 = 625,000.\n\nNow add them all together: 2,000,000 + 3,375,000 = 5,375,000; 5,375,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000. So yes, it works.\n\nSo, any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 will satisfy the equation. Therefore, the total number of such triples is 601, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when I set a=100, the other two variables can be any pair summing to 200, which includes cases where one is zero. So, in that case, how many triples are there where a=100, b=200, c=0, etc.\n\nBut according to the inclusion-exclusion, it's 601. But when I calculated earlier, I found 6 triples where one variable is zero, but according to this, there are 3*201=603, minus overlaps, giving 601.\n\nSo, perhaps the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I set a=100, the number of solutions is 201, which includes the case where b=100, c=100. Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So when I compute the union, I have to subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, which is three cases, and then add back the case where all three are 100, which was subtracted too many times.\n\nWait, so the inclusion-exclusion formula is:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nSo, |A| = |B| = |C| = 201.\n\n|A\u2229B| is the number of triples where a=100 and b=100, which implies c=100. So |A\u2229B|=1.\n\nSimilarly, |A\u2229C|=1, |B\u2229C|=1.\n\n|A\u2229B\u2229C|=1.\n\nSo,\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 201*3 - 3*1 + 1 = 603 -3 +1= 601.\n\nSo, 601 triples where at least one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nBut wait, according to the earlier example, when a=100, b=150, c=50, that's a valid triple, so it's included in |A|, and so on.\n\nSo, does that mean that all these 601 triples satisfy both equations? It seems so, based on the earlier substitution.\n\nSo, the answer would be 601.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that when one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, that gives 601 triples. But let me check if there are any other solutions besides these.\n\nWait, suppose that none of the variables is 100. Could such a triple satisfy both equations?\n\nLet me test with a=150, b=150, c=0. Then a + b + c = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*150 + 0\u00b2*150.\n\n= 2*(150^3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.\n\n= 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nAnother test case: a=200, b=100, c=0. As before, this gives 6,000,000.\n\nWhat about a=100, b=100, c=100: sum is 300, and the second equation is 6,000,000.\n\nWhat about a=150, b=100, c=50: a + b + c=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\n150\u00b2*100 + 150\u00b2*50 + 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*150 + 50\u00b2*100.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500*100 = 2,250,000.\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22,500*50 = 1,125,000.\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000.\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000.\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000.\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000.\n\nSum them up:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000.\n\n1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000.\n\n375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000.\n\nTotal: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,375,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000. So yes, this works.\n\nBut in this case, a=150, which is not 100. So according to the earlier reasoning, this triple should be included in the count where a=100, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, because in this case, a=150, which is not 100, but the other two variables, b=100 and c=50, do not sum to 200. Wait, wait, 100 + 50 = 150, which is not 200.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 would work. But in this case, a=150, which is not 100, but the other two variables are 100 and 50, which sum to 150. But this triple still satisfies the second equation. So my earlier conclusion that only triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 satisfy the equation is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So my earlier approach is flawed because there are solutions where none of the variables is 100, but the second equation is still satisfied.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, a=150, b=100, c=50, which sums to 300, and the second equation gives 6,000,000. But in this case, none of the variables is 100 except b. Wait, b is 100, so actually, this triple is included in the count where b=100, and a + c=200. Because a=150, c=50, which sum to 200. So yes, this triple is part of the count where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nSo, that example is included in the 601 triples. So perhaps my initial conclusion was correct, and all solutions are accounted for in the 601 triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nWait, but let me try another example where none of the variables is 100. Let me pick a=120, b=120, c=60. a + b + c=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= 120\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*60 + 120\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*60 + 60\u00b2*120 + 60\u00b2*120.\n\n= 2*(120^3) + 2*(120\u00b2*60) + 2*(60\u00b2*120).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120^3 = 1,728,000.\n\nSo 2*(1,728,000) = 3,456,000.\n\n120\u00b2=14,400. 14,400*60=864,000. So 2*(864,000)=1,728,000.\n\n60\u00b2=3,600. 3,600*120=432,000. 2*(432,000)=864,000.\n\nNow, sum all:\n\n3,456,000 + 1,728,000 = 5,184,000.\n\n5,184,000 + 864,000 = 6,048,000.\n\nWhich is more than 6,000,000. So this triple does not satisfy the second equation.\n\nAnother example: a=160, b=80, c=60. a + b + c=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\n160\u00b2*80 + 160\u00b2*60 + 80\u00b2*160 + 80\u00b2*60 + 60\u00b2*160 + 60\u00b2*80.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n160\u00b2=25,600.\n\n25,600*80=2,048,000.\n\n25,600*60=1,536,000.\n\n80\u00b2=6,400.\n\n6,400*160=1,024,000.\n\n6,400*60=384,000.\n\n60\u00b2=3,600.\n\n3,600*160=576,000.\n\n3,600*80=288,000.\n\nNow sum all:\n\n2,048,000 + 1,536,000 = 3,584,000.\n\n1,024,000 + 384,000 = 1,408,000.\n\n576,000 + 288,000 = 864,000.\n\nTotal: 3,584,000 + 1,408,000 = 4,992,000 + 864,000 = 5,856,000. Less than 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so this doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me try to find a triple where none of the variables is 100, but the second equation is satisfied. But from the earlier test cases, it seems that only triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where a=150, b=100, c=50, which is included in the count where b=100, a + c=200, so that's part of the 601 triples. So perhaps all solutions are accounted for in the 601 triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other solutions outside of this. Suppose a=110, b=110, c=80. a + b + c=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\n110\u00b2*110 + 110\u00b2*80 + 110\u00b2*110 + 110\u00b2*80 + 80\u00b2*110 + 80\u00b2*110.\n\n= 2*(110^3) + 2*(110\u00b2*80) + 2*(80\u00b2*110).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n110^3 = 1,331,000. So 2*1,331,000=2,662,000.\n\n110\u00b2=12,100. 12,100*80=968,000. 2*968,000=1,936,000.\n\n80\u00b2=6,400. 6,400*110=704,000. 2*704,000=1,408,000.\n\nSum all:\n\n2,662,000 + 1,936,000 = 4,598,000.\n\n4,598,000 + 1,408,000 = 6,006,000. Close to 6,000,000, but not exactly. So this triple doesn't satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to adjust the numbers to get exactly 6,000,000 without any variable being 100. Let me try a=120, b=90, c=90. a + b + c=300.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\n120\u00b2*90 + 120\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90.\n\n= 2*(120\u00b2*90) + 2*(90\u00b2*120) + 2*(90\u00b2*90).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n120\u00b2=14,400. 14,400*90=1,296,000. 2*1,296,000=2,592,000.\n\n90\u00b2=8,100. 8,100*120=972,000.
