      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, maybe I was confusing it with a square. Let me correct that: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Oh right, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.\n\nSo, let's denote points A, B, C, D as vertices of the rhombus. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, we can characterize the coordinates of these points in terms of vectors. Let me think: in a rhombus, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the origin is their midpoint, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).\n\nWait, but ABCD is a rhombus, so the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, as per the property of a rhombus.\n\nSo, since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin, points A, B, C, D can be considered as pairs of points symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nGiven that all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, substituting A's coordinates into the hyperbola equation: (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1. Similarly, (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B must be equal to the distance from A to D. Let me write this down.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]\nDistance AD: sqrt[(-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2]\n\nSince both distances are equal, squaring both sides gives:\n\n(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-p - x)^2 + (-q - y)^2\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (p\u00b2 - 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 - 2qy + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (p\u00b2 + 2px + x\u00b2) + (q\u00b2 + 2qy + y\u00b2)\n\nSubtracting left from right:\n\nLeft - Right = (-4px - 4qy) = 0\n\nSo, -4px -4qy = 0 => px + qy = 0\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nAnother thing is that the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must have a dot product of zero.\n\nVector AC is ( -x - x, -y - y ) = (-2x, -2y). Wait, actually, AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q). So, the dot product of AC and BD is:\n\n(-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq.\n\nSince they are perpendicular, this dot product equals zero:\n\n4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.\n\nWait, but from the earlier equation, we had px + qy = 0. So, both are the same equation. That makes sense because the diagonals being perpendicular is the same condition as the rhombus property.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. (x\u00b2)/20 - (y\u00b2)/24 = 1\n2. (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1\n3. px + qy = 0\n\nWe need more equations to solve for these variables. Let me think about the slopes.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe slope of AC: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-y - y)/(-x - x) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of BD: (q2 - q1)/(p2 - p1) = (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSo, the product of the slopes is (y/x) * (q/p) = (yq)/(xp) = -1, because they are perpendicular.\n\nBut from equation 3, we have px + qy = 0 => qy = -px => yq = -px. So, (yq)/(xp) = (-px)/(xp) = -1. So, this holds true, which is consistent.\n\nSo, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, now, I need to find BD\u00b2. BD is one of the diagonals. Let's compute BD squared.\n\nBD is the distance from B to D. But since BD is a diagonal, it's twice the distance from B to the origin, because the origin is the midpoint. So, BD is 2 * |OB|, where O is the origin.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (2 * |OB|)^2 = 4 * (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, if I can express p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 in terms of the hyperbola equation, then I can find BD\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation 2, we have p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nLet me write this as p\u00b2 = 20(1 + q\u00b2/24). So, p\u00b2 = 20 + (20 q\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 20 + (5 q\u00b2)/6 + q\u00b2 = 20 + (11 q\u00b2)/6.\n\nBut we also have the equation from 3: px + qy = 0.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nBut maybe we can express x and y in terms of p and q, or find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nI recall that hyperbolas can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For a hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Alternatively, using hyperbola coordinates, (a cosh t, b sinh t). Hmm, but hyperbolic parametrization might be complicated because of the slope condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can consider that the points A and B lie on perpendicular lines through the origin.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the diagonals are perpendicular and the rhombus is formed, the coordinates of A and B must satisfy certain conditions. Let's think of points A and B on the hyperbola such that OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so OA and OB would be along the diagonals. Wait no, OA is a diagonal, OB is another diagonal?\n\nWait, no, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, point A is one vertex, point C is the opposite vertex. Similarly, point B is another vertex. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. As we found earlier, which led to px + qy = 0.\n\nBut perhaps another way to parametrize points A and B is that they lie on the hyperbola and the product of their slopes is -1, but that's not necessarily the case because OA and OB are not necessarily the sides, but actually the diagonals.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me clarify: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the lines AC and BD are the diagonals, and their slopes multiply to -1.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that the slope of AC is y/x, and the slope of BD is q/p, so (y/x)*(q/p) = -1.\n\nWhich led to yq = -xp, which is the same as equation 3.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to use coordinates for A and B such that their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because in the rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but points A and B are adjacent vertices. So, the sides AB are equal and at an angle.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing points A and B on the hyperbola such that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Wait, but is that the case?\n\nWait, no. Because in the rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but OA is half of diagonal AC, and OB is half of diagonal BD. So, vectors OA and OB are actually along the diagonals, which are perpendicular. So, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nSo, OA and OB are position vectors of A and B, which are (x, y) and (p, q). Since OA and OB are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:\n\nx p + y q = 0.\n\nWait, that's exactly the equation we had earlier, equation 3: px + qy = 0.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding points A(x, y) and B(p, q) on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 such that x p + y q =0, and then computing BD\u00b2 =4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), and finding the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, we need the supremum of the lower bounds, but actually, it's the infimum of BD\u00b2. But wait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because we need the largest number that's always below BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, as BD\u00b2 can vary depending on the rhombus, and then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but the question is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, perhaps the infimum is zero, but that can't be, because BD can't be zero as it's a diagonal of a rhombus.\n\nWait, actually, BD\u00b2 is the square of the diagonal, so it's always positive. Since the rhombus lies on the hyperbola, perhaps BD\u00b2 has a minimum value, and the question is asking for the supremum of the lower bounds, which would be the minimal possible BD\u00b2. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let's think again: The problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is the greatest lower bound, so this infimum is the number we're looking for. So, we need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi, which would be the infimum.\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given that points A(x, y) and B(p, q) lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 and satisfy x p + y q =0.\n\nSo, how do we minimize 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3. x p + y q =0.\n\nThis is an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me try to express p in terms of x and y. From equation 3: p = (-y q)/x.\n\nWait, from equation 3: x p + y q =0 => p = (-y q)/x.\n\nBut from equation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1. Substituting p:\n\n[ ( (-y q / x )^2 ) /20 - q\u00b2/24 ] =1\n\nSo, [ ( y\u00b2 q\u00b2 ) / (20 x\u00b2 ) ] - [ q\u00b2 / 24 ] =1\n\nFactor q\u00b2:\n\nq\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n(y\u00b2)/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 => y\u00b2/24 = x\u00b2/20 -1.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (24 x\u00b2)/20 -24 = (6 x\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) = ( (6 x\u00b2/5 -24 ) ) / (20 x\u00b2 ) = (6 x\u00b2)/(5 *20 x\u00b2) - 24/(20 x\u00b2) ) = (6/(100)) - (24)/(20 x\u00b2) ) = (3/50) - (6)/(5 x\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\ny\u00b2 = (6 x\u00b2)/5 -24\n\nSo, y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) = [ (6 x\u00b2/5 -24 ) ] / (20 x\u00b2 ) = (6 x\u00b2)/(5*20 x\u00b2) - 24/(20 x\u00b2) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n6/(100) - 24/(20 x\u00b2 ) = 3/50 - 6/(5 x\u00b2 )\n\nSo, the coefficient is [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = [ (3/50 - 6/(5 x\u00b2 )) - 1/24 ]\n\nCompute this:\n\nLet me find a common denominator. 50, 5, 24. The least common multiple is 600.\n\nConvert each term:\n\n3/50 = 36/600,\n\n6/(5 x\u00b2 ) = 72/(600 x\u00b2 ),\n\n1/24 = 25/600.\n\nSo,\n\n[36/600 - 72/(600 x\u00b2 ) -25/600 ] = (36 -25)/600 -72/(600 x\u00b2 ) = 11/600 - 72/(600 x\u00b2 )\n\nSo, putting back into the equation:\n\nq\u00b2 [11/(600) -72/(600 x\u00b2 ) ] =1\n\nSo,\n\nq\u00b2 = 1 / [ 11/(600) - 72/(600 x\u00b2 ) ] = 600 / [11 - (72/x\u00b2 ) ]\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's continue.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 600 / (11 - 72/x\u00b2 )\n\nAnd since we have BD\u00b2 =4 (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 )\n\nBut p is expressed in terms of q and x: p = (- y q ) /x.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = ( y\u00b2 q\u00b2 ) /x\u00b2.\n\nBut y\u00b2 is known: y\u00b2 = (6 x\u00b2)/5 -24.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = [ (6 x\u00b2 /5 -24 ) * q\u00b2 ] / x\u00b2 = [ (6 x\u00b2 /5 -24 ) / x\u00b2 ] * q\u00b2 = (6/5 - 24/x\u00b2 ) * q\u00b2.\n\nSo, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (6/5 -24/x\u00b2 ) q\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (6/5 -24/x\u00b2 +1 ) q\u00b2 = (11/5 -24/x\u00b2 ) q\u00b2.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 =4 (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) =4*(11/5 -24/x\u00b2 ) q\u00b2.\n\nBut from earlier, q\u00b2 = 600 / (11 -72/x\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4*(11/5 -24/x\u00b2 )*(600 / (11 -72/x\u00b2 ) )\n\nHmm, let me simplify this expression.\n\nLet me denote t = 1/x\u00b2, so x\u00b2 =1/t, where t>0.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2 becomes:\n\n4*(11/5 -24 t )*(600/(11 -72 t )) )\n\nSimplify the expression step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 11/5 -24 t.\n\n11/5 is 2.2, and 24 t is 24 t.\n\nThen, 11 -72 t is in the denominator.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4 * (11/5 -24 t) * (600/(11 -72 t )) )\n\nLet me compute (11/5 -24 t) * (600/(11 -72 t )):\n\n= [ (11/5 -24 t ) *600 ] / (11 -72 t )\n\n= [ (11/5 *600 ) -24 t *600 ] / (11 -72 t )\n\nCompute 11/5 *600: 11 *120=1320\n\n24*600=14400\n\nSo,\n\n= (1320 -14400 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n1320 -14400 t = 1320(1 - (14400/1320 ) t )\n\nCompute 14400 /1320: 14400 \u00f71320= 14400 \u00f7 (132*10 )= (14400 \u00f7132 ) \u00f710= (109.848 ) \u00f710= ~10.9848. Wait, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, 1320 = 132*10, 14400=144*100.\n\nSo,\n\n1320 -14400 t = 132*10 -144*100 t = 12*(11*10) -12*(12*100) t = 12[ 110 -1200 t ]\n\nSo,\n\n= 12(110 -1200 t )\n\nDenominator: 11 -72 t =11 -72 t.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 11 - 72 t as is.\n\nSo, now, BD\u00b2 =4*(12(110 -1200 t )) / (11 -72 t )\n\nSimplify this:\n\n=4*12*(110 -1200 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\n=48*(110 -1200 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 110 -1200 t =110 -1200 t =10*(11 -120 t )\n\nDenominator:11 -72 t.\n\nSo,\n\n=48*10*(11 -120 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\n=480*(11 -120 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write this as 480*[ (11 -120 t ) / (11 -72 t ) ]\n\nLet me write (11 -120 t ) = (11 -72 t ) -48 t.\n\nSo,\n\n(11 -120 t ) = (11 -72 t ) -48 t.\n\nSo,\n\n[ (11 -120 t ) ] / (11 -72 t ) = 1 - (48 t )/(11 -72 t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 * [1 - (48 t)/(11 -72 t ) ]\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, note that BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of t, where t =1/x\u00b2.\n\nSo, t must be positive. Also, from the hyperbola equation, x\u00b2 must be greater than or equal to 20, since x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 implies x\u00b2 \u226520.\n\nTherefore, t=1/x\u00b2 \u22641/20.\n\nSo, t \u2208 (0, 1/20].\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a function of t, where t \u2208 (0, 1/20].\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(11/5 -24 t)*(600/(11 -72 t )) )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n=4*( (11/5)*(600) -24 t *600 ) / (11 -72 t )\n\n=4*( (1320) -14400 t ) / (11 -72 t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(1320 -14400 t )/(11 -72 t )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:1320 -14400 t =1320(1 - (14400/1320) t )=1320(1 -10.909 t )\n\nHmm, but perhaps another way.\n\nWait, 1320 =11*120, 14400=72*200.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator=11*120 -72*200 t=11*120 -72*200 t.\n\nDenominator=11 -72 t.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(11*120 -72*200 t )/(11 -72 t )\n\n=4*[ (11*120 -72*200 t )/(11 -72 t ) ]\n\nLet me factor the numerator:\n\n=4*[ 11*120 -72*200 t ] / (11 -72 t )\n\n=4*[ 11*120 - (72*200 t ) ] / (11 -72 t )\n\nHmm, perhaps factor 11 and 72:\n\nWait, 72=11*6 + 6, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, write numerator as 11*(something) + 72*(something).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perform polynomial division.\n\nLet me write numerator as A*(11 -72 t ) + B, so that:\n\n11*120 -72*200 t = A*(11 -72 t ) + B\n\nSo,\n\n11*120 -72*200 t =11 A -72 A t + B.\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of t: -72*200 = -72 A => A=200.\n\nConstant term:11*120 =11 A + B.\n\nSo, 1320=11*200 + B =>1320=2200 + B => B=1320 -2200= -880.\n\nSo,\n\nNumerator=200*(11 -72 t ) -880.\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*[200*(11 -72 t ) -880]/(11 -72 t )\n\n=4*[200 - 880/(11 -72 t ) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(200 - 880/(11 -72 t ) )\n\n=800 - 3520/(11 -72 t )\n\nNow, since t \u2208(0, 1/20], let's see how 11 -72 t behaves.\n\nWhen t approaches 0, 11 -72 t approaches 11.\n\nWhen t=1/20, 11 -72*(1/20 )=11 -72/20=11 -3.6=7.4.\n\nSo, denominator is between 7.4 and 11.\n\nSo, 11 -72 t \u2208 [7.4, 11 )\n\nSo, 880/(11 -72 t ) \u2208 (880/11, 880/7.4 ]\n\nCompute:\n\n880/11=80,\n\n880/7.4\u2248120 approximately.\n\nWait, 7.4=37/5, so 880/(37/5 )=880*(5/37 )\u2248880*0.135\u2248118.27.\n\nSo, 880/(11 -72 t ) \u2208 [80, ~118.27 ]\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=800 -3520/(11 -72 t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =800 -3520/(11 -72 t )\n\nSince 880/(11 -72 t ) varies between 80 and ~118.27, then 3520/(11 -72 t )=4*880/(11 -72 t ), which varies between 4*80=320 and 4*118.27\u2248473.08.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=800 - something between 320 and 473.08.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 \u2208 (800 -473.08, 800 -320 )\n\nWhich is approximately (326.92, 480 )\n\nBut more accurately, since 11 -72 t is in [7.4, 11 ), the term 3520/(11 -72 t ) is in (3520/11, 3520/7.4 )\n\nCompute:\n\n3520/11=320,\n\n3520/7.4\u22483520/7.4\u2248475.675.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 \u2208 (800 -475.675, 800 -320 )= (324.325, 480 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is between approximately 324.325 and 480.\n\nWait, but this is an approximation. Let's see if we can find the exact minimum.\n\nGiven that BD\u00b2=800 -3520/(11 -72 t ), and t \u2208(0,1/20 ]\n\nWe can write BD\u00b2 as a function of t: BD\u00b2(t)=800 -3520/(11 -72 t )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(t) over t \u2208(0,1/20 ]\n\nSince BD\u00b2(t) is a continuous function on (0,1/20], and it's decreasing or increasing?\n\nLet me compute the derivative of BD\u00b2(t) with respect to t to see if it's increasing or decreasing.\n\nBut t is 1/x\u00b2, so perhaps it's easier to think in terms of t.\n\nLet me compute d(BD\u00b2)/dt= derivative of [800 -3520/(11 -72 t ) ] with respect to t.\n\nWhich is 0 -3520 * d/dt [1/(11 -72 t ) ]\n\n= -3520 * [ 0 - (-72 ) ] / (11 -72 t )\u00b2\n\n= -3520 * [72 ] / (11 -72 t )\u00b2\n\n= -3520*72 / (11 -72 t )\u00b2\n\nWhich is negative because numerator is negative (since 3520*72 is positive, and with the negative sign) and denominator is positive.\n\nSo, d(BD\u00b2)/dt is negative. So, BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing as t increases.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at the maximum t, which is t=1/20.\n\nSo, plugging t=1/20 into BD\u00b2(t):\n\nBD\u00b2=800 -3520/(11 -72*(1/20 ) )\n\nCompute denominator:11 -72/20=11 -3.6=7.4\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=800 -3520/7.4\n\nCompute 3520 /7.4:\n\n7.4=37/5, so 3520/(37/5 )=3520*(5/37 )= (3520/37 )*5\n\nCompute 3520 \u00f737:\n\n37*95=3515, so 3520=37*95 +5, so 3520/37=95 +5/37\u224895.135.\n\nMultiply by 5:95.135*5\u2248475.675.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2\u2248800 -475.675\u2248324.325.\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\nCompute 3520/7.4:\n\n7.4=74/10=37/5.\n\nSo, 3520 / (37/5 )=3520*5/37= (3520/37 )*5.\n\n3520 \u00f737: 37*95=3515. So, 3520=37*95 +5, so 3520/37=95 +5/37=95 + (5/37 )\n\nMultiply by 5: 95*5=475, (5/37 )*5=25/37.\n\nSo, 3520/7.4=475 +25/37=475 + ~0.67568\u2248475.67568.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=800 -475.67568=324.32432.\n\nSo, approximately 324.3243.\n\nBut to get an exact expression, let's compute 3520/(11 -72*(1/20 ))=3520/(7.4)=35200/74=17600/37.\n\nBecause 3520 \u00f77.4=3520 \u00f7 (37/5 )=3520*(5/37 )= (3520*5)/37=17600/37\u2248475.67568.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=800 -17600/37.\n\nCompute 800 as 800*37/37=29600/37.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=29600/37 -17600/37=(29600 -17600)/37=12000/37\u2248324.3243.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=12000/37.\n\nSo, when t=1/20, BD\u00b2=12000/37\u2248324.3243.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing in t, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 12000/37, and as t approaches 0, BD\u00b2 approaches 800 -3520/11=800 -320=480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as desired but doesn't reach it because t approaches 0 but never actually is zero (since x\u00b2 must be at least 20, so t=1/x\u00b2 is at most 1/20).\n\nWait, but if t approaches zero, then x\u00b2 approaches infinity, so the point A goes to infinity on the hyperbola. However, from equation 3, when t approaches zero, q\u00b2 approaches 600/(11 )\u224854.545, since 600/11\u224854.545.\n\nWait, but with t approaching zero, x\u00b2 approaches infinity, so y\u00b2= (6x\u00b2)/5 -24\u2248 (6x\u00b2)/5, which also approaches infinity.\n\nSo, as t approaches zero, point A goes to infinity, and point B approaches some finite point on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but if point A is at infinity, is the rhombus still valid? Because then BD would be finite, but in reality, the rhombus would become degenerate as one diagonal becomes very large.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to check if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480 or not.\n\nWait, when t approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but since t can't be zero, BD\u00b2 can't actually be 480. So, 480 is an upper limit, but BD\u00b2 can get as close to 480 as we want by taking t approaching zero. So, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but the infimum is 12000/37\u2248324.3243.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 12000/37.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 12000/37.\n\nSo, the answer is 12000/37.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWe had BD\u00b2=800 -3520/(11 -72 t )\n\nAt t=1/20,\n\nBD\u00b2=800 -3520/(7.4 )=800 - (3520*10)/74=800 - (35200)/74=800 - 475.675\u2248324.324.\n\nBut 3520/7.4=35200/74=17600/37\u2248475.675.\n\nSo, 800 -17600/37= (800*37 -17600 )/37= (29600 -17600 )/37=12000/37.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n12000 divided by 37 is approximately 324.324.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as 12000/37, and as large as approaching 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12000/37, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 12000/37, and can be made arbitrarily close to 480.\n\nHence, the answer is 12000/37, which is approximately 324.324.\n\nWait, but let me verify if this is indeed the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nIs there a way for BD\u00b2 to be smaller than 12000/37? Let me think.\n\nSince BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing in t, and t can only go up to 1/20, so the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs at t=1/20, which is 12000/37.\n\nTherefore, yes, that's the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 12000/37.\n\nThus, the answer is 12000/37.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus $ABCD$ on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$. The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. We express the coordinates of points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ in terms of vectors and use the properties of the hyperbola and rhombus to derive the necessary conditions.\n\n1. **Hyperbola Equations**: Points $A(x, y)$ and $B(p, q)$ lie on the hyperbola, satisfying:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular, leading to the condition:\n   \\[\n   px + qy = 0.\n   \\]\n\n3. **BD\u00b2 Calculation**: The diagonal $BD$ is twice the distance from $B$ to the origin, so:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Optimization**: Using the constraints, we express $p$ and $q$ in terms of $x$ and $y$, and substitute into the hyperbola equations. Through algebraic manipulation and optimization, we find that the minimal value of $BD^2$ is achieved when $t = \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{20}$. This results in:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{12000}{37}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{12000}{37}}$.",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. The rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, that's a kite. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they are perpendicular. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that means the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.\n\nSince the problem says the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), because the midpoint between A and C is the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q). So, all four points are arranged such that each pair of opposite points are diametrically opposite with respect to the origin.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals. I think the sides of the rhombus can be expressed in terms of the half-diagonals.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. If a rhombus has diagonals of lengths d1 and d2, then each side is sqrt((d1/2)\u00b2 + (d2/2)^2). So, the side length s is (1/2) * sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2). Since all sides are equal, this formula should hold.\n\nBut in this case, the points lie on the hyperbola. So, points A, B, C, D lie on x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, for each point, (x, y), x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSince A and C are opposite points, so if A is (x, y), C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p, q), D is (-p, -q). So, all four points satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C.\n\nLet me write the distance formulas.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(p - (-x))^2 + (q - (-y))^2] = sqrt[(p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2]\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares should be equal:\n\n(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yq + q\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2xp + p\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yq + q\u00b2\n\nSimplify by subtracting x\u00b2, y\u00b2, p\u00b2, q\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2xp - 2yq = 2xp + 2yq\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-2xp - 2yq - 2xp - 2yq = 0\n\n-4xp -4yq = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nxp + yq = 0\n\nSo, xp + yq = 0. That's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider another condition for the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nThe diagonals are AC and BD. Diagonal AC goes from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so the slope is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x.\n\nSimilarly, diagonal BD goes from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.\n\nSince diagonals are perpendicular, the product of slopes is -1:\n\n(y/x) * (q/p) = -1\n\nSo, (yq)/(xp) = -1\n\nBut from earlier, we have xp + yq = 0. Rearranged, that's yq = -xp.\n\nSubstitute into the slope equation:\n\n(yq)/(xp) = (-xp)/(xp) = -1\n\nWhich is indeed true. So, that condition is satisfied. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of vectors. The diagonals AC and BD are vectors from the origin to (x, y) and (p, q), but wait, no, the diagonals are from A to C and from B to D. But since their midpoints are the origin, they pass through the origin, so the vectors for the diagonals are (2x, 2y) and (2p, 2q), but actually, the diagonals are vectors from (-x, -y) to (x, y), which is (2x, 2y), and similarly for BD.\n\nBut since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nSo, the vectors AC and BD are (2x, 2y) and (2p, 2q). So, their dot product is (2x)(2p) + (2y)(2q) = 4xp + 4yq = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0. Which is the same as before. So, that condition is necessary.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, let's write the equations for points A, B, C, D.\n\nPoint A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nPoint B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nPoint C: (-x)^2/20 - (-y)^2/24 = x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, same as point A.\n\nPoint D: (-p)^2/20 - (-q)^2/24 = p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1, same as point B.\n\nSo, all four points satisfy the hyperbola equation, so we just have two distinct equations for A and B.\n\nSo, our constraints are:\n\n1. x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 (for point A)\n2. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1 (for point B)\n3. xp + yq = 0 (from the perpendicular diagonals)\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2. BD is the distance between B and D. But since D is (-p, -q), the distance between B(p, q) and D(-p, -q) is sqrt[(p + p)^2 + (q + q)^2] = sqrt[(2p)^2 + (2q)^2] = 2 sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, BD is twice the distance from the origin to B. So, BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, our target is to find the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, but wait, no, the problem says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the supremum of the lower bounds of BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi. So, it's the minimal value that BD\u00b2 can take, but the question is phrased as the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Hmm, perhaps I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nWait, but if I can find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, then that would be the least BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, which is the minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, but we need the minimal BD\u00b2. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 would be the greatest lower bound, so the answer is that minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 cannot be less than a certain value, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is, say, m, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be m. Therefore, I think I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), given the hyperbola condition and xp + yq = 0.\n\nSo, let's write down our variables. We have:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nEquation 3: xp + yq = 0\n\nWe need to find the minimum of 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). So, perhaps we can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation 3: xp = -yq\n\nSo, y = (-xp)/q\n\nBut then, from equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [ ( (-xp)/q )\u00b2 ] /24 = 1\n\nWhich is x\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) = 1.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parameterize the points on the hyperbola. Since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola opening left and right.\n\nWe can parameterize the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, the parametric equations are x = a cosh \u03b8, y = b sinh \u03b8. So, for our case, a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6. So, parametric equations would be:\n\nx = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8\n\ny = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8\n\nSimilarly, for point B, we can write:\n\np = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6\n\nq = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6\n\nThen, equation 3: xp + yq = 0\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(2\u221a5 cosh \u03b8)(2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6) + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03b8)(2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6) = 0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2\u221a5)(2\u221a5) cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = 4*5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = 20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6\n\nSecond term: (2\u221a6)(2\u221a6) sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 4*6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6\n\nSo, equation 3 becomes:\n\n20 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 24 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nWe can factor this:\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, that's equation 3 after substitution.\n\nSo, 5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 + 6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6 = 0\n\nThat's the condition we have.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n5 cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 = -6 sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are except for \u03b8=0 or \u03c6=0, but those would be trivial cases where points are on the vertices, but probably not giving the minimal BD\u00b2).\n\nSo, 5 = -6 (sinh \u03b8 sinh \u03c6)/(cosh \u03b8 cosh \u03c6) = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\n5 = -6 tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6\n\nSo,\n\ntanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the product of tanh \u03b8 and tanh \u03c6 is -5/6.\n\nNow, the hyperbolic tangent function has a range of (-1, 1). So, tanh \u03b8 is between -1 and 1, same for tanh \u03c6.\n\nSo, their product is -5/6, which is approximately -0.8333.\n\nSo, let's think about this. The product of two numbers in (-1,1) is -5/6. So, we need to find \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWe can write tanh \u03c6 = (-5/6) / tanh \u03b8.\n\nSo, that's one equation.\n\nNow, what else do we have? We have point A on the hyperbola, parameterized by \u03b8, and point B on the hyperbola, parameterized by \u03c6.\n\nWe need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nFrom earlier, BD\u00b2 = 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSince p = 2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6 and q = 2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (2\u221a5 cosh \u03c6)^2 + (2\u221a6 sinh \u03c6)^2 = 4*5 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 4*6 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (20 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) = 80 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe we can use hyperbolic identities to simplify.\n\nWe know that cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 (1 + sinh\u00b2 \u03c6) + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 80 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 + 96 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSimilarly, perhaps we can express sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of tanh \u03b8.\n\nFrom earlier, tanh \u03b8 tanh \u03c6 = -5/6\n\nWe can write tanh \u03c6 = (-5/6) / tanh \u03b8\n\nSo, let's find sinh\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nWe know that tanh \u03c6 = sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6, so sinh \u03c6 = tanh \u03c6 cosh \u03c6.\n\nAlso, cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 - sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1.\n\nLet me express sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 in terms of tanh \u03c6.\n\nSince tanh \u03c6 = sinh \u03c6 / cosh \u03c6,\n\ntanh\u00b2 \u03c6 = sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 / cosh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 \u03c6 = tanh\u00b2 \u03c6 cosh\u00b2 \u03c6\n\nBut cosh\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1 + sinh\u00b2 phi.\n\nWait, this might get circular. Alternatively, express sinh\u00b2 phi in terms of tanh phi.\n\nWe know that 1 - tanh\u00b2 phi = 1 / cosh\u00b2 phi\n\nSo, 1 - tanh\u00b2 phi = 1 / cosh\u00b2 phi\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2 phi = 1 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)\n\nSo, sinh\u00b2 phi = cosh\u00b2 phi -1 = [1 / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)] - 1 = [1 - (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)] / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi) ) = tanh\u00b2 phi / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)\n\nTherefore,\n\nsinh\u00b2 phi = tanh\u00b2 phi / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)\n\nSo, going back, we have BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 phi\n\n= 80 + 176 [ tanh\u00b2 phi / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi) ]\n\nBut from earlier, tanh phi = (-5/6) / tanh theta\n\nSo, tanh phi = (-5/6) / tanh theta\n\nSo, tanh\u00b2 phi = (25/36) / tanh\u00b2 theta\n\nLet me denote t = tanh theta, so tanh phi = (-5/6)/t\n\nThus, tanh\u00b2 phi = (25/36) / t\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 * [ (25/36)/t\u00b2 ) / (1 - (25/36)/t\u00b2 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1 - (25/36)/t\u00b2 = (t\u00b2 - 25/36)/t\u00b2\n\nSo, numerator is (25/36)/t\u00b2, denominator is (t\u00b2 -25/36)/t\u00b2\n\nThus, the fraction becomes [ (25/36)/t\u00b2 ] / [ (t\u00b2 -25/36)/t\u00b2 ] = (25/36) / (t\u00b2 -25/36)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 * [ (25/36) / (t\u00b2 -25/36) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + [176 * 25 / 36 ] / (t\u00b2 -25/36 )\n\nCompute 176 *25 = 4400, 4400 /36 = 122.222... So, 122.222... / (t\u00b2 -25/36)\n\nHmm, perhaps as fractions:\n\n176 = 16*11, 25=25, 36=36.\n\nSo, 176*25=4400, 4400/36=1100/9\u2248122.222.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9) / (t\u00b2 -25/36 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9) / ( (36 t\u00b2 -25)/36 )\n\nWhich is BD\u00b2 = 80 + (1100/9) * (36 / (36 t\u00b2 -25)) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1100/9)*(36) = 1100 * 4 = 4400\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400 / (36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400 / (36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nNow, t is tanh theta, and tanh theta is in (-1,1). So, t is in (-1,1).\n\nBut t cannot be such that denominator becomes zero, so 36 t\u00b2 -25 \u22600 \u2192 t\u00b2 \u226025/36 \u2192 t \u2260 \u00b15/6. So, t can be from -1 to 1, except \u00b15/6.\n\nBut in our case, from earlier, tanh theta tanh phi = -5/6.\n\nGiven that tanh phi = (-5/6)/t, and tanh phi must be in (-1,1).\n\nSo, if t is positive, then tanh phi is negative, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's assume t is positive. Because hyperbolic functions are symmetric, we can assume t >0 without loss of generality.\n\nSo, t is in (0,1), but not equal to 5/6.\n\nSo, 36 t\u00b2 -25 is in (36*(0) -25, 36*(1) -25) = (-25,11). But as t approaches 5/6 from below, 36 t\u00b2 approaches 25, so denominator approaches 0 from the negative side. Similarly, as t approaches 5/6 from above, denominator approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nBut since t cannot be 5/6, so 36 t\u00b2 -25 is in (-25,0) union (0,11).\n\nBut since t is positive, let's consider t in (0,5/6) and t in (5/6,1).\n\nBut in our case, tanh theta tanh phi = -5/6, and tanh phi = (-5/6)/t.\n\nSo, if t is positive, then tanh phi is negative, so phi is in the other branch of the hyperbola.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal BD\u00b2 as a function of t, where t is in (0,5/6) union (5/6,1).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25).\n\nWe can analyze this function to find its minimal value.\n\nLet me denote f(t) = 80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimum of f(t) for t in (0,5/6) and t in (5/6,1).\n\nFirst, consider t in (0,5/6):\n\nIn this interval, 36 t\u00b2 -25 is negative (since t\u00b2 <25/36). So, denominator is negative, and 4400 is positive, so 4400/(negative) is negative. So, f(t) =80 + negative number. So, the function f(t) decreases as t increases towards 5/6 from below.\n\nSimilarly, in the interval t in (5/6,1):\n\n36 t\u00b2 -25 is positive (since t\u00b2 >25/36). So, denominator is positive, and 4400/(positive) is positive. So, f(t) =80 + positive number. So, as t increases, denominator increases (since t\u00b2 increases), so 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25) decreases. So, f(t) decreases as t approaches 5/6 from above.\n\nThus, the minimal value of f(t) occurs at the point where t approaches 5/6 from both sides.\n\nWait, but let's check the limits.\n\nAs t approaches 5/6 from below, 36 t\u00b2 approaches 25 from below, so 36 t\u00b2 -25 approaches 0 from below (negative). So, 4400/(negative approaching zero) approaches negative infinity. So, f(t) approaches 80 - infinity = negative infinity.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 is a squared distance, so it can't be negative. So, that suggests that as t approaches 5/6 from below, BD\u00b2 tends to negative infinity, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, no. Wait, BD\u00b2 is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Since p and q are real numbers, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 is always non-negative, so BD\u00b2 is non-negative. So, if according to the expression, BD\u00b2 approaches negative infinity, that must mean I have an error in the algebra.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400 / (36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWait, if t approaches 5/6 from below, 36 t\u00b2 -25 approaches 0 from the negative side, so denominator is approaching 0-.\n\nSo, 4400/(denominator approaching 0-) would approach -infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 + (-infinity) = -infinity.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 must be positive because it's a squared distance. So, this suggests that for t approaching 5/6 from below, BD\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible. Therefore, such t cannot be allowed. So, perhaps t cannot be in (0,5/6), because that would cause BD\u00b2 to be negative, which is impossible.\n\nSo, only t in (5/6,1) is acceptable, because in that case, denominator is positive, so BD\u00b2 is positive.\n\nWait, let me check. If t is approaching 5/6 from above, then 36 t\u00b2 -25 approaches 0 from above, so denominator approaches 0+, and 4400/(denominator approaching 0+) approaches +infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches +infinity. That seems okay.\n\nBut wait, for t in (5/6,1), BD\u00b2 is 80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25), which is 80 + a positive number, and as t increases from 5/6 to 1, 36 t\u00b2 -25 increases from 0 to 11, so the denominator increases, so 4400/(denominator) decreases. So, BD\u00b2 starts at +infinity when t approaches 5/6 from above, and decreases as t increases, reaching a minimum at t=1.\n\nWait, at t=1, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 4400/(36*1 -25) = 80 + 4400/(11) = 80 + 400 = 480.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity as t approaches 5/6 from above, and at t=1, BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nBut what about t in (0,5/6)? There, BD\u00b2 is negative, which is impossible. So, perhaps t cannot be in (0,5/6). So, only t in (5/6,1) is valid.\n\nWait, but t is tanh theta, and tanh theta can be from -1 to 1. So, maybe when t is negative, we can have another scenario.\n\nWait, let's suppose t is negative, so t is in (-1,0). Then, tanh phi = (-5/6)/t, which is positive because t is negative, so tanh phi is positive. So, phi is in the other branch.\n\nSo, let's explore t negative.\n\nIf t is negative, say t approaches 0 from below, then tanh phi = (-5/6)/t approaches positive infinity because t approaches 0- (negative approaching zero). But tanh phi must be less than 1, so tanh phi approaches 1 from below as t approaches 0 from below.\n\nWait, but if tanh phi approaches 1, then sinh phi approaches infinity, because sinh phi = (tanh phi)/(sqrt(1 - tanh\u00b2 phi)).\n\nWait, no, actually, as tanh phi approaches 1, sinh phi approaches infinity.\n\nSo, in this case, when t approaches 0 from below, tanh phi approaches 1 from below, so sinh phi approaches infinity. Therefore, BD\u00b2, which is 80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 phi, would approach infinity as t approaches 0 from below.\n\nAlternatively, when t approaches -1 from above, tanh theta approaches -1, so tanh phi = (-5/6)/(-1) = 5/6. So, tanh phi =5/6, which is valid because |5/6| <1.\n\nSo, when t approaches -1 from above, tanh phi approaches 5/6 from above.\n\nWait, perhaps let's go through this.\n\nIf t is negative, say t approaches -1 from above, so t approaches -1+, then tanh phi = (-5/6)/t = (-5/6)/(-1+) = (5/6)/(1 - \u03b5) \u22485/6*(1 + \u03b5) \u22485/6 + (5/6) \u03b5, which approaches 5/6 from above.\n\nSo, tanh phi approaches 5/6 from above, so sinh phi approaches a finite limit because tanh phi approaches 5/6, which is within (-1,1).\n\nSo, in this case, sinh phi is finite, so BD\u00b2 is finite.\n\nSo, when t is negative, t approaches -1 from above, tanh phi approaches 5/6 from above, which is within the valid range.\n\nSimilarly, as t approaches 0 from below, tanh phi approaches positive infinity, which is not possible because tanh phi is bounded by 1.\n\nWait, no, tanh phi can't approach infinity. So, earlier conclusion was incorrect.\n\nWait, tanh phi is bounded by 1, so if t approaches 0 from below (t approaches 0-), then tanh phi = (-5/6)/t approaches positive infinity as t approaches 0- because t is approaching 0 from the negative side, so (-5/6)/t approaches positive infinity. But tanh phi can't exceed 1, so this suggests that t cannot approach 0 from below because that would require tanh phi to be greater than 1, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, for t negative, tanh phi can only approach up to 1. Therefore, the minimal t can be is such that tanh phi =1.\n\nWait, but tanh phi = (-5/6)/t.\n\nIf tanh phi approaches 1, then (-5/6)/t approaches 1, so t approaches -5/6.\n\nSo, t is in (-1, -5/6], because if t approaches -5/6 from below (i.e., t approaches -5/6 from the left, more negative), then tanh phi approaches 1 from below.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nIf t is in (-1, -5/6), then tanh phi = (-5/6)/t.\n\nt is negative, so tanh phi is positive.\n\nBecause t is negative, and (-5/6)/t is positive.\n\nSo, tanh phi is in (0,5/6/1)= (0,5/6).\n\nWait, 5/6 divided by |t|, but |t| is less than 1.\n\nWait, let's suppose t is in (-1, -5/6). So, |t| is in (5/6,1). So, (-5/6)/t = (5/6)/|t|, which is in (5/6, 1). So, tanh phi is in (5/6,1).\n\nWait, but tanh phi can't be more than 1, so as t approaches -5/6 from below, tanh phi approaches 1.\n\nSo, t can be in (-1, -5/6), which makes tanh phi in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, now, let's express BD\u00b2 in this scenario.\n\nAgain, BD\u00b2 =80 + 176 sinh\u00b2 phi\n\nBut sinh\u00b2 phi = tanh\u00b2 phi / (1 - tanh\u00b2 phi )\n\n= (25/36)/t\u00b2 / (1 - (25/36)/t\u00b2 )\n\n= (25/(36 t\u00b2)) / ( (36 t\u00b2 -25)/(36 t\u00b2) )\n\n= 25/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =80 + 176*(25)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\n=80 + (4400)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nBut now, t is in (-1, -5/6). So, t\u00b2 is in (25/36,1).\n\nTherefore, 36 t\u00b2 -25 is in (0,11), same as when t is in (5/6,1).\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWhich is the same as when t is positive and in (5/6,1).\n\nSo, whether t is in (5/6,1) or t is in (-1, -5/6), the BD\u00b2 expression is the same.\n\nSo, in both cases, the function f(t) =80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25) is defined for t in (5/6,1) or t in (-1, -5/6).\n\nSo, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can consider t in (5/6,1) and find the minimal value of f(t).\n\nSo, f(t) =80 + 4400/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nLet me consider t in (5/6,1). Let me make a substitution for t.\n\nLet u = t\u00b2, so u is in (25/36,1).\n\nThen, f(u) =80 + 4400/(36 u -25)\n\nWe can find the derivative of f(u) with respect to u to find its minima.\n\nSo, df/du = 0 + [0 -4400 *36 ] / (36 u -25)^2 = (-158400)/(36 u -25)^2\n\nWait, derivative is negative because numerator is negative, denominator is positive.\n\nSo, df/du is negative for all u in (25/36,1). So, f(u) is decreasing as u increases.\n\nSo, f(u) is minimized when u is as large as possible, which is u=1.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is at u=1.\n\nSo, plug u=1 into f(u):\n\nf(1) =80 +4400/(36*1 -25) =80 +4400/11=80+400=480.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 cannot be less than 480. So, 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nWait, but wait. Is 480 the minimal value? Because if we approach t=5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, which is the minimal value.\n\nSimilarly, when t approaches -5/6 from below, which would correspond to u approaching 25/36 from above, the BD\u00b2 approaches infinity again, and as t approaches -1, u approaches 1, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, yes, 480 is the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that is, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than or equal to all BD\u00b2 is 480. But since 480 is attainable (at t=1 and t=-1), so for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480, because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Wait, no, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that is, find the maximum m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nBut if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, then m must be less than or equal to 480. Wait, no, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so m must be the supremum of numbers less than all BD\u00b2, which would be 480.\n\nBecause if you take m=480, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u2265480, so 480 < BD\u00b2 is not true for rhombi where BD\u00b2=480. So, the problem is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Therefore, m must be less than 480, but as close as possible to 480.\n\nWait, no, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 480, so any m less than 480 would not satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because some rhombi have BD\u00b2=480, which is not greater than m. Hmm, I think I might have misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, m must satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480. Therefore, the greatest such m is the supremum of all m where m < 480, so m approaches 480 from below.\n\nBut since m has to be a real number, the supremum is 480, but since m must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which includes rhombi where BD\u00b2=480, m must be less than or equal to 480. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\", so m must be strictly less than 480. Therefore, the greatest real number m is 480, but since 480 is attainable, m must be less than 480. So, the supremum is 480, but it's not attainable as a lower bound. So, the answer is 480, but the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 can be exactly 480, m must be less than 480. Therefore, the greatest such number is 480, but since it must be less than BD\u00b2, which can be 480, the answer is the supremum, which is 480, but since 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but is equal to BD\u00b2 for some, the problem is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning earlier. Let me check if BD\u00b2=480 is attainable.\n\nWhen t=1, BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, if we set t=1, then tanh theta=1, which implies theta approaches infinity, so sinh theta approaches infinity, cosh theta approaches infinity.\n\nSo, point A would be (2\u221a5 cosh theta, 2\u221a6 sinh theta), which would be a point at infinity on the hyperbola. Similarly, point B would be (2\u221a5 cosh phi, 2\u221a6 sinh phi). But if tanh theta=1, then sinh theta is infinity, so point A is at infinity. Similarly, tanh phi = (-5/6)/1 = -5/6. So, phi is a finite value, as tanh phi=-5/6.\n\nSo, point B is (2\u221a5 cosh phi, 2\u221a6 sinh phi), where tanh phi= -5/6.\n\nSo, indeed, point B is a finite point on the hyperbola.\n\nBut point A is at infinity, which may not form a proper rhombus. Hmm, maybe the case t=1 is degenerate, because point A is at infinity, which might not be acceptable. So, perhaps BD\u00b2 approaches 480 as t approaches 1 from below, but never actually reaches 480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches 1 from below, point A approaches infinity, which would make the rhombus infinitely large, but BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is actually higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, when t approaches 1, tanh theta approaches 1, so theta approaches infinity, meaning point A goes to infinity. Similarly, point B is finite. So, in that case, the rhombus would have point A at infinity, which is not really a rhombus.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is higher than 480. Hmm, I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem differently, without parameterization.\n\nLet me think of the problem again.\n\nWe have four points on the hyperbola: A(x,y), B(p,q), C(-x,-y), D(-p,-q).\n\nThe diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n\nSo, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:\n\n(2x, 2y) \u00b7 (2p, 2q) = 0 \u2192 4xp + 4yq = 0 \u2192 xp + yq=0.\n\nWe also have x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 and p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 4(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2).\n\nSo, let me denote S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of 4S, given the constraints.\n\nFrom xp + yq=0, and x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe can express y from the first equation: y = (-xp)/q.\n\nSubstitute into the hyperbola equation for A:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [ (-xp/q)^2 ] /24 =1\n\nWhich is x\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2)/(24 q\u00b2) =1.\n\nLet me factor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [ 1/20 - p\u00b2/(24 q\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 [ (12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2)/(240 q\u00b2) ) ] =1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 240 q\u00b2 / (12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2 )\n\nBut since x\u00b2 must be positive, denominator must have same sign as numerator.\n\n240 q\u00b2 is positive, so denominator must be positive: 12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2 >0.\n\nSo, 12 q\u00b2 >5 p\u00b2\n\nSo, 12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2 >0.\n\nSimilarly, from the hyperbola equation for point B: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 240: 12 p\u00b2 -5 q\u00b2=240.\n\nSo, 12 p\u00b2 -5 q\u00b2=240.\n\nSo, from this, we can express p\u00b2 in terms of q\u00b2:\n\n12 p\u00b2 =240 +5 q\u00b2 \u2192 p\u00b2= (240 +5 q\u00b2)/12\n\nSo, p\u00b2= 20 + (5/12) q\u00b2.\n\nNow, going back to the expression for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2=240 q\u00b2/(12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2 )\n\nBut from the expression for p\u00b2, 12 p\u00b2=240 +5 q\u00b2 \u2192 5 p\u00b2= (240 +5 q\u00b2)/12 *5= (240*5 +25 q\u00b2)/12= (1200 +25 q\u00b2)/12.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to substitute p\u00b2 into the denominator.\n\nDenominator: 12 q\u00b2 -5 p\u00b2 =12 q\u00b2 -5*(20 + (5/12) q\u00b2 )=12 q\u00b2 -100 - (25/12) q\u00b2.\n\nCompute 12 q\u00b2 - (25/12) q\u00b2 = (144/12 q\u00b2 -25/12 q\u00b2 )= (119/12) q\u00b2.\n\nSo, denominator= (119/12) q\u00b2 -100.\n\nSo, x\u00b2=240 q\u00b2 / [ (119/12) q\u00b2 -100 ] =240 q\u00b2 / [ (119 q\u00b2 -1200)/12 ] =240 q\u00b2 *12 / (119 q\u00b2 -1200 )= (2880 q\u00b2)/(119 q\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nNow, x\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must be positive:\n\n119 q\u00b2 -1200 >0 \u2192 q\u00b2>1200/119\u224810.084.\n\nSo, q\u00b2>10.084.\n\nSo, with this, we can write x\u00b2=2880 q\u00b2/(119 q\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nNow, we also have point A lying on the hyperbola, so x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut y= (-xp)/q, so y\u00b2= (x\u00b2 p\u00b2 )/q\u00b2.\n\nSo, substituting into hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 p\u00b2 )/(24 q\u00b2 )=1.\n\nBut we already used this to find x\u00b2 in terms of q\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps now, we can relate S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nWe have p\u00b2=20 + (5/12) q\u00b2.\n\nSo, S=20 + (5/12) q\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (17/12) q\u00b2.\n\nSo, S=20 + (17/12) q\u00b2.\n\nWe need to minimize 4S=80 + (17/3) q\u00b2.\n\nBut we have constraints on q\u00b2.\n\nFrom earlier, q\u00b2>1200/119\u224810.084.\n\nSo, to minimize 4S, we need to minimize q\u00b2.\n\nSince S increases with q\u00b2, the minimal S occurs at the minimal q\u00b2, which is q\u00b2=1200/119.\n\nSo, substituting q\u00b2=1200/119 into S:\n\nS=20 + (17/12)*(1200/119)=20 + (17*100)/119=20 +1700/119.\n\nCompute 1700/119: 119*14=1666, 1700-1666=34, so 14 +34/119=14 + 34/119\u224814.286.\n\nSo, S\u224820 +14.286\u224834.286.\n\nSo, 4S\u2248137.144.\n\nWait, but let me compute exactly:\n\n1700/119 = 1700 \u00f7119.\n\n119*14=1666\n\n1700-1666=34\n\nSo, 1700/119=14 +34/119=14 + (34/119)=14 + (2*17)/(7*17)=14 + 2/7=14.2857.\n\nSo, S=20 +14.2857\u224834.2857.\n\nTherefore, 4S\u2248137.1428.\n\nBut let me compute it more accurately.\n\n1700 \u00f7119:\n\n119*14=1666\n\n1700-1666=34\n\nSo, 34 \u00f7119= 34/119=2/7.\n\nSo, 1700/119=14 +2/7=14.285714...\n\nTherefore, S=20 +14.285714=34.285714.\n\nSo, 4S=137.142856.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4S\u2248137.142856.\n\nWait, but earlier, when we set t=1, we found BD\u00b2=480, but here, we're getting BD\u00b2\u2248137.14.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that perhaps my earlier approach using parameterization was flawed, perhaps missing some constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps because when t approaches 1, point A goes to infinity, which is not a valid point for the rhombus, so the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when q\u00b2 is at its minimal, which is 1200/119, leading to BD\u00b2\u2248137.14.\n\nSo, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, in the parametrization approach, I found that BD\u00b2 can be as low as 480, but in reality, the minimal BD\u00b2 is approximately 137.14.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in the parametrization approach, I didn't consider the correct constraints. Maybe I should have considered the relationship between points A and B more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWe need to minimize S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1\n\n2. xp + yq=0\n\nAnd point A (x,y) is on the hyperbola: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1\n\nEquation 3: xp + yq=0\n\nWe can express x and y in terms of p and q via equation 3.\n\nFrom equation 3: y = (-xp)/q\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - [ ( (-xp)/q )\u00b2 ] /24=1\n\nWhich is same as equation 1 substitution earlier.\n\nWhich led to x\u00b2=2880 q\u00b2/(119 q\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2=2880 q\u00b2/(119 q\u00b2 -1200 )\n\nFrom equation 2: p\u00b2=20 + (5/12) q\u00b2\n\nSo, S = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=20 + (17/12) q\u00b2\n\nSo, our goal is to minimize S=20 + (17/12) q\u00b2, with q\u00b2>1200/119\u224810.084.\n\nThus, the minimal S is when q\u00b2=1200/119, leading to S=20 + (17/12)*(1200/119)=20 + (17*100)/119=20 +1700/119=20 +14.2857\u224834.2857.\n\nSo, minimal S\u224834.2857, so minimal BD\u00b2=4*S\u2248137.1428.\n\nBut earlier, from parametrization, I obtained BD\u00b2=480.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization approach was incorrect because when t approaches 1, point A goes to infinity, which is degenerate, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed approximately 137.14.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct minimal BD\u00b2 is 137.142857, which is 137 and 1/7, as 1/7\u22480.142857.\n\nWait, 137.142857 is 137 + 1/7.\n\nBecause 1/7\u22480.142857.\n\nSo, 137 + 1/7= 960/7\u2248137.142857.\n\nWait, 960 divided by7: 7*137=959, so 960/7=137 +1/7\u2248137.142857.\n\nSo, 960/7\u2248137.142857.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=960/7.\n\nLet me compute 960/7: 7*137=959, so 960/7=137+1/7=137.142857.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=960/7.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960/7, which is about 137.142857.\n\nSo, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 960/7, which is approximately 137.142857, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7, because BD\u00b2 can be exactly 960/7, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" Wait, no, because if BD\u00b2 can reach 960/7, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than 960/7. But wait, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 960/7, then for any number less than 960/7, there exists a rhombus where BD\u00b2 is less than that number, which contradicts. Wait, no, because if the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960/7, then for any m <960/7, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=960/7>m, but other rhombuses can have larger BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the greatest real number m such that m < BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nSo, m must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, because if m is less than minimal BD\u00b2, then m will be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 cannot be smaller than the minimal.\n\nBut if m is equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, then m is not less than BD\u00b2 for rhombi with BD\u00b2=m.\n\nTherefore, the greatest m is the minimal BD\u00b2, because any higher m would not satisfy m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi.\n\nWait, but in this case, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960/7\u2248137.142857.\n\nSo, the greatest m where m < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7, because for any m' <960/7, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=960/7 >m'.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's the supremum of all such m, which is 960/7.\n\nBut since 960/7 is attainable, then m can be as close as possible to 960/7 from below, but not including 960/7. Wait, no, because 960/7 is the minimal BD\u00b2. So, if m is the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, m must be less than 960/7. But the supremum of such m is 960/7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 960/7.\n\nBut let me confirm this.\n\nFrom the Lagrange multipliers approach, we found that the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960/7.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7.\n\nSo, the answer is 960/7, which is approximately 137.142857.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{960}{7}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi \\(ABCD\\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).\n   - The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.\n   - Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are on the hyperbola, with \\(C = (-x, -y)\\) and \\(D = (-p, -q)\\) if \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(B = (p, q)\\).\n\n2. **Conditions for Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(xp + yq = 0\\).\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - \\(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\\).\n   - Using the hyperbola equation for point \\(B\\), we express \\(p^2\\) in terms of \\(q^2\\): \\(p^2 = 20 + \\frac{5}{12}q^2\\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - Substituting \\(p^2\\) into \\(BD^2\\), we get \\(BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{17}{3}q^2\\).\n   - The minimal value of \\(q^2\\) is found to be \\(\\frac{1200}{119}\\), leading to the minimal \\(BD^2 = \\frac{960}{7}\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is the minimal \\(BD^2\\), which is \\(\\frac{960}{7}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{960}{7}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me read it again.\n\nWe have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about hyperbolas and rhombuses.\n\nFirst, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, with a\u00b2 = 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis has b\u00b2 = 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nFor a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles if it's a square, but here it's a general rhombus. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, for the rhombus ABCD, points A, B, C, D are such that the midpoints of both diagonals are at the origin.\n\nSo, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the midpoints are the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the four points are arranged such that the diagonals are AC and BD. So, points A, B, C, D are in order, so the diagonals are from A to C and from B to D.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.\n\nAlso, since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, the points are placed symmetrically.\n\nBut let's think about parametrizing the points on the hyperbola. Since we're dealing with a hyperbola of the form x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, we can parametrize it using hyperbolic functions.\n\nSo, for any point on the hyperbola, we can write (x, y) = (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8), where \u03b8 is a parameter. Alternatively, using hyperbola parametrization, but sometimes people use (a cosh t, b sinh t). Wait, but since hyperbola can also be parametrized with angle \u03b8, but it's not the same as the angle in the circle.\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Because a\u00b2 is 20, so a is sqrt(20), and b\u00b2 is 24, so b is sqrt(24). So, this would give us points on the hyperbola.\n\nBut since the origin is the midpoint of the diagonals, and since the diagonals are AC and BD, then if A is (x1, y1), then C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, B is (x2, y2) and D is (-x2, -y2).\n\nSo, the four points are A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2), C(-x1, -y1), D(-x2, -y2). Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal.\n\nSo, the distance AB must equal BC, which equals CD, which equals DA.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use vectors or coordinate geometry to express the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the properties of rhombus and hyperbola.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and since the center is the origin, then the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nWait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, AC and BD are perpendicular.\n\nSo, if AC is the diagonal from A(x1, y1) to C(-x1, -y1), then the vector AC is (-2x1, -2y1). Similarly, BD is from B(x2, y2) to D(-x2, -y2), so vector BD is (-2x2, -2y2).\n\nSince AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.\n\nSo, AC \u00b7 BD = (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, that's one condition.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for points A, B, C, D:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nx2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\n(-x1)\u00b2/20 - (-y1)\u00b2/24 = x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nSame for C, same for D.\n\nSo, the conditions are that A and B lie on the hyperbola, with the product of their coordinates summing to zero: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find BD\u00b2. Diagonal BD is from B(x2, y2) to D(-x2, -y2). So, the length of BD is the distance between (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2), which is sqrt[(x2 - (-x2))\u00b2 + (y2 - (-y2))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2x2)\u00b2 + (2y2)\u00b2] = 2 sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 would be [2 sqrt(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)]\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4(x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nWe need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, meaning the greatest lower bound, such that BD\u00b2 is always greater than this number for all possible such rhombi.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that's the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value, but never less than that, then that value is the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find the minimum possible BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the BD\u00b2 can approach a certain limit, but not go below it.\n\nSo, how do I find the minimum of BD\u00b2? BD\u00b2 is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2, given that x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1, and that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, where (x1, y1) is another point on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but since A, B, C, D are four points forming a rhombus, perhaps we can relate x1, y1 and x2, y2.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of the rhombus as two points A and B on the hyperbola, such that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, and being perpendicular.\n\nSo, A is (x1, y1), B is (x2, y2), C is (-x1, -y1), D is (-x2, -y2).\n\nAnd the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nWe have the condition x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, as we derived earlier.\n\nSo, to find BD\u00b2, which is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2), we need to minimize x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2, subject to x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24 = 1, and x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, where (x1, y1) is on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit involved. Maybe we can express x1 and y1 in terms of x2 and y2.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: since the diagonals are perpendicular, and the rhombus is formed by two points A and B on the hyperbola, with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin and perpendicular.\n\nWait, so maybe we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that the vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but OA is vector (x1, y1), OB is vector (x2, y2), and their dot product is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0, as per before.\n\nSo, points A and B lie on the hyperbola and are such that OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nSo, the condition is that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors.\n\nSo, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nSo, given that, we can perhaps express y1 in terms of x1, and y2 in terms of x2, and then use the orthogonality condition.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use parametric equations for the hyperbola.\n\nLet me think: the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWe can parametrize it using hyperbola functions.\n\nLet me set x1 = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y1 = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, x2 = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, y2 = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nThen, the condition OA \u00b7 OB = 0 is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSubstituting, we get:\n\nsqrt(20) sec\u03b8 * sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 * sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's the equation we have.\n\nLet me write sec\u03b8 as 1/cos\u03b8, tan\u03b8 as sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8.\n\nSo, 5*(1/cos\u03b8)(1/cos\u03c6) + 6*(sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6/cos\u03c6) = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n5 + 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0.\n\nTherefore,\n\n6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5.\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 have a product of -5/6.\n\nBut we need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nExpressed in terms of \u03c6.\n\nBecause x2 = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, y2 = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut sec\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6, so substitute:\n\n= 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= 20 + 20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) = 4*(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, x2\u00b2 = 20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 = 20 + (20/24) y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2) = 80 + (44/6)y2\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nBut we have the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut since we have expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of y2\u00b2, perhaps we can relate y2\u00b2 to \u03b8 or \u03c6.\n\nWait, y2 = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 = 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)(24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut we also have the condition from earlier: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we can find tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8 or something else.\n\nWait, let's think.\n\nWe have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03c6 = 25/36.\n\nAlso, from the hyperbola parametrization, we have:\n\nx1 = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8,\n\nso cos\u03b8 = sqrt(20)/x1,\n\nand sin\u03b8 = y1 / sqrt(24).\n\nSimilarly,\n\nsin\u03c6 = y2 / sqrt(24),\n\ncos\u03c6 = sqrt(20)/x2.\n\nWait, so:\n\nsin\u03b8 = y1 / sqrt(24),\n\nsin\u03c6 = y2 / sqrt(24),\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = (y1 y2) / (24) = -5/6.\n\nSo,\n\ny1 y2 = -5/6 * 24 = -20.\n\nSo, y1 y2 = -20.\n\nWait, that's a useful equation.\n\nSo, from the orthogonality condition, we get y1 y2 = -20.\n\nSo, we have another condition: y1 y2 = -20.\n\nSo, now, we can think of the rhombus as being constructed from points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) on the hyperbola, with y1 y2 = -20.\n\nSo, perhaps we can write BD\u00b2 in terms of y2.\n\nGiven that, BD\u00b2 is 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2, as above.\n\nBut let's see if we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of y2, given that y1 y2 = -20.\n\nFrom the hyperbola equation, x1\u00b2 = 20(1 + y1\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2 = 20(1 + y2\u00b2/24).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) = 4[20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2] = 4[20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2] = 80 + (44/6)y2\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nBut we have y1 y2 = -20.\n\nAnd from the hyperbola equation, y1\u00b2 = (x1\u00b2 - 20)*24.\n\nSimilarly, y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2 - 20)*24.\n\nBut perhaps we can express y1 in terms of y2.\n\nFrom y1 y2 = -20, we get y1 = -20 / y2.\n\nSo, plugging into the hyperbola equation for point A:\n\nx1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 = 20(1 + y1\u00b2 /24).\n\nSubstituting y1 = -20/y2,\n\nx1\u00b2 = 20[1 + ( (-20/y2)^2 ) /24 ] = 20[1 + (400)/(24 y2\u00b2) ) ] = 20[1 + (50)/(3 y2\u00b2)].\n\nSimilarly, for point B,\n\nx2\u00b2 = 20[1 + y2\u00b2 /24].\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 = 20[1 + 50/(3 y2\u00b2)].\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, x1\u00b2 must be positive, as is x2\u00b2.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWait, perhaps we can think of BD\u00b2 in terms of y2\u00b2, and relate it to y1\u00b2.\n\nBut y1\u00b2 = (400)/(y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, substitute into x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 = 20[1 + (50)/(3 y2\u00b2)].\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation, x1\u00b2 must be real, so the expression inside must be positive, which it is as long as y2\u00b2 is positive, which it is.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of y2\u00b2, and then find its minimum.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3) y2\u00b2.\n\nBut with y1 y2 = -20, and points A and B on the hyperbola, so we have constraints on y2\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find the range of possible y2\u00b2.\n\nGiven that y1 y2 = -20, and both y1 and y2 are real numbers.\n\nSo, y2 cannot be zero, as that would make y1 undefined.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 must be positive.\n\nBut what's the minimum value of y2\u00b2?\n\nWait, but we also have points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, for point A, y1\u00b2 must satisfy y1\u00b2 = (x1\u00b2 -20)*24.\n\nBut x1\u00b2 must be greater than or equal to 20 because the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so x\u00b2 >=20.\n\nSo, y1\u00b2 = 24*(x1\u00b2/20 -1) = (24/20)x1\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)x1\u00b2 -24.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, y2\u00b2 = (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nBut since y1 y2 = -20, then y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 = 400.\n\nSo, [(6/5)x1\u00b2 -24][(6/5)x2\u00b2 -24] = 400.\n\nBut x1\u00b2 and x2\u00b2 are related via the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular and the product of the slopes is -1.\n\nBut since the diagonals are AC and BD, with AC from A(x1, y1) to C(-x1, -y1), so the slope of AC is (-y1 - y1)/(-x1 - x1) = (-2y1)/(-2x1) = y1/x1.\n\nSimilarly, BD is from B(x2, y2) to D(-x2, -y2), so its slope is (-y2 - y2)/(-x2 - x2) = (-2y2)/(-2x2) = y2/x2.\n\nSince the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.\n\nWhich gives y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nWait, that's a key equation.\n\nSo, from perpendicularity, we have y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nBut earlier, from the dot product condition, we had x1 x2 + y1 y2 =0.\n\nWait, so substituting y1 y2 = -x1 x2 into the equation x1x2 + y1y2=0:\n\nx1 x2 + (-x1 x2) = 0.\n\nWhich is 0=0.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, that doesn't give us new information.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWe have points A and B on the hyperbola, such that OA is perpendicular to OB.\n\nWe can parametrize A and B such that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nWe can perhaps use coordinates (x, y) and (-ky, kx) for some k, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we can write the coordinates of B in terms of A.\n\nSince OA is perpendicular to OB, then the coordinates of B can be written as (-k y1, k x1) for some scalar k.\n\nWait, because if OA is (x1, y1), then a vector perpendicular to OA is (-y1, x1) or (y1, -x1). So, scaled by a scalar k.\n\nBut since B lies on the hyperbola, which is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, if B is (a, b), then a = -k y1, b = k x1.\n\nThen, a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(k\u00b2 y1\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 x1\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 [ y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 ] =1.\n\nBut from point A, x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1.\n\nSo, let's denote S = x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1.\n\nThen, the expression inside the bracket for B is y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 = - (x1\u00b2 /24 - y1\u00b2 /20) = ?\n\nWait,\n\nCompute y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24:\n\n= (y1\u00b2 /20) - (x1\u00b2 /24)\n\n= ( (y1\u00b2 * 3) - (x1\u00b2 *5) ) /60\n\nWait, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, since x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1,\n\nThen, y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 = (y1\u00b2 /20) - (x1\u00b2 /24).\n\nBut that's not directly expressible in terms of S.\n\nWait, perhaps let's compute it.\n\nMultiply both sides of S =1 by 24*20 = 480:\n\n24 x1\u00b2 -20 y1\u00b2 =480.\n\nSo,\n\n24 x1\u00b2 -20 y1\u00b2 =480.\n\nThen, the expression [ y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 ] is:\n\n= (y1\u00b2 * 24 - x1\u00b2 *20 ) / (20*24)\n\n= (24 y1\u00b2 -20 x1\u00b2)/480\n\n= -(20 x1\u00b2 -24 y1\u00b2)/480\n\n= -480 /480\n\n= -1.\n\nSo, the expression y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 = -1.\n\nSo, going back,\n\nk\u00b2 [ -1 ] =1.\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 = -1.\n\nWait, that's not possible because k\u00b2 cannot be negative.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the coordinates.\n\nWait, if OA is (x1, y1), then a perpendicular vector would be (-y1, x1). But since B must lie on the hyperbola, we set B as ( -k y1, k x1 ), but this leads to k\u00b2 (-1) =1, which is impossible.\n\nWait, but that suggests that such points A and B cannot exist, which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that such a rhombus exists.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates of B should be (k y1, -k x1) instead.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nSo, if OA is (x1, y1), then a perpendicular vector is (y1, -x1). So, scaled by k, we have (k y1, -k x1).\n\nThen, point B is (k y1, -k x1).\n\nThen, substituting into the hyperbola equation:\n\n(k y1)^2 /20 - (-k x1)^2 /24 =1.\n\nWhich is (k\u00b2 y1\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 x1\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nFactor out k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 [ y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 ] =1.\n\nAgain, [ y1\u00b2 /20 - x1\u00b2 /24 ] is equal to -1 as before.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 (-1) =1 => k\u00b2= -1.\n\nAgain, impossible.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So, this suggests that my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not use this parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that points A and B are such that OA is perpendicular to OB, so the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nSo, if A is (x1, y1), then the slope of OA is y1/x1.\n\nSimilarly, the slope of OB is y2/x2.\n\nSo, (y1/x1)*(y2/x2) = -1.\n\nThus, y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nWhich is consistent with our earlier finding.\n\nSo, we have two conditions:\n\n1. x1x2 + y1y2 = 0 (from perpendicular diagonals).\n\n2. y1 y2 = -x1 x2 (from perpendicularity of OA and OB).\n\nWait, substituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nx1 x2 + (-x1 x2) =0.\n\nWhich simplifies to 0=0. So, both conditions are the same.\n\nWhich suggests that any points A and B on the hyperbola with OA perpendicular to OB will satisfy the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but then in that case, the only condition is y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nSo, with that in mind, perhaps we can proceed.\n\nSo, we have points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) on the hyperbola, with y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2).\n\nSo, to find the minimum BD\u00b2, we can write BD\u00b2 in terms of x2 and y2, and use the hyperbola equation and the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2.\n\nBut since y1 y2 = -x1 x2, we can write y1 = -x1 x2 / y2.\n\nSubstituting into the hyperbola equation for point A:\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - ( (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 ) / y2\u00b2 ) /24 =1.\n\nMultiply through by 24 y2\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n12 y2\u00b2 x1\u00b2 - x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 =24 y2\u00b2.\n\nFactor x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 (12 y2\u00b2 - x2\u00b2 ) =24 y2\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 = (24 y2\u00b2 ) / (12 y2\u00b2 -x2\u00b2 ).\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point B:\n\nx2\u00b2 /20 - y2\u00b2 /24 =1.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 =20(1 + y2\u00b2 /24 )=20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 =20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting into x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 = (24 y2\u00b2 ) / [12 y2\u00b2 - (20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 ) ].\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n12 y2\u00b2 -20 - (5/6)y2\u00b2 = (12 -5/6)y2\u00b2 -20 = (72/6 -5/6)y2\u00b2 -20 = (67/6)y2\u00b2 -20.\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 = (24 y2\u00b2 ) / [ (67/6)y2\u00b2 -20 ].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 6 to eliminate fractions:\n\nx1\u00b2 = (24 y2\u00b2 *6 ) / [67 y2\u00b2 -120 ] = (144 y2\u00b2 ) / (67 y2\u00b2 -120 ).\n\nBut x1\u00b2 must be positive because it's a square of a real number.\n\nSo, the denominator must be positive as well, since y2\u00b2 is positive.\n\nTherefore,\n\n67 y2\u00b2 -120 >0 => y2\u00b2 >120/67 \u2248 1.791.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 must be greater than approximately 1.791.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of y2\u00b2 is 120/67.\n\nWait, that might be the minimal value.\n\nWait, but can y2\u00b2 be equal to 120/67?\n\nIf so, then when y2\u00b2 =120/67, the denominator becomes zero, which would make x1\u00b2 undefined.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2 must be greater than 120/67.\n\nSo, the minimal value of y2\u00b2 is 120/67, approached as y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67 from above.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is when y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )=4[20 + (5/6)y2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ]=4[20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, as y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67, BD\u00b2 approaches 4[20 + (11/6)*(120/67)].\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nCompute (11/6)*(120/67):\n\n11/6 *120/67 = (11*120)/(6*67) = (1320)/(402) = 1320 \u00f7 6 =220; 402 \u00f76=67. So, 220/67.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 approaches 4[20 + 220/67] =4[ (20*67 +220)/67 ].\n\nCompute numerator: 20*67=1340; 1340 +220=1560.\n\nSo,\n\n4*(1560/67) = (4*1560)/67 =6240/67.\n\nCompute that: 67*93=6231, 6240-6231=9, so 93 + 9/67=93.134...\n\nWait, but 6240 \u00f767:\n\n67*93=6231,\n\n6240-6231=9,\n\nSo, 6240/67=93 +9/67= approx93.134.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 approaches 6240/67 as y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67 from above, which is approximately93.134.\n\nBut is this the minimal BD\u00b2? Wait, but when y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67, BD\u00b2 approaches6240/67, but is this the minimal value?\n\nWait, no, because when y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67, x1\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, because when y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67, denominator in x1\u00b2 approaches zero, so x1\u00b2 becomes very large.\n\nWhich would mean that point A is going off to infinity on the hyperbola.\n\nBut the problem says that points A,B,C,D are on the hyperbola, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nBut as the points go to infinity, the rhombus becomes very large.\n\nWait, but we are to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, so the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, perhaps 6240/67 is the infimum.\n\nWait, but 6240/67 is approximately93.134.\n\nBut let me check the computation again.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4[20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2 ].\n\nSo, as y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67,\n\nBD\u00b2 approaches4[20 + (11/6)*(120/67)].\n\nCompute (11/6)*(120/67):\n\n11/6 *120/67= (11*120)/(6*67)= (1320)/(402)= 220/67.\n\nSo,\n\n4[20 +220/67] =4[ (20*67 +220)/67 ].\n\nCompute 20*67=1340.\n\n1340 +220=1560.\n\nSo, 4*(1560/67)=6240/67.\n\nYes, 6240 divided by 67 is indeed 93 and 9/67.\n\nSo, 6240/67=93 +9/67=93.134328...\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 6240/67 as y2\u00b2 approaches 120/67 from above.\n\nBut can BD\u00b2 actually be equal to 6240/67? Or is it just approached asymptotically?\n\nSince when y2\u00b2 =120/67, the denominator in x1\u00b2 is zero, which would require x1\u00b2 to be infinity, which isn't possible for finite points.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 6240/67, but can't actually reach it.\n\nHence, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 6240/67.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the infimum, which is 6240/67.\n\nBut let me see if this fraction can be simplified.\n\nCompute GCD of 6240 and67.\n\n67 is a prime number.\n\nCheck if 67 divides 6240.\n\n67*93=6231, 6240-6231=9, so 67 doesn't divide into 6240 exactly. So, the fraction is irreducible.\n\nSo, 6240/67 is the infimum.\n\nBut let me compute 6240 /67.\n\nCompute 67*93=6231, as above.\n\n6240-6231=9.\n\nSo, 6240/67=93 +9/67.\n\nSo, 93.134328...\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 6240/67, so the answer is 6240/67.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2) subject to the hyperbola equation x2\u00b2/20 - y2\u00b2/24=1 and the condition y1 y2 = -x1 x2, where x1\u00b2/20 - y1\u00b2/24=1.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write BD\u00b2 in terms of y2\u00b2, and find its minimum.\n\nEarlier, we found that BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)=4*(20 + (11/6)y2\u00b2)=80 + (22/3)y2\u00b2.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize y2\u00b2.\n\nBut y2\u00b2 cannot be less than 120/67, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 80 + (22/3)*(120/67).\n\nCompute that:\n\n22/3 *120/67= (22*120)/(3*67)= (2640)/(201)=880/67.\n\nSo, 80 +880/67= (80*67 +880)/67= (5360 +880)/67=6240/67.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 6240/67.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 6240/67.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all rhombi \\( ABCD \\) inscribed in the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. \n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**: The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. A rhombus has equal sides and perpendicular diagonals intersecting at the midpoint.\n\n2. **Coordinates of Points**: Points \\( A, B, C, D \\) are on the hyperbola with diagonals \\( AC \\) and \\( BD \\) intersecting at the origin. Thus, if \\( A = (x_1, y_1) \\), then \\( C = (-x_1, -y_1) \\), and similarly for \\( B \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The diagonals are perpendicular, implying \\( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\( BD^2 \\)**: The length of diagonal \\( BD \\) is \\( 2\\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} \\), so \\( BD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \\).\n\n5. **Hyperbola Constraint**: For point \\( B \\), \\( \\frac{x_2^2}{20} - \\frac{y_2^2}{24} = 1 \\), leading to \\( x_2^2 = 20 + \\frac{5}{6}y_2^2 \\).\n\n6. **Minimizing \\( BD^2 \\)**: Substituting \\( x_2^2 \\) into \\( BD^2 \\), we get \\( BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{22}{3}y_2^2 \\). To minimize \\( BD^2 \\), \\( y_2^2 \\) must be minimized.\n\n7. **Minimum \\( y_2^2 \\)**: Using the condition \\( y_1y_2 = -20 \\) and the hyperbola equation, it is found that the minimum \\( y_2^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{120}{67} \\).\n\n8. **Final Calculation**: Substituting \\( y_2^2 = \\frac{120}{67} \\) into \\( BD^2 \\), we get \\( BD^2 = \\frac{6240}{67} \\).\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\( BD^2 \\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{6240}{67}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me about hyperbolas and rhombuses. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:\n\n\"Let \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) be points on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) such that \\(ABCD\\) is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So we have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi. That is, I need the infimum of \\(BD^2\\) or something? Wait, no, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi. So maybe it's the minimum possible value of \\(BD^2\\), but since it's the greatest number less than all such \\(BD^2\\), I think I need the infimum, but perhaps more accurately, the lower bound.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. It says, \"the greatest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\" So I'm looking for some number \\(L\\) such that \\(BD^2 > L\\) for all such rhombi, and \\(L\\) is the largest such number. So essentially, the infimum of \\(BD^2\\) is \\(L\\), and \\(BD^2\\) is always greater than \\(L\\). So I need to find the infimum of \\(BD^2\\), which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nAlright, let me start by recalling some properties. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, not necessarily right angles, but they do bisect each other. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense.\n\nGiven that, the diagonals of the rhombus are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So in this case, the diagonals would be \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\). The intersection point is the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, if \\(A\\) is a point on the hyperbola, then \\(C\\) must be the diametrically opposite point, such that the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are points such that their midpoint is also the origin.\n\nSo, if \\(A = (x, y)\\), then \\(C = (-x, -y)\\). Similarly, if \\(B = (u, v)\\), then \\(D = (-u, -v)\\).\n\nNow, since \\(ABCD\\) is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal: \\(AB = BC = CD = DA\\).\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, wait. A rhombus is a special case of a parallelogram where all sides are equal, and in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So yes, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSo, in this case, the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular.\n\nSo, given that, let's model the points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\).\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are opposite vertices, their coordinates are \\((x, y)\\) and \\((-x, -y)\\). Similarly, \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are \\((u, v)\\) and \\((-u, -v)\\).\n\nNow, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors along the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) must be perpendicular. The vector \\(AC\\) is \\((-2x, -2y)\\), and vector \\(BD\\) is \\((-2u, -2v)\\). The dot product of these vectors should be zero.\n\nSo, \\((-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0\\)\n\nSimplifying, \\(4xu + 4yv = 0\\), divide both sides by 4: \\(xu + yv = 0\\). So, the dot product of vectors \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) is zero, meaning vectors \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are perpendicular.\n\nWait, \\(OA\\) is the vector from origin to \\(A\\), which is \\((x, y)\\), and \\(OB\\) is \\((u, v)\\). So, their dot product is zero, so they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the hyperbola, and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nAlso, since \\(ABCD\\) is a rhombus, the lengths of the sides must be equal. So, \\(AB = BC = CD = DA\\).\n\nLet me compute the lengths.\n\nFirst, compute \\(AB\\). The distance between \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(B = (u, v)\\) is:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(BC\\) is the distance between \\(B = (u, v)\\) and \\(C = (-x, -y)\\):\n\n\\[\nBC = \\sqrt{(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(AB = BC\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2} = \\sqrt{(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(x\u00b2 - 2xu + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yv + v\u00b2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(x\u00b2 + 2xu + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yv + v\u00b2\\)\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n\\( (x\u00b2 + 2xu + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2yv + v\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 - 2xu + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2yv + v\u00b2) \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\(4xu + 4yv = 0\\)\n\nWhich brings us back to \\(xu + yv = 0\\), which is consistent with the perpendicularity condition we had earlier.\n\nSo, the condition \\(AB = BC\\) is equivalent to \\(xu + yv = 0\\), which is already satisfied because the diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nSo, perhaps I don't get any new information from equating \\(AB = BC\\); it's redundant because of the perpendicularity.\n\nSo, maybe I need another condition.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the property that all sides are equal. So, \\(AB = AD\\).\n\nWait, \\(AD\\) is the distance between \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(D = (-u, -v)\\):\n\n\\[\nAD = \\sqrt{(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(AB\\) is \\(\\sqrt{(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2}\\)\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2} = \\sqrt{(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2}\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same as \\(AB = BC\\), so again, same condition.\n\nSo, it seems that the condition of the rhombus is equivalent to the diagonals being perpendicular and passing through the origin.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that all four points lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, points \\(A = (x, y)\\), \\(B = (u, v)\\), \\(C = (-x, -y)\\), \\(D = (-u, -v)\\) lie on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\nSo, plugging in \\(A\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\(B\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{u^2}{20} - \\frac{v^2}{24} = 1\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are perpendicular, so:\n\n\\[\nxu + yv = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{u^2}{20} - \\frac{v^2}{24} = 1\\)\n3. \\(xu + yv = 0\\)\n\nBut since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are arbitrary points on the hyperbola with perpendicular vectors, perhaps I can parameterize them.\n\nMaybe using parametric equations for hyperbola.\n\nThe standard hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\) can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions:\n\n\\(x = a \\cosh \\theta\\), \\(y = b \\sinh \\theta\\)\n\nAlternatively, using rational parameterization, but hyperbolic functions might be more straightforward here.\n\nSo, let me set:\n\n\\(x = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta\\)\n\n\\(y = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta = 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\theta\\)\n\nSimilarly, since \\(B\\) is another point on the hyperbola, let me parametrize it as:\n\n\\(u = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi = \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi\\)\n\n\\(v = \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi = 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\phi\\)\n\nWait, but since \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are perpendicular, their dot product is zero:\n\n\\(xu + yv = 0\\)\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta \\cdot \\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi + 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\theta \\cdot 2\\sqrt{6} \\sinh \\phi = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\). Let's write it as:\n\n\\[\n20 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 24 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0\n\\]\n\nI can factor out a common factor of 4:\n\n\\[\n4 (5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi) = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n5 \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi + 6 \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write this in terms of hyperbolic identities.\n\nRecall that \\(\\cosh(\\theta - \\phi) = \\cosh \\theta \\cosh \\phi - \\sinh \\theta \\sinh \\phi\\), but that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can manipulate the equation:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 = -6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6) / (cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6) = -6 tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6\n\nSo:\n\n5 = -6 tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6\n\nWhich gives:\n\ntanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, okay. So, the product of the hyperbolic tangents is -5/6.\n\nI need to find all possible such \u03b8 and \u03c6 that satisfy this, but perhaps I can express one in terms of the other.\n\nLet me denote t = tanh\u03b8, and s = tanh\u03c6.\n\nSo, ts = -5/6.\n\nI can express tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t).\n\nBut, given that tanh is bounded between -1 and 1, so for the equation to hold, both t and s must be such that their product is -5/6.\n\nWhich implies that both t and s must have absolute values less than or equal to 1. So, 5/6 is less than 1, so t can be any value except zero, but s would have to be -5/(6t), and the condition is that |s| \u2264 1.\n\nSo, |s| = | -5/(6t) | = 5/(6|t|) \u22641\n\nWhich implies that 5/(6|t|) \u22641 \u2192 6|t| \u22655 \u2192 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, |t| \u22655/6. Therefore, |tanh\u03b8| \u22655/6. Since 5/6 is approximately 0.833, which is less than 1, this is possible.\n\nSo, tanh\u03b8 must be \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6.\n\nSimilarly, tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t), so if t is positive, s is negative, and vice versa.\n\nBut since tanh is an odd function, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, so \u03b8 >0, and hence tanh\u03b8 positive, and then \u03c6 will have tanh negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express variables in terms of \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps if I let the vectors OA and OB be perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1.\n\nGiven that OA has a slope of (y/x), and OB has a slope of (v/u).\n\nSo, (y/x)(v/u) = -1.\n\nSo, (yv)/(xu) = -1 \u2192 yv = -xu.\n\nWhich is the same as xu + yv =0, which is equation 3.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use the parametrization:\n\nLet\u2019s denote point A as (\u221a20 cosh\u03b8, \u221a24 sinh\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, point B as (\u221a20 cosh\u03c6, \u221a24 sinh\u03c6)\n\nThen, from xu + yv =0:\n\n\u221a20 cosh\u03b8 * \u221a20 cosh\u03c6 + \u221a24 sinh\u03b8 * \u221a24 sinh\u03c6 =0\n\nWhich is 20 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + 24 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, maybe I can write this as:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 +6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0\n\nAs I did earlier.\n\nWhich leads to 5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 = -6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6\n\nDivide both sides by cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 (sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6)/(cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6) = -6 tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6\n\nSo, tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nSo, that's the key equation.\n\nSo, now, perhaps I can express tanh\u03c6 in terms of tanh\u03b8.\n\nLet me let t = tanh\u03b8, then tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t)\n\nBut since tanh\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, we have:\n\n-1 \u2264 -5/(6t) \u22641\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-5/(6t) \u2265 -1 \u2192 -5/(6t) \u2265 -1\n\nMultiply both sides by 6t, but considering the sign.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the two cases when t is positive and when t is negative.\n\nCase 1: t >0.\n\nThen, tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t) must satisfy |tanh\u03c6| \u22641.\n\nSo, | -5/(6t) | \u22641 \u2192 5/(6t) \u22641 \u2192 t \u22655/6.\n\nSo, tanh\u03b8 \u22655/6.\n\nSimilarly, for t <0.\n\nCase 2: t <0.\n\nThen, tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t) must satisfy |tanh\u03c6| \u22641.\n\nSo, 5/(6|t|) \u22641 \u2192 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, in either case, |t| \u22655/6.\n\nSo, tanh\u03b8 is either \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 is such that tanh\u03b8 is outside [-1, 1], but wait, tanh\u03b8 is always between -1 and 1, so 5/6 is approximately 0.833, which is within the range.\n\nSo, okay, proceeding.\n\nSo, we have that tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t).\n\nBut since t = tanh\u03b8, and s = tanh\u03c6, and s = -5/(6t).\n\nSo, perhaps, I can express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8 or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of sin and cos, but with hyperbolic functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of t, which is tanh\u03b8.\n\nSo, let me denote t = tanh\u03b8.\n\nThen, tanh\u03c6 = -5/(6t) = s.\n\nSo, s = -5/(6t)\n\nNow, perhaps I can express cosh\u03b8 and sinh\u03b8 in terms of t.\n\nWe have:\n\ncosh\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nsinh\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, for \u03c6:\n\ncosh\u03c6 = 1 / sqrt(1 - s\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 t\u00b2))\n\nWait, because s = -5/(6t), so s\u00b2 = 25/(36 t\u00b2)\n\nSo, cosh\u03c6 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 25/(36 t\u00b2)) = 1 / sqrt( (36 t\u00b2 -25)/(36 t\u00b2) ) = (6 |t|)/sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u03c6 = s / sqrt(1 - s\u00b2) = (-5/(6t)) / sqrt(1 - 25/(36 t\u00b2)) ) = (-5/(6t)) / ( sqrt( (36 t\u00b2 -25)/36 t\u00b2 )) )\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nsqrt( (36 t\u00b2 -25)/(36 t\u00b2) ) ) = sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)/(6 |t| )\n\nSo, sinh\u03c6 = (-5/(6t)) / ( sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)/(6 |t| )) )\n\n= (-5/(6t)) * (6 |t| / sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-5 |t| ) / (t sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25))\n\nBut t is from |t| \u22655/6. Let's consider t positive first, so t = |t|.\n\nSo, t >0, so |t|=t.\n\nSo, sinh\u03c6 = (-5 t ) / (t sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)) ) = -5 / sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u03c6 = -5 / sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, now, we can write expressions for cosh\u03b8, sinh\u03b8, cosh\u03c6, sinh\u03c6 in terms of t.\n\nNow, let me recall the hyperbola equation for points A and B.\n\nWe have:\n\nPoint A: (x, y) = (\u221a20 cosh\u03b8, \u221a24 sinh\u03b8)\nPoint B: (u, v) = (\u221a20 cosh\u03c6, \u221a24 sinh\u03c6)\n\nWe need to compute BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B to D, and D is (-u, -v). So, BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nWait, no, BD is the diagonal, so it's from B to D, which is from (u, v) to (-u, -v). So, the length BD is the distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v).\n\nThe distance between (u, v) and (-u, -v) is:\n\nsqrt[ (u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ (2u)\u00b2 + (2v)\u00b2 ] = 2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2 sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2))\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, since u = \u221a20 cosh\u03c6, v = \u221a24 sinh\u03c6,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6 )\n\n= 80 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +96 sinh\u00b2\u03c6\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of t.\n\nSo, from earlier, we have expressions for cosh\u03c6 and sinh\u03c6 in terms of t.\n\ncosh\u03c6 = (6 t)/sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nsinh\u03c6 = -5/sqrt(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = (36 t\u00b2)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nsinh\u00b2\u03c6 = 25/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, substituting into u\u00b2 + v\u00b2:\n\n20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6 = 20*(36 t\u00b2)/(36 t\u00b2 -25) +24*(25)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\n= [20*36 t\u00b2 +24*25]/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20*36 t\u00b2 = 720 t\u00b2\n\n24*25 = 600\n\nSo numerator =720 t\u00b2 +600\n\nDenominator=36 t\u00b2 -25\n\nSo, u\u00b2 +v\u00b2= (720 t\u00b2 +600)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2=4*(720 t\u00b2 +600)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n720 t\u00b2 +600 = 120*(6 t\u00b2 +5)\n\nDenominator:36 t\u00b2 -25 = (6 t)^2 -5\u00b2 = (6 t -5)(6 t +5)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(120*(6 t\u00b2 +5)) / (36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\n= 480*(6 t\u00b2 +5)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nHmm, let me see if I can simplify further.\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\n6 t\u00b2 +5 and 36 t\u00b2 -25.\n\nNote that 36 t\u00b2 -25 = (6t -5)(6t +5), and 6 t\u00b2 +5 doesn't factor as nicely.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express 6t\u00b2 +5 as (36 t\u00b2 -25) * something + remainder.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express BD\u00b2 as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(6t\u00b2 +5)/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(6t\u00b2 +5)/(36t\u00b2 -25) = 480*( (6t\u00b2 -25 +30)/(36t\u00b2 -25) )\n\n= 480*[ (6t\u00b2 -25)/(36t\u00b2 -25) + 30/(36t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\n= 480*[ 1/6 + 30/(36t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 6t\u00b2 +5 = (6t\u00b2 -25) +30\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 480 * [ (6t\u00b2 -25 +30)/(36t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\n= 480 * [ (6t\u00b2 -25)/(36t\u00b2 -25) + 30/(36t\u00b2 -25) ]\n\nBut (6t\u00b2 -25)/(36t\u00b2 -25) = (6t\u00b2 -25)/( (6t)^2 -5^2 )\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write BD\u00b2 in terms of t.\n\nLet me denote t as a variable where |t| \u22655/6, and t is in (-1,1). So, t ranges from 5/6 to 1 and from -1 to -5/6.\n\nBut since BD\u00b2 is symmetric in t and -t, because t is squared in BD\u00b2, we can consider t \u22655/6.\n\nSo, let me define t \u2208 [5/6,1).\n\nSo, let me write BD\u00b2 = 480*(6t\u00b2 +5)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2 as a function of t, say f(t) = (6t\u00b2 +5)/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, f(t) = (6t\u00b2 +5)/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nI can write this as:\n\nf(t) = [6t\u00b2 +5] / [36t\u00b2 -25] = [6t\u00b2 +5] / [ (6t)^2 -5^2 ]\n\nWhich can be expressed as:\n\nf(t) = [6t\u00b2 +5]/[ (6t -5)(6t +5) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform partial fraction decomposition.\n\nLet me assume that:\n\n(6t\u00b2 +5)/( (6t -5)(6t +5) ) = A/(6t -5) + B/(6t +5)\n\nMultiply both sides by (6t -5)(6t +5):\n\n6t\u00b2 +5 = A(6t +5) + B(6t -5)\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n= (6A +6B) t + (5A -5B)\n\nSet coefficients equal:\n\n6t\u00b2 +5 = (6A +6B) t + (5A -5B)\n\nWait, but the left side is a quadratic, and the right side is linear. That doesn't make sense. So, maybe partial fractions isn't the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express f(t) as:\n\nf(t) = [6t\u00b2 +5]/[36t\u00b2 -25] = [ (36t\u00b2 -25) + 30 ] / [36t\u00b2 -25]\n\n= 1 + 30/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nAh, that's a useful decomposition.\n\nSo, f(t) = 1 + 30/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =480*f(t) =480*(1 +30/(36t\u00b2 -25)) =480 + 480*30/(36t\u00b2 -25) =480 + 14400/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =480 + 14400/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nNow, let me denote z =36t\u00b2 -25\n\nSince t \u22655/6,\n\nz =36t\u00b2 -25 \u226536*(25/36) -25 =25 -25=0\n\nWait, when t=5/6, z=0.\n\nBut as t approaches 1, z approaches 36*1 -25=11.\n\nSo, z \u2208 [0,11)\n\nBut wait, when t=5/6, z=0, which makes BD\u00b2 undefined as 14400/0 is infinity.\n\nSo, as t approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches 1, z approaches 36*1 -25=11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 +14400/11\u2248480 +1309.09\u22481789.09.\n\nWait, but we are to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large (as t approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity), but as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches approximately 1789.09.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if t approaches 5/6, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, but as t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches a finite limit.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is the limit as t approaches 1 from below, which is 480 +14400/11.\n\nBut let me compute that exactly.\n\nCompute 14400 /11:\n\n14400 \u00f711=1309 and 1/11 (since 11*1309=14399, and 14400-14399=1).\n\nSo, 14400/11=1309 +1/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 +1309 +1/11=1789 +1/11\u22481789.0909.\n\nWait, but hold on. Because as t increases from 5/6 to1, z=36t\u00b2-25 increases from 0 to 11.\n\nSo, 14400/(36t\u00b2 -25) decreases from infinity to 14400/11.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 =480 + 14400/(36t\u00b2 -25) decreases from infinity to 480 +14400/11.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480 +14400/11.\n\nBut wait, is that the minimal value? Because BD\u00b2 can be as large as we want, but as t approaches 5/6, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480 +14400/11, and it's the smallest value that BD\u00b2 can take.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is equal to 480 +14400/(36t\u00b2 -25). Now, as t approaches 5/6 from above, 36t\u00b2-25 approaches 0, so 14400/(36t\u00b2-25) approaches +infinity, so BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t approaches 1 from below, 36t\u00b2-25 approaches 11, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 +14400/11\u22481789.09.\n\nBut, can BD\u00b2 be smaller than that?\n\nWait, for t>5/6, so z=36t\u00b2-25>0, so 14400/z is positive, so BD\u00b2 =480 + positive term. So, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is when 14400/z is minimized, which is when z is maximized.\n\nWait, z=36t\u00b2-25 can be as large as possible when t approaches 1, but for t beyond 1, but wait, t is tanh\u03b8, which is bounded by 1.\n\nWait, actually, t can't exceed 1 because tanh\u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity. So, z=36t\u00b2-25 is in [0, 36*1 -25)= [0,11).\n\nThus, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 480 +14400/11, approximately 1789.09, and it can be made larger by choosing t closer to 5/6, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be as small as (480 +14400/11), which is 480 +1309 and 1/11, which is 1789 and 1/11.\n\nBut the problem says, \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 480 +14400/11, which is exactly (480*11 +14400)/11= (5280 +14400)/11=19680/11.\n\nWait, 480*11=5280; 5280 +14400=19680.\n\nSo, 19680/11 is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 \u226519680/11.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 19680/11.\n\nBut wait, 19680 divided by 11 is:\n\n11*1789=19679, so 19680=11*1789 +1 \u219219680/11=1789 +1/11.\n\nSo, 1789 and 1/11 is the minimal value.\n\nSo, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, since BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 19680/11, then the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11.\n\nWait, but is 19680/11 attainable? Because when t approaches 1, BD\u00b2 approaches 19680/11, but does it ever actually reach that?\n\nWait, when t=1, z=36*1 -25=11, so BD\u00b2=480 +14400/11= (480*11 +14400)/11=(5280 +14400)/11=19680/11.\n\nSo, when t=1, which corresponds to tanh\u03b8=1, so \u03b8 approaches infinity.\n\nBut tanh\u03b8 approaches 1 as \u03b8 approaches infinity, so in the limit as \u03b8\u2192infty, we have t\u21921, and BD\u00b2 approaches 19680/11.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 19680/11, but can it actually reach it?\n\nWell, at t=1, which is \u03b8=\u221e, but that's not a real point, because hyperbolic functions are defined for all real \u03b8, but as \u03b8 approaches infinity, t approaches 1.\n\nSo, in reality, BD\u00b2 approaches 19680/11 but never actually reaches it. So, BD\u00b2 is always greater than 19680/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11.\n\nBut let me confirm. Let's think about t=1.\n\nIf t=1, then tanh\u03b8=1, which implies \u03b8 approaches infinity.\n\nSo, point A would be (\u221a20 cosh\u03b8, \u221a24 sinh\u03b8), which as \u03b8\u2192infty, cosh\u03b8 ~ sinh\u03b8 ~ (e^\u03b8)/2.\n\nSo, x ~ \u221a20*(e^\u03b8)/2, y ~ \u221a24*(e^\u03b8)/2.\n\nSimilarly, point B would be (\u221a20 cosh\u03c6, \u221a24 sinh\u03c6), with tanh\u03c6= -5/(6*1)= -5/6.\n\nSo, tanh\u03c6= -5/6, which is a finite value, so \u03c6 is finite.\n\nSo, for point B, cosh\u03c6=1/sqrt(1 - (25/36))=1/sqrt(11/36)=6/sqrt(11)\n\nSimilarly, sinh\u03c6= (-5/6)/sqrt(1 -25/36)= (-5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (-5/6)*(6/sqrt(11))= -5/sqrt(11)\n\nSo, point B is (\u221a20*(6/sqrt(11)), \u221a24*(-5/sqrt(11)) )\n\n= (6\u221a20 / sqrt(11), -5\u221a24 / sqrt(11) )\n\nSo, that is a valid point on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, when t=1, we have a valid point B.\n\nWait, but when t=1, z=36*(1)^2 -25=11, so BD\u00b2=480 +14400/11=19680/11.\n\nSo, in that case, BD\u00b2=19680/11 is attainable when t=1.\n\nWait, but when t=1, \u03b8 approaches infinity, but \u03c6 is finite.\n\nSo, in that case, point A is at infinity, but point B is finite.\n\nBut then, the rhombus would have points A at infinity and B finite, but the rhombus would collapse in a sense.\n\nBut, given that, BD\u00b2=19680/11 is attainable when t=1.\n\nSo, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 19680/11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be equal to 19680/11 when t=1, so the number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be any number less than 19680/11.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 19680/11, but since BD\u00b2 can actually reach 19680/11, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 19680/11.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can be equal to 19680/11, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is just less than 19680/11.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If BD\u00b2 can be equal to 19680/11, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11 because for that particular rhombus, BD\u00b2=19680/11, so any number less than 19680/11 would not be the greatest, because 19680/11 is attainable.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 can be as low as 19680/11, then for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 \u226519680/11.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 19680/11.\n\nWait, but for some rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than 19680/11, but for at least one rhombus, BD\u00b2=19680/11.\n\nSo, the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 19680/11, because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is at least 19680/11.\n\nWait, yes, because if you take any number greater than 19680/11, say 19680/11 + \u03b5, then there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=19680/11) where BD\u00b2 <19680/11 + \u03b5. But since we need a number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, it can't exceed 19680/11 because for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=19680/11, any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for that rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 19680/11.\n\nSo, 19680 divided by11.\n\nCompute that:\n\n11*1789=19679, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, 19680=11*1789 +1 \u219219680/11=1789 +1/11=1789.090909...\n\nSo, the answer is 19680/11, which is 1789 and 1/11.\n\nThus, the final answer is 19680/11, which can be written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{19680}{11}}.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations, especially when I expressed BD\u00b2 as 4*(20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6). Let's verify that.\n\nBD is the distance between points B and D, which are (u, v) and (-u, -v). So, BD is sqrt( (u - (-u))\u00b2 + (v - (-v))\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 )=2*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2).\n\nSince u=\u221a20 cosh\u03c6, v=\u221a24 sinh\u03c6,\n\nu\u00b2 +v\u00b2=20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen, in terms of t, we had expressions for cosh\u03c6 and sinh\u03c6 in terms of t, which led to u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=(720 t\u00b2 +600)/(36 t\u00b2 -25)\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4*(720t\u00b2 +600)/(36t\u00b2 -25)=480*(6t\u00b2 +5)/(36t\u00b2 -25)\n\nWhich we expressed as 480 +14400/(36t\u00b2-25)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, when t=1, BD\u00b2=480 +14400/11= (480*11 +14400)/11= (5280 +14400)/11=19680/11.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) form a rhombus on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular, implying that vectors \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are perpendicular. \n\nParametrizing points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola using hyperbolic functions, we express their coordinates as \\(A = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\theta)\\) and \\(B = (\\sqrt{20} \\cosh \\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\sinh \\phi)\\). The condition of perpendicularity gives \\(xu + yv = 0\\), leading to the relation \\(\\tanh \\theta \\tanh \\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\nExpressing \\(\\tanh \\phi\\) in terms of \\(\\tanh \\theta\\) and substituting back, we derive the expression for \\(BD^2\\). After simplifications, we find that \\(BD^2 = 480 + \\frac{14400}{36t^2 - 25}\\), where \\(t = \\tanh \\theta\\). \n\nAnalyzing the behavior of \\(BD^2\\) as \\(t\\) approaches its limits, we determine that the minimum value of \\(BD^2\\) is \\(\\frac{19680}{11}\\), achieved when \\(t = 1\\). Therefore, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{19680}{11}}\\).",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've been given this problem where points A, B, C, D lie on a hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.\n\nFirst, I know that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. That's a key property. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is given, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. The hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening left and right since the positive term is with x\u00b2. The rhombus has diagonals intersecting at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are equal in length. Also, as diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so if I denote points A and C as being at (p, q) and (-p, -q) respectively, because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, points B and D would be at (r, s) and (-r, -s).\n\nWait, but since the rhombus is made up of points A, B, C, D, I need to arrange them in order such that the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.\n\nBut wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals aren't necessarily equal, but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, if points A and C are (p, q) and (-p, -q), then points B and D would be (r, s) and (-r, -s). But then, the four points would be A(p, q), B(r, s), C(-p, -q), D(-r, -s). Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance AB must equal BC, which equals CD, which equals DA.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the rhombus as two pairs of points symmetric about the origin, with the diagonals AC and BD. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, each bisected by the origin.\n\nSo, since points A and C are at opposite ends of a diagonal, their coordinates are (p, q) and (-p, -q). Similarly, points B and D are at (r, s) and (-r, -s).\n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, for point A: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSame for point C: (-p)\u00b2/20 - (-q)\u00b2/24 = p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1. So, same equation.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSame for point D: (-r)\u00b2/20 - (-s)\u00b2/24 = r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, all four points satisfy the same equation.\n\nNow, the rhombus condition. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, perhaps I can use vector methods.\n\nWait, another approach: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero.\n\nVector AC is from A to C, which is (-2p, -2q).\n\nVector BD is from B to D, which is (-2r, -2s).\n\nWait, no, vectors AC is (C - A) which is (-2p, -2q), and BD is (D - B) which is (-2r, -2s). But since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.\n\nWait, no, actually, the vectors representing the diagonals would be AC and BD. So, the vector AC is from A to C: (-2p, -2q). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D: (-2r, -2s). Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD, so their vectors would be AC and BD. So, the dot product is (-2p)(-2r) + (-2q)(-2s) = 4pr + 4qs. Since diagonals are perpendicular, this should equal zero.\n\nSo, 4pr + 4qs = 0 => pr + qs = 0.\n\nSo, equation (1): pr + qs = 0.\n\nAdditionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, the length of AB equals the length of BC, etc. Let's compute AB and BC.\n\nPoint A is (p, q), point B is (r, s). So, AB distance squared is (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2.\n\nPoint B is (r, s), point C is (-p, -q). So, BC distance squared is (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2.\n\nSince AB = BC, their squares are equal:\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (-p - r)^2 + (-q - s)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: (r - p)^2 = r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2, (s - q)^2 = s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2. So total: r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (-p - r)^2 = (p + r)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2. Similarly, (-q - s)^2 = (q + s)^2 = q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2. So total: p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2.\n\nSetting left equal to right:\n\n(r\u00b2 - 2pr + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2qs + q\u00b2) = (p\u00b2 + 2pr + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + 2qs + s\u00b2).\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2pr - 2qs.\n\nRight: p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + 2pr + 2qs.\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n0 = 4pr + 4qs.\n\nWhich gives pr + qs = 0, which is the same as equation (1). So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, that condition is already satisfied by the fact that diagonals are perpendicular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the vectors of the sides.\n\nAnother approach: since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude and should be perpendicular to each other.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but in a rhombus, adjacent sides are equal in length but not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the sides are equal, but the angles can vary. So, perhaps I need another condition.\n\nWait, perhaps since the rhombus is formed by the four points, the vectors AB and AD should be equal in length and should satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using parametric coordinates for the hyperbola.\n\nWait, hyperbola can be parameterized using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec \u03b8, b tan \u03b8). Alternatively, using hyperbola coordinates, another parametrization is (a cosh t, b sinh t) for one branch, and (-a cosh t, -b sinh t) for the other.\n\nBut since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps I can model points A and C as (p, q) and (-p, -q), and points B and D as (r, s) and (-r, -s). Then, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular.\n\nWait, but the sides of the rhombus would be AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to relate p, q, r, s through the rhombus conditions.\n\nWait, another thought: since the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps the rhombus can be considered as a product of two perpendicular lines through the origin, each intersecting the hyperbola at two points, which would be the endpoints of the diagonals.\n\nWait, but in that case, the diagonals would be the lines AC and BD, which are perpendicular. So, perhaps the lines can be represented as y = m x and y = -1/m x, since they are perpendicular.\n\nWait, so let's suppose that diagonal AC lies on the line y = m x, and diagonal BD lies on the line y = (-1/m) x, since they are perpendicular.\n\nThen, points A and C would lie on y = m x and satisfy the hyperbola equation. Similarly, points B and D would lie on y = (-1/m) x and satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, let's find points A and C on y = m x.\n\nSubstituting y = m x into the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 x\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) = 1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, y = m x, so points A and C would be at (x, m x) and (-x, -m x).\n\nSimilarly, for points B and D on y = (-1/m) x:\n\nSubstituting y = (-1/m) x into the hyperbola equation:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - ( ( (-1/m) x )\u00b2 ) /24 = 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2) = 1.\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)).\n\nOkay, so for each diagonal, we can find the points.\n\nBut wait, since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are the two lines y = m x and y = (-1/m) x, the points are determined by m.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides should be equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc. So, perhaps I can compute AB\u00b2 in terms of m and then set it equal to BC\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to compute the lengths of the diagonals. Wait, in a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. And the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals.\n\nWait, more accurately, in a rhombus, each side can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since the diagonals are perpendicular. So, if the diagonals are of lengths d1 and d2, then each side is sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ).\n\nSo, side length s = sqrt( (d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2)/4 ) = (1/2) sqrt(d1\u00b2 + d2\u00b2).\n\nSince all sides are equal, this gives a condition.\n\nBut perhaps I can express the side length in terms of the hyperbola parameters.\n\nWait, let me try to model this.\n\nSo, points A and C are on y = m x, at (x, m x) and (-x, -m x), where x\u00b2 = 1/(1/20 - m\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, points B and D are on y = (-1/m) x, at (y, (-1/m)y) and (-y, (1/m)y), where y\u00b2 = 1/(1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)).\n\nWait, but I can write x in terms of m, and y in terms of m.\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 and y\u00b2.\n\nx\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24).\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express this more neatly.\n\nLet me compute the denominator for x\u00b2:\n\nDenominator_x = 1/20 - m\u00b2/24 = (24 - 20 m\u00b2) / (20*24).\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = 1 / ( (24 - 20 m\u00b2)/(20*24) ) ) = (20*24)/(24 - 20 m\u00b2) ) = (480)/(24 - 20 m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, for y\u00b2, the denominator is 1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) = (24 m\u00b2 - 20)/(20 * 24 m\u00b2).\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 1 / ( (24 m\u00b2 - 20)/(20 * 24 m\u00b2) ) ) = (20*24 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 - 20) ) = (480 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 - 20).\n\nSo, x is sqrt(480/(24 - 20 m\u00b2)) and y is sqrt(480 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 - 20)). But since the hyperbola is symmetric, we can take positive roots without loss of generality.\n\nBut wait, for x\u00b2 and y\u00b2 to be real and positive, the denominators must be positive.\n\nSo, for x\u00b2: 24 - 20 m\u00b2 > 0 \u2192 20 m\u00b2 < 24 \u2192 m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5 \u2192 |m| < sqrt(6/5).\n\nSimilarly, for y\u00b2: 24 m\u00b2 - 20 > 0 \u2192 24 m\u00b2 > 20 \u2192 m\u00b2 > 20/24 = 5/6 \u2192 |m| > sqrt(5/6).\n\nSo, m must satisfy sqrt(5/6) < |m| < sqrt(6/5).\n\nHmm, interesting. So, m can't be just any slope; it has to lie between sqrt(5/6) and sqrt(6/5).\n\nNow, let's think about the rhombus. So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The lengths of these diagonals can be found.\n\nLength of AC is 2x, since from (x, m x) to (-x, -m x) is 2x in each coordinate. Similarly, length of BD is 2y, since from (y, (-1/m)y) to (-y, (1/m)y) is 2y.\n\nSo, AC = 2x, BD = 2y.\n\nIn a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2 = (2x * 2y)/2 = 2xy.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the sides of the rhombus can be found using the diagonals.\n\nAs I thought earlier, each side is (1/2) sqrt(AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2). So, side length s = (1/2) sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 ) = (1/2) sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4y\u00b2) = (1/2)*2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check:\n\nWait, in a rhombus, each side is equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ), where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. So, side length s = sqrt( (AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2 ).\n\nSo, AC is 2x, so AC/2 = x. Similarly, BD is 2y, so BD/2 = y. Thus, s = sqrt( x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nBut since all four points lie on the hyperbola, perhaps we can express s\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2 and y\u00b2, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful.\n\nWait, but let me compute s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nBut from earlier, x\u00b2 = 480/(24 - 20 m\u00b2), and y\u00b2 = (480 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 - 20).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = 480/(24 - 20 m\u00b2) + (480 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 - 20).\n\nLet me simplify this expression.\n\nNote that 24 m\u00b2 - 20 = 4*(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nSimilarly, 24 - 20 m\u00b2 = 4*(6 -5 m\u00b2).\n\nWait, maybe I can factor 480 as 480 = 48 * 10 = 16 * 30, but perhaps a better approach is to compute the two terms.\n\nLet me compute s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 480/(24 - 20 m\u00b2) + (480 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 - 20).\n\nNote that 24 m\u00b2 - 20 = -(20 - 24 m\u00b2) = -(20 - 24 m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, 24 - 20 m\u00b2 = 24 -20 m\u00b2.\n\nLet me write the denominators as follows:\n\nDenominator of first term: 24 - 20 m\u00b2.\n\nDenominator of second term: 24 m\u00b2 - 20 = 4*(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nWait, perhaps I can express both terms with a common denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to factor out 4 from both denominators.\n\nFirst term denominator: 24 -20 m\u00b2 = 4*(6 -5 m\u00b2).\n\nSecond term denominator: 24 m\u00b2 -20 = 4*(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = 480/(4*(6 -5 m\u00b2)) + (480 m\u00b2)/(4*(6 m\u00b2 -5)).\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n480/4 = 120, so first term becomes 120/(6 -5 m\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, second term becomes (120 m\u00b2)/(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5 m\u00b2) + 120 m\u00b2/(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nLet me write 6 m\u00b2 -5 as -(5 -6 m\u00b2) = -(5 -6 m\u00b2). Wait, but 6 m\u00b2 -5 = -(5 -6 m\u00b2) when 6 m\u00b2 <5, but since m\u00b2 >5/6 (from earlier), 6 m\u00b2 -5 is positive. So, 6 m\u00b2 -5 = (6 m\u00b2 -5), positive.\n\nSo, let me write the second term denominator as (6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5 m\u00b2) + (120 m\u00b2)/(6 m\u00b2 -5).\n\nNow, let's combine these terms.\n\nLet me denote u = m\u00b2, so that u >5/6 and u <6/5.\n\nThen, s\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5u) + 120 u/(6u -5).\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\ns\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5u) + (120u)/(6u -5).\n\nNote that 6u -5 = 6u -5, and 6 -5u = 6 -5u.\n\nI can write these denominators as:\n\n6 -5u = -(5u -6) = -(5u -6).\n\nSimilarly, 6u -5 = 6u -5.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the denominators.\n\nLet me compute s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 120/(6 -5u) + (120u)/(6u -5).\n\nLet me note that 6u -5 = 6u -5, and 6 -5u = 6 -5u.\n\nWait, let me get a common denominator for the two terms. The denominators are (6 -5u) and (6u -5). So, the common denominator would be (6 -5u)(6u -5).\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = [120*(6u -5) + 120u*(6 -5u)] / [(6 -5u)(6u -5)].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n120*(6u -5) + 120u*(6 -5u).\n\n= 720u - 600 + 720u - 600u\u00b2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n720u + 720u = 1440u.\n\n-600 remains.\n\n-600u\u00b2.\n\nSo numerator: -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600.\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nLet me factor out -600:\n\n= -600(u\u00b2 - (1440u)/600 + 1).\n\nWait, but 1440/600 = 2.4, which is 12/5.\n\nWait, let me compute it correctly:\n\n1440u /600 = (1440/600) u = 2.4 u.\n\nSimilarly, 600/600 =1.\n\nSo, numerator = -600(u\u00b2 - (12/5) u + 1).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to factor without factoring out the -600.\n\nBut perhaps I can factor the numerator as:\n\n-600u\u00b2 + 1440u -600.\n\nLet me factor out -60:\n\n= -60(10u\u00b2 -24u +10).\n\nWait, 10u\u00b2 -24u +10. Let me check if this factors:\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 10*10=100, and a + b = -24.\n\nWait, 10u\u00b2 -24u +10.\n\nLooking for factors of 10*10 = 100 that add up to -24.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's not factorable easily. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:\n\n10u\u00b2 -24u +10 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: u = [24 \u00b1 sqrt(576 - 400)]/(20) = [24 \u00b1 sqrt(176)]/20 = [24 \u00b1 4 sqrt(11)]/20 = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(11)]/5.\n\nHmm, so 10u\u00b2 -24u +10 = 10(u - [6 + sqrt(11)]/5)(u - [6 - sqrt(11)]/5).\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can leave the numerator as is.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = [ -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600 ] / [ (6 -5u)(6u -5) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, denominator: (6 -5u)(6u -5) = 6*(6u) +6*(-5) -5u*(6u) -5u*(-5).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to expand it:\n\n(6 -5u)(6u -5) = 6*6u +6*(-5) -5u*6u + (-5u)*5.\n\nWait, no, more accurately:\n\n(6 -5u)(6u -5) = 6*6u + 6*(-5) + (-5u)*6u + (-5u)*(-5).\n\n= 36u -30 -30u\u00b2 +25u.\n\nWait, 36u +25u = 61u.\n\nSo, = (36u +25u) -30 -30u\u00b2 = 61u -30 -30u\u00b2.\n\nBut that's messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as -5u*6u + ... well, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\n(6 -5u)(6u -5) = 6*6u +6*(-5) + (-5u)*6u + (-5u)*(-5).\n\n= 36u -30 -30u\u00b2 +25u.\n\n= (36u +25u) -30 -30u\u00b2.\n\n= 61u -30 -30u\u00b2.\n\n= -30u\u00b2 +61u -30.\n\nSo, denominator is -30u\u00b2 +61u -30.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = [ -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600 ] / [ -30u\u00b2 +61u -30 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me factor numerator: -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600.\n\nFactor out -600: -600(u\u00b2 - (1440/600)u + 1).\n\nWhich is -600(u\u00b2 - 2.4u +1).\n\nSimilarly, denominator: -30u\u00b2 +61u -30.\n\nLet me factor this as:\n\n-30u\u00b2 +61u -30.\n\nLooking for factors of (-30)*(-30) = 900 that add up to 61.\n\nWait, perhaps this factors as (-5u + a)(6u + b) or something. Let me try.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor out a negative sign:\n\n= -(30u\u00b2 -61u +30).\n\nNow, let's try to factor 30u\u00b2 -61u +30.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 30*30=900 and a + b = -61. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps using quadratic formula for 30u\u00b2 -61u +30.\n\nDiscriminant D = 61\u00b2 -4*30*30 = 3721 - 3600 = 121.\n\nSo, sqrt(121)=11.\n\nSo, u = [61 \u00b111]/(2*30) = [72 or 50]/60.\n\nSo, 72/60 = 6/5, 50/60 =5/6.\n\nThus, 30u\u00b2 -61u +30 = 30(u - 6/5)(u -5/6).\n\nSo, denominator is - (30(u -6/5)(u -5/6)).\n\nSo, denominator = -30(u -6/5)(u -5/6).\n\nNow, the numerator is -600(u\u00b2 -2.4u +1).\n\nWait, but 2.4 is 12/5. So, u\u00b2 - (12/5)u +1.\n\nLet me check if this quadratic factors.\n\nu\u00b2 - (12/5)u +1 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: u = [12/5 \u00b1 sqrt( (144/25) -4 )]/2.\n\n= [12/5 \u00b1 sqrt(144/25 - 100/25)]/2.\n\n= [12/5 \u00b1 sqrt(44/25)]/2.\n\n= [12/5 \u00b1 (2 sqrt(11))/5 ]/2.\n\n= [12 \u00b1 2 sqrt(11)]/(5*2) = [6 \u00b1 sqrt(11)]/5.\n\nSo, u\u00b2 - (12/5)u +1 = (u - [6 + sqrt(11)]/5)(u - [6 - sqrt(11)]/5).\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of factoring, I can write s\u00b2 as:\n\ns\u00b2 = [ -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600 ] / [ -30u\u00b2 +61u -30 ].\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: -600u\u00b2 +1440u -600 = -600(u\u00b2 - 2.4u +1).\n\nDenominator: -30u\u00b2 +61u -30 = -30u\u00b2 +61u -30.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor out a common factor between numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me see if numerator is a multiple of denominator.\n\nLet me compute (-600u\u00b2 +1440u -600) divided by (-30u\u00b2 +61u -30).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by -1: numerator becomes 600u\u00b2 -1440u +600, denominator becomes 30u\u00b2 -61u +30.\n\nSo, 600u\u00b2 -1440u +600 divided by 30u\u00b2 -61u +30.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division:\n\nDivide 600u\u00b2 -1440u +600 by 30u\u00b2 -61u +30.\n\nFirst term: 600u\u00b2 / 30u\u00b2 = 20.\n\nMultiply divisor by 20: 20*(30u\u00b2 -61u +30) = 600u\u00b2 -1220u +600.\n\nSubtract from dividend:\n\n(600u\u00b2 -1440u +600) - (600u\u00b2 -1220u +600) = 0u\u00b2 + (-1440u +1220u) + (600 -600).\n\n= (-220u) + 0 = -220u.\n\nSo, the division gives 20 with a remainder of -220u.\n\nWait, that's not zero, so perhaps the numerator is not a multiple of the denominator.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the division.\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n30u\u00b2 -61u +30 multiplied by 20 is indeed 600u\u00b2 -1220u +600.\n\nSubtracting from 600u\u00b2 -1440u +600:\n\n600u\u00b2 -1440u +600\n- (600u\u00b2 -1220u +600)\n= 0u\u00b2 + (-1440u +1220u) + 0\n= (-220u).\n\nSo, the remainder is -220u, which suggests that numerator and denominator are not factors of each other.\n\nHmm, perhaps that approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express s\u00b2 in terms of m and then find its minimum or maximum.\n\nWait, but the question is about BD\u00b2. Wait, BD is the length of diagonal BD, which is 2y.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 would be (2y)^2 =4y\u00b2.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4y\u00b2, and y\u00b2 = 480 m\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2 -20).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4*(480 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 -20) = (1920 m\u00b2)/(24 m\u00b2 -20).\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2 is a function of m\u00b2, which is u, where u is between 5/6 and6/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =1920u/(24u -20).\n\nWait, let's write that as BD\u00b2(u) =1920u/(24u -20).\n\nI can simplify this expression:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n1920/4=480, 24/4=6, 20/4=5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) =480u/(6u -5).\n\nNow, I can write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480u/(6u -5).\n\nNow, I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2(u) over the domain u \u2208 (5/6,6/5). Because for any rhombus, BD\u00b2 is at least this infimum, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be this infimum.\n\nWait, but wait. I'm being asked for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2 over all possible rhombi. Because for any number less than the infimum, there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 less than that number, but since we need a number that's less than all BD\u00b2, it must be the infimum.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if I'm looking for the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, because the infimum is the smallest value that BD\u00b2 can approach. So, any number below the infimum would not satisfy the condition because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2 just above the infimum. Hmm, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards.\n\nWait, let me think: if the infimum is the greatest lower bound, then BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to the infimum from above, but never go below it. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum, because any number larger than the infimum would not be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, since BD\u00b2 can be just above the infimum. So, the greatest lower bound is the infimum, so the answer is the infimum.\n\nSo, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2(u) =480u/(6u -5) over u \u2208 (5/6,6/5).\n\nLet me compute BD\u00b2 as a function of u:\n\nBD\u00b2(u) =480u/(6u -5).\n\nLet me compute its derivative to find minima or maxima.\n\nLet me denote f(u) =480u/(6u -5).\n\nCompute f'(u):\n\nf'(u) = [480*(6u -5) -480u*6]/(6u -5)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n480*(6u -5) -480u*6 =480*6u -480*5 -2880u = (2880u -2400 -2880u) = -2400.\n\nSo, f'(u) = (-2400)/(6u -5)^2.\n\nSince the denominator is squared, it's always positive for u \u22605/6. So, the sign of f'(u) is determined by the numerator, which is negative. So, f'(u) is negative for all u in (5/6,6/5).\n\nSo, f(u) is decreasing on this interval.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(u) occurs at the right endpoint, u=6/5, and the maximum occurs at the left endpoint, u=5/6.\n\nWait, but since u approaches 5/6 from above, and 6/5 from below.\n\nWait, let me compute the limits.\n\nAs u approaches 5/6 from above, 6u -5 approaches 6*(5/6) -5=5-5=0 from above (since u>5/6, 6u-5 approaches 0 from positive side).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(5/6)/(0+) = (480*(5/6))/0+ = (400)/0+ \u2192 +\u221e.\n\nSimilarly, as u approaches 6/5 from below, 6u-5 approaches 6*(6/5) -5 = 36/5 -25/5=11/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(u) approaches 480*(6/5)/(11/5) )= (480*(6/5)) * (5/11) )= (480*6)/11 = 2880/11 \u2248261.818.\n\nBut wait, since f(u) is decreasing, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 occurs at u=6/5, which is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but wait, when u approaches 6/5 from the left, 6u-5 approaches 11/5, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480*(6/5)/(11/5) = (480*6/5)*(5/11) )= (480*6)/11 = 2880/11 \u2248261.818.\n\nBut, wait, when u approaches 5/6 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity, and as u approaches 6/5 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11.\n\nSo, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is 2880/11, and it's approached as u approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nTherefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum, which is 2880/11, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 2880/11, but cannot be less than that. So, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 2880/11.\n\nWait, but I should verify if this is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the derivative.\n\nWait, f(u) =480u/(6u -5).\n\nf'(u) = [480*(6u -5) -480u*6]/(6u -5)^2.\n\nSo, 480*(6u -5) is 480*6u -480*5=2880u -2400.\n\n480u*6=2880u.\n\nSo, numerator is 2880u -2400 -2880u = -2400.\n\nSo, f'(u)= -2400/(6u -5)^2, which is negative for all u>5/6.\n\nSo, f(u) is decreasing on (5/6,6/5), as I thought.\n\nThus, the infimum is approached as u approaches 6/5 from below, which gives BD\u00b2 approaching 2880/11.\n\nBut wait, let me compute 2880 \u00f711.\n\n2880 \u00f711 = 261.8181818..., so about 261.818.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum, which is 2880/11.\n\nBut wait, I should ensure that at u=6/5, the point lies on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, when u=6/5, which is m\u00b2=6/5, then m=\u00b1sqrt(6/5).\n\nThen, for points on the hyperbola, let's compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2=480/(24 -20*(6/5))=480/(24 -24)=480/0, which is undefined. So, u cannot be equal to 6/5, only approaching it.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 2880/11 as u approaches 6/5 from below.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 2880/11, and since BD\u00b2 cannot be less than this, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 2880/11.\n\nBut let me check with specific values to see if this makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take m\u00b2 approaching 6/5 from below, say m\u00b2=6/5 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a very small positive number.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=480u/(6u -5).\n\nPlugging u=6/5 - \u03b5:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(6/5 - \u03b5)/(6*(6/5 - \u03b5) -5).\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n6*(6/5) =36/5, 6*(-\u03b5)= -6\u03b5.\n\nSo, denominator=36/5 -6\u03b5 -5=36/5 -25/5 -6\u03b5=11/5 -6\u03b5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(6/5 - \u03b5)/(11/5 -6\u03b5).\n\nAs \u03b5 approaches 0, this becomes 480*(6/5)/(11/5) = (480*6/5)*(5/11)= (480*6)/11=2880/11.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the infimum is 2880/11, which is approximately 261.818.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 2880/11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The hyperbola is given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. That is, I need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is the greatest lower bound.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, no, that's for a kite. Hmm, maybe I confused some properties. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, because a rhombus is a special kind of kite where all sides are equal. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.\n\nSo, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about both axes and the origin.\n\nGiven that, let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since they intersect at the origin, the points A and C are diametrically opposite with respect to the origin, same with B and D. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (a, b), then point D would be (-a, -b).\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates:\nA = (x, y)\nB = (a, b)\nC = (-x, -y)\nD = (-a, -b)\n\nSince it's a rhombus, the distances AB, BC, CD, DA must all be equal.\n\nFirst, let's compute AB\u00b2:\nAB\u00b2 = (a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, BC\u00b2 = (-x - a)\u00b2 + (-y - b)\u00b2\n\nSince AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2, let's set them equal:\n(a - x)\u00b2 + (b - y)\u00b2 = (-x - a)\u00b2 + (-y - b)\u00b2\n\nExpanding both sides:\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2)\nRight side: (x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2)\n\nSimplify both sides:\nLeft: a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - 2ax + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2by\nRight: a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + 2ax + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by\n\nSubtract left from right:\n(Left) - (Right) = (-2ax - 2by) - (2ax + 2by) = -4ax -4by = 0\n\nSo, -4ax -4by = 0 \u2192 ax + by = 0.\n\nHmm, so that's one condition: ax + by = 0.\n\nNow, since all sides are equal, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 = CD\u00b2 = DA\u00b2. Let's check another equality, say AB\u00b2 = CD\u00b2.\n\nCompute CD\u00b2: (-a - (-x))\u00b2 + (-b - (-y))\u00b2 = (x - a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2, which is same as AB\u00b2. So, that gives the same condition. Similarly, DA\u00b2 would be equal to AB\u00b2 as well.\n\nSo, the only condition we get from the side equality is ax + by = 0.\n\nNow, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:\n\nFor A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nFor B: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSo, points A and B satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nNow, because ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD must satisfy certain properties. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes must be -1.\n\nLet's compute the slopes of AC and BD.\n\nSlope of AC: ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x\n\nSlope of BD: ( -b - b ) / ( -a - a ) = (-2b)/(-2a) = b/a\n\nSince they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (b/a) = -1\n\nSo, (y * b) / (x * a) = -1 \u2192 yb = -xa \u2192 yb + xa = 0\n\nWait, that's the same as ax + by = 0, which we obtained earlier. So, that condition is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since we already had ax + by = 0, and the slopes' product is -1, that is consistent.\n\nSo, moving on, since diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD, which are lines connecting (x,y) to (-x,-y) and (a,b) to (-a,-b), respectively.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n\nNow, the diagonals of a rhombus also satisfy the relation that the sum of the squares of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the diagonals. Wait, for any quadrilateral, the relation is:\n\nAB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 + DA\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2\n\nBut in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so 4AB\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + BD\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, for a rhombus, it's known that the area is (AC * BD)/2, and since the sides are equal and the diagonals are perpendicular, each side can be expressed in terms of the diagonals as sqrt( (AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2 )\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of coordinates.\n\nBut maybe it's better to parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can parameterize points A and B such that they lie on the hyperbola and satisfy the condition ax + by = 0.\n\nAlternatively, since the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1 is symmetric, perhaps I can parameterize points A and B in terms of some parameters.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 1, a parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So, maybe I can set A = (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), and point B = (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nBut given that ax + by = 0, substituting in terms of \u03b8 and \u03c6:\n\na = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6\nx = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8\nb = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6\ny = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8\n\nSo, ax + by = 0 \u2192 sqrt(20) sec\u03c6 * sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 + sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 * sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 + 24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 = 0\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 = -24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8\n\nDivide both sides by sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 (assuming they are non-zero):\n\n20 = -24 tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 / (sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8 )\n\nBut tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6, and sec\u03c6 = 1 / cos\u03c6, so:\n\ntan\u03c6 / sec\u03c6 = (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) / (1 / cos\u03c6) ) = sin\u03c6\n\nSimilarly, tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nSo, tan\u03c6 tan\u03b8 / (sec\u03c6 sec\u03b8) = sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8\n\nSo, 20 = -24 sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore,\n\nsin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -20 / 24 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6\n\nThat's a key equation.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we can write their coordinates as:\n\nA = (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 )\nB = (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6 )\n\nWe also need to find BD\u00b2. Let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nPoints B and D are (a,b) and (-a,-b), so BD is the distance between (a,b) and (-a,-b). Wait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, but in our coordinates, D is (-a,-b), so BD is from (a,b) to (-a,-b), which is a line of length sqrt( (a - (-a))\u00b2 + (b - (-b))\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nBut wait, points B lie on the hyperbola, so a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1 \u2192 a\u00b2 = 20(1 + b\u00b2/24 ) = 20 + (20/24) b\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) b\u00b2\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 20 + (5/6) b\u00b2\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = 4(20 + (5/6) b\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = 4(20 + (11/6) b\u00b2 ) = 80 + (44/6) b\u00b2 = 80 + (22/3) b\u00b2\n\nHmm, but we need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of something we can manage.\n\nWait, but we have another condition from earlier: sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nBut from the parametrization, we can write sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 in terms of the hyperbola.\n\nWait, from the parametrization:\n\nFor point A:\n\ny = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = y / sqrt(24 )\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = y / sqrt( x\u00b2 - 20 ), since for hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, so y\u00b2 = (24)(x\u00b2/20 -1 )\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = y / sqrt(x\u00b2 - 20 )\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nFor hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2=1, parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8 ). Then, tan\u03b8 = y / b \u2192 \u03b8 = arctan(y / b )\n\nBut also, sin\u03b8 = y / sqrt(x\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ), because:\n\nFrom the identity, tan\u03b8 = y / b, so sin\u03b8 = tan\u03b8 / sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (y / b ) / sqrt(1 + y\u00b2 / b\u00b2 ) = y / sqrt(b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nBut for the hyperbola, x\u00b2 = a\u00b2 (1 + y\u00b2 / b\u00b2 ), so sqrt(b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt( b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt( (b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) )\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, since x = a sec\u03b8, so sec\u03b8 = x / a \u2192 cos\u03b8 = a / x \u2192 sin\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - (a\u00b2 / x\u00b2 )) = sqrt( (x\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) / x\u00b2 ) = sqrt(x\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) / x\n\nTherefore, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x\u00b2 - a\u00b2 ) / x\n\nWait, in our case, a\u00b2 is 20, so sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x\u00b2 - 20 ) / x\n\nSimilarly, for point B, sin\u03c6 = sqrt(a\u00b2 - 20 ) / a\n\nWait, because for point B, x = a, so sin\u03c6 = sqrt(a\u00b2 - 20 ) / a\n\nSo, from earlier, we have sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6\n\nSubstituting:\n\n[ sqrt(a\u00b2 - 20 ) / a ] * [ sqrt(x\u00b2 - 20 ) / x ] = -5/6\n\nBut wait, points A and B are different points on the hyperbola, but I think there's a relationship between a and x.\n\nWait, from the condition ax + by = 0, where points A is (x, y) and B is (a, b), and points A and B satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nSo, given ax + by = 0, and A and B on hyperbola, perhaps we can express a and b in terms of x and y, or vice versa.\n\nSo, from ax + by = 0 \u2192 a = (-by)/x\n\nBut since point B is (a, b), which is on the hyperbola: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nSubstituting a = (-by)/x into this:\n\n[ ( (-by)/x )\u00b2 ] / 20 - b\u00b2 /24 = 1\n\nCompute:\n\n( b\u00b2 y\u00b2 ) / (20 x\u00b2 ) - (b\u00b2 ) /24 =1\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ y\u00b2 / (20 x\u00b2 ) - 1 /24 ] =1\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 ) / (20 x\u00b2 *24 ) ] =1\n\nSimplify denominator: 20*24 x\u00b2 = 480 x\u00b2\n\nNumerator: 24 y\u00b2 - 20x\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 (24 y\u00b2 - 20x\u00b2 ) / 480 x\u00b2 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by 480 x\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 (24 y\u00b2 - 20x\u00b2 ) = 480 x\u00b2\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2 /24 =1 \u2192 24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 = 20*24 *1 = 480\n\nSo, 24x\u00b2 -20y\u00b2 =480 \u2192 24 y\u00b2 -20x\u00b2 = -480\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nb\u00b2 (-480 ) = 480 x\u00b2 \u2192 -480 b\u00b2 =480 x\u00b2 \u2192 -b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = -x\u00b2\n\nWait, that can't be right because b\u00b2 is positive and x\u00b2 is positive, so their negatives would make it impossible.\n\nHmm, that suggests an error in substitution.\n\nWait, let's double-check the substitution.\n\nWe have:\n\na = (-b y)/x\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 y\u00b2)/x\u00b2\n\nThen, the hyperbola equation for point B: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1\n\nSubstituting a\u00b2:\n\n( b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/(20 x\u00b2 ) - b\u00b2 /24 =1\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ] =1\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets is:\n\n(y\u00b2)/(20x\u00b2 ) - 1/24\n\nBut from hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 multiply both sides by 24*20=480:\n\n24 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =480 \u2192 24x\u00b2 = 20y\u00b2 +480 \u2192 y\u00b2 = (24x\u00b2 -480)/20 = (6x\u00b2 - 120)/5\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (6x\u00b2 -120)/5\n\nLet me plug this into the expression [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ]:\n\n= [ (6x\u00b2 -120)/(5*20x\u00b2 ) ] - 1/24\n= [ (6x\u00b2 -120)/(100x\u00b2 ) ] - 1/24\n= [ (6x\u00b2 -120) / 100x\u00b2 ] - 1/24\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n6x\u00b2 - 120 = 6(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo,\n\n= [ 6(x\u00b2 -20 ) / (100x\u00b2 ) ] - 1/24\n= [ (6/100)(x\u00b2 -20)/x\u00b2 ] - 1/24\n= (3/50)(x\u00b2 -20)/x\u00b2 - 1/24\n\nBut x\u00b2 -20 is from the hyperbola equation. Let me see:\n\nFrom point A on hyperbola: x\u00b2 -20 = (y\u00b2 *20)/24 = (5 y\u00b2 )/6\n\nWait, x\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u2192 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, x\u00b2 -20 =20 y\u00b2 /24 =5 y\u00b2 /6\n\nSo,\n\n= (3/50)*(5 y\u00b2 /6 ) /x\u00b2 -1/24\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3/50)*(5 y\u00b2 /6 ) = (15 y\u00b2 )/(300 ) = y\u00b2 /20\n\nSo,\n\n= ( y\u00b2 /20 ) /x\u00b2 - 1/24\n\nBut y\u00b2 /x\u00b2: from point A's hyperbola equation, y\u00b2 = (24/20)(x\u00b2 -20 )= (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo, y\u00b2 /x\u00b2 = (6/5)(1 - 20/x\u00b2 )\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me instead compute the entire expression:\n\n[ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ] = [ (6x\u00b2 -120 )/(5*20x\u00b2 ) ] -1/24\n\nWait, no, I already did that. Perhaps I should compute it numerically.\n\nWait, let me try plugging in the expression for y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = (6x\u00b2 -120)/5\n\nSo,\n\ny\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) = (6x\u00b2 -120)/(5*20x\u00b2 ) = (6x\u00b2 -120)/(100x\u00b2 ) = [6(x\u00b2 -20)]/(100x\u00b2 ) = [6/100](x\u00b2 -20)/x\u00b2 = (3/50)(1 - 20/x\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\n[ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ] = (3/50)(1 - 20/x\u00b2 ) - 1/24\n\nHmm, but this seems tricky. Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nWait, from the parametrization, we have points A and B with parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6, and sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6\n\nAlso, we have the expression for BD\u00b2 in terms of a and b, which is 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nBut since a and b are related through the hyperbola equation, a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2/24 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4(20 + (5/6) b\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) =4(20 + (11/6) b\u00b2 ) =80 + (44/6) b\u00b2 =80 + (22/3) b\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 depends on b\u00b2, which we can relate to the other variables.\n\nBut we also have the condition sin\u03c6 sin\u03b8 = -5/6.\n\nEarlier, we saw that sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x\u00b2 -20 ) /x and sin\u03c6 = sqrt(a\u00b2 -20 ) /a.\n\nBut since a = (-b y)/x from ax + by =0, and y from hyperbola is sqrt(24(x\u00b2/20 -1 ))= sqrt( (6x\u00b2 -60)/5 )\n\nWait, maybe this is not the way to go. Alternatively, let's try to express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me denote t = sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nBut from parametrization, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x, sin\u03c6 = sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x * sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a = -5/6\n\nBut sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x is positive because x\u00b2 >20 for hyperbola.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a is positive if a> sqrt(20 ), negative if a < -sqrt(20 )\n\nBut since hyperbola has points in all quadrants, but in this case, points A and B should be such that diagonals are perpendicular and intersecting at origin.\n\nWait, perhaps the product is negative, so one of the terms is negative.\n\nBut sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a is positive if a>sqrt(20 ), negative if a < -sqrt(20 )\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x is positive if x>sqrt(20 ), negative if x < -sqrt(20 )\n\nBut the product is negative, so one term is positive and the other is negative.\n\nSo, either (sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x positive and sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a negative ), or vice versa.\n\nSo, either x>sqrt(20 ), a < -sqrt(20 ), or x< -sqrt(20 ), a>sqrt(20 )\n\nSo, let's consider case 1: x>sqrt(20 ), a < -sqrt(20 )\n\nThen, sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x is positive, sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a is negative because a is negative.\n\nSo, their product is negative, matching the condition.\n\nSimilarly, case 2: x< -sqrt(20 ), a>sqrt(20 )\n\nThen, sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x is negative, as x is negative. sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a is positive, as a is positive.\n\nAgain, product is negative.\n\nSo, in either case, the product is negative, which matches sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nTherefore, let's proceed.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x = p\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a = q\n\nThen, p * q = -5/6\n\nBut in case 1:\n\np = sqrt(x\u00b2 -20)/x = sqrt(1 - 20/x\u00b2 )\n\nq = sqrt(a\u00b2 -20)/a. Since a is negative, q = -sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 )\n\nSo, p * q = - sqrt(1 -20/x\u00b2 ) * sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 ) = -5/6\n\nBut we can write:\n\nsqrt(1 -20/x\u00b2 ) * sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 ) =5/6\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (1 -20/x\u00b2 )(1 -20/a\u00b2 ) ) =5/6\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(1 -20/x\u00b2 )(1 -20/a\u00b2 ) =25/36\n\nLet me compute this product:\n\n=1 -20/a\u00b2 -20/x\u00b2 + (400)/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 ) =25/36\n\nBring 25/36 to the left:\n\n1 -25/36 -20/a\u00b2 -20/x\u00b2 + (400)/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 )=0\n\nCompute 1 -25/36 =11/36\n\nSo,\n\n11/36 -20/a\u00b2 -20/x\u00b2 +400/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 )=0\n\nMultiply both sides by 36 x\u00b2 a\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n11 x\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 720 x\u00b2 -720 a\u00b2 + 14400 =0\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of x.\n\nFrom earlier, we had a = (-b y )/x\n\nBut from the hyperbola equation for point A, y\u00b2 = (24/20)(x\u00b2 -20 )= (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo, y = sqrt(6/5 (x\u00b2 -20 )) or y = -sqrt(6/5 (x\u00b2 -20 ))\n\nSimilarly, for point B: a\u00b2 =20(1 + b\u00b2 /24 )\n\nLet me express b in terms of a:\n\nFrom a = (-b y ) /x \u2192 b = (-a x ) / y\n\nSo, b\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 x\u00b2 ) / y\u00b2\n\nThen, substituting into a\u00b2 =20 + (5/6) b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 =20 + (5/6)(a\u00b2 x\u00b2 ) / y\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by y\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 y\u00b2 =20 y\u00b2 + (5/6) a\u00b2 x\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2 y\u00b2 - (5/6)a\u00b2 x\u00b2 -20 y\u00b2 =0\n\nFactor out a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 ( y\u00b2 - (5/6)x\u00b2 ) -20 y\u00b2=0\n\nBut from point A's hyperbola equation, y\u00b2 = (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo, substitute y\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 [ (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 ) - (5/6)x\u00b2 ] -20*(6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 )=0\n\nCompute the expression inside the brackets:\n\n= (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 ) - (5/6)x\u00b2\n\nLet me get a common denominator of 30:\n\n= (36/30)(x\u00b2 -20 ) - (25/30)x\u00b2\n\n= [36(x\u00b2 -20 ) -25x\u00b2 ] /30\n\n= (36x\u00b2 -720 -25x\u00b2 ) /30\n\n= (11x\u00b2 -720 ) /30\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 (11x\u00b2 -720 ) /30 -20*(6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 )=0\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 (11x\u00b2 -720 ) /30 -24(x\u00b2 -20 )=0\n\nMultiply through by 30 to eliminate denominators:\n\na\u00b2 (11x\u00b2 -720 ) -720(x\u00b2 -20 )=0\n\nSo,\n\n11 a\u00b2 x\u00b2 -720 a\u00b2 -720 x\u00b2 +14400=0\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy. Let me see if I can find a relationship between a and x.\n\nWait, from a = (-b y )/x, and from parametrization, we have:\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nWhich we expressed in terms of x and a:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 -20 )/x * sqrt(a\u00b2 -20 )/a = -5/6\n\nBut in case 1: x>sqrt(20 ), a <0, so sqrt(a\u00b2 -20 )/a = -sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 -20 )/x * (-sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 )) = -5/6 \u2192 sqrt(x\u00b2 -20 )/x * sqrt(1 -20/a\u00b2 ) =5/6\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( (x\u00b2 -20 )/(x\u00b2 ) ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 -20 )/a\u00b2 ) =5/6\n\nWhich is sqrt( (x\u00b2 -20 )/(x\u00b2 ) * (a\u00b2 -20 )/a\u00b2 ) =5/6\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n( (x\u00b2 -20 )/(x\u00b2 ) ) * ( (a\u00b2 -20 )/a\u00b2 ) =25/36\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 -20/x\u00b2 )(1 -20/a\u00b2 )=25/36\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, 1 -20/x\u00b2 -20/a\u00b2 +400/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 )=25/36\n\nRearranged:\n\n1 -25/36 =20/x\u00b2 +20/a\u00b2 -400/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 )\n\nAs 1 -25/36=11/36\n\nSo,\n\n11/36 =20/x\u00b2 +20/a\u00b2 -400/(x\u00b2 a\u00b2 )\n\nLet me set u =1/x\u00b2 and v =1/a\u00b2.\n\nThen, equation becomes:\n\n11/36 = 20 u +20 v -400 u v\n\nWe also have from the hyperbola equation:\n\nFrom point A: x\u00b2/20 -

So, something is wrong.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 must be positive, so perhaps when t approaches 20 from above, denominator approaches 67*20 -1440=1340 -1440= -100, and numerator approaches 960*(220 -120 )=960*100=96000\n\nSo, f(t ) approaches 96000 / (-100 )= -960, which is negative, but BD\u00b2 must be positive, so perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.\n\nWait, in the earlier steps, when I set points B and D as (k, (-x/y)k ) and (-k, (x/y)k ), their y-coordinates are negative and positive, respectively. So, when calculating BD\u00b2, the distance should be positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when computing BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is the square of the distance between (k, (-x/y)k ) and (-k, (x/y)k )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=(k - (-k ))\u00b2 + [ (-x/y k - (x/y k ) ]\u00b2= (2k )\u00b2 + [ (-2x/y k ) ]\u00b2=4k\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 k\u00b2 / y\u00b2\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut when t approaches 20, x\u00b2 approaches 20, so y\u00b2 approaches zero, which would make 1/y\u00b2 approach infinity, so BD\u00b2 would approach infinity.\n\nBut according to f(t )=960*(11t -120 )/(67t -1440 ), at t=20, it's negative, which suggests that perhaps I have a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track the signs.\n\nFrom BD\u00b2=4k\u00b2 (1 +x\u00b2 /y\u00b2 )\n\nSince y\u00b2 is positive, and x\u00b2 is positive, 1 +x\u00b2 /y\u00b2 is positive, so BD\u00b2 is positive.\n\nBut in f(t ), when t approaches 20, denominator approaches 67*20 -1440=1340 -1440= -100, which is negative, and numerator is 11*20 -120=220 -120=100, so f(t ) approaches 960*100 / (-100 )= -960, which is negative, which contradicts BD\u00b2 being positive.\n\nThus, I must have made an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nBD\u00b2=4k\u00b2 (1 +x\u00b2 /y\u00b2 )\n\nBut k\u00b2=1440(x\u00b2 -20 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(1440(x\u00b2 -20 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 ))*(1 +x\u00b2 /y\u00b2 )\n\nBut 1 +x\u00b2 /y\u00b2=1 +x\u00b2 / [ (6/5)(x\u00b2 -20 ) ]=1 +5x\u00b2/(6x\u00b2 -120 )\n\n= [6x\u00b2 -120 +5x\u00b2 ]/(6x\u00b2 -120 )= (11x\u00b2 -120 )/(6x\u00b2 -120 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(1440(x\u00b2 -20 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )) * (11x\u00b2 -120 )/(6x\u00b2 -120 )\n\nNotice that 6x\u00b2 -120=6(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(1440(x\u00b2 -20 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 ))*(11x\u00b2 -120 )/(6(x\u00b2 -20 )) )\n\nCancel (x\u00b2 -20 ):\n\n=4*(1440/(67x\u00b2 -1440 ))*(11x\u00b2 -120 )/6\n\n= (4*1440 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )*(11x\u00b2 -120 )/6\n\nCompute constants:\n\n4/6=2/3\n\nSo,\n\n= (2/3 )*1440*(11x\u00b2 -120 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )\n\n= 960*(11x\u00b2 -120 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nBut as x\u00b2 approaches 20 from above, denominator approaches -100, numerator approaches 960*(220 -120 )=960*100=96000\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 approaches 96000 / (67*20 -1440 )=96000/-100= -960, which is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps I messed up the initial substitution.\n\nWait, when I set points B as (k, (-x/y)k ), perhaps I should have taken into account that if x and y are positive, then (-x/y)k may be negative or positive depending on k.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have considered that if point B is (k, m ), then point D is (-k, -m ), making BD the distance between (k,m ) and (-k,-m ), which is sqrt( (2k )\u00b2 + (2m )\u00b2 )=2 sqrt(k\u00b2 +m\u00b2 )\n\nWhich would make BD\u00b2=4(k\u00b2 +m\u00b2 )\n\nGiven that m= (-x/y )k, so m= (-x/y )k\n\nThus, m\u00b2= x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 *k\u00b2\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(k\u00b2 +x\u00b2 k\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )=4k\u00b2(1 +x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nBut when t approaches 20, x\u00b2 approaches 20, y\u00b2 approaches zero, so x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 approaches infinity, making BD\u00b2 approach infinity.\n\nBut according to f(t ), it's approaching negative, which suggests that perhaps k\u00b2 becomes negative, which is impossible.\n\nWait, because k\u00b2 is given by 1440(x\u00b2 -20 )/(67x\u00b2 -1440 )\n\nSo, when x\u00b2 approaches 20 from above, numerator approaches 1440*(0 )=0, denominator approaches 67*20 -1440= -100, so k\u00b2 approaches 0 from negative side, which is impossible because k\u00b2 can't be negative.\n\nSo, that suggests that k\u00b2 can't be negative, which implies that denominator must be positive when numerator is positive.\n\nSo, 67x\u00b2 -1440 must have same sign as numerator 1440(x\u00b2 -20 )\n\nSo, 67x\u00b2 -1440 and (x\u00b2 -20 ) must have same sign.\n\nSo, 67x\u00b2 -1440 >0 \u2192x\u00b2>1440/67\u224821.4925\n\nAnd x\u00b2 -20 >0 \u2192x\u00b2>20\n\nThus, for k\u00b2 positive, x\u00b2 must be greater than 21.4925.\n\nSo, the domain of t is t>1440/67\u224821.4925.\n\nTherefore, in our function f(t )=960*(11t -120 )/(67t -1440 ), t must be greater than 1440/67\u224821.4925.\n\nSo, let's compute f(t ) for t>21.4925.\n\nAt t=1440/67\u224821.4925, denominator approaches zero, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nAs t increases beyond 1440/67, denominator becomes positive and increases, numerator also increases.\n\nThus, as t approaches infinity, f(t )=960*(11t )/(67t )=960*(11/67 )\u2248960*0.164\u2248157.432\n\nBut wait, 11/67\u22480.164, so 960*0.164\u2248157.432.\n\nBut let me compute 960*(11/67 )= (960/67 )*11\u224814.328*11\u2248157.608\n\nBut wait, earlier when I set t\u2192\u221e, BD\u00b2 approaches 960*(11t )/(67t )=960*(11/67 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/67\u2248157.608.\n\nBut we can find the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSince f(t ) is decreasing for t>1440/67, because derivative is negative.\n\nThus, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is the limit as t approaches infinity, which is 10560/67\u2248157.608.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 10560/67, but since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to this value, but never less than it.\n\nWait, but wait, as t increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/67 from above, meaning BD\u00b2 is always greater than 10560/67.\n\nBut since the function is decreasing, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is 10560/67, approached as t\u2192infty.\n\nWait, no, because as t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases towards 10560/67.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 can be as small as just above 10560/67, but cannot be smaller than that.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nWait, if BD\u00b2 approaches 10560/67 as t approaches infinity, then for any BD\u00b2 greater than 10560/67, you can find a rhombus with BD\u00b2 as close as desired to 10560/67, but not less than that.\n\nTherefore, the infimum is 10560/67, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me compute 10560/67.\n\nCompute 67*157=67*(150+7)=67*150=10050, 67*7=469\u219210050+469=10519\n\n10560-10519=41\n\nSo, 10560/67=157 +41/67\u2248157.61194...\n\nSo, approximately 157.612.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 10560/67.\n\nBut wait, 10560 divided by 67: 67*157=10519, 10560-10519=41, so 10560/67=157 +41/67=157.61194...\n\nBut since we need the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is the infimum, which is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me see if 10560/67 can be simplified.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(10560,67). Since 67 is a prime number, check if 67 divides 10560.\n\n10560 \u00f767=157.61194... So, no, it does not divide evenly.\n\nThus, 10560/67 is the reduced fraction.\n\nBut let me see if 10560 and 67 have any common factors. 67 is prime, and 67 doesn't divide 10560, as 10560 \u00f767 is not integer.\n\nThus, 10560/67 is the simplest form.\n\nBut let me check calculations once more.\n\nWait, when t approaches infinity, f(t )=960*(11t )/(67t )=960*(11/67 )=10560/67\u2248157.61194\n\nYes.\n\nBut the question is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 10560/67, which is the greatest lower bound, so the answer is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me check if 10560/67 can be simplified further.\n\n67 is a prime number. 67 divides 10560?\n\nCompute 67*157=10519, 67*158=10519+67=10586>10560.\n\nSo, 67 does not divide 10560, so 10560/67 is the simplest form.\n\nThus, the answer is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me compute 10560/67 as a mixed number: 67*157=10519, 10560-10519=41, so 157 41/67.\n\nBut as an improper fraction, 10560/67 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an integer, but 10560/67 is not integer.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum is 10560/67, which is approximately 157.6119...\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake in earlier steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in f(t ).\n\nWait, f(t )=960*(11t -120 )/(67t -1440 )\n\nAs t\u2192\u221e, f(t ) approaches 960*(11t )/(67t )=960*(11/67 )=10560/67\u2248157.6119.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is 10560/67, but the problem asks for the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is the infimum, so 10560/67.\n\nBut 10560/67 is approximately 157.6119, but I can check if this is indeed the minimal value.\n\nWait, but since the function f(t ) is decreasing for t>1440/67\u224821.4925, and as t approaches infinity, f(t ) approaches 10560/67, then BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 10560/67 from above, but cannot be less than that.\n\nThus, the infimum is 10560/67, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 10560/67.\n\nThus, the answer is 10560/67, which is approximately 157.6119.\n\nBut to write it as a fraction, 10560/67 is the exact value.\n\nBut let me check: 67*157=67*(150+7)=67*150=10050, 67*7=469, total 10050+469=10519.\n\n10560-10519=41.\n\nSo, 10560/67=157 and 41/67.\n\nBut as an improper fraction, it's 10560/67.\n\nWait, but 10560 divided by 67: 67*157=10519, 10560-10519=41, so 10560=67*157 +41.\n\nThus, 10560/67=157 +41/67=157 41/67.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the function f(t ).\n\nWait, f(t )=960*(11t -120 )/(67t -1440 )\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:11t -120\n\nDenominator:67t -1440=67(t - 1440/67 )=67(t -21.4925 )\n\nBut perhaps I can write f(t )=960*(11t -120 )/(67t -1440 )=960*(11(t - 120/11 ))/(67(t -1440/67 ))=960*(11/67 )*(t -120/11 )/(t -1440/67 )\n\nBut 120/11\u224810.909, and 1440/67\u224821.4925.\n\nSo, f(t )= (960*11/67 )*(t -10.909 )/(t -21.4925 )\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the expression (t -10.909 )/(t -21.4925 ) approaches 1, so f(t ) approaches 960*11/67=10560/67\u2248157.6119.\n\nBut as t increases beyond 21.4925, the function f(t ) decreases towards 10560/67.\n\nThus, the minimal value is 10560/67.\n\nSo, the answer is 10560/67.\n\nBut let me compute 10560/67.\n\nCompute 67*157=10519.\n\n10560-10519=41.\n\nSo, 10560/67=157 +41/67=157 41/67.\n\nBut to write as a single fraction, 10560/67.\n\nBut I can check if 41 and 67 have a common factor: 67 is prime, 41 is prime, so no.\n\nThus, the exact value is 10560/67.\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{10560}{67}}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The rhombus's diagonals are perpendicular, and all sides are equal. \n\n1. **Parametrization and Conditions**:\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the hyperbola can be parameterized as \\(A = (x, y)\\) and \\(B = (a, b)\\).\n   - The condition \\(ax + by = 0\\) arises from the equality of side lengths.\n   - The slopes of the diagonals must multiply to \\(-1\\), leading to the relation \\(yb = -xa\\).\n\n2. **Hyperbola Equations**:\n   - For point \\(A\\): \\( \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n   - For point \\(B\\): \\( \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - \\(BD^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2)\\).\n   - Using the hyperbola equation for \\(B\\), \\(a^2 = 20(1 + \\frac{b^2}{24})\\).\n   - Substituting \\(a^2\\) into \\(BD^2\\) gives \\(BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{22}{3}b^2\\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - Expressing \\(BD^2\\) in terms of a single variable and analyzing its behavior as \\(t = x^2\\) approaches infinity, we find that \\(BD^2\\) approaches \\(\\frac{10560}{67}\\).\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{10560}{67}}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, the hyperbola is given by the equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola is \\(\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\), which opens left and right. Here, the center is at (0,0), so that's straightforward. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.\n\nNow, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I know that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, is that true? Actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren\u2019t necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, maybe they are. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. That's actually a property of a square or a kite. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the vertex angles, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm confusing with a different shape. Let me think. For a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do intersect at right angles. Oh, right! In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, that's important.\n\nSo, the rhombus is such that its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the point where the diagonals cross is the origin. So, the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin, and the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both diagonals.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum or the lower bound of \\(BD^2\\) across all possible such rhombuses. So, the maximum lower bound that is still less than all possible \\(BD^2\\) values.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. So, we have a hyperbola centered at the origin, and a rhombus inscribed in it with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So, the rhombus is determined by the slopes of its diagonals, I suppose.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals can be represented as straight lines passing through the origin. So, let's say one diagonal is along some line with slope m, and the other is along a line with slope n. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes should be -1. So, if one diagonal has slope m, the other would have slope -1/m.\n\nWait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the two diagonals must be perpendicular to each other.\n\nSo, the diagonals can be represented as two perpendicular lines intersecting at the origin. So, let's parametrize them. Let me consider one diagonal along the line \\(y = kx\\), and the other along \\(y = (-1/k)x\\), since they must be perpendicular.\n\nBut wait, since a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, so perhaps we can parametrize the points in terms of the slopes of the diagonals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points in terms of angles. But maybe using coordinates is better.\n\nLet me think about how the points are arranged. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric in the same way. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps points B and D lie on the other diagonal.\n\nWait, no, because the diagonals are perpendicular, the four points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC is one diagonal, BD is the other.\n\nSince AC is along one line, say, with slope m, and BD is along another line, with slope -1/m, since they are perpendicular.\n\nSo, let me suppose that diagonal AC lies along a line making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, so its slope is tan\u03b8. Then, the other diagonal BD lies along a line perpendicular to that, with slope -cot\u03b8.\n\nSo, points A and C are on the line with slope tan\u03b8, and points B and D are on the line with slope -cot\u03b8.\n\nGiven that the rhombus is convex and symmetric, so the four points would be in such a way that each is a reflection across the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).\n\nSo, now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, which is equal to the distance between C and D, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, we can use properties of vectors. Let me think in terms of vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD as position vectors. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of AC is the origin, so the average of OA and OC is zero, which implies OC = -OA. Similarly, OD = -OB.\n\nSo, OA = vector from origin to A, OC = -OA, OB = vector to B, OD = -OB.\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length.\n\nSo, vector AB = OB - OA. Its magnitude squared is |OB - OA|\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, vector BC = OC - OB = (-OA) - OB. So, |BC|\u00b2 = | - OA - OB |\u00b2 = | OA + OB |\u00b2.\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, |AB|\u00b2 = |BC|\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n|OB - OA|\u00b2 = |OA + OB|\u00b2.\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n|OB|\u00b2 - 2 OA \u00b7 OB + |OA|\u00b2 = |OA|\u00b2 + 2 OA \u00b7 OB + |OB|\u00b2.\n\nSubtract |OA|\u00b2 and |OB|\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n-2 OA \u00b7 OB = 2 OA \u00b7 OB\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-2 OA \u00b7 OB - 2 OA \u00b7 OB = 0\n\n-4 OA \u00b7 OB = 0\n\nSo, OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nTherefore, vectors OA and OB are perpendicular.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, in this case, OA and OB are perpendicular vectors. So, points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and their position vectors are perpendicular.\n\nHmm, that's a key insight.\n\nSo, given that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors, and both points A and B lie on the hyperbola.\n\nSo, let me write the condition that OA \u00b7 OB = 0.\n\nIn coordinates, suppose A is (x1, y1), then OA = (x1, y1), and B is (x2, y2), so OB = (x2, y2). The dot product is x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nSo, x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.\n\nAlso, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy:\n\n\\(\\frac{x1^2}{20} - \\frac{y1^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nand\n\n\\(\\frac{x2^2}{20} - \\frac{y2^2}{24} = 1\\)\n\nSo, with these two equations and the orthogonality condition, perhaps we can find a relationship between A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize points A and B in terms of some parameter.\n\nWait, hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), a standard parametrization is \\(x = a \\sec \\theta\\), \\(y = b \\tan \\theta\\). Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: \\(x = a \\cosh t\\), \\(y = b \\sinh t\\). Both parametrizations can be used, but perhaps the trigonometric one is easier for this problem.\n\nSo, let's parametrize point A as \\(A = ( \\sqrt{20} \\sec \\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\theta )\\), and point B as \\(B = ( \\sqrt{20} \\sec \\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\phi )\\).\n\nGiven that OA \u00b7 OB = 0, then substituting:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{20} \\sec \\theta \\cdot \\sqrt{20} \\sec \\phi + \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\theta \\cdot \\sqrt{24} \\tan \\phi = 0\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(20 \\sec \\theta \\sec \\phi + 24 \\tan \\theta \\tan \\phi = 0\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = -6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nExpressing everything in terms of sine and cosine:\n\n5 / (cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) = -6 (sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8)(sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n5 = -6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nHmm, so we have a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, now, our goal is to find BD^2.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B to D. But since D is the opposite point of B, which is (-x2, -y2). So, BD is the distance between B and D, which is the distance between (x2, y2) and (-x2, -y2), which is sqrt[(2x2)^2 + (2y2)^2] = 2 sqrt(x2^2 + y2^2). Therefore, BD squared is 4(x2^2 + y2^2).\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 4 (x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4 (x1\u00b2 + y1\u00b2), but we are interested in BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, our target is to find the minimal BD\u00b2 such that BD\u00b2 is as small as possible, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the infimum of BD\u00b2 across all such rhombuses.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which would correspond to the minimal 4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2). So, minimal x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2.\n\nBut given that point B is on the hyperbola and that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can express x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can connect \u03b8 and \u03c6 through the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nWait, let me think. Since point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6), then x2 = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, y2 = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = 20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nExpress this in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6:\n\n= 20 / cos\u00b2\u03c6 + 24 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n= (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6\n\nBut we know from the hyperbola equation that for point B, (x2\u00b2)/20 - (y2\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nWhich is:\n\n(20 sec\u00b2\u03c6)/20 - (24 tan\u00b2\u03c6)/24 = 1\n=> sec\u00b2\u03c6 - tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 1\nBut sec\u00b2\u03c6 - tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 1, which is a trigonometric identity, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut from the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, perhaps we can relate \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nWait, let's see. From sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and we know from point A's parametrization that sin\u03b8 = (y1)/sqrt(24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 + 20), but maybe it's better to express in terms of t = tan(\u03b8/2) or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write sin\u03b8 = s, sin\u03c6 = t, so s*t = -5/6.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let's note that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. Also, since A lies on the hyperbola, we can express something in terms of \u03b8.\n\nWait, for point A, (x1, y1) = (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), so x1\u00b2 / 20 - y1\u00b2 / 24 = 1, which is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, same.\n\nWait, perhaps we can express x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, and then express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, using the condition sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut maybe it's getting a bit tangled. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 in terms of sin\u03c6.\n\nWe have x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6)/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nBut cos\u00b2\u03c6 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nSo, substituting that in,\n\nx2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = (20 + 24 sin\u00b2\u03c6) / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6)\n\nLet me denote u = sin\u00b2\u03c6. Then,\n\nx2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 = (20 + 24u) / (1 - u)\n\nSo, our goal is to find the minimal value of (20 + 24u)/(1 - u), given that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut we can relate sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6 via this equation.\n\nFrom sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut from point A, we can write sin\u03b8 in terms of t = \u03b8.\n\nWait, for point A, x1 = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, so sec\u03b8 = x1 / sqrt(20). Similarly, tan\u03b8 = y1 / sqrt(24).\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = tan\u03b8 / sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) = (y1 / sqrt(24)) / sqrt(1 + (y1\u00b2 /24)).\n\nBut perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and sin\u03b8 = (y1)/sqrt(y1\u00b2 + 20), because from point A, (x1, y1) lies on the hyperbola, so x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 = 1. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, for point A, x1 = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, so sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 = x1, so sec\u03b8 = x1 / sqrt(20). Then, cos\u03b8 = sqrt(20)/x1.\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) = sqrt(1 - 20/x1\u00b2) = sqrt( (x1\u00b2 - 20)/x1\u00b2 ) = sqrt(x1\u00b2 - 20)/x1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B, sin\u03c6 = sqrt(x2\u00b2 - 20)/x2, because x2\u00b2 /20 - y2\u00b2 /24 =1, so y2\u00b2 = (x2\u00b2 /20 -1)*24 = (x2\u00b2 -20)*24/20 = (x2\u00b2 -20)*6/5.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03c6 = sqrt(y2\u00b2 +20)/x2 ? Wait, no, sin\u03c6 for point B is y2 / sqrt(y2\u00b2 + x2\u00b2). Wait, no. Wait, in the parametrization, for point B, sin\u03c6 = (y2)/sqrt(y2\u00b2 + x2\u00b2). Because in the parametrization, for hyperbola, we have x = a sec\u03c6, y = b tan\u03c6, so sin\u03c6 = (y)/sqrt(y\u00b2 + (a\u00b2)( (sqrt(y\u00b2 + a\u00b2 tan\u00b2\u03c6)) )) Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, and from point A, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x1\u00b2 -20)/x1, and from point B, sin\u03c6 = sqrt(x2\u00b2 -20)/x2.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nsqrt(x1\u00b2 -20)/x1 * sqrt(x2\u00b2 -20)/x2 = -5/6\n\nBut wait, sqrt(x1\u00b2 -20) is positive, sqrt(x2\u00b2 -20) is positive, so their product is positive. But the right side is negative. So, the product is negative, which suggests that either sin\u03b8 or sin\u03c6 is negative.\n\nBut since in the parametrization, we can have \u03b8 and \u03c6 in different quadrants. So, perhaps sin\u03b8 is negative while sin\u03c6 is positive, or vice versa.\n\nBut regardless, the product is negative. So, perhaps we can write:\n\nsqrt(x1\u00b2 -20) * sqrt(x2\u00b2 -20) = -5/6 * x1 x2\n\nBut the left side is positive, and the right side is negative. So, that's a contradiction. Hmm, that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me think again.\n\nFrom earlier, we have OA \u00b7 OB = 0, which is x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.\n\nBut we also have sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nBut sin\u03b8 = y1 / sqrt(y1\u00b2 + 20) (no, wait, earlier I had sin\u03b8 = sqrt(x1\u00b2 - 20)/x1.\n\nWait, let me re-examine.\n\nFrom point A: x1 = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, y1 = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = tan\u03b8 / sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) = (y1 / sqrt(24)) / sqrt(1 + (y1\u00b2 /24)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (y1) / sqrt(y1\u00b2 + 24)\n\nSimilarly, cos\u03b8 = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) = 1 / sqrt(1 + y1\u00b2 /24) = sqrt(24)/sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24)\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 = y1 / sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24)\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03c6 = y2 / sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nThen, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = (y1 y2) / (sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24) sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)) ) = -5/6\n\nSo, (y1 y2) = -5/6 sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24) sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nBut we know that OA \u00b7 OB = 0, which is x1 x2 + y1 y2 = 0.\n\nSo, x1 x2 = - y1 y2.\n\nSo, substituting into the previous equation:\n\ny1 y2 = -5/6 sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24) sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nBut x1 x2 = - y1 y2, so x1 x2 = 5/6 sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24) sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nBut x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1, so x1\u00b2 =20 (1 + y1\u00b2 /24 ) = 20 + (20 y1\u00b2)/24 = 20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2 =20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x1 x2 = sqrt( (20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6 ) (20 + (5 y2\u00b2)/6 ) )\n\nBut x1 x2 = 5/6 sqrt(y1\u00b2 +24) sqrt(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\nx1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 = (25/36) (y1\u00b2 +24)(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nBut x1\u00b2 =20 + (5 y1\u00b2)/6, so x1\u00b2 = (120 +5 y1\u00b2)/6\n\nSimilarly, x2\u00b2 = (120 +5 y2\u00b2)/6\n\nSo, x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 = (120 +5 y1\u00b2)(120 +5 y2\u00b2)/(6*6) = [ (5 y1\u00b2 +120)(5 y2\u00b2 +120) ] /36\n\nSet equal to (25/36)(y1\u00b2 +24)(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nMultiply both sides by 36:\n\n(5 y1\u00b2 +120)(5 y2\u00b2 +120) =25 (y1\u00b2 +24)(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n(y1\u00b2 +24)(5 y2\u00b2 + 240) =5 (y1\u00b2 +24)(y2\u00b2 +24)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(5 y1\u00b2 +120)(5 y2\u00b2 +120) =25 y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 +600 y1\u00b2 +600 y2\u00b2 +14400\n\nRight side:\n\n25 (y1\u00b2 +24)(y2\u00b2 +24) =25 [ y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 +24 y1\u00b2 +24 y2\u00b2 +576 ] =25 y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 +600 y1\u00b2 +600 y2\u00b2 +14400\n\nSo, the left side is 25 y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 +600 y1\u00b2 +600 y2\u00b2 +14400\n\nThe right side is 25 y1\u00b2 y2\u00b2 +600 y1\u00b2 +600 y2\u00b2 +14400\n\nSo, they are equal. That means that the earlier equation is an identity, which doesn't give us any new information. So, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the coordinates of points A, B, C, D.\n\nSince the rhombus is centered at the origin, the coordinates of the four points are A, B, -A, -B.\n\nSo, the four points are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (-x1, -y1), (-x2, -y2).\n\nAnd the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nSo, the vectors AB = (x2 -x1, y2 - y1)\n\nSimilarly, vector BC = (-x1 -x2, -y1 - y2)\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, |AB| = |BC|\n\nSo, |AB|\u00b2 = |BC|\u00b2\n\nWhich gives:\n\n(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (-x1 -x2)^2 + (-y1 - y2)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: x2\u00b2 -2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 -2y1y2 +y1\u00b2\n\nRight side: x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2\n\nSet equal:\n\nx2\u00b2 -2x1x2 +x1\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 -2y1y2 +y1\u00b2 = x1\u00b2 + 2x1x2 +x2\u00b2 + y1\u00b2 + 2y1y2 + y2\u00b2\n\nCancelling terms on both sides:\n\n-2x1x2 -2y1y2 = 2x1x2 + 2y1y2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-4x1x2 -4y1y2 =0\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\nx1x2 + y1y2 =0\n\nWhich is consistent with our earlier finding that OA \u00b7 OB =0.\n\nSo, again, this brings us back to the condition x1x2 + y1y2 =0.\n\nSo, with that, perhaps we can express one variable in terms of another.\n\nLet me express y1 in terms of x1 and x2, y2.\n\nFrom x1x2 + y1y2=0, we get y1 = -(x1x2)/y2\n\nBut since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, we can write equations for both.\n\nFor point A: x1\u00b2 /20 - y1\u00b2 /24 =1\n\nSubstituting y1 = -(x1x2)/y2 into this:\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - [ (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 ) / y2\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nSimilarly, for point B: x2\u00b2 /20 - y2\u00b2 /24 =1\n\nSo, let me denote equation 1: x1\u00b2 /20 - (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/(24 y2\u00b2) =1\n\nEquation 2: x2\u00b2 /20 - y2\u00b2 /24 =1\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y2\u00b2:\n\ny2\u00b2 =24*(x2\u00b2 /20 -1 )= (24/20)x2\u00b2 -24= (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24\n\nNow, plug this into equation 1:\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2)/(24*( (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) )) =1\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nDenominator: 24*(6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) =24*(6x2\u00b2/5 -24)=24*( (6x2\u00b2 -120)/5 )= (24/5)(6x2\u00b2 -120)\n\nSo, (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 ) / [24*(6/5 x2\u00b2 -24) ] = (x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 ) / [ (24/5)(6x2\u00b2 -120) ) ] =5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 / [24(6x2\u00b2 -120) ]\n\nSo, equation 1 becomes:\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - [5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 / (24(6x2\u00b2 -120) ) ] =1\n\nLet me factor out 6x2\u00b2 -120 as 6(x2\u00b2 -20):\n\nSo, denominator becomes 24*6(x2\u00b2 -20) =144(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nSo, equation 1:\n\nx1\u00b2 /20 - [5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 ] / [144 (x2\u00b2 -20) ] =1\n\nMultiply all terms by 144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20) to eliminate denominators:\n\nx1\u00b2 *144*(x2\u00b2 -20) *20 /20 -5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 *144*(x2\u00b2 -20)/(144*(x2\u00b2 -20)) ) =1 *144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: x1\u00b2 *144*(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nSecond term: -5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2\n\nThird term: 144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nSo,\n\n144 x1\u00b2 (x2\u00b2 -20) -5 x1\u00b2 x2\u00b2 =144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nFactor x1\u00b2:\n\nx1\u00b2 [144(x2\u00b2 -20) -5 x2\u00b2 ] =144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20)\n\nSimplify the bracket:\n\n144x2\u00b2 -144*20 -5x2\u00b2 = (144-5)x2\u00b2 -2880 =139x2\u00b2 -2880\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 (139x2\u00b2 -2880 ) =144*20*(x2\u00b2 -20 )\n\nCalculate 144*20: 2880\n\nSo,\n\nx1\u00b2 (139x2\u00b2 -2880 ) =2880 (x2\u00b2 -20 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx1\u00b2 = [2880 (x2\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (139x2\u00b2 -2880 )\n\nNow, notice that x1\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator and numerator must have the same sign.\n\nSo, numerator and denominator must both be positive or both negative.\n\nSo,\n\nCase 1: 2880 (x2\u00b2 -20 ) >0 and 139x2\u00b2 -2880 >0\n\nWhich implies x2\u00b2 >20 and 139x2\u00b2 >2880 =>x2\u00b2>2880/139\u224820.65\n\nSo, if x2\u00b2>20.65, then both numerator and denominator are positive.\n\nCase 2: 2880 (x2\u00b2 -20 ) <0 and 139x2\u00b2 -2880 <0\n\nWhich implies x2\u00b2 <20 and x2\u00b2 <2880/139\u224820.65\n\nSo, for x2\u00b2 <20, which is possible because the hyperbola allows x2\u00b2 \u226520, but wait, no, the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2 /20 - y\u00b2 /24 =1, so x\u00b2 must be \u226520.\n\nWait, that's right. For the hyperbola, x\u00b2 must be \u226520, so x2\u00b2 >=20.\n\nSo, Case 2 is impossible because x2\u00b2 <20 is not allowed.\n\nSo, only Case 1 is possible, where x2\u00b2>20.65.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2>2880/139\u224820.65.\n\nThus, we can write x1\u00b2 = [2880 (x2\u00b2 -20 ) ] / (139x2\u00b2 -2880 )\n\nBut x1\u00b2 must also satisfy the hyperbola equation.\n\nWait, but we already used that. So, perhaps plugging this back into BD\u00b2.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )\n\nFrom equation 2: y2\u00b2= (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4( x2\u00b2 + (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 )=4( (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 )= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is a linear function of x2\u00b2, with a positive coefficient. So, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize x2\u00b2.\n\nBut x2\u00b2 must be greater than 2880/139\u224820.65.\n\nSo, the minimal value of x2\u00b2 is 2880/139, so plugging that into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2_min = (44/5)*(2880/139) -96\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute 44/5 *2880/139:\n\n44/5 =8.8\n\n2880 /139 \u224820.65467626\n\n8.8 *20.65467626 \u2248181.71\n\nThen subtract 96: 181.71 -96\u224885.71\n\nSo, approximately 85.71.\n\nBut let's compute it exactly.\n\nFirst, 44/5 * (2880/139) = (44 *2880) / (5 *139 )\n\n44 *2880=44*2880= Let's compute 44*2880:\n\n2880 *40=115200\n\n2880 *4=11520\n\nTotal=115200+11520=126720\n\nDenominator:5*139=695\n\nSo, 126720 /695.\n\nLet me compute 126720 \u00f7695.\n\n695 * 182=695*(180+2)=695*180=125,100; 695*2=1,390 \u2192 total=126,490.\n\nSubtract from 126,720: 126,720 -126,490=230.\n\nSo, 695*182 +230=126,720.\n\nBut 230=695*(230/695)=695*(46/139)=\u22480.331*695.\n\nSo, 126720 /695=182 +230/695=182 + (46/139)=182 +0.331\u2248182.331.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I messed up:\n\nWait, 44/5 * (2880/139 )= (44*2880)/(5*139)= (126720)/(695)\n\nDivide 126720 by 695.\n\nCompute how many times 695 fits into 126720.\n\nLet me compute 695*181=?\n\n695*180=125,100\n\n695*1=695\n\nTotal:125,100 +695=125,795\n\nSubtract from 126,720:126,720 -125,795=925.\n\nNow, 695 fits into 925 once, with remainder 230.\n\nSo, 126720 /695=181 +925/695=181 +1 +230/695=182 +230/695=182 +46/139.\n\nSo, approximately 182 +0.331=182.331.\n\nThen, subtract 96:\n\n182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u224886.331.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 86.331..., but since BD\u00b2 can approach this value but cannot be less than it, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 86.331... But I think we can compute it exactly.\n\nWait, 44/5*(2880/139) -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96= 126720/695 -96.\n\nExpress 96 as 96*695/695=66480/695.\n\nSo,\n\n126720/695 -66480/695= (126720 -66480)/695=60240/695.\n\nSimplify 60240/695:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 12048/139.\n\nCheck if 12048 \u00f7139:\n\n139*86=139*(80+6)=11120 +834=11954\n\n12048 -11954=94.\n\nSo, 12048/139=86 +94/139.\n\nSo, 86 +94/139=86 + (94/139).\n\nSo, 94/139\u22480.676.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +94/139=86.676.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier calculation said approximately 86.331.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction.\n\nWait, 44/5*(2880/139) -96.\n\nWait, 44/5 is 8.8, 2880/139\u224820.65467626.\n\n8.8 *20.65467626\u2248181.71.\n\nThen, 181.71 -96=85.71.\n\nBut according to the exact computation, it's 60240/695=86.676.\n\nHmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, 60240 \u00f7695.\n\nCompute 695*86=59,570\n\n60,240 -59,570=670.\n\n695*0.965\u2248670.\n\nSo, 86.965\u224887.\n\nWait, but 60240/695= exactly 86.676.\n\nWait, 695*86.676\u2248695*(86 +0.676)=695*86 +695*0.676.\n\nCompute 695*86:\n\n695*80=55,600\n\n695*6=4,170\n\nTotal:55,600 +4,170=59,770\n\n695*0.676\u2248695*0.6=417; 695*0.076\u224852.94\n\nTotal\u2248417+52.94\u2248469.94\n\nSo, total\u224859,770 +469.94\u224860,239.94\u224860,240.

So, which is still less than 60,240.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nBut regardless, the exact value is 60240/695=12048/139.\n\nWait, 60240 \u00f75=12048, 695 \u00f75=139.\n\nYes, 60240/695=12048/139.\n\n12048 \u00f7139.\n\nCompute 139*86=11,  139*80=11,120; 139*6=834; so 11,120+834=11,954.\n\n12048 -11,954=94.\n\nSo, 12048/139=86 +94/139.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +94/139.\n\nWhich is 86 + (94/139).\n\nSimplify 94/139: can't be reduced further.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +94/139=86.676 approximately.\n\nBut wait, this seems to be the minimal BD\u00b2, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 can be as close as possible to 86 +94/139 from above, but not less. So, the infimum is 86 +94/139, but BD\u00b2 cannot be less than that.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 86 +94/139.\n\nBut 94/139 is approximately0.676, so 86.676.\n\nBut the problem says \"greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\".\n\nWait, that is, the supremum of all lower bounds for BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, if BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 86 +94/139, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 86 +94/139.\n\nBut wait, no, because BD\u00b2 can approach 86 +94/139 from above, but never be less.\n\nSo, the infimum is 86 +94/139, but there's no minimum, just the infimum.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is the infimum, which is 86 +94/139.\n\nSo, the answer is 86 +94/139.\n\nBut let me compute 94/139 in reduced terms. 94 and139 are both primes?\n\n139 is a prime number, yes.\n\n94 is 2*47.\n\nSo, no common factors. So, 94/139 is in simplest form.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is always greater than or equal to 86 +94/139.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 86 +94/139.\n\nBut, to put it as a fraction, 86 +94/139= (86*139 +94)/139= (11,954 +94)/139=12,048/139.\n\nSo, 12,048/139 is equal to approximately86.676.\n\nBut the problem asks for the answer as an integer within a box, but wait, no, it says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nBut the problem expects an exact value, which is 12,048/139. Let me compute that as a mixed number.\n\n12,048 \u00f7139=86 with remainder 94, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, 12,048/139=86 +94/139=86.676...\n\nBut since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, which is the infimum, which is 12,048/139.\n\nBut the question is, do we have to present it as a fraction or a decimal?\n\nGiven that the problem says \"the greatest real number,\" it's likely expecting an exact value, so a fraction.\n\nBut 12,048/139 can it be simplified?\n\n12,048 \u00f72=6,024\n\n139 is prime, so no.\n\nWait, 139 is a prime number, so 12,048/139 cannot be simplified further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it can be written as a mixed number, but the problem might just want it as an improper fraction.\n\nSo, 12,048/139.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again to make sure I haven't made any mistake.\n\nEarlier, we had x1\u00b2 = [2880 (x2\u00b2 -20)] / (139x2\u00b2 -2880 )\n\nWe then expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of x2\u00b2, which is (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nThen, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize x2\u00b2, which is 2880/139\u224820.65467626.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96.\n\nWait, 44/5 is 8.8, 2880/139\u224820.65467626.\n\n8.8*20.65467626\u2248181.71.\n\n181.71 -96\u224885.71.\n\nBut when we compute it exactly, it's (44*2880)/(5*139) -96.\n\nWhich is 126720/(5*139) -96.\n\nWait, 5*139=695.\n\n126720/695 -96.\n\n126720 \u00f7695=182.331.\n\n182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed 126720/695=182.331, then subtract 96, getting\u224886.331.\n\nBut when I computed it as (44/5)*(2880/139) -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96=126720/695 -96= (126720 -96*695)/695.\n\nCompute 96*695: 96*700=67,200, minus 96*5=480, so 67,200 -480=66,720.\n\nSo, 126,720 -66,720=60,000.\n\nSo, 60,000/695=60,000 \u00f7695\u224886.25.\n\nWait, 695*86=59,570.\n\n60,000-59,570=430.\n\nSo, 430/695=86/139.\n\nSo, 60,000/695=86 + (430/695)=86 +86/139.\n\nWait, 430=2*215=2*5*43, and 695=5*139.\n\nSo, 430/695= (2*5*43)/(5*139)= (2*43)/139=86/139.\n\nSo, 60,000/695=86 +86/139.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=60,000/695=86 +86/139=86.619.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, wait, in the step:\n\nBD\u00b2= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96\n\nBut x2\u00b2=2880/139.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96.\n\nCompute 44/5=8.8, 2880/139\u224820.65467626.\n\n8.8 *20.65467626\u2248181.71.\n\n181.71 -96\u224885.71.\n\nBut when I compute it as fractions:\n\n(44/5)*(2880/139)= (44*2880)/(5*139)= (126,720)/695.\n\nThen, 126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -96*695)/695= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=86.619.\n\nWhich is 86 +86/139.\n\nHmm, so 86/139\u22480.619.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +86/139\u224886.619.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, the problem is when I plug in x2\u00b2=2880/139 into BD\u00b2=(44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, (44/5)x2\u00b2=44/5*(2880/139)= (44*2880)/(5*139)= (126,720)/695\u2248182.331.\n\nThen, subtract 96: 182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut when computing in fractions, it's 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nSo, the confusion is, is BD\u00b2= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96, and x2\u00b2=2880/139, so plugging in:\n\nBD\u00b2=(44/5)*(2880/139) -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96=126,720/695 -96.\n\nBut 126,720/695=182.331.\n\n182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nAlternatively, 126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -96*695)/695= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=86.619.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting.\n\nWait, I think the mistake is whether BD\u00b2 is (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96 or (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nWait, no, the computation is correct.\n\nWait, 44/5 x2\u00b2 is 8.8 x2\u00b2.\n\nx2\u00b2=2880/139\u224820.65467626.\n\nSo, 8.8 *20.65467626\u2248181.71.\n\nThen, 181.71 -96\u224885.71.\n\nBut when computing as fractions:\n\nBD\u00b2= [ (44/5)*(2880/139) ] -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96=126,720/695 -96.\n\nBut 126,720/695=182.331.\n\n182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nAlternatively, if you compute 126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -96*695)/695= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=86.619.\n\nSo, wait, which is correct?\n\nWait, 126,720 -96*695=126,720 -66,720=60,000.\n\nSo, 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nBut 126,720/695=182.331.\n\nSo, 182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nWait, hold on. 126,720/695=182.331.\n\nSo, 126,720/695 -96=182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut if I compute 60,000/695, it's 86.619.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, 126,720/695 -96= [126,720 -96*695]/695= [126,720 -66,720]/695=60,000/695.\n\nYes, because 96*695=66,720.\n\nSo, 126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=86.619.\n\nSo, which is correct.\n\nBut why earlier approximation gave 86.331?\n\nBecause when I computed 126,720/695=182.331, then subtract 96, I get\u224886.331.\n\nBut according to exact fraction, it's 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nWait, the expression is BD\u00b2= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nBut x2\u00b2=2880/139.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96= (126720)/(695) -96= 182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut when I compute 126720/695 -96*695/695= (126720 -66720)/695=60000/695=86.619.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, 126720/695 -96=126720/695 - (96*695)/695= (126720 -66720)/695=60000/695.\n\nSo, both ways, it's 60,000/695.\n\nWhich is approximately86.619.\n\nSo, I think I messed up earlier when I said 126720/695=182.331, but that's incorrect.\n\nBecause 695*180=125,100, which is less than 126,720.\n\nWait, 695*182=695*(180+2)=125,100 +1,390=126,490.\n\n126,720 -126,490=230.\n\nSo, 126720/695=182 +230/695=182 + (46/139)=182 +\u22480.331\u2248182.331.\n\nSo, 126720/695=182.331.\n\nThus, 126720/695 -96=182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut according to the other approach, 126720/695 -96= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=86.619.\n\nWait, which one is correct?\n\nWait, 126720/695=182.331.\n\nThen, 182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nWait, but 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nWhich is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial computation.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )\n\nBut with x2\u00b2=2880/139, and y2\u00b2=(6/5)x2\u00b2 -24= (6/5)*(2880/139) -24= (6*576)/139 -24=3456/139 -24.\n\nCompute 3456/139\u224824.878, so 24.878 -24=0.878.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2\u22480.878.\n\nThus, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2\u224820.654 +0.878\u224821.532.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*21.532\u224886.128.\n\nHmm, which is close to 86.331, but not exactly.\n\nSo, exact computation:\n\ny2\u00b2=(6/5)x2\u00b2 -24= (6/5)*(2880/139) -24= (6*2880)/(5*139) -24= (17,280)/(695) -24.\n\n17,280 \u00f7695.\n\nCompute 695*24=16,680.\n\n17,280 -16,680=600.\n\nSo, 17,280/695=24 +600/695=24 + (120/139)=24.863.\n\nSo, y2\u00b2=24.863 -24=0.863.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2=2880/139 +0.863\u224820.654 +0.863\u224821.517.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4*21.517\u224886.068.\n\nSo, approximately86.068.\n\nBut when I compute 60,000/695, it's\u224886.619.\n\nWhich is higher than this.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct exact value is 86 + (something).\n\nWait, let me compute x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2= x2\u00b2 + (6/5 x2\u00b2 -24 )= (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, with x2\u00b2=2880/139:\n\n(11/5)*(2880/139) -24= (11*2880)/(5*139) -24= (31,680)/(695) -24.\n\n31,680 \u00f7695.\n\nCompute 695*45=31,275.\n\n31,680 -31,275=405.\n\nSo, 31,680/695=45 +405/695=45 +81/139\u224845.583.\n\nSo, x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2=45.583 -24=21.583.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=4*21.583\u224886.332.\n\nSo, that matches the earlier approximation.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u224886.332.\n\nBut when I compute 60,000/695=86.619.\n\nThat can't be.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the expression.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 )=4*( (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24 )= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nx2\u00b2=2880/139.\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96= (44*2880)/(5*139) -96=126,720/695 -96.\n\nSo, 126,720/695=182.331.\n\n182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut when I compute (44/5)*(2880/139)= (44*2880)/(5*139)= (126,720)/695=182.331.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=182.331 -96=86.331.\n\nBut when I compute x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2= (11/5)x2\u00b2 -24= (11/5)*(2880/139) -24= (31,680)/(695) -24=45.583 -24=21.583.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*21.583\u224886.332.\n\nSo, which is consistent.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2\u224886.332.\n\nSo, the exact value is 126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -96*695)/695= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=12,000/139= approximately86.331.\n\nSo, 60,000/695=12,000/139.\n\nWait, 60,000 \u00f75=12,000, 695 \u00f75=139.\n\nYes, so 60,000/695=12,000/139.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=12,000/139\u224886.331.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 12,000/139.\n\nBut 12,000 \u00f7139.\n\nCompute 139*86=11,954.\n\n12,000 -11,954=46.\n\nSo, 12,000/139=86 +46/139=86 + (46/139).\n\n46 and139 have no common factors.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +46/139.\n\nWait, but earlier, when computing x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2, I had 21.583, which is 21 +0.583, but 46/139\u22480.331, so 86 +0.331\u224886.331.\n\nWait, but 12,000/139=86 +46/139.\n\nWait, 46/139\u22480.331, so 86.331.\n\nBut when I compute 12,000/139=86.33094244\u224886.331.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=86 +46/139=86.33094244.\n\nSo, that's the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 86 +46/139.\n\nBut wait, 46/139 is less than 1, so this is 86.33094244.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which is the infimum, 86 +46/139.\n\nBut 46 and139 are coprime, so it can't be reduced.\n\nSo, as a fraction, BD\u00b2=12,000/139.\n\nSo, 12,000 \u00f7139=86.33094244.\n\nSo, the infimum is 86.33094244, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 86.33094244.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the answer in a box, probably as a fraction.\n\nSo, 12,000/139.\n\nBut wait, 12,000/139 can be reduced?\n\nWait, 139 is a prime, 12,000=12*1000=2^4*3*5^3.\n\nSo, no common factors with139.\n\nSo, 12,000/139 is the simplest form.\n\nSo, the answer is 12,000/139.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWe started with the hyperbola equation, set up the condition OA \u00b7 OB=0, which led us to the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=-5/6.\n\nThen, expressed BD\u00b2 in terms of x2\u00b2, found that x2\u00b2 must be >=2880/139\u224820.654.\n\nThen, plugged that into BD\u00b2=(44/5)x2\u00b2 -96= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96=126,720/695 -96= (126,720 -66,720)/695=60,000/695=12,000/139\u224886.3309.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12,000/139.\n\nBut to confirm, let me see if there's an alternative approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize BD\u00b2 subject to the hyperbola constraints and the orthogonality condition.\n\nBut that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since BD\u00b2=4(x2\u00b2 + y2\u00b2 ), and from the hyperbola equation, y2\u00b2=(6/5)x2\u00b2 -24.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(x2\u00b2 + (6/5)x2\u00b2 -24 )=4*(11/5 x2\u00b2 -24 )= (44/5)x2\u00b2 -96.\n\nSo, to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize x2\u00b2.\n\nFrom the orthogonality condition, we found x2\u00b2 must be >=2880/139.\n\nThus, the minimal BD\u00b2 is achieved when x2\u00b2=2880/139.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2= (44/5)*(2880/139) -96=12,000/139\u224886.3309.\n\nSo, the answer is 12,000/139, which is approximately86.3309.\n\nSo, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 12,000/139.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{12000}{139}}.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the hyperbola is given by \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\). Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\). The vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0\\).\n\nUsing the parametrization of the hyperbola, we express points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in terms of parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\). The orthogonality condition translates to \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\nWe then express \\(BD^2\\) in terms of \\(x_2^2\\) and \\(y_2^2\\), utilizing the hyperbola equation to find \\(y_2^2 = \\frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24\\). Substituting this into \\(BD^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) = 4\\left(x_2^2 + \\frac{6}{5}x_2^2 - 24\\right) = \\frac{44}{5}x_2^2 - 96\n\\]\n\nTo minimize \\(BD^2\\), we need the smallest possible \\(x_2^2\\), which is found by solving the orthogonality condition and the hyperbola equation. This results in \\(x_2^2 = \\frac{2880}{139}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x_2^2 = \\frac{2880}{139}\\) into the expression for \\(BD^2\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = \\frac{44}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2880}{139} - 96 = \\frac{12000}{139}\n\\]\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{12000}{139}}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola (x\u00b2/20) - (y\u00b2/24) = 1. The rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Oh, right, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at 90 degrees and split each other into two equal parts.\n\nGiven that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is (0,0), that must mean that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if we think of points A, B, C, D, each pair of opposite points must be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is (x,y), then C would be (-x,-y). Similarly, if B is (a,b), then D would be (-a,-b). Is that right? Yeah, because the midpoint between A and C is ((x - x)/2, (y - y)/2) = (0,0). Same for B and D.\n\nBut wait, since ABCD is a rhombus, all four points lie on the hyperbola. The hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So, each of these points (A, B, C, D) must satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me denote the points as follows:\n- Point A: (x, y)\n- Point B: (a, b)\n- Point C: (-x, -y)\n- Point D: (-a, -b)\n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to approach this. Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes and the origin, and the rhombus is centered at the origin, perhaps the diagonals are aligned with the axes or not? Wait, no, the diagonals can be at any angle because the rhombus can be rotated. But in this case, since the hyperbola is symmetric, maybe the rhombus can have its diagonals along the asymptotes or something like that.\n\nWait, hyperbola asymptotes are y = \u00b1(sqrt(24)/sqrt(20))x = \u00b1(sqrt(6)/sqrt(5))x. That's approximately \u00b11.095x. So, maybe the rhombus can have different orientations.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the diagonals AC and BD. Since A is (x,y) and C is (-x,-y), the diagonal AC has length sqrt[(2x)\u00b2 + (2y)\u00b2] = 2*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Similarly, BD has length sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, BD\u00b2 = 4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nWait, but I need the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, I need to find the supremum of BD\u00b2, which would be the least upper bound, and then take the greatest integer less than that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 can approach a certain maximum value but never exceeds it. So, perhaps I should find the maximum possible BD\u00b2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the rhombus. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B is equal to the distance from B to C, etc.\n\nSo, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C.\n\nWait, let me write expressions for these distances.\n\nDistance AB: sqrt[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2]\n\nDistance BC: sqrt[(-x - a)^2 + (-y - b)^2] = sqrt[( -x - a)^2 + (-y - b)^2] = sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2]\n\nSo, setting AB = BC:\n\nsqrt[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2] = sqrt[(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n(a\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2) = (x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2)\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 - 2ax + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2by + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2ax + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2by + b\u00b2\n\nCancel terms on both sides:\n\nLeft: a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ax - 2by\n\nRight: a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2ax + 2by\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n( a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2ax + 2by ) - ( a\u00b2 + x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2ax - 2by ) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4ax + 4by = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\nax + by = 0\n\nSo, that's a condition we get from AB = BC.\n\nSimilarly, since all sides are equal, other conditions would lead to similar equations, but perhaps this is sufficient for now.\n\nSo, equation (1): ax + by = 0.\n\nNow, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, they satisfy:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1  (Equation 2)\n\na\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 = 1  (Equation 3)\n\nSo, now we have three equations: equation (1), (2), (3).\n\nWe can maybe solve for a and b in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom equation (1): ax + by = 0 => ax = -by => a = (-by)/x, assuming x \u2260 0.\n\nThen plug this into equation (3):\n\n[ (-b y / x )\u00b2 ] / 20 - (b\u00b2) /24 = 1\n\nCompute:\n\n( b\u00b2 y\u00b2 ) / (20 x\u00b2 ) - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1\n\nFactor out b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24 ] = 1\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = 1 / [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nHmm, perhaps simplify the denominator:\n\ny\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2) - 1/24 = (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (20 x\u00b2 * 24)\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = 1 / [ (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2) / (480 x\u00b2) ) ] = 480 x\u00b2 / (24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 480 x\u00b2 = 480 x\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 24 y\u00b2 - 20 x\u00b2 = 4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 = (480 x\u00b2) / [4*(6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 ) ] = (120 x\u00b2 ) / (6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 )\n\nSo, now, from equation (2), x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 => (6 x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 )/(60)=1 => 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 =60.\n\nSo, 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2 =60 => 5 y\u00b2 =6x\u00b2 -60 => y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -60)/5\n\nLet me substitute this into the expression for b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 6 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2 =6*( (6x\u00b2 -60)/5 ) -5x\u00b2 = (36x\u00b2 -360)/5 -5x\u00b2 = (36x\u00b2 -360 -25x\u00b2)/5 = (11x\u00b2 -360)/5.\n\nSo, substitute back into b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2= (120 x\u00b2 ) / [ (11x\u00b2 -360)/5 ] = (120 x\u00b2 *5 ) / (11x\u00b2 -360 ) = 600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSo, b\u00b2 =600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1), a=(-b y)/x, so we can express a in terms of x and y.\n\nBut perhaps we can express BD\u00b2 in terms of x and y.\n\nEarlier, BD\u00b2 =4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nSo, we have b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nAnd a = (-b y)/x => a\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 ) /x\u00b2\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = [600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 ) * y\u00b2 ] /x\u00b2 = [600 y\u00b2 ] / (11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nBut from equation (2), y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -60)/5\n\nSo, plug that in:\n\na\u00b2=600*(6x\u00b2 -60)/5 / (11x\u00b2 -360 ) = [120*(6x\u00b2 -60) ] / (11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nCompute numerator: 120*(6x\u00b2 -60)=720x\u00b2 -7200\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -360\n\nSo, a\u00b2=(720x\u00b2 -7200)/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 720x\u00b2 -7200 =720(x\u00b2 -10 )\n\nDenominator:11x\u00b2 -360\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 =720(x\u00b2 -10)/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 )=4*[720(x\u00b2 -10)/(11x\u00b2 -360 ) +600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 ) ]\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=4*[ (720x\u00b2 -7200 +600x\u00b2 ) / (11x\u00b2 -360 ) ]\n\n=4*[ (1320x\u00b2 -7200 ) / (11x\u00b2 -360 ) ]\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200= 1320(x\u00b2 ) -7200= 1320(x\u00b2 - (7200/1320))=1320(x\u00b2 - 5.4545... )\n\nWait, maybe factor out 120:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200=120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )\n\nAh, 120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*[120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -360 ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n=4*120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\n=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nHmm, that's interesting.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNotice that 11x\u00b2 -60 and 11x\u00b2 -360. Let me denote z=11x\u00b2.\n\nThen, BD\u00b2=480*(z -60)/(z -360 )\n\nBut I can write this as 480*( (z -60)/(z -360) )\n\nLet me see, perhaps I can write this as:\n\n(z -60)/(z -360 ) = [ (z -360 ) + 300 ] / (z -360 )=1 + 300/(z -360 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(1 + 300/(z -360 ))=480 + 480*300/(z -360 )\n\nWait, but z=11x\u00b2, and from equation (2), 6x\u00b2 -5 y\u00b2=60.\n\nAnd since the hyperbola is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1, which is a hyperbola opening along the x-axis. So, x\u00b2 must be greater than or equal to 20 for real points.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 >=20.\n\nSo, z=11x\u00b2 >=11*20=220.\n\nSo, z >=220.\n\nSo, z -360 >=220-360= -140.\n\nBut BD\u00b2 expression: 480*(z -60)/(z -360 )\n\nWait, denominator z -360 can be positive or negative.\n\nWait, z=11x\u00b2, which is >=220.\n\nSo, z-360 >=220-360=-140.\n\nSo, when z=220, denominator is -140.\n\nWhen z approaches 360 from below, denominator approaches 0 from below, so BD\u00b2 tends to negative infinity? That can't be right because BD\u00b2 is a square of length, so it must be positive.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, BD\u00b2 is 480*(11x\u00b2 -60)/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nSince 11x\u00b2 -360 = z -360. If z=11x\u00b2 >=220, then z-360 >=-140.\n\nBut if z-360 is negative, then BD\u00b2 becomes negative, which can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests a problem with my earlier calculation. Maybe I messed up the signs.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nFrom equation (1): ax + by =0.\n\nFrom equation (3): a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFrom equation (2): x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThen, I derived a = - (b y)/x.\n\nPlugging into equation (3):\n\n( (b\u00b2 y\u00b2)/x\u00b2 ) /20 - b\u00b2/24=1\n\nWhich is (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/(20 x\u00b2 ) - (b\u00b2)/24=1\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2 ) - 1/24 ] =1\n\nSo, b\u00b2=1/[ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]\n\nThen, I expressed y\u00b2 in terms of x\u00b2 from equation (2): y\u00b2= (6x\u00b2 -60)/5.\n\nWait, let's plug that in.\n\nSo, y\u00b2= (6x\u00b2 -60)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2=1/[ ( (6x\u00b2 -60)/5 )/(20x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(6x\u00b2 -60)/(5*20x\u00b2) -1/24 = (6x\u00b2 -60)/(100x\u00b2) -1/24\n\nCompute:\n\n= [ (6x\u00b2 -60)*24 - 100x\u00b2 ] / (100x\u00b2 *24 )\n\nWait, no, actually, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (6x\u00b2 -60)/(100x\u00b2 )= (6x\u00b2)/(100x\u00b2 ) -60/(100x\u00b2 )=6/100 - 60/(100x\u00b2 )=3/50 - 3/(5x\u00b2 )\n\nSecond term: -1/24\n\nSo, the entire denominator is 3/50 -3/(5x\u00b2 ) -1/24.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nConvert all to common denominator, which would be 600.\n\n3/50=36/600\n\n-3/(5x\u00b2 )= -36/(600x\u00b2 )\n\n-1/24= -25/600\n\nSo, sum is (36 -25)/600 -36/(600x\u00b2 )=11/600 - 36/(600x\u00b2 )\n\nSo, denominator is (11 - 36/x\u00b2 )/600\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2=1/[ (11 -36/x\u00b2 )/600 ] =600/(11 -36/x\u00b2 )\n\nWhich is 600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nWait, that seems different from what I had earlier. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, earlier I had b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 ), but now I see that 600/(11 -36/x\u00b2 )=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nAh, so earlier I had a mistake in calculation.\n\nSo, correct expression is b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSimilarly, a\u00b2=(b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/x\u00b2 = [600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) * y\u00b2 ]/x\u00b2=600 y\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nBut y\u00b2=(6x\u00b2 -60)/5.\n\nSo, plug that in:\n\na\u00b2=600*(6x\u00b2 -60 )/(5*(11x\u00b2 -36 ))= (600/5)*(6x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )=120*(6x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSo, a\u00b2= [720x\u00b2 -7200 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )=4*( [720x\u00b2 -7200 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) + [600x\u00b2 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) )\n\nCombine terms:\n\n=4*( [720x\u00b2 -7200 +600x\u00b2 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) )\n\n=4*( [1320x\u00b2 -7200 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200= 1320(x\u00b2 - (7200/1320))=1320(x\u00b2 - 5.4545 )\n\nHmm, alternatively, factor 120:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200 =120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 ))=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nLet me denote t=11x\u00b2.\n\nSince x\u00b2 >=20, t=11x\u00b2 >=220.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t -60)/(t -36 )\n\nNow, let me simplify this expression.\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(t -60)/(t -36 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*[ (t -36 ) + (-24) ] / (t -36 )=480*[1 -24/(t -36 ) ]\n\nSo, that's 480*[1 -24/(t -36 ) ]=480 - (480*24)/(t -36 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 - 11520/(t -36 )\n\nSince t >=220, t-36 >=220 -36=184.\n\nSo, t -36 >=184, so 1/(t -36 ) <=1/184.\n\nThus, the term 11520/(t -36 ) <=11520/184= let's compute this:\n\n11520 \u00f7 184.\n\nCompute 184*60=11040, 184*62=11040 + 368=11408. 184*63=11408+184=11592, which is more than 11520.\n\nSo, 184*62=11408.\n\n11520 -11408=112.\n\nSo, 11520=184*62 +112.\n\nSo, 11520/184=62 +112/184=62 + 28/46=62 +14/23\u224862.6087\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 -11520/(t -36 ) >=480 -62.6087\u2248417.3913.\n\nWait, no, actually, since t-36 is in the denominator, and t-36 >=184, then 11520/(t -36 ) <=11520/184\u224862.6087.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480 - something <=62.6087.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 >=480 -62.6087\u2248417.3913.\n\nBut wait, that's the lower bound. Wait, no, BD\u00b2=480 - [something positive], so as the something decreases, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nWait, wait, no, BD\u00b2=480 - [something positive], so as [something] decreases, BD\u00b2 increases.\n\nWait, [something]=11520/(t -36 )\n\nt-36 increases as t increases, so [something] decreases as t increases.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 increases as t increases.\n\nSo, as t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the maximum BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but doesn't reach it because t can't be infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is less than 480.\n\nHence, the supremum of BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest integer less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 479.\n\nWait, but let's check if BD\u00b2 can actually approach 480.\n\nWhen t approaches infinity, which means x\u00b2 approaches infinity, which is possible because the hyperbola extends to infinity.\n\nSo, as x approaches infinity, t=11x\u00b2 also approaches infinity.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 -0=480.\n\nHence, the supremum is 480. Therefore, the greatest integer less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 479.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but never actually reach it.\n\nYes, as x becomes very large, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is 480, but since BD\u00b2 is strictly less than 480, the greatest integer less than BD\u00b2 is 479.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 417.3913, but the supremum is 480, but the question is about the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses.\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I misread. It's the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, that number must be less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nWait, so we need to find the maximum lower bound for BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to some number, and we need the greatest such number.\n\nWait, earlier, I found that BD\u00b2 >=417.3913, but when t approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480, but when t is minimal, which is t=220, x\u00b2=20.\n\nWait, let me compute BD\u00b2 when t=220.\n\nt=220,\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(220 -60)/(220 -36 )=480*(160)/(184 )\n\n160/184=40/46=20/23\u22480.8696\n\nSo,\n\n480*(20/23 )=480*0.8696\u2248417.391\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, when t=220, BD\u00b2\u2248417.391, which is the minimal value of BD\u00b2.\n\nBut as t increases, BD\u00b2 increases approaching 480.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 can be as small as approximately 417.391 and as large as approaching 480.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, that number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is about 417.391, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be the minimal BD\u00b2, because any number larger than that would not be less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus with minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because BD\u00b2 can be as small as ~417 and as large as approaching 480. So, the number we're looking for must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if I pick a number like 417.391, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=417.391, the number is not less than BD\u00b2, it's equal. So, the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, which is 417.391, but since BD\u00b2 can be as small as that, the number we are looking for is the infimum, but we need the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, which would be the infimum.\n\nBut the question says, \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nTherefore, the maximum such number is the infimum of BD\u00b2, because if you pick a number higher than the infimum, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2 equal to the infimum, the number would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is approximately 417.391, which is 480*(220 -60)/(220 -36 )=480*(160)/(184 )=480*(40/46 )=480*(20/23 )\u2248417.391.\n\nBut 480*(20/23 ) is exactly 9600/23 \u2248417.3913.\n\nSo, the infimum is 9600/23, which is approximately 417.3913.\n\nBut 9600 \u00f723: Let's compute 23*417=23*(400 +17)=9200 +391=9591.\n\n9600-9591=9. So, 9600/23=417 +9/23\u2248417.3913.\n\nSo, the infimum is 9600/23.\n\nBut the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, this number must be less than or equal to 9600/23, but since BD\u00b2 can be as low as 9600/23, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 9600/23, because if you take any number larger than that, it would not be less than BD\u00b2 for the rhombus where BD\u00b2=9600/23.\n\nWait, no, because the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, the number must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 9600/23\u2248417.3913.\n\nWait, but 9600/23 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so any number less than that would satisfy being less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, but the greatest such number is 9600/23, because if you take a number larger than that, it would not satisfy for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23.\n\nWait, no, the number has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if the minimal BD\u00b2 is m, then any number less than m will satisfy the condition, but the greatest such number is m itself because m is the least upper bound for numbers that are less than all BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think differently. The problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. That is, find the maximum L such that L < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nSo, L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, because if L were greater than the minimal BD\u00b2, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2 equal to the minimal, L would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no! Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIf L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, then L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2. Because if L is greater than the minimal BD\u00b2, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2 equal to the minimal, L would not be less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, actually, the greatest such L is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because the minimal BD\u00b2 is the smallest BD\u00b2, so for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 >= minimal BD\u00b2. So, if we set L equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, then L is less than or equal to BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2\". So, if L is equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2 equal to minimal BD\u00b2, L is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but if L is less than the minimal BD\u00b2, then it's less than all BD\u00b2, but L would have to be as close as possible to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, the supremum of all such L is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut since L must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, then L must be less than or equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it numerically.\n\nThe minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23\u2248417.3913.\n\nSo, for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2 >=417.3913.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is L=417.3913, because if you take L=417.3913, it's equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, so for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=417.3913, L is not less than BD\u00b2. So, you have to take L less than that. But then, the greatest such L is just less than 417.3913.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, the maximum L such that L <= BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but strictly less.\n\nWait, but in reality, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 9600/23, so the greatest L is 9600/23, but since L must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, the only way is to take L=9600/23 because if you take any number greater than that, it won't satisfy for the minimal rhombus.\n\nWait, but L must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if L is less than 9600/23, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, L is less than BD\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that would be the maximum L such that L < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be as small as 9600/23, any L greater than 9600/23 would not satisfy for the minimal BD\u00b2. Therefore, the maximum possible L is 9600/23.\n\nWait, but L must be less than BD\u00b2, so if L is equal to 9600/23, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, L is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, actually, L must be less than 9600/23.\n\nBut then, the supremum of such L is 9600/23, but since L must be strictly less, the greatest real number is 9600/23.\n\nWait, but in real numbers, there is no greatest number less than 9600/23, because you can always add an epsilon. But perhaps the question is expecting an integer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, it's a real number, not necessarily integer.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" Usually, in these problems, it's an integer. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me re-read.\n\n\"Let A, B, C, and D be points on the hyperbola (x\u00b2/20) - (y\u00b2/24)=1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, they're asking for the supremum of BD\u00b2, which is 480, but since BD\u00b2 approaches 480 but never reaches it, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses would be 480. But wait, no, because BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480, but for each rhombus, BD\u00b2 is less than 480.\n\nWait, no, for each rhombus, BD\u00b2 is less than 480, but the supremum is 480.\n\nBut the problem is to find the greatest real number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nWait, if L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, then L must be less than or equal to the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, because if L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, then L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if L is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, then L must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, for example, if BD\u00b2 can be as small as 417.3913, then any L less than 417.3913 satisfies L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. But the greatest such L is approaching 417.3913 from below.\n\nBut in reality, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 417.3913, the maximum L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 417.3913, because if you take L=417.3913, it's equal to the minimal BD\u00b2, which doesn't satisfy L < BD\u00b2.\n\nSo, L must be less than 417.3913.\n\nBut then, the supremum of such L is 417.3913, but it's not attainable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 480, but that can't be because BD\u00b2 is always less than 480.\n\nWait, no, because BD\u00b2 can approach 480, so any number less than 480 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses except those approaching 480. But the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have BD\u00b2=480*(11x\u00b2 -60)/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nWhen x\u00b2 approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nWhen x\u00b2 is minimal, which is 20, BD\u00b2=480*(220 -60)/(220 -36 )=480*160/184=480*(40/46 )=480*(20/23 )=9600/23\u2248417.391.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 is in the interval (9600/23,480).\n\nTherefore, for all rhombuses, BD\u00b2>9600/23 and BD\u00b2<480.\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, the number must be less than BD\u00b2 for every rhombus.\n\nWhich means, the number must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 9600/23.\n\nWait, no. Because if the number is less than 9600/23, then it's less than all BD\u00b2 since BD\u00b2>9600/23.\n\nBut wait, no, BD\u00b2 is greater than 9600/23, so if L is less than 9600/23, then L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nBut the problem is to find the greatest such L, which is the supremum of all L's less than 9600/23.\n\nBut 9600/23 is the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest L is 9600/23.\n\nBut since L must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, and the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23, then L must be less than or equal to 9600/23.\n\nBut if L is equal to 9600/23, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, L is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nHence, the greatest L is just below 9600/23.\n\nBut in real numbers, the supremum is 9600/23.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, perhaps the answer is 9600/23, since it's the infimum of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is always greater than 9600/23, so 9600/23 is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nWait, no, because 9600/23 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, 9600/23 is equal to BD\u00b2, not less.\n\nSo, the correct answer is that L must be less than 9600/23, but the greatest such L is 9600/23.\n\nWait, but L must be strictly less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, if L is 9600/23, then for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, L is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nWait, but this is confusing. Let me think about it differently.\n\nImagine the set S of all BD\u00b2 for such rhombuses. S is the interval (9600/23, 480). So, we need to find the greatest L such that L < s for all s in S.\n\nBut since S starts just above 9600/23, the greatest such L is 9600/23, but since 9600/23 is not in S, the supremum of such L is 9600/23.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, in reality, 9600/23 is the infimum of BD\u00b2, so it's the greatest lower bound for BD\u00b2. But L needs to be less than all BD\u00b2, so L can be as close as possible to 9600/23, but not exceeding it.\n\nBut in terms of real numbers, the supremum of all such L is 9600/23. So, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut let me check, perhaps I messed up in my earlier steps.\n\nWait, when t=220, BD\u00b2=480*(220-60)/(220-36)=480*160/184=480*(40/46 )=480*(20/23 )=9600/23\u2248417.391.\n\nBut 9600/23 is approximately 417.391, and BD\u00b2 can be as small as that, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 9600/23, because if you take any number larger than that, it would not satisfy for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23.\n\nBut wait, no, because the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\" So, if L=9600/23, for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23, L is not less than BD\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, L must be less than 9600/23.\n\nBut then, the greatest such L is approaching 9600/23 from below. But since the problem asks for a specific real number, perhaps they expect 9600/23, but considering BD\u00b2 approaches 480, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23, and the maximal BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, the number must be less than the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 9600/23.\n\nBut if L is less than 9600/23, then it's less than all BD\u00b2, but the greatest such L is 9600/23.\n\nBut since 9600/23 is the infimum, which is not attained, the supremum of all L's less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 9600/23.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 9600/23, which is approximately 417.3913.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses. So, the answer is 9600/23, which is approximately 417.3913.\n\nBut the problem may expect an integer, but it says \"greatest real number.\" So, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut 9600 divided by 23 is 417 and 9/23.\n\nSo, the final answer is 9600/23, which is approximately 417.391, but as a fraction, it's 9600/23.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation of BD\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nAfter correcting the mistake, I had:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nThen, with t=11x\u00b2, so t>=220.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=480*(t -60)/(t -36 )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*( (t -36 ) + (-24) )/(t -36 )=480*(1 -24/(t -36 ))=480 - 11520/(t -36 )\n\nSo, as t increases, 11520/(t -36 ) decreases, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from below.\n\nWhen t=220, BD\u00b2=480 -11520/(220 -36 )=480 -11520/184=480 -62.6087\u2248417.3913.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 has a minimal value of 9600/23\u2248417.3913 and approaches 480 as t increases.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23, and the maximal BD\u00b2 approaches 480.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nThat is, find L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses.\n\nSince BD\u00b2 can be as small as 9600/23, the number L must be less than 9600/23.\n\nBut the greatest L is approaching 9600/23 from below.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the greatest real number, so it's 9600/23.\n\nWait, but L must be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, which means L must be less than or equal to the minimal BD\u00b2.\n\nBut L can be equal to the minimal BD\u00b2 only if it's strictly less. Since L must be strictly less, the supremum is 9600/23, but it's not attainable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut to write it as a box, should I write it as a fraction or decimal?\n\nThe problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So, likely as a fraction.\n\n9600 divided by 23 is 417 with remainder 9, so 9600/23=417 +9/23=417.3913...\n\nBut 9600/23 cannot be simplified further, so the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps, and actually, the minimal BD\u00b2 is not 9600/23, but something else.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculations.\n\nFrom equation (1): ax + by=0.\n\nFrom equation (2): x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFrom equation (3): a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFrom equation (1): a = - (b y)/x.\n\nSubstitute into equation (3):\n\n( (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/x\u00b2 )/20 - b\u00b2/24=1 => (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/(20 x\u00b2 ) - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2: b\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20 x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nFrom equation (2): y\u00b2= (6x\u00b2 -60)/5.\n\nPlug into the expression:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (6x\u00b2 -60)/(5*20x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n(6x\u00b2 -60)/(100x\u00b2 ) -1/24 = [ (6x\u00b2 -60)*24 -100x\u00b2 ] / (100x\u00b2 *24 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(6x\u00b2 -60)*24=144x\u00b2 -1440\n\nSubtract 100x\u00b2: 144x\u00b2 -1440 -100x\u00b2=44x\u00b2 -1440\n\nSo, denominator: 2400x\u00b2\n\nSo, expression becomes (44x\u00b2 -1440)/(2400x\u00b2 )= [44x\u00b2 -1440]/(2400x\u00b2 )\n\nFactor numerator: 4*(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nDenominator:2400x\u00b2=48*50x\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ 4*(11x\u00b2 -360 )/(2400x\u00b2 ) ]=1\n\nSimplify:\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11x\u00b2 -360 )/(600x\u00b2 ) ]=1\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -360 )\n\nWait, earlier I had b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nWait, this is conflicting. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the initial substitution, I think I messed up the denominator.\n\nWait, equation (1): ax + by=0.\n\nEquation (2): x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1.\n\nEquation (3): a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nFrom equation (1): a= - (b y)/x.\n\nPlug into equation (3):\n\n( (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/x\u00b2 ) /20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nSo,\n\n( b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/(20x\u00b2 ) - (b\u00b2)/24=1.\n\nFactor b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 [ y\u00b2/(20x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nFrom equation (2): y\u00b2= (6x\u00b2 -60)/5.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ (6x\u00b2 -60)/(5*20x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n5*20x\u00b2=100x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ (6x\u00b2 -60)/(100x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(6x\u00b2 -60)/(100x\u00b2 )=6/(100) -60/(100x\u00b2 )=3/50 - 3/(5x\u00b2 )\n\nSecond term: -1/24.\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [3/50 -3/(5x\u00b2 ) -1/24 ]=1.\n\nFind common denominator for the terms inside the brackets. Let's compute:\n\nConvert 3/50, -3/(5x\u00b2 ), and -1/24 to a common denominator.\n\nThe common denominator would be 600x\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n3/50=36/600\n\n-3/(5x\u00b2 )=-36/(600x\u00b2 )\n\n-1/24= -25/600\n\nSo,\n\n36/600 -25/600 -36/(600x\u00b2 )= (11)/600 -36/(600x\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 [ (11 -36/x\u00b2 )/600 ]=1\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2=600/(11 -36/x\u00b2 )=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nAh, so earlier I had a mistake in the denominator. It's 11x\u00b2 -36, not 11x\u00b2 -360.\n\nSo, correcting that, b\u00b2=600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSimilarly, a\u00b2= (b\u00b2 y\u00b2 )/x\u00b2= [600x\u00b2/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) ] * [ (6x\u00b2 -60)/5 ] /x\u00b2=600*(6x\u00b2 -60 )/(5*(11x\u00b2 -36 ))=120*(6x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSo, a\u00b2= [720x\u00b2 -7200 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=4(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )=4*( [720x\u00b2 -7200 +600x\u00b2 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) )\n\n=4*( [1320x\u00b2 -7200 ]/(11x\u00b2 -36 ) )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200=1320(x\u00b2 - (7200/1320 ))=1320(x\u00b2 -5.4545 )\n\nAlternatively, factor 120:\n\n1320x\u00b2 -7200=120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2=4*(120*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 ))=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, my earlier steps were correct.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2=480*(11x\u00b2 -60 )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )=480*( (11x\u00b2 -36 ) + (-24) )/(11x\u00b2 -36 )=480*(1 -24/(11x\u00b2 -36 ))=480 - 11520/(11x\u00b2 -36 )\n\nSince x\u00b2 >=20, 11x\u00b2 -36 >=220 -36=184.\n\nThus, 11520/(11x\u00b2 -36 )<=11520/184\u224862.6087.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2=480 - something <=62.6087.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2>=480 -62.6087\u2248417.3913.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23\u2248417.3913.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is 9600/23.\n\nBut the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses. So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 9600/23, any number greater than that would not satisfy the condition for the rhombus with BD\u00b2=9600/23.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number L such that L < BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses is L=9600/23.\n\nBut since L must be strictly less than BD\u00b2, and the minimal BD\u00b2 is 9600/23, the supremum of all such L is 9600/23.\n\nSo, the answer is 9600/23.\n\nBut to express it as a box, I think the problem expects it in fraction form.\n\nSo, 9600 divided by 23 is 417 and 9/23, so 9600/23 is the exact value.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9600}{23}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombuses is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9600}{23}}.\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombuses \\(ABCD\\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. **Points on the Hyperbola**: Points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) lie on the hyperbola and form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Thus, if \\(A = (x, y)\\), then \\(C = (-x, -y)\\), and if \\(B = (a, b)\\), then \\(D = (-a, -b)\\).\n\n2. **Distance Conditions**: Since \\(ABCD\\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. This leads to the condition \\(ax + by = 0\\).\n\n3. **Hyperbola Equations**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) satisfy the hyperbola equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expressing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**: Using the condition \\(ax + by = 0\\), we express \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\), \\(x\\), and \\(y\\). Substituting into the hyperbola equations, we derive expressions for \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\).\n\n5. **BD\u00b2 Calculation**: Using the derived expressions, we find:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 480 \\cdot \\frac{11x^2 - 60}{11x^2 - 36}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying BD\u00b2**: Rewriting \\(BD^2\\) as:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = 480 - \\frac{11520}{11x^2 - 36}\n   \\]\n   We analyze the behavior of \\(BD^2\\) as \\(x^2\\) varies. The minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) occurs when \\(x^2 = 20\\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 = \\frac{9600}{23}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombuses is the infimum of \\(BD^2\\), which is \\(\\frac{9600}{23}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{9600}{23}}\\).",
