This is because the central angles corresponding to these steps differ by 90 degrees, ensuring the chords are perpendicular.\n\n2. **Valid Step Size Pairs**:\n   - The valid pairs of step sizes `(m, n)` where `|m - n| = 3` are `(1, 4)`, `(2, 5)`, and `(3, 6)`. Each pair represents two perpendicular directions that can form the sides of a rectangle.\n\n3. **Counting Rectangles for Each Pair**:\n   - For each valid pair `(m, n)`, there are 12 possible starting vertices in the dodecagon. However, each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner), so the number of unique rectangles per pair is `12 / 4 = 3`.\n\n4. **Total Number of Rectangles**:\n   - Since there are three valid step size pairs, the total number of rectangles is `3 pairs * 3 rectangles per pair = 9`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon under the given conditions is:\n\n\\boxed{9}"
