The torus has a major radius of 6 and a minor radius of 3, while the sphere has a radius of 11.\n\nTo solve this, we consider the geometry of the torus and sphere. The torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away from its center. The sphere is centered at the origin with a radius of 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, it is tangent along a circle, and when it is outside, it is tangent along another circle. The key is to find the radii of these tangent circles.\n\nBy analyzing the cross-sections and using the equations of the torus and sphere, we determine that the radii of the tangent circles are found by solving for the points where the distance from the origin matches the conditions for tangency. After solving the equations and considering the geometry, we find that the difference between the internal and external radii is \\( \\frac{20}{3} \\).\n\nThus, the difference \\( r_i - r_o = \\frac{20}{3} \\), where \\( m = 20 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n = 23 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The value of \\( m + n \\) is \\boxed{23}."
