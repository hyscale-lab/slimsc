Okay, so I have this math problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits, and there are some conditions about the sums. Hmm, let me try to understand it properly.

The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns, right? So each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9. The problem says that when you read the grid left to right, you form two numbers, and their sum should be 999. Also, when you read the grid top to bottom, you form three numbers, and their sum should be 99. 

Let me visualize the grid. It's like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the two numbers formed left to right are "abc" and "def". So, the first number is 100a + 10b + c, and the second is 100d + 10e + f. Their sum should be 999. So,

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

And then, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number: "ad", "be", "cf". So, each of these is 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f. Their sum should be 99. So,

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me write these equations more neatly.

Equation (1): 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation (2): 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Wait, maybe I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) or something. Let me see.

Let me subtract equation (2) multiplied by some factor from equation (1) to eliminate variables. Alternatively, maybe simplify both equations.

Looking at equation (2):

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me group terms:

(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Similarly, equation (1):

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Let me group this as well:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Hmm. So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Let me define variables for the sums:

Let me denote S1 = a + d,

S2 = b + e,

S3 = c + f.

Then equation (1) becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation (2) is:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps yet. Wait, maybe I can express equation (2) in terms of S1, S2, S3 somehow.

Wait, because S1 = a + d,

S2 = b + e,

S3 = c + f.

So, a + b + c = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) - (d + e + f) = S1 + S2 + S3 - (d + e + f).

Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe equation (2) can be written as 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But perhaps it's better to just work with the two equations we have.

So, equation (1): 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation (2): 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Wait, but I don't know how to relate a + b + c and d + e + f to S1, S2, S3.

Alternatively, maybe I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1). Let's see.

Equation (1): 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation (2): 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

(100a - 10a) + (10b - 10b) + (c - 10c) + (100d - d) + (10e - e) + (f - f) = 999 - 99.

So, 90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900.

Wait, let me compute it correctly:

100a -10a = 90a,

10b -10b = 0,

c -10c = -9c,

100d - d = 99d,

10e - e =9e,

f - f =0.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.

Let me write that as:

10a + 11d + e - c = 100.

Hmm. Let me think of this equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can find another way.

Wait, from equation (1):

100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

And S1, S2, S3 are sums of two digits. So each of S1, S2, S3 can be at most 18, since 9+9=18.

Wait, 999 is a three-digit number. Let me think about what 100S1 +10S2 + S3 =999 implies.

It's a number in the form of S1 S2 S3, right? Like, 100*S1 +10*S2 + S3. So that's equal to 999.

So S1 must be 9, since 100*9 =900.

Then, 10*S2 + S3 =99.

Because 999 - 900 =99.

So, 10*S2 + S3=99.

So, S2 is the tens digit and S3 is the units digit of 99. So, 10*S2 + S3=99.

So, S2 must be 9, because 10*9=90, and then S3 would be 9. Because 90 +9=99.

So, so far:

From equation (1):

S1 =9,

S2=9,

S3=9.

So,

S1 = a + d =9,

S2 = b + e =9,

S3 = c + f=9.

That's a key insight. Because the first equation gives us that.

So, now, each of a + d, b + e, c + f equals 9.

Now, going back to equation (2):

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) =99.

But since each of a +d =9, etc., let's compute a + b + c and d + e + f.

Because, a + d =9 → d=9 -a,

b + e=9 → e=9 -b,

c + f=9 → f=9 -c.

So, d=9−a,

e=9−b,

f=9−c.

So, d + e + f = (9−a) + (9−b) + (9−c) = 27 - (a + b + c).

So, equation (2) is:

10*(a + b + c) + [27 - (a + b + c)] =99.

Let me compute that.

Let me let x = a + b + c.

Then equation (2) becomes:

10x + (27 - x) = 99.

So,

10x +27 -x =99,

9x +27=99,

9x=72,

x=8.

So, a + b + c=8.

Therefore, a + b + c=8,

and d + e + f=27 -8=19.

So, now, I have a + d=9,

b + e=9,

c + f=9.

And a + b + c=8,

d + e + f=19.

So, now, I have to find the number of possible digits a,b,c,d,e,f such that:

1. a + d=9,

2. b + e=9,

3. c + f=9,

4. a + b + c=8,

5. d + e + f=19.

Wait, but since d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c,

so d + e + f=27 - (a + b + c)=27 -8=19. Which checks out.

So, now, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible digits a,b,c, each from 0-9, such that:

a + b + c=8,

and each of a, b, c is a digit (0-9).

Moreover, for each of a, b, c, the corresponding d=9−a must be a digit (0-9). So, 9−a must be between 0 and 9, which implies that a must be between 0 and9, which it already is.

So, the constraints are:

a, b, c ∈ {0,1,...,9},

and a + b + c=8.

So, the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where each a, b, c is between 0 and9.

But since 8 is less than 9*3=27, and 8 is less than 9, all possible solutions will have a, b, c ≤9, so we don't need to worry about the upper bounds. So, the number of solutions is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions without considering the upper limit.

Wait, but wait. Each of a, b, c can be 0, but are they allowed to be zero? The problem says it's a digit, so 0 is allowed. So, yes, a, b, c can be 0.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer triples (a,b,c) such that a + b + c=8.

The formula for that is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

So, 45 solutions.

But wait, but each of a, b, c can be 0-9, but in this case, since 8 is small, no a, b, c will exceed 9. So, yes, 45.

But wait, each of a, b, c must be a digit, so 0-9, but in this case, since 8 is small, the maximum any of them can be is 8, which is less than 9, so no problem.

But each of a, b, c has to be between 0 and 9, so in this case, all 45 solutions are acceptable.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. If a + b + c=8, then each a, b, c can be 0 up to 8, which is within 0-9.

So, yes, 45 possible triples (a,b,c).

But wait, no, because a, b, c are digits, and each can be 0-9, but in this case, since a + b + c=8, each of them can be at most 8, which is allowed.

So, the number of triples is 45.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Are all these 45 solutions allowed? Because when we have a=0, b=0, c=8, that's allowed. Similarly, a=8, b=0, c=0 is allowed. So, yes, all 45 are acceptable.

But then, for each such (a,b,c), we have d=9−a, e=9−b, f=9−c.

So, for each (a,b,c), we have a unique (d,e,f). So, each solution for (a,b,c) gives a unique solution for the entire grid.

Wait, but now, do we have any constraints on d, e, f? Well, d=9−a, so since a is a digit, d will be 9−a, which is also a digit because a is between 0 and8 (since a + b + c=8 and b,c ≥0 so a ≤8). So, d=9−a, a is up to 8, so d is at least 1. So, d is between 1 and9.

Similarly, e=9−b, and since b can be 0 to 8, e is between 1 and 9.

Same for f=9−c. So, all d, e, f are between1 and9.

So, no problem with d, e, f being digits.

Therefore, the total number of possible grids is equal to the number of possible (a,b,c) triples, which is 45.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the example given in the problem.

In the example, the grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So, a=0, b=0, c=8.

Then d=9−a=9, e=9−b=9, f=9−c=1.

So, a + b + c=0+0+8=8. That's correct.

So, this is one of the 45 possible solutions.

But wait, wait, let me think about another example. Suppose a=1, b=2, c=5. Then a + b + c=8. Then d=8, e=7, f=4.

So, the grid would be:

1 2 5

8 7 4

Which gives numbers 125 + 874=1000-1=999? Wait, 125 + 874=999. Yes.

And top to bottom, 18 + 27 +54= 18+27=45 +54=99. Yes, correct.

So, that's another valid grid.

So, in all cases, for each (a,b,c) with a + b + c=8, the corresponding d,e,f are 9−a, 9−b,9−c, which are digits, and the grid satisfies the given conditions.

So, the number of such grids is 45.

Wait, but that was quick. Did I miss something?

Wait, another thought: are the numbers formed by left to right (abc and def) allowed to have leading zeros? In the example, the first number is 008, which is 8. So, it's allowed to have leading zeros because it's a three-digit number, but as a number, 008 is 8. But the sum is 8 + 991=999. So, leading zeros are allowed because the problem says "place a digit in each cell". So, digits can be zero, leading zeros are acceptable in the numbers formed.

Similarly, for the vertical numbers, each is two digits, like "ad", which could be 09 if a=0 and d=9, which is 9 as a number. But again, leading zeros are allowed.

So, no problem.

Therefore, the total number is 45.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". So, the two numbers are abc and def. So, if abc is 008 and def is 991, their sum is 999, which is correct.

But, wait, is abc allowed to have leading zeros? I think yes, because it's a three-digit number with each cell having a digit, so 008 is a valid three-digit number in this context.

So, the count is 45.

But wait, wait. Let me think of a case where a=9. But wait, a + b + c=8. So, a cannot be 9. Because 9 +0 +0=9>8. So, a can be at most 8, same for b and c. So, a, b, c are from 0 to8.

So, the number of non-negative integer solutions is C(8 +3−1,3−1)=C(10,2)=45.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 45. So, the number of ways is 45.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99". In the example, the three numbers are 09, 09, 81, which sum to 99. But in my earlier calculation, I considered the numbers as 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f.

Wait, but in the example, a=0, d=9, so 10a + d= 0 +9=9.

Similarly, 10b + e=0 +9=9.

10c + f=8 +1=9.

So, 9 +9 +81=99. Wait, 9 +9 is 18, plus 81 is 99.

Wait, but wait, in the grid, the columns are (a,d), (b,e), (c,f). So, each is a two-digit number, but in the example, the third column is 8 and1, so 81. So, 81 is 8*10 +1.

So, the way to compute the sum is to take each column as a two-digit number and sum them. So, the sum is 9 +9 +81=99.

So, in that case, the numbers are 09, 09, 81, but as two-digit numbers, 09 is 9, 09 is 9, and 81 is 81.

So, the sum is 9 +9 +81=99.

So, in our equations, each column is 10a + d, 10b + e, 10c + f.

So, when a=0, 10a + d= d.

So, in equation (2), 10a + d + 10b + e +10c + f=99.

Which is the same as sum of the three two-digit numbers.

So, that's correct.

But, in my earlier thinking, I used the fact that a + b + c=8, and then d + e + f=19.

And each of the columns, when summed as 10a +d, etc., gives 99.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, all the reasoning seems correct.

So, the number of ways is 45.

Wait, but wait. I just thought of something else. Are a, b, c, d, e, f allowed to be 9? For example, a=9. But in our case, a can't be 9 because a + b + c=8, so a can't exceed 8. So, a, b, c can be 0-8, and d=9−a, so d=1-9.

So, for example, a=8, then d=1.

So, all digits are allowed, as long as the constraints are satisfied.

So, 45 is the correct number.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the columns. Each column must form a two-digit number, so for example, a and d must form a two-digit number, so a can be 0, but d is non-zero? Wait, no. Because a=0 is allowed, and d=9, so 0 and9 form 09, which is 9.

So, leading zeros in the two-digit numbers are allowed because it's just a digit in the tens place. So, 09 is a valid two-digit number, meaning that a can be 0. So, no problem.

So, everything seems okay.

Therefore, the answer is 45.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{45}.


We need to find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid such that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

The grid is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\ \hline
d & e & f \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]

The two numbers formed left to right are \(100a + 10b + c\) and \(100d + 10e + f\). Their sum is 999. The three numbers formed top to bottom are \(10a + d\), \(10b + e\), and \(10c + f\). Their sum is 99.

We have the following equations:
1. \(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999\)
2. \(10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99\)

We define:
- \(S1 = a + d\)
- \(S2 = b + e\)
- \(S3 = c + f\)

From equation (1), we get:
\[100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999\]
This implies \(S1 = 9\), \(S2 = 9\), and \(S3 = 9\).

From equation (2), we get:
\[10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99\]
Since \(d = 9 - a\), \(e = 9 - b\), and \(f = 9 - c\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99\]
Let \(x = a + b + c\). Then:
\[10x + 27 - x = 99\]
\[9x + 27 = 99\]
\[9x = 72\]
\[x = 8\]

Thus, \(a + b + c = 8\). The number of non-negative integer solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) is given by the combination formula \(C(8 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(10, 2) = 45\).

Therefore, the number of ways to place the digits in the grid is \(\boxed{45}\).
