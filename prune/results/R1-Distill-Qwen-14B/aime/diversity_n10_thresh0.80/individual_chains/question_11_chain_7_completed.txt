Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

First, I know that z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. So, |z| = 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Maybe that's a good starting point.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared. Wait, actually, since |z| = 4, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ} because |z| squared is 16, and z̄ is 4e^{-iθ}, so 1/z is z̄ / |z|² = (4e^{-iθ}) / 16 = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}
And (96 + 144i)/z becomes (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Simplify both terms:

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4 = 300 + 468i, so term1 = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) = 24 + 36i, so term2 = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let me denote e^{iθ} as e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and similarly e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding term1: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Multiply out:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ
Combine like terms:
Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Similarly, term2: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
Multiply out:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
Again, i^2 = -1:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ
Combine like terms:
Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Now, add term1 and term2 together:

Real parts:
(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But since we only care about the real part, we can focus on 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, the real part of the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as θ varies. That is, maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude, and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C.

So, let's compute C for the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) where A = 324 and B = -432.

Calculating C:
C = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2)

Let me compute 324^2 and 432^2.

324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, then 24^2=576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14400. So 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 432 is 400 + 32. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let's see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 = 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So C is 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm.

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, in the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but with B negative.

So, the maximum is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = 540. So that's correct.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression, we simplify and find the real part. This real part is of the form \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), and its maximum value is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Calculating this gives us the maximum real part as 540.

The largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
