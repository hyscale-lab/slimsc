Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The goal is that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999, and when I read them top to bottom, their sum should be 99. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's 2 rows and 3 columns. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row has three cells. Each cell can have a digit from 0 to 9, I suppose, unless specified otherwise.

When reading left to right, each row forms a number. The top row forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row also forms a three-digit number. Their sum should be 999. So, if I denote the top row as ABC and the bottom row as DEF, then ABC + DEF = 999.

Wait, actually, in the example given, the top row is 008 and the bottom is 991. 008 is 8, and 991 is 991. 8 + 991 is 999. Oh, right, so leading zeros are allowed because 008 is just 8. So each row is a three-digit number, but the actual numerical value could be less than 100 if there are leading zeros.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is A and D, which forms the number AD, the second column is B and E, forming BE, and the third column is C and F, forming CF. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, in the example given, the columns are 09, 09, and 81. So, 09 is 9, another 09 is 9, and 81 is 81. Adding those together: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So, that works.

So, the problem is to find how many such digit arrangements exist in the grid that satisfy both these conditions: ABC + DEF = 999 and AD + BE + CF = 99.

Let me think about how to model this. Since each cell is a digit, each of A, B, C, D, E, F can be from 0 to 9. But the sums have to hold.

First, let's handle the sum of the two three-digit numbers: ABC + DEF = 999.

Expressed numerically, ABC is equal to 100*A + 10*B + C, and DEF is equal to 100*D + 10*E + F. So, their sum is 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, we can write:

100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Similarly, for the sum of the three two-digit numbers: AD + BE + CF = 99.

AD is 10*A + D, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F. So, adding them:

(10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99.

Which simplifies to:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So, now we have two equations:

1) 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999

2) 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Hmm, interesting. So, let me denote S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F.

Then equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

And equation 2 can be written as:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

But notice that A + D = S1, B + E = S2, C + F = S3.

So, A + B + C = (A + B + C) = Let's see, from the sum of S1, S2, S3:

S1 + S2 + S3 = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F).

Let me denote Total = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F). Then from equation 2, 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me let X = A + B + C, and Y = D + E + F.

So, equation 2 becomes 10X + Y = 99.

And from the sum of S1 + S2 + S3, which is (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = X + Y.

But, X + Y = S1 + S2 + S3.

Wait, but equation 1 is 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

So, let's write both equations:

1) 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

2) 10 X + Y = 99, where X = A + B + C and Y = D + E + F.

But also, X + Y = S1 + S2 + S3.

So, if I can express everything in terms of S1, S2, S3, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find possible values for S1, S2, S3 and X, Y.

From equation 1:

100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

So, 100
