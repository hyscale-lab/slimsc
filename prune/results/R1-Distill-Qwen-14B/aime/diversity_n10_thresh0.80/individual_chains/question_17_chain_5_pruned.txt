Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me break this down. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. So, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box, which means I need to find the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any vertex of the box. Since the sphere has to contain the entire box, the radius r will be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r is d/2, and r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Wait, so to minimize r², I need to minimize (x² + y² + z²)/4. That is, I need to minimize the sum x² + y² + z² given the constraints of surface area and volume.

So the problem reduces to minimizing x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This looks like a constrained optimization problem. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers or maybe some inequalities like AM-GM to solve this.

Let me first note down the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

I need to minimize S = x² + y² + z².

I remember that for three variables, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, S = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz).

Since I know xy + yz + xz is 27, then S = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to minimize S, I need to minimize (x + y + z)^2, which in turn means minimizing x + y + z.

Alternatively, if I can express x + y + z in terms of other variables, maybe I can find a relationship.

But this seems a bit tricky. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers is the way to go. Let's try that.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. The function to minimize is S = x² + y² + z², and the constraints are:

1. C1: xy + yz + xz = 27
2. C2: xyz = 23

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ1(xy + yz + xz - 27) - λ2(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ1(y + z) - λ2(yz) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂y = 2y - λ1(x + z) - λ2(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ1(x + y) - λ2(xy) = 0

Hmm, so we have three equations:

1. 2x = λ1(y + z) + λ2(yz)  [1]
2. 2y = λ1(x + z) + λ2(xz)  [2]
3. 2z = λ1(x + y) + λ2(xy)  [3]

These equations look symmetric. Maybe x = y = z? But let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then:

Surface area: 2(3x²) = 54 → 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. So each side is 3. Then, volume would be 3³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So x = y = z is not possible because it would require volume 27, but we have 23. So the box isn't a cube. Hence, x, y, z must be different.

But perhaps two variables are equal? Let's assume that x = y. Maybe that could simplify things.

Let me suppose that x = y, so then we can write equations in terms of x and z.

So, x = y.

Then, let me rewrite the constraints:

1. xy + yz + xz = x² + 2xz = 27
2. xyz = x² z = 23

So from the second equation, z = 23/(x²)

Substitute into the first equation:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27 → x² + (46/x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 = 0

Let me try to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 =
