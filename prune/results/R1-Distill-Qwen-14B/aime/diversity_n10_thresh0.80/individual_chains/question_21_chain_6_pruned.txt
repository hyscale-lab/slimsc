Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. According to the problem, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81).

So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy these two conditions. Then, find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, when n is written in base b with exactly two digits, it can be expressed as:

n = a * b + c,

where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1, and both a and c must be less than b (since in base b, digits go from 0 to b-1). So, a is in [1, b-1], and c is in [0, b-1].

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Let me write that as:

a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a * b + c).

Since a, c are non-negative integers, sqrt(n) should also be an integer because the sum of two integers is an integer. So, n must be a perfect square.

Let me denote sqrt(n) as k, so n = k^2.

So, substituting back, we have:

k = a + c,
n = a * b + c = k^2.

So, substituting k into the second equation:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange this equation:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c.

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c.

Bringing all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe I can express it differently. Let me try to group terms:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

So, this is a quadratic equation in a. For each fixed c and b, a must be an integer solution to this equation. But since a and c are digits in base b, they have constraints as mentioned before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of a and c. Let's see.

From the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c.

Let me solve for b:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a.

Simplify numerator:

(a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a = (a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1))/a.

This can be rewritten as:

b = a + 2c + (c(c - 1))/a.

Since b must be an integer (as it's a base), the term (c(c - 1))/a must be an integer. Let me denote this term as t:

t = c(c - 1)/a.

So, t must be an integer. Since a is a positive integer (digit from 1 to b-1), and c is a non-negative integer (digit from 0 to b-1), t must be a non-negative integer as well.

So, for each a and c, we can compute t, and then b = a + 2c + t.

But wait, since t = (c(c-1))/a, this implies that a must divide c(c - 1). So, a | c(c - 1). That is, a is a divisor of c(c - 1).

But since a ranges from 1 to b-1, and b is at least 2, a can't be too large. So, maybe it's better to consider possible a and c values and then compute b accordingly.

But perhaps a better approach is to parameterize in terms of k. Since k = a + c, and k^2 = a*b + c. Let's write:

k^2 = a*b + c.

But since a + c = k, we can write c = k - a. Sub
