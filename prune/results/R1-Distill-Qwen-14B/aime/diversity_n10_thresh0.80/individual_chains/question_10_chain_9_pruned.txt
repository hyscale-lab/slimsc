Hmm, let me try to figure this problem out. So, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Okay, so let's break this down. First, Bob is listing all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So, for each element 'a' in A, how many sets B have 'a' as their maximum?

Wait, if a set B has maximum 'a', then all other elements in B must be less than 'a'. So for each 'a' in A, the number of possible sets B with max 'a' is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set. Because each element less than 'a' can either be in B or not, except that B can't be empty since it's a nonempty set.

So the number of possible sets B with max 'a' is 2^{a-1} - 1. Wait, no, actually, wait. Each element less than 'a' can be either included or not, but since B must be non-empty and the maximum is 'a', the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. Because if the other elements are empty, then B is just {a}, which is a valid non-empty set.

So actually, for each 'a', the number of such sets B is 2^{a-1}. Because each of the a-1 elements can be present or not, and one of those subsets is the empty set, leading to B being just {a}.

But wait, no, wait. Because if a is the maximum, the other elements can be any subset of the elements less than a, including none. So the number of possible subsets is indeed 2^{a-1}. Because for each element less than a, you have two choices: include or exclude.

Therefore, for each a in A, the number of sets B with max a is 2^{a-1}. So the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a - 1}.

But the problem says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. So sum_{a
