Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because to go from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The question specifically asks for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that in grid path problems, we often use combinations to count the number of paths. The standard number of paths without any restrictions is C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction on the number of direction changes, which complicates things.

So, what does it mean for a path to change direction exactly four times? Well, each path consists of a series of moves either right (R) or up (U). A direction change happens when the path switches from R to U or U to R. So, if a path changes direction four times, that means it alternates between right and up four times.

Wait, actually, the number of direction changes relates to the number of runs of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, a path with four direction changes would have five runs. Because each direction change starts a new run. So, starting with either R or U, then changing four times would give five runs.

Let me confirm that. Suppose a path starts with R, then changes to U, that's one change, then back to R, that's two, and so on. So, four changes mean five runs. Each run consists of consecutive same-direction moves.

So, for an 8x8 grid, the total number of steps is 16, with 8 R and 8 U. The number of direction changes is four, so number of runs is five. Since it's a grid from lower left to upper right, the path must start either with R or U.

So, maybe I can model this as a sequence of runs, each run being a consecutive set of R's or U's. The total number of runs is five. Each run must consist of at least one step. So, I need to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's into these five runs, alternating between R and U.

Wait, but the starting direction can be either R or U, which affects the arrangement. So, two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

Let me think about each case separately.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R runs and two U runs (since five runs in total). Similarly, Case 2: starts with U, leading to three U runs and two R runs.

Wait, hold on. Five runs, starting with R: R, U, R, U, R. So three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R, U. Three U runs and two R runs.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, the total number of R and U steps are equal. So, if we have three R runs and two U runs, the sum of R runs must be 8, and the sum of U runs must also be 8. Same for the other case.

So, the problem reduces to distributing 8 R's into 3 runs, each run at least 1, and 8 U's into 2 runs, each run at least 1. Then, the number of such paths would be the product of the combinations for R and U runs, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the runs.

Wait, but actually, since the runs are fixed in order (alternating R and U), the number of ways is the number of compositions for R's and U's.

Yes, so for the first case (starting with R), we have three runs of R's: each run has at least 1 step. The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for the two runs of U's, it's C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So, the total number of such paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for the case starting with U, we have three runs of U's and two runs of R's. The number of ways for U's is C(7,2) = 21, and for R's it's C(7,1)=7. So, again, 21*7=147.

So, adding both cases, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, is that all? Let me double-check.

Each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U. So, for four direction changes, we have five runs. Whether starting with R or U, the number of runs for each direction is either 3 and 2 or 2 and 3.

Wait, in the case of starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U gives three U runs and two R runs.

In each case, the number of compositions is (number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 parts) times (number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 parts). So, for R starting: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 *7=147.

Wait, but hold on: when starting with R, the first run is R, then U, R, U, R. So, the R runs must be three, each with at least 1, summing to 8. Similarly, the U runs are two, each at least 1, summing to 8.

So, yes, number of ways for R is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21, and for U it's C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147.

Same for the other case. So, 147*2=294.

But let me think about this again. The number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five.

Is there another way to model this? Maybe using stars and bars.

Yes, the number of compositions (ways to write an integer as a sum of k positive integers) is C(n-1,k-1). So, for R's and U's, we use that.

But wait, in this case, the starting direction affects the number of R runs and U runs. So, if the starting direction is R, then we have (number of R runs) = (number of U runs) +1. Since five runs, if starting with R, R runs are 3 and U runs are 2.

So, the formula holds.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of such paths can be found by considering the number of ways to have exactly four direction changes.

Each direction change is a switch from R to U or U to R. So, each time the direction changes, the path switches.

So, the number of direction changes is four, meaning that the path switches direction four times. So, the path has five segments: for example, right, up, right, up, right, etc.

But how does this relate to the number of runs
