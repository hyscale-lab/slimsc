Okay, so I have this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem involves sets and their overlaps. I remember something about using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for these kinds of problems. 

Let me list what's given:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number of diamond ring owners: 195.
- Number of golf club owners: 367.
- Number of garden spade owners: 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900.

Wait, actually, the candy hearts are an additional item. So we have four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Each resident owns at least one of these, but actually, no, wait—the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So every resident has at least the candy hearts. But they might own more things.

Now, let's note the other numbers:

- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 own exactly three of them.

And we need to find how many own all four.

Wait, but each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So if someone owns exactly two things, does that include the candy hearts? Or are they counting only the other three items? Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the way the problem is phrased: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are universal—they're owned by
