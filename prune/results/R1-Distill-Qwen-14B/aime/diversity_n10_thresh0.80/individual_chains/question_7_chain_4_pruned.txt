Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let's try to break it down.

First, let me visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, so each has a 1/2 chance. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So our sample space is 256.

Now, the problem is about the probability that there exists a rotation (by some number of positions) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, after rotation, all the blue vertices must occupy positions that were red before any rotation was done.

Wait, so if I have a coloring, and after some rotation, all the blue vertices in the rotated configuration were originally red. That means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if I rotate the octagon so that every blue vertex is on a red, then the set of blues must be a rotated version of the set of reds.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotationally shifted) version of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so rotations correspond to cyclic shifts. So, for the coloring, we can consider the colorings as binary strings of length 8, where each bit is red or blue.

So, the condition is that the set of blue positions is a cyclic shift of the set of red positions. Hmm, but that might not capture everything because the octagon can be rotated by any number of positions, not just shifts by 1.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the colorings where the blue vertices form a rotationally symmetric pattern that's a shift of the reds. So, the set of blue vertices should be a union of some of the orbits under rotation.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of group actions. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8. So, each element of the group is a rotation by 0
