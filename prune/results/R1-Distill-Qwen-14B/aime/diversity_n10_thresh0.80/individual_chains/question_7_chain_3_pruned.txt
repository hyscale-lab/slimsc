Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then I have to find m + n.

Alright, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So, each vertex has two choices, and there are 8 vertices, meaning there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings in total. That will be the denominator of my probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract. Maybe I should think about what that means.

So, for a given coloring, we need to find a rotation (by some number of steps) such that after rotating, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, equivalently, after rotation, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the original red vertices. Or, in other words, the image of the blue set under rotation is a subset of the red set.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so all rotations are cyclic permutations. The rotations can be by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which correspond to rotating 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps, since each step is 45°. So, there are 8 possible rotations, including the identity rotation (which does nothing).

So, for a given coloring, we have 8 possible rotations to check. We need to count the number of colorings where at least one of these rotations maps all blue vertices to red positions.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that might involve group theory or Burnside's lemma. Burnside's lemma is useful for counting orbits and can sometimes be applied to problems involving group actions, like rotations.

Burnside's lemma states that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions. But in this case, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable, because we are looking for colorings that are fixed under some rotation, not all.

Alternatively, maybe inclusion-exclusion could be used here.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the colorings that satisfy the condition. Such a coloring must be such that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the image of the red vertices under some rotation. Or, in other words, the blue set is a subset of a rotation of the red set.

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because when we rotate the octagon, each blue vertex moves to a new position, and we require that all those new positions were originally red. So, another way to think about it is: the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices under some rotation.

Wait, no, actually, the blue set must be a subset of the image of the red set under some rotation. Because when
