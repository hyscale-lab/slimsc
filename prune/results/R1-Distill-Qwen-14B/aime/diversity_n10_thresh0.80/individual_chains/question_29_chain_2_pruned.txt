Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD and BC are both 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG is 17, so EH is 17, and EF is 184, so GH is 184.

Wait, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. So, the line goes through D, E, C, F in that order. So, points D and C are adjacent in the line, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the order is different. Wait, no, because in the problem statement, it's written as D, E, C, F being collinear, so the order is D-E-C-F.

So, the line is D-E-C-F. So, the distance from D to E, E to C, and C to F are parts of this line. So, CE is the segment from E to C, which is part of this line.

Now, the other condition is that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circle. That suggests that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Hmm, let me try to sketch this mentally. So, rectangle ABCD: Let's say A is at the bottom left, B is at the bottom right, C is at the top right, D is at the top left. So, AD is vertical, AB is horizontal. Rectangle EFGH: Let's say E is connected to F and G. Since E is on the line D-E-C-F, and F is a point on that line. Hmm, maybe EFGH is another rectangle adjacent to ABCD? Or is it placed somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let me try that.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (AB, 0) because AB is the length from A to B, but wait, no, AB is the length of the side. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is the length of the base, so if A is at (x,y), then B is at (x + AB, y). Hmm, maybe it's better to assign coordinates with specific positions.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to place point D at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (AB, BC). Wait, no. Wait, if ABCD is
