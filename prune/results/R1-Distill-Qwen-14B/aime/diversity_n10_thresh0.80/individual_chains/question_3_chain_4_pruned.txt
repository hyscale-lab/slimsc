Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. But if all four of her numbers match, she wins the grand prize. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

Alright, so let me parse this. It sounds like a conditional probability problem. We're looking for P(Grand Prize | Prize). That's the probability that she has all four numbers correct, given that she has at least two correct.

I remember that conditional probability is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she automatically has at least two correct numbers. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (which includes the grand prize). Then, I'll divide the two to get the conditional probability.

Let me get into the details.

First, let's compute P(Grand Prize). That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery randomly picks 4 numbers out of 10, and she picked 4 specific numbers. So, how many ways can the lottery choose 4 numbers? That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is C(10,4). And how many ways can it choose the exact four numbers she picked? Only 1 way. So, P(Grand Prize) is 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(Prize), which is the probability that she wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(Prize) is equal to the sum of probabilities of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches.

So, let's compute each of these.

The number of ways she can have exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Because she has 4 numbers, she needs to choose k of them to match, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers must come from the other 6 numbers she didn't pick.

Wait, let me make sure. The total numbers in S is 10. If she picks 4, the rest are 6. So, if she has exactly k matches, then the lottery picks k from her 4 and (4 - k) from the other 6. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k).

Let me compute each case:

1. Exactly 2 matches:
C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

2. Exactly 3 matches:
C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

3. Exactly 4 matches:
C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, total number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(Prize) is 115 / C(10,4) = 115 / 210.

Wait, but let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no. Actually, the total number of ways is C(10,4) = 210, correct. So, the number of favorable for the prize is 90 + 24 +1 = 115. So, probability is 115/210.

But wait, 115/210 can be simplified. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5 gives 23/42. Let me verify: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(Prize) is 23/42.

Wait, but let me confirm the counts again.

For exactly two matches: C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, 6*15=90.

Exactly three: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, 4*6=24.

Exactly four: 1.

Total is 90 +24 +1=115. So that seems correct.

So, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42.

Wait, but that's the probability for her winning a prize. So, that's P(Prize) = 23/42.

And P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me think again. Because 1/210 divided by 115/210 is (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

So, m is 1, n is 115. They are coprime since 1 is coprime with any
