Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, alright. So, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, right?

The product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's 13 terms multiplied together. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute this product modulo 1000.

First, maybe I should try to simplify each term. Let's see, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe factor something out or relate it to ω^k.

Wait, ω^{2k} is (ω^k)^2. So maybe let x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, the term is x² - 2x + 2.

So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k. But since ω is a primitive 13th root, ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct 13th roots of unity except 1, right? Wait, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so that term is x=1: 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So that term is 1. So, maybe the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{k})² - 2ω^k + 2.

So, the product is \prod_{k=1}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Hmm, maybe I can think of this as evaluating a polynomial at certain roots. Let me consider the polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. The product is f(ω^k) for k=1 to 12. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k).

But since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Because Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) where k runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. Since 13 is prime, all ω^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive.

So, I can think of the product over f(ω^k) as the product of f(x) evaluated at each root of Φ₁₃(x). So, maybe I can relate this to some resultant or something.

Wait, another approach: The product over f(ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to the product over (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe I can write this as the product over (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2) = (ω^{k})² - 2ω^k + 2, which is f(ω^k).

So, the product is ∏_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k). Now, since the roots of Φ₁₃(x) are ω, ω², ..., ω¹², then the product ∏_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃
