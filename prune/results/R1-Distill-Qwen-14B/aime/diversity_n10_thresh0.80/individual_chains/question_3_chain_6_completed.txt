Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

First, let me figure out the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen.

P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. Since there's only one specific set that will match her numbers, the probability is 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers match. So, this includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match. Wait, but since the grand prize is exactly four, which is already included in B, but in the conditional probability, we'll take that into account.

Alternatively, P(B) can be calculated as 1 minus the probability of not winning a prize. Not winning a prize would be having fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches. So, maybe it's easier to compute 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me think about how to calculate P(zero matches) and P(one match).

First, P(zero matches): this is the probability that none of Jen's numbers are in the chosen 4. So, all 4 chosen numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and Jen picked 4, so 6 are left). So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 not picked by Jen is C(6,4). Then, P(zero matches) is C(6,4)/C(10,4).

Calculating C(6,4) = 15, so P(zero matches) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, P(one match): this is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 is C(4,1), and the number of ways to choose the other 3 from the remaining 6 is C(6,3). So, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Calculating C(4,1) = 4 and C(6,3) = 20, so 4*20 = 80. So, P(one match) is 80/210.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - P(zero) - P(one) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me check that. 15 + 80 is 95, yes. 210 - 95 is 115. So, 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. Let's see: 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

But wait, the problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, B is the event that exactly two, three, or four of her numbers are chosen. So, another way to compute P(B) is to compute P(exactly two) + P(exactly three) + P(exactly four).

Let me check that way as well.

P(exactly two) is C(4,2)*C(6,2) / C(10,4). Let's compute that. C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15 = 90. So, 90/210.

P(exactly three) is C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24, so 24/210.

P(exactly four) is C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1, so 1/210.

Adding those up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, 115/210, same as before. So that's correct.

So, P(B) = 115/210 = 23/42 as I found earlier.

Now, P(A) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. But let me double-check.

Wait, so P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, (1/210) divided by (115/210) is indeed (1/210)*(210/115) = 1/115.

So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1.

Therefore, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute P(B) correctly? Because sometimes with conditional probabilities, it's easy to make a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, when we are given that a prize was won, which means at least two matches, and we are to compute the probability that all four match given that at least two match.

Another way to think about it is: given that in the chosen 4, at least two are among Jen's 4, what is the probability that all four are among her numbers.

So, perhaps using counting methods.

The total number of possible 4-number combinations that include at least two of Jen's numbers is equal to the number of ways to choose 2,3, or 4 numbers from her 4 and the rest from the other 6.

Which is exactly what we computed earlier as 90 + 24 +1 =115.

Out of these 115 possible winning combinations, only one of them is the grand prize (all four numbers). So, the probability is 1/115.

So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think another way. Maybe using hypergeometric distribution concepts.

The hypergeometric probability P(X = k) is [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)] / C(10,4).

So, for k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90

k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24

k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1

Total is 115, same as before.

So, the conditional probability is P(k=4)/P(B) = (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

Hence, the probability is 1/115, so m=1, n=115, m +n=116.

Wait, but hold on, is the probability 1/115? Because intuitively, the probability of four matching numbers given that at least two match is 1 over the number of possible ways to have at least two matches. Since there are 115 such ways, the probability is 1/115. That makes sense.

I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 1 + 115 = 116.


The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize in a lottery. Jen selects 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \), and 4 numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four match.

To solve this, we first compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

1. **Probability of Winning the Grand Prize (P(A))**:  
   There is only one specific set of 4 numbers that matches Jen's numbers. Thus,  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Probability of Winning a Prize (P(B))**:  
   Winning a prize includes scenarios where exactly two, three, or all four of Jen's numbers match. We calculate this as:  
   \[
   P(B) = 1 - P(\text{zero matches}) - P(\text{one match})
   \]  
   - **Zero matches**: All 4 chosen numbers are from the remaining 6.  
     \[
     P(\text{zero matches}) = \frac{\binom{6}{4}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}
     \]  
   - **One match**: 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6.  
     \[
     P(\text{one match}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{80}{210}
     \]  
   - Thus,  
     \[
     P(B) = 1 - \frac{15}{210} - \frac{80}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
     \]

3. **Conditional Probability (P(A|B))**:  
   Using the formula for conditional probability:  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
