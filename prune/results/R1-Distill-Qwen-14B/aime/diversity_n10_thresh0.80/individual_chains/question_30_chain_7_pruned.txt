Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. The minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the product I'm dealing with is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a product over all 13th roots of unity, except for ω^0 = 1 because ω ≠ 1? Wait, no, actually k goes from 0 to 12, so ω^0 is included, but ω ≠ 1 is given, so I think ω^0 is 1, but the problem states ω ≠ 1, so maybe k=0 is still included but ω^0 is 1. Hmm, but 1 is a 13th root of unity, so maybe the problem is just excluding ω=1? Or perhaps the product is over all 13th roots except 1? I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem says ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, so perhaps each term in the product is evaluated at ω^k, where k goes from 0 to 12, which would include ω^0 = 1. But since ω itself is not equal to 1, but ω^k could be 1 when k=0. Hmm, maybe I can proceed regardless, because whether k=0 is included or not, the product is from k=0 to 12. So I'll proceed with that in mind.

So, the product is over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x². So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k).

Wait, but ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. So, the product is equal to the product of f(ζ) where ζ runs through all 13th roots of unity, including 1. Therefore, the product is equal to the value of the polynomial f(x) evaluated at each root of x^13 - 1 = 0, except that x^13 - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x¹² + x
