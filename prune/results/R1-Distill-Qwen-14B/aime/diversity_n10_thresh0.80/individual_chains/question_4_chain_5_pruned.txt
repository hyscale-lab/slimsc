Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic game theory problem, probably involving something called Grundy numbers or maybe just finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions.

First, I should define what a "winning position" is. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position (n) is a losing position, then Bob can win with the right strategy. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the starting player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to find a pattern by calculating the winning (W) and losing (L) positions for small n.

Let's start:

n = 1: The first player takes 1 token and wins. So W.
n = 2: The first player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the second player who will take it and win. Wait, no, wait. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving Bob with n=1. Bob takes it and wins. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. But Alice could take 1 and let Bob take the last one. But wait, that's not good for Alice. Alternatively, can Alice take 1 and make Bob take the last one? Or maybe Alice can take 4, but n=2, she can't take 4. So for n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is L.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice can't win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n
