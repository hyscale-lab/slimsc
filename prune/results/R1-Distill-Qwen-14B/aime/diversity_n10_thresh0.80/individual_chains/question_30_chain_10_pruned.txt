Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. Here, \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, roots of unity often come up in cyclotomic polynomials, so maybe that's related. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for roots of unity, certain products can be simplified using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or by recognizing patterns. Let me write down the product expression again:

\[
P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so that's all 13th roots of unity, including 1, since when k=0, \(\omega^0 = 1\). So the product includes the term when k=0. Let me calculate that term first.

When k=0:
\(2 - 2\omega^0 + \omega^{0} = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1\).

So the first term is 1. That might not affect the product much, but I should keep that in mind.

Now, let me consider the general term for k=1 to 12, since k=0 gives 1. So the product can be written as:

\[
P = 1 \times \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

So P is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of that expression. Now, I need to compute this product. Maybe I can factor or simplify the expression inside the product somehow.

Looking at \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\), perhaps I can write it in terms of \(\omega^{k}\). Let me set \(x = \omega^k\), so the expression becomes \(2 - 2x + x^2\). So the term is \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). Hmm, that's a quadratic in x. Let me see if this quadratic factors or if it has roots related to other roots of unity.

Wait, maybe I can factor it as \(x^2 - 2x + 2\). Let me compute the discriminant: \(D = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 − 8 = −4\). So the roots are complex: \(x = [2 \pm \sqrt{-4}]/2 = [2 \pm 2i]/2 = 1 \pm i\). So the roots are complex numbers, which are 8th roots of unity? Wait, no, 1 + i is a 4th root of unity because (1 + i)^4 = (sqrt(2))^4 * e^{iπ/2 *4} = 4*(1) = 4, but (1 + i) squared is 2i, so (2i)^2 = -4, so (1+i)^4 = -4. Hmm, not exactly a root of unity, but perhaps related.

Wait, maybe I can relate this quadratic to cyclotomic polynomials. The cyclotomic polynomial Φₙ(x) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive n-th roots of unity. For n=4, Φ₄(x) = x² + 1, which has roots i and -i. But our quadratic here is x² - 2x + 2. Let me compute its value at x=1+i: (1+i)^2 - 2(1+i) + 2 = (1 + 2i + i²) - 2 - 2i + 2 = (1 + 2i -1) -2 -2i + 2 = (2i) -2 -2i +2 = 0. So x=1+i is a root, which we already saw. Similarly, x=1-i is the other root.

So perhaps the quadratic factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). Let me check that: (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)) = x² - [ (1+i) + (1-i) ]x + (1+i)(1-i) = x² - 2x + (1 + i² - i + i) = x² - 2x + (1 -1) = x² - 2x + 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, (1+i)(1-i) is 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2, so yes, that's correct. So the quadratic factors into (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).

Hmm, but how does this help me? Maybe if I consider that each term in the product is the value of this quadratic at x = ω^k, then the product becomes the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)).

So, P = product_{k=1}^{12} [ (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)) ]

Which can be written as [product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - (1-i)) ]

So, P is the product of two products, each involving 12 terms. Now, I can think about each product separately.

Let me denote Q = product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a), where a is either (1+i) or (1-i). Then, P = Q(a=1+i) * Q(a=1-i).

Now, what is Q? Well, the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - a) is related to evaluating a certain polynomial at a. Since ω^k are the 13th roots of unity except 1, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ_13(x), the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Because the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to n-1, where ω is a primitive n-th root of unity.

Wait, wait, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity, which are exactly ω^k for k from 1 to 12, since 13 is prime. So the product_{k=1}^{12} (x - ω^k) = Φ_13(x). Therefore, Q = Φ_13(a) when a is 1+i or 1-i.

So, if I denote Q(a) = Φ_13(a), then P = Φ_13(1+i) * Φ_13(1−i).

Now, I need to compute Φ
