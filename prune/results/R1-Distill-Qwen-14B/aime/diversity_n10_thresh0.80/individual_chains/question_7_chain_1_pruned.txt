Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with equal chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. Then, they want the answer in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know a regular octagon has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex can be colored red or blue with a 50% chance each. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator for our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions where there were originally red vertices. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it: after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a spot that was red before the rotation. So, the blue vertices have to align with the red positions after rotation.

Wait, but the octagon is being rotated. So, maybe we need to consider the colorings that are invariant under some rotation, but not exactly... Hmm, perhaps it's about the colorings that can be shifted so that the blue and red colors are swapped.

Wait, another approach: for a given rotation, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, if we have a coloring, and if the blue vertices are a rotated version of the red ones, then such a rotation exists.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is equivalent to the set of blue vertices being a rotation of the red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that blue vertices go to red positions, that implies that the blue positions are a rotated version of the red positions.

So, maybe we can model this as the number of colorings where the blue and red vertex sets are rotations of each other.

But how do we count that?

Wait, another way: For a coloring to satisfy the condition, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Since each coloring is a pair of sets (blue and red), and the condition is that one is a rotation of the other.

But since the octagon can be rotated in 8 different ways (including 0 degrees, which is the identity rotation), maybe we can use Burnside's lemma or something with group actions.

Wait, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps we can count the number of colorings where the blue set is equal to a rotated red set for some rotation.

Wait, let me think. For a given coloring, the red and blue sets must be in a rotational symmetry. So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

But how many such colorings are there?

Alternatively, for each possible rotation, the number of colorings that are fixed by that rotation could help. Because if we consider the group of rotations acting on the colorings, then the colorings that satisfy our condition are the colorings fixed by some rotation (maybe non-identity). Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently. For each rotation, say by k positions, the coloring must have the property that shifting the colors by k positions swaps the blue and red vertices. So, each blue vertex must correspond to a red vertex k positions away.

Wait, but the number of colorings that are symmetric under a rotation of k positions is perhaps equal to the number of colorings where the coloring is periodic with period gcd(k,8). Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for the condition to hold, the coloring must be such that the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. That is, if the red vertices are R, then the blue vertices are some rotation of R, say R shifted by k positions.

So, for each possible rotation k (from 0 to 7), the number of colorings where blue is a rotation of red by k positions would be something.

Wait, but if we count for each k, the number of colorings where the blue set is exactly the red set rotated by k, then the total would be 8 times the number of such colorings for each k, but we must be careful because some colorings may satisfy the condition for multiple k.

Wait, but actually, each such coloring is determined uniquely by the rotation. Or perhaps not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is equivalent to the number of colorings where the blue and red sets are rotational shifts of each other. So, for each rotation k, the number of colorings where blue is R shifted by k is equal to the number of colorings where if a vertex is red, then the vertex k positions away is blue, and vice versa.

Wait, that might not hold. Let me think.

Alternatively, for a particular rotation k, the condition is that for each vertex v, if v is blue, then v shifted by k is red, and vice versa. So, the color of each vertex is determined by the color of the vertex k positions away.

But this would form cycles. Because applying the rotation k multiple times should cycle through the colors.

Wait, for the octagon, shifting by k positions, the number of cycles would be equal to the greatest common divisor of k and 8. So, for example, if k=1, gcd(1,8)=1, so the rotation would have a single cycle of length 8. If k=2, gcd(2,8)=2, so two cycles of length 4, and so on.

In each cycle, the coloring must alternate red and blue? Because if you have a cycle where each vertex is determined by the next one, which is red if the previous was blue and vice versa, then each cycle must have an even number of vertices, otherwise, you'd end up with a contradiction.

Wait, so for a rotation by k, the cycles have length d, where d = 8 / gcd(k,8). Wait, no, wait, actually, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8), each of length 8/gcd(k,8). For example, k=1, gcd=1, so 1 cycle of length 8. If k=2, gcd=2, so 2 cycles of length 4. For k=3, gcd=1, so 1 cycle of length 8. For k=4, gcd=4, so 4 cycles of length 2.

Wait, 8 / gcd(k,8) is the cycle length. So, for the coloring to satisfy that blue is a rotation of red by k, each cycle must have the colors alternating.

But for that to happen, each cycle must have an even number of vertices. Because if the cycle length is even, you can alternate red and blue, but if it's odd, you can't. Because in a cycle of odd length, you'd have to alternate colors, but you'd end up with a conflict at the end.

So, for a given k, the rotation by k can be used to define a valid coloring only if all cycles have even length. Which is equivalent to 8/gcd(k,8) being even, so 8/gcd(k,8) must be even. Which implies that gcd(k,8) must be a divisor of 8 that is 8/(even number). Let me think.

Wait, 8/gcd(k,8) must be even. So, 8/gcd(k,8) is even. So, 8/gcd(k,8) is in {2,4,8} because 8 is 2^3. So, 8/gcd(k,8) must be even, which means it's 2,4, or 8. So, possible cycle lengths are 2,4,8. Wait, but 8 is also even, so that's acceptable.

Wait, but if the cycle length is 8, then 8/gcd(k,8)=8, so gcd(k,8)=1. So, for k=1,3,5,7, which are coprime to 8, the cycle length is 8.

Similarly, for k=2,4,6
