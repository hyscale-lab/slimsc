Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Hmm, let me see. The problem is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Alright, so z has a magnitude of 4, which means it's somewhere on the circle with radius 4 in the complex plane.

First, I need to figure out how to approach this. Since z is a complex number with a fixed modulus, maybe I can represent it in polar form. That might make things easier because then I can express z as 4 times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. So, z = 4e^{iθ}.

Let me write that down: z = 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would just be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because the magnitude becomes 1/4 and the argument is negative. So, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Now, plugging these into the expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Substituting z and 1/z, it becomes (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately. First, (75 + 117i)*4. Let's calculate that: 75*4 = 300, 117i*4 = 468i. So, that part is 300 + 468i, multiplied by e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second part: (96 + 144i)*(1/4). 96*(1/4) is 24, 144i*(1/4) is 36i. So, that's 24 + 36i, multiplied by e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}. Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this complex expression because the problem is asking for the largest possible real part.

So, let's denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. Then, the expression becomes A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}. The real part of this would be Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

I remember that for a complex number C multiplied by e^{iθ}, the real part is Re(C) cosθ - Im(C) sinθ. Similarly, for B e^{-iθ}, it's Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ, because e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me express A e^{iθ} as (a + ib)(cosθ + i sinθ). So, multiplying it out: a cosθ - b sinθ + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So, the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ. Similarly, for B e^{-iθ} which is (c + id)(cosθ - i sinθ). Multiplying out: c cosθ + d sinθ + i(-c sinθ + d cosθ). So, the real part is c cosθ + d sinθ.

So, combining both, the total real part is [a cosθ - b sinθ] + [c cosθ + d sinθ] = (a + c) cosθ + (-b + d) sinθ.

In our case, A is 300 + 468i, so a = 300, b = 468. B is 24 + 36i, so c = 24, d = 36. Therefore, the real part becomes (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, the goal is to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ. Because θ can vary, we need to find the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that expressions of the form K cosθ + M sinθ can be rewritten as N cos(θ + φ), where N is the amplitude, the square root of (K² + M²), and φ is some phase shift. Alternatively, since our expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is similar to K cosθ + M sinθ but with a negative sign.

Wait, so let me write that correctly: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Let me think of this as K cosθ + M sinθ, where K = 324 and M = -432.

But actually, perhaps it's easier to consider the amplitude of this sinusoidal function. The maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So, in this case, A = 324, B = -432. The maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Wait, yes, because the maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). So, the maximum real part will be sqrt(324² + 432²). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324 * 324. Let me see, 300² is 90000, 24² is 576, and the cross term is 2*300*24=14400. So, (300 + 24)² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976.

Similarly, 432 squared. 400² is 160000, 32² is 1024, cross term is 2*400*32=25600. So, (400 + 32)² = 160000 + 25600 + 1024 = 160000 + 25600 is
