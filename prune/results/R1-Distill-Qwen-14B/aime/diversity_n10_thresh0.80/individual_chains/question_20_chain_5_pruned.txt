Okay, so I have this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to place some of them into a 5x5 grid. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and if I try to add any more chips, it would violate the previous two conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the problem. I have a grid of 5x5, which is 25 cells. I can place white or black chips in these cells, but each cell can have only one chip at most. Now, the first condition says that all chips in the same row must be the same color. So, for any given row, all the chips in that row, wherever they are placed, must be either all white or all black. Similarly, the same applies to columns—every column must have all its chips of the same color.

Wait, but the problem says "some" of the chips, so not necessarily all 25. But it also says that if I add any additional chip, it would violate the conditions. So, the configuration I come up with must be maximal in the sense that I can't add another chip without breaking the row or column color uniformity.

So, the setup is that each row must be entirely white or entirely black, and each column must be entirely white or entirely black. But wait, is that the case? Because the problem says all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has no chips, then that's fine—there's no color requirement for that row. Similarly for columns. So, the non-empty rows must all have the same color, and the non-empty columns must all have the same color.

But wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The chips in the same row must all have the same color. So, if a row has some chips, they must all be white or all be black. If a row has no chips, then it doesn't impose any color requirement. Similarly for columns.

So, the grid can be thought of as a combination of white and black regions, where each row and column must be entirely white or entirely black, but they don't have to be filled. So, the non-empty rows and columns must be monochromatic.

But wait, how do
