Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the side length of a convex equilateral hexagon. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property. So, in a hexagon ABCDEF, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Right?

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300 units long. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles when dealing with extended sides in polygons. Maybe I can use similar triangles here. Let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it might be similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in certain directions.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, but in this case, it's not necessarily regular because the triangle formed by the extensions has sides of different lengths. So, the hexagon isn't regular but is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel.

I think I can model this as a hexagon that's been transformed by a scaling in different directions, but keeping the sides equal. So, the opposite sides are parallel, which suggests that the hexagon is a translation of a regular hexagon in some directions.

But how does the triangle come into play? The triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Each of these sides is a side of the hexagon, so their extensions will meet at some points creating a larger triangle.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF must be similar to some smaller triangle inside the hexagon. Maybe the hexagon can be thought of as being "inscribed" within this larger triangle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratios of the sides. The triangle has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me see if these are in a particular ratio. Dividing each by 40, 200/40=5, 240/40=6, 300/40=7.5. Hmm, not the nicest ratios, but maybe they can be scaled in a way relative to the hexagon's sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is similar to a smaller triangle formed by the other three sides of the hexagon, BC, DE, and FA. Because if AB is parallel to DE, then the extensions of AB and DE are parallel, so the triangles formed by these extensions might be similar.

Wait, maybe I can model the hexagon as being part of a larger triangle, with each pair of opposite sides cutting off a smaller triangle from the larger one. So, the larger triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from it, each corresponding to a pair of opposite sides.

But I'm not sure. Let me
