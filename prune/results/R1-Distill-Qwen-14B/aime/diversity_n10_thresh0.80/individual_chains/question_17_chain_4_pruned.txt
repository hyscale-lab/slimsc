Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of that sphere squared is what I need to find, and then express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. 

First, let's parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. For each box in B, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. Then, among all these spheres, find the one with the smallest radius r. So essentially, we're looking for the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B, because the sphere's diameter must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius will be half of that maximum space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). To find r², we need to find (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2)^2, which simplifies to (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, the key is to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

The constraints are:
1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. So, xy + yz + xz = 27.
2. Volume: xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z² given these two constraints. 

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a smarter way using algebraic identities.

Let me recall that for three variables, we have the identity:
(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz)
Which can be rearranged as:
x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz)
We know that xy + yz + xz = 27, so x² + y² + z² = (x+y+z)^2 - 54.

But we don't know x + y + z. Hmm. Maybe we can relate this to the volume. Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality between the arithmetic mean and geometric mean.

Wait, but let's think about how to maximize x² + y² + z². Since we have constraints on the sum of products and the product, perhaps it's better to fix two variables and express the third in terms of them.

Let me denote x, y, z as the sides. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x ≤ y ≤ z, but maybe that's not necessary.

Let me try to express z in terms of x and y using the volume constraint. So, from xyz = 23, we have z = 23/(xy).

Then, substituting into the surface area equation: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. So, xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Simplify that: xy + (23/y) + (23/x) = 27.

Let me write that as:
xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can set u = x + y and v = xy. Then, perhaps express the equation in terms of u and v.

But wait, let's see:

We have z = 23/(xy) = 23/v.

Then, the surface area equation is:
xy + yz + xz = 27
v + y*(23/v) + x*(23/v) = 27
v + (23/v)(x + y) = 27

But x + y is u, so:
v + (23 u)/v = 27

So, we have v + (23 u)/v = 27. Let's multiply both sides by v to eliminate the denominator:
v² + 23 u = 27 v

Which rearranges to:
v² - 27 v + 23 u = 0

But I also know that for x and y, u = x + y and v = xy, so by the AM-GM inequality, we have u² ≥ 4v. So, u ≥ 2√v.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe we can express u in terms of v from the equation above.

From v² -27v +23u =0, we can solve for u:
23u = 2
