Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. 

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square or a special rhombus. Hmm, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular but they do bisect each other at the same angles. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.

So, given that, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis because the diagonals are along the axes or some other lines through the origin, but since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular.

Wait, but in this case, the rhombus can have diagonals along any pair of perpendicular lines passing through the origin, not necessarily the axes. Hmm, but since the hyperbola is symmetric about the x and y axes, maybe the diagonals lie along these axes? Or maybe not necessarily.

Wait, but since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, and the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin, perhaps the points A, B, C, D are arranged symmetrically with respect to the origin.

Let me try to parametrize the points. Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, any point on the hyper
