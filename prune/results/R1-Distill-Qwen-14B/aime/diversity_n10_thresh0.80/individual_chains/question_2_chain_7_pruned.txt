Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find OC² where C is a specific point on segment AB. The points O, A, and B are given, with O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. 

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that's not on any other segment from F besides AB. I need to find OC², which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me sketch that mentally: from the midpoint of the x-axis between O and (1,0) up to a point on the y-axis a bit less than 1 unit up.

The family F consists of segments PQ, each of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, all in the first quadrant. So each segment PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between them is 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies that p² + q² = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the distance between P and Q is unit length. So yes, sqrt((p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. So each PQ is such that p and q lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant.

So, the family F is the set of all such segments from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive and p² + q² = 1.

Now, AB is one such segment, right? Let me check. Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the distance between A and B is sqrt((1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in family F.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. So, how do I find such a point C?

I think this point C is the point on AB that is closest to the origin. Because if you imagine moving the segment PQ around, the closest point on AB to the origin would be the one that's least likely to be intersected by other segments from F. Or maybe it's the point where the envelope of all these segments is tangent to AB. Hmm.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if I think of all these segments PQ as lines, their envelope might form a curve, and the point C could be where AB is tangent to this envelope. So, C would be the point on AB where the envelope touches AB, and that would mean that C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

Alternatively, maybe I should parametrize AB and find the point C on AB such that the line PQ is tangent to AB at C. Wait, no, because each PQ is a segment, not a curve. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB where the distance from the origin is minimized. So, it's the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB. If that's the case, then OC would be the shortest distance from O to AB, and C would be the point on AB closest to O.

Let me try to compute that. The line AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of AB.

First, find the slope. The slope m is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0):

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So
