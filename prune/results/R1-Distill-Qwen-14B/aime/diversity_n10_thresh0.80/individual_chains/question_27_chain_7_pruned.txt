Okay, so I've got this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but outside of it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6 units. 

The sphere S has a radius of 11. The problem says that when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to find expressions for r_i and r_o in terms of the given radii of the torus and the sphere. Let's see. 

First, let me recall the properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

Now, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's placed outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles.

I think the key here is to consider the centers of these tangent circles. When the torus is inside the sphere, the tangent circle lies on the inner surface of the sphere, and the sphere's center is at some point relative to the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the tangent circle is on the outer surface.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus can be given in 3D coordinates. If the torus is centered at the origin, the equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r². Here, R is 6 and r is 3. So, substituting, the equation becomes (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent to it, the tangent point must satisfy both equations. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's tangent externally, so I think the sphere would be inside the torus, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Because the torus is a surface, when placed externally, it would touch the sphere from the outside. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the distance between the centers.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the centers of the sphere and the generating circle of the torus. The sphere S is centered at some point, let's say the origin, and the torus T is also centered there, right? Because otherwise, how would it be tangent along a circle?

Wait, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside except for the tangent circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, and they touch along another circle.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about cross-sections. Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetric around the same axis, perhaps the z-axis, let's consider a cross-sectional view in the x-z plane.

In that cross-section, the torus would look like two circles: one on the right and one on the left, each
