Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's summarize the given information. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are universal—every single resident has them. That might be useful later.

Now, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're asked to find how many own all four. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and Venn diagrams. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion can get a bit complicated with four sets. The formula for four sets is a bit involved, but let me recall it. The total number of elements in the union of four sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of the sizes of all possible pairwise intersections plus the sum of the sizes of all possible triple-wise intersections minus the size of the intersection of all four sets.

Mathematically, that's:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, since all residents have a bag of candy hearts (let's denote that as D), that might simplify things a bit. Because D is present in everyone, the intersections involving D might be easier to handle.

But let me think again. Maybe I should approach this problem by considering that each resident can own 0 to 4 items. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, no one owns zero items. So, the possible ownerships are 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.

Given that, the problem provides the number of residents owning exactly two items (437) and exactly three items (234). So, we're missing the number who own exactly one item and exactly four items.

But wait, we know the total number of residents is 900. So, if I let x be the number of residents who own exactly four items, and y be the number who own exactly one item, then:

y + 437 + 234 + x = 900

So, y + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So, y + x = 229. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the total number of items owned. Let me
