Okay, so I have this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to change direction exactly four times. The total length of each path is 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps.

Hmm, I remember that in a grid, a path can be thought of as a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. So, for an 8x8 grid, any valid path has exactly 8 R's and 8 U's. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But this problem adds a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction mean? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if I start by moving right, then switch to up, that's one change. If I switch back to right, that's a second change, and so on.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A "run" is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if I have a path like RRRUUURRRUUURRUU, that's several runs. The number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs because each change starts a new run.

Wait, so if the path changes direction exactly four times, that means there are five runs in total. Because each change adds a new run. So, if I have four changes, there are five runs. But these runs alternate between R and U. So, the number of runs must be odd, meaning the number of direction changes is even?

Wait no, that's not right. Because starting with R, the number of runs for R and U would be different. If I have four direction changes, that's five runs. If I start with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs, totaling five runs with four changes. Alternatively, if I start with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U: three U runs and two R runs.

But in an 8x8 grid, the number of R and U steps is equal. So, the number of runs for R and U must be such that the total steps add up to 8 each. Let me think: if the path has four direction changes, which leads to five runs. These runs alternate between R and U.

So, if it starts with R, the number of R runs would be three and U runs would be two. Or if it starts with U, R runs would be two and U runs would be three. Wait, but since both R and U must sum to 8, let's see:

Case 1: Starting with R, runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U. So, for the three R runs, the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's is the number of ways to split 8 into 3 parts, each at least 1. That's like stars and bars: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for the two U runs, it's C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7. So, the total number of paths starting with R and having four direction changes is 21 *7 =147.

Similarly, case 2: Starting with U, runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

For the three U runs, the number of ways is C(7,2)=21, and for the two R runs, it's C(7,1)=7. So, the total number of paths starting with U
