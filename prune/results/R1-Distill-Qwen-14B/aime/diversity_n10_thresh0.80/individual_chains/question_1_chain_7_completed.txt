Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So substituting y into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which simplifies to:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent.

Wait, 2^(-2/3) is 2^(-8/12). Then 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). So when you multiply, exponents add: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12). So x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Therefore, x = sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24).

So x = 2^(-7/24). Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plug in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

And we already had z = 2^(-5/12). Equation (z).

Now, let me write down all three variables:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

To make it easier, let's express all exponents with a common denominator. The denominators are 24, 8, 12. The least common multiple is 24.

So:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24) since -3/8 = -9/24
z = 2^(-10/24) since -5/12 = -10/24

So x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24).

Hmm, maybe I can write them as:

x = 2^{-7/24}, y = 2^{-9/24}, z = 2^{-10/24}

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute the exponent first: x^4 y^3 z^2.

Since each variable is a power of 2, I can rewrite the product as 2^{4a} * 2^{3b} * 2^{2c} where a, b, c are the exponents for x, y, z.

Wait, x is 2^{-7/24}, so x^4 is 2^{-7/24 *4} = 2^{-7/6}.

Similarly, y^3 is (2^{-9/24})^3 = 2^{-27/24} = 2^{-9/8}.

z^2 is (2^{-10/24})^2 = 2^{-20/24} = 2^{-5/6}.

So the product x^4 y^3 z^2 is 2^{-7/6} * 2^{-9/8} * 2^{-5/6}.

Add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Let me find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have LCM 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them up: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

So x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-75/24} = 2^{-25/8}.

Then log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^{-25/8}) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So m is 25, n is 8. They are coprime, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the exponents:

x = 2^{-7/24}
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-28/24} = 2^{-7/6}

y = 2^{-9/24} = 2^{-3/8}
y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}

z = 2^{-10/24} = 2^{-5/12}
z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-10/12} = 2^{-5/6}

So adding exponents: x^4 y^3 z^2 exponent is (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Compute each in 24ths:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Total: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So yes, 25 and 8 are coprime, so m + n is 33.

I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \implies x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \implies y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \implies z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Next, we substitute these expressions into each other to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2:

- From equation (1): \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
- Substitute \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into the above: \(x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3})z \cdot 2^{1/2}\)
- Simplify: \(x = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\), leading to \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}\)
- Substitute \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into equation (3): \(2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\), giving \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\)
- Express \(y\) in terms of \(x\): \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\)
- Substitute \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\): \(x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-2/3}\), leading to \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- Find \(y\) using \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\): \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)

Now, we compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

- \(x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}\)
- \(y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}\)
- \(z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}\)
- Combine exponents: \(-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{25}{8}\)

Thus, \(x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-25/8}\), and \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}\). Taking the absolute value gives \(\frac{25}{8}\).

Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
