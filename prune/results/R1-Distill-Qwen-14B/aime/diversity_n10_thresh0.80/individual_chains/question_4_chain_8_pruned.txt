Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I've heard of terms like "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this case, Bob wants to be in a position where, regardless of Alice's move, he can always win. So I need to find all n where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position, meaning that Bob can always win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote P(n) as the position when there are n tokens left. P(n) is a winning position if the current player can force a win, otherwise it's a losing position.

Base cases:
- P(0): No tokens left. The player who is supposed to move loses, but since the last token was taken by the previous player, that player wins. So P(0) is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.
Wait, actually, if n=0, the game is over, so the player whose turn it is can't move and thus loses. So P(0) is a losing position. So if a player can move to P(0), they win.

So for n=1:
- The player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) is a winning position.

n=2:
- Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can't take 4. So the player can only take 1, leaving n=1. But wait, does that mean the opponent can win? Or does the player have another option?

Wait, no, n=2: the player can take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. Or the player could take 1, but that's the only option. So the player has no winning move, so P(2) is a losing position.

Wait, but wait. If n=2, you can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So the current player (at n=2) cannot win. So P(2) is a losing position.

n=3:
- The player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So if the player takes 1, the opponent is in a losing position. So P(3) is a winning position.

n=4:
- The player can take 4 tokens and win, so P(4) is a winning position.

n=5:
- The player can take 1, leaving n=4 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving n=1 (a winning position for the opponent). So both options lead to the opponent being able to win. So P(5) is a losing position.

n=6:
- The player can take 1, leaving n=5 (a losing position for the opponent). So P(6) is a winning position.

n=7:
- The player can take 1, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=3 (winning for opponent). So both options leave opponent in winning positions. Therefore, P(7) is a losing position.

n=8:
- Take 1, leaving n=7 (losing for opponent). So P(8) is winning.

n=9:
- Take 1, leaving n=8 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=5 (losing for opponent). So the player can take 4, leaving opponent with n=5, which is losing. So P(9) is a winning position.

n=10:
- Take 1, leaving n=9 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=6 (winning for opponent
