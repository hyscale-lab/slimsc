Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it and figure out how to approach it.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

First, let's recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is also related to the area and semiperimeter.

The circumradius R is given by the formula R = (a b c) / (4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ / s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, maybe I can relate these somehow.

Also, the condition IA ⊥ OI is interesting. IA is the line from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the line from the circumcenter to the incenter. So these two lines are perpendicular. That must give us some relation between the sides or angles of the triangle.

I think I need to find some relationship involving IA and OI. Maybe I can express IA and OI in terms of other known quantities.

Wait, perhaps I can use coordinates to model this. Let me try to place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Let’s consider placing the circumcenter O at the origin (0, 0) because it might simplify calculations. Then, points A, B, C lie on the circumference of a circle with radius 13.

The incenter I is somewhere inside the triangle. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, if I can find coordinates for I such that the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI, that might help.

Let me denote the coordinates: Let’s say O is at (0,0), and point I is at (x, y). Then, vector OI is (x, y). Vector IA is the vector from I to A, which is (A_x - x, A_y - y).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product is zero. So:

(A_x - x) * x + (A_y - y) * y = 0

Which simplifies to:

A_x x + A_y y - (x² + y²) = 0

Or,

A_x x + A_y y = x² + y²

Hmm, that's one equation, but I don't know the coordinates of A yet. Maybe I can express A in terms of angles or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known formula or theorem that relates IA and OI. Let me think. I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius.

Wait, that's a useful formula. So OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)) = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is sqrt(13), perhaps we can find the length of IA, and then use that to find some relation in the triangle.

Wait, how to find IA? The length from the incenter to vertex A, IA. I think there's a formula for the length of the inradius in terms of angles or sides.

Alternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles. Let me recall the formula. IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Yes, that's correct. So IA = r / sin(A/2). Given that r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

Similarly, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which has length sqrt(13), perhaps we can
