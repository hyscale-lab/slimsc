Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention the answer will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each can be red or blue. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's some rotation that maps all blue vertices to where red ones were. So, I need to count how many such colorings exist.

Wait, but how do rotations affect the colorings? Since it's a regular octagon, rotations are by multiples of 45 degrees, right? So there are eight possible rotations: 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, corresponding to rotating 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

Each rotation can be thought of as a permutation of the vertices. So, for a given coloring, I need to check if any of these rotations will transform all blue vertices to positions that were originally red.

Wait, no, more precisely, after the rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was red before the rotation. Hmm, but the rotation is applied to the octagon, which changes the positions, but the colors are fixed. Or wait, no, each vertex is colored, so when you rotate the octagon, the colors move with the vertices. So, the original positions are colored, and after rotation, the colors are in new positions.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: Suppose I have a coloring C. I want to find a rotation r such that when I apply r to C, every blue vertex in C is moved to a position that was originally red in C. Wait, that might not be the right way to phrase it. Let me clarify.

No, actually, the problem states: after coloring, there exists a rotation such that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, the octagon is rotated, and after rotation, wherever there's a blue vertex, that spot was previously red. So, maybe it's equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices under some rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotation) of the set of red vertices. Wait, maybe more accurately, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate the octagon, the blue vertices move to the positions that were originally red.

Wait, no. Let's think: If I have an octagon where some vertices are blue and others are red. If I rotate it by some angle, then each blue vertex moves to a new position. For the condition to hold, each of these new positions must have been red in the original coloring. So, the image of the blue set under rotation must be
