Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem is about a list of positive integers with three specific properties:

1. The sum of all the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'll start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.

First, the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. The problem says it's a unique mode, which means only the number 9 appears more times than any other number. So, 9 must occur at least twice, and more than any other number.

The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from least to greatest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list if the list has an odd number of elements. So, this suggests that the list has an even number of elements because then the median would be the average of two numbers, which might not be in the list.

Wait, let me think again. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. But the problem states the median isn't in the list. So that implies that the number of elements must be even because the median is the average of two numbers and might not be an integer unless those two numbers are the same. Wait, but the median is given as a positive integer. So, if the median is an integer, then the two middle numbers must add up to an even number because (a + b)/2 must be integer, so a + b must be even. That implies a and b are both even or both odd.

But the median itself isn't in the list. So, if the median is an integer, but it's not in the list, that suggests that the two middle numbers are different, but their average is an integer. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the mode. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so perhaps 9 appears more than once, but the two middle numbers might be 8 and 10, making the median 9, which is not in the list. But wait, if 9 is in the list, then the median would be 9 if it's one of the middle numbers. So, perhaps the list has an even number of elements, and the two middle numbers are not 9, but their average is 9.

Wait, but if 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So
