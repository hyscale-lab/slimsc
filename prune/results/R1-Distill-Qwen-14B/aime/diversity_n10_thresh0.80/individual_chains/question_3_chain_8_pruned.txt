Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They give that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But in this case, if she won the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers matching, so A is a subset of B. So P(A and B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B), where A is the event she won the grand prize, and B is the event she won a prize.

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then take their ratio.

Let me write down what each event is:

- A: All four of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, A is the event that the 4 randomly selected numbers are exactly the four Jen picked.

- B: At least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, B includes all cases where 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers are selected.

So, first, let's compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 elements, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210.

Now, let's find P(A). The number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, because there's only one specific set of 4 numbers that Jen has. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, let's find P(B). P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are selected. This is the same as 1 minus the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are selected. So, 1 - [probability that zero or one of her numbers are selected].

Alternatively, we can compute P(B) as the sum of probabilities that exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are selected.

But maybe it's easier to compute the complementary probability and subtract it from 1.

So, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers not containing any of Jen's numbers is C(6,4), because there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not in Jen's set. Similarly, the number of ways to choose exactly one of her numbers is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Wait, let me make sure. If we have 4 numbers that Jen picked, then the remaining numbers are 6. So:

Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with none of Jen's: C(6,4) = 15.

Number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly 1 of Jen's: C(4,1)*C(6,3). Let's compute that: 4 * 20 = 80.

So the number of ways where fewer than two of Jen's numbers are selected is 15 + 80 = 95. Therefore, the number of ways where at least two are selected is total ways (210) minus 95, which is 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210. Let me simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, wait. Let me check that computation again. Because 15 (none) + 80 (one) is 95. 210-95=115. So 115/210 is indeed 23/42.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

Now, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42). Let me compute that.

First, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23). 42 divided by 210 is 1/5. So,
