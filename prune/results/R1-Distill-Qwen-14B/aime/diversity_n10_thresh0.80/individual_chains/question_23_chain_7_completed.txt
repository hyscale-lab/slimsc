Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD² or the maximum lower bound for BD² across all possible such rhombuses.

First, let's recall some properties. A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus is a diamond shape.

Let me denote the diagonals AC and BD as vectors. Let’s say vector AC is from point A to point C, and BD is from point B to point D. Since the origin is the midpoint, point C is the reflection of point A through the origin, so if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, the diagonals are AC with endpoints (x, y) and (-x, -y), so the vector AC is ( -2x, -2y ). Similarly, BD is from (p, q) to (-p, -q), so the vector BD is (-2p, -2q). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. So, AC · BD = 0.

Wait, no. Actually, the vectors AC and BD are diagonals of the rhombus. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their direction vectors should be perpendicular. But AC and BD are vectors from the origin. Wait, no, in reality, the diagonals of the rhombus are two lines: one connecting A to C and the other connecting B to D. The direction vectors of these diagonals should be perpendicular. So, the vectors OA and OC are (x, y) and (-x, -y), but the direction vectors of the diagonals are AC and BD. So, AC has direction vector from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD has direction vector from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the slopes of the diagonals. The diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1. Let me compute the slopes.

Slope of AC: since it goes from (x, y) to (-x, -y), the slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.

Slope of BD: from (p, q) to (-p, -q), slope is (-q - q)/(-p - p) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.

Since they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (q/p) = -1. So, (yq)/(xp) = -1. So, yq = -xp. That's one condition.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, so each point must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, same for p, q. So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and for point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, I need to find BD². BD is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-p, -q), the distance BD is sqrt[ (p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))² ] = sqrt[ (2p)² + (2q)² ] = sqrt[4p² + 4q²] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²). So, BD² is [2*sqrt(p² + q²)]² = 4(p² + q²).

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²). Therefore, to find the infimum of BD², I need to find the smallest possible value of 4(p² + q²), given that points B(p, q) and A(x, y) lie on the hyperbola, and yq = -xp.

Wait, so the constraints are:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 (for point A)
2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1 (for point B)
3. yq = -xp (from the perpendicularity condition)

I need to minimize BD² = 4(p² + q²), subject to these constraints.

So, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y, using the third equation.

From equation 3: yq = -xp.

So, q = (-xp)/y.

Let me substitute this into equation 2.

p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Substitute q:

p²/20 - [ ( (-xp)/y )² ] /24 = 1

Compute (-xp/y)^2 = (x² p²)/y².

So,

p²/20 - (x² p²)/(24 y²) = 1.

Factor out p²:

p² [ 1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) ] = 1.

Let me compute that coefficient:

1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) = [ (24 y²) - 20 x² ] / (20 * 24 y² )

Which is [ (24 y² - 20 x²) ] / (480 y² )

So,

p² [ (24 y² - 20 x²) ] / (480 y² ) = 1.

Multiply both sides by 480 y² / (24 y² - 20 x²):

p² = [480 y² ] / [24 y² - 20 x² ]

Simplify denominator: 24 y² - 20 x² = 4*(6 y² - 5 x² )

So,

p² = [480 y² ] / [4*(6 y² -5 x² ) ] = [120 y² ] / [6 y² -5 x² ]

So, p² = (120 y² ) / (6 y² -5 x² )

Similarly, since I have q = (-xp)/y, then q² = (x² p²)/y².

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²) = 4 [ p² + (x² p²)/y² ] = 4 p² [ 1 + (x²)/y² ] = 4 p² ( y² + x² ) / y².

But we have p² expressed in terms of x and y. So, let's substitute that in.

BD² = 4 * [ (120 y² ) / (6 y² -5 x² ) ] * (x² + y² ) / y².

Simplify that expression:

BD² = 4 * [ 120 y² / (6 y² -5 x² ) ] * (x² + y² ) / y²

The y² cancels:

BD² = 4 * [ 120 / (6 y² -5 x² ) ] * (x² + y² )

So,

BD² = (480 (x² + y² )) / (6 y² -5 x² )

Now, since point A lies on the hyperbola, x² /20 - y² /24 = 1.

Let me write that as x² = 20 (1 + y² /24 ) = 20 + (20/24) y² = 20 + (5/6) y².

So, x² = 20 + (5/6) y².

Let me substitute x² into BD² expression.

So, BD² = [480 ( (20 + (5/6)y² ) + y² ) ] / [6 y² -5*(20 + (5/6) y² ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

First, numerator:

(20 + (5/6)y² ) + y² = 20 + (5/6 + 6/6)y² = 20 + (11/6)y².

So, numerator is 480*(20 + (11/6)y² ) = 480*20 + 480*(11/6)y² = 9600 + 880 y².

Denominator:

6 y² -5*(20 + (5/6)y² ) = 6 y² -100 - (25/6)y².

Convert 6 y² to (36/6)y²:

(36/6)y² -100 - (25/6)y² = (11/6)y² -100.

So, denominator is (11/6)y² -100.

Therefore, BD² = [9600 + 880 y² ] / [ (11/6)y² -100 ]

Let me write this as:

BD² = (9600 + 880 y² ) / ( (11/6)y² -100 )

To simplify, let's multiply numerator and denominator by 6 to eliminate the fraction in the denominator.

Numerator: 6*(9600 + 880 y² ) = 57600 + 5280 y²

Denominator: 6*( (11/6)y² -100 ) = 11 y² - 600.

So, BD² = (57600 + 5280 y² ) / (11 y² - 600 )

Hmm, this seems more manageable.

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 57600 + 5280 y² = 5280 y² + 57600 = 5280(y² + 57600/5280 )

Calculate 57600 /5280: Let's see, 5280 * 10 = 52800, 57600 -52800 = 4800. 4800 /5280 = 4800/5280 = 48/52.8 = 48/(52.8) = 0.909... Wait, but perhaps better to write as fractions.

Wait, 57600 /5280 = (57600 ÷ 240)/(5280 ÷240) = 240 /22 = 120/11 ≈10.909.

Wait, let me compute 57600 ÷ 5280:

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 5760 /528

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 240 /22

Which is 120/11 ≈10.909.

So, 57600 = 5280*(120/11).

Therefore, numerator is 5280(y² + 120/11) = 5280*(11y² + 120)/11 = (5280/11)(11y² + 120) = 480*(11 y² +120).

Similarly, denominator is 11 y² -600.

So, BD² = [480*(11 y² + 120)] / (11 y² -600 )

Let me write this as:

BD² = 480*(11 y² +120)/(11 y² -600 )

Let me denote z = 11 y². Then, the expression becomes:

BD² = 480*(z +120)/(z -600 )

So, BD² = 480*(z +120)/(z -600 )

Now, we can express this as:

BD² = 480*[ (z -600 + 720 ) / (z -600 ) ]

Because z +120 = (z -600) + 720.

So, BD² = 480*[1 + 720/(z -600 ) ]

Which is BD² = 480 + (480*720)/(z -600 )

So, BD² = 480 + (345600)/(z -600 )

Now, z =11 y², and since point A is on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

From that, x² =20 + (5/6)y².

Since x² must be positive, any y² is allowed as long as x² is positive, but in reality, for the hyperbola, y² can be any non-negative real number because hyperbola extends infinitely.

But wait, for the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, x can be any real number with |x| ≥ sqrt(20). So, x² is at least 20.

But we have z =11 y², and from the denominator in BD², we have z -600. So, for BD² to be real, z -600 ≠0, so z≠600, so 11 y²≠600, so y²≠600/11≈54.545. So, y² can be any value except that.

But for the expression z -600 in the denominator, we need to ensure that z -600 is positive or negative.

Looking back to the original expression BD² = (57600 + 5280 y² ) / (11 y² -600 )

So, for BD² to be positive, the denominator must be positive because the numerator is always positive (57600 +5280 y² is positive for any real y). So, denominator must be positive.

So, 11 y² -600 >0 => y² >600/11 ≈54.545.

Therefore, y² must be greater than 600/11.

So, z =11 y² >600.

Thus, in the expression BD² =480 + 345600/(z -600 ), since z >600, z -600 is positive, so the second term is positive, making BD² larger than 480.

Wait, but we need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, I think we are to find the minimum possible value of BD², because the greatest lower bound would be the infimum, which would be the minimum if it's attainable.

Wait, but if BD² is always greater than 480, then 480 is the lower bound, but maybe it can approach 480 as z approaches infinity.

Wait, let's see: As z approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480 + 345600/(z -600 ) approaches 480. So, BD² can get arbitrarily close to 480 from above. So, the infimum is 480.

But wait, is 480 attainable? If z approaches infinity, that would correspond to y² approaching infinity, meaning that point A is going off to infinity on the hyperbola. So, in that case, BD² approaches 480 but doesn't actually reach it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 480.

Wait, but I should verify if BD² can indeed approach 480. Let me think about the limits.

If y² becomes very large, then from the hyperbola equation, x² =20 + (5/6)y², so x² also becomes very large. Then, from the slope condition, yq = -xp. As y and x grow, p would adjust accordingly.

But in the expression for BD², as y² tends to infinity, z =11 y² tends to infinity, so BD² approaches 480. So, it's a limit, but BD² can get as close as we like to 480, but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the infimum is 480, and it's the greatest lower bound.

So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480. So, the answer is 480.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there is any constraint I missed. For instance, when y² approaches 600/11 from above, z approaches 600 from above, so z -600 approaches 0 from above, making 345600/(z -600) approach infinity, so BD² approaches infinity. So, BD² can get as large as possible as well. But we are concerned with the lower bound.

Another thought: To ensure that points B and D lie on the hyperbola, we need to check if for the given BD², the points are real. But since we're working with real coordinates and the hyperbola is real, any y² greater than 600/11 will give a real p².

Wait, from earlier, p² = [120 y² ] / (6 y² -5 x² )

But x² =20 + (5/6)y².

So, 6 y² -5 x² =6 y² -5*(20 +5/6 y² )=6 y² -100 -25/6 y² = (36/6 -25/6 )y² -100= (11/6)y² -100.

Which is the same as (11 y² -600)/6.

Therefore, p² = [120 y² ] / [ (11 y² -600)/6 ] = (120 y² *6 )/(11 y² -600 )=720 y²/(11 y² -600 ).

So, for p² to be positive, since y²>600/11, 11 y² -600 is positive, so p² is positive. So, p is real.

Therefore, as y² approaches infinity, p² approaches 720 y²/(11 y² )=720/11≈65.454...

So, p² approaches 720/11, which is finite. Therefore, as y² approaches infinity, x² approaches infinity, but p² approaches a finite limit. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, but if p² approaches 720/11, then BD² =4(p² + q² )

But q² = (x² p² )/ y².

So, as y² approaches infinity, q² approaches (x² p² ) / y². But x² is ~ (5/6)y², so q² ~ ( (5/6)y² * (720/11) ) / y² = (5/6 *720/11 )= (600/11 )≈54.545.

So, q² approaches 600/11, and p² approaches 720/11. Therefore, BD² =4*(720/11 +600/11 )=4*(1320/11 )=4*120=480.

So, that matches the earlier limit. So, BD² approaches 480 as y² tends to infinity. Therefore, 480 is indeed the infimum.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 480.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{480}


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\), we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all rhombuses \(ABCD\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.

1. **Hyperbola Properties and Rhombus Conditions**:
   - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola.
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.
   - The slopes of the diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \(yq = -xp\).

2. **Coordinates and Distances**:
   - Points \(A\) and \(C\) are \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\).
   - Points \(B\) and \(D\) are \((p, q)\) and \((-p, -q)\).
   - The distance \(BD\) is calculated as \(2\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\).

3. **Hyperbola Equations**:
   - For points \(A\) and \(B\), we have \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and \(\frac{p^2}{20} - \frac{q^2}{24} = 1\).

4. **Substitution and Simplification**:
   - Using the condition \(yq = -xp\), we express \(q\) as \(-\frac{xp}{y}\).
   - Substituting \(q\) into the hyperbola equation for \(B\) and simplifying, we find expressions for \(p^2\) and \(q^2\).

5. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**:
   - After simplification, we find \(BD^2 = \frac{480 (x^2 + y^2)}{6 y^2 - 5 x^2}\).
   - Using the hyperbola equation, we express \(x^2\) in terms of \(y^2\) and substitute back.

6. **Limit Analysis**:
   - As \(y^2\) approaches infinity, the expression for \(BD^2\) approaches 480.
   - This analysis shows that \(BD^2\) can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never actually reaches it.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses is \(\boxed{480}\).
