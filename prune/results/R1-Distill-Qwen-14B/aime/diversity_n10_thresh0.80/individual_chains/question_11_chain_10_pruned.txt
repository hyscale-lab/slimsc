Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier since everything can be expressed in terms of θ.

Wait, but before I jump into that, maybe I should write z as 4e^{iθ}, right? Because |z| = 4, so modulus is 4. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, and therefore 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|^2. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, substituting z into the expression: (75 + 117i)z becomes (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}, which is 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, (96 + 144i)/z becomes (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}, which is (1/4)*(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (1/4)*(96 + 144i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, both terms have factors outside the complex numbers multiplied by e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ}.

I think I can combine these terms more neatly. Let me factor out the constants:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

Second term: (1/4)*(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.

So, the expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it over θ.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this expression will be Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

I can write A e^{iθ} as |A| e^{i(θ + φ_A)}, where φ_A is the argument of A. Similarly, B e^{-iθ} is |B| e^{i(-θ + φ_B)}, where φ_B is the argument of B.

But maybe a better approach is to express A and B in polar form and then compute the real parts.

Alternatively, I can write each term as a sum of sine and cosine terms.

Let me recall that for a complex number C = c + di, C e^{iθ} = (c + di)(cosθ + isinθ) = (c cosθ - d sinθ) + i(c sinθ + d cosθ).

So, the real part of C e^{iθ} is c cosθ - d sinθ.

Similarly, the real part of C e^{-iθ} is c cosθ + d sinθ.

So, applying this to both terms:

Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re( (300 + 468i) (cosθ + i sinθ) ) = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re( (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) ) = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, adding these together, the total real part is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Calculating the coefficients:

300 + 24 = 324.

-468 + 36 = -432.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, so I've reduced the problem to finding the maximum of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that for an expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(a² + b²). So, the maximum real part would be sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Wait, let me verify that.

Yes, because a cosθ + b sinθ can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²), so the maximum value is R.

So, in this case, a is 324 and b is -432.

Wait, but in the expression, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is the same as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, a = 324, b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324² + 432²).

Wait, let me compute 324² and 432².

324²: Let's see, 300² is 90,000. 24² is 576. The cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So, 324² = (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400 + 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432²: Let's compute 400² = 160,000. 32² = 1,024. Cross term is 2*400*32 = 25,600.

So, 432² = (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 is 185,600 + 1,024 is 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)? Let me compute that.

Hmm, 540² is 291,600 because 500² is 250,000, 40² is 1,600, and cross term 2*500*40 = 40,000. So 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

Wait, but 540 times 540 is indeed 540² = (500 + 40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So, R = 540
