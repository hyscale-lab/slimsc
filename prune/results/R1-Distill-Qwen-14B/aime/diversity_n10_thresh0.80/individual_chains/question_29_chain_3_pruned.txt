Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because without a clear picture, I might get lost in the equations.

Alright, so there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear. That means all four of these points lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, and G all lie on a circle. Interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. 

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

First, let me sketch this out mentally. Let's consider rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17, so EH = FG =17 and EF = GH = 184.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, and E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order, or maybe another order? Hmm, the problem just says they're collinear, so the order might matter, but I might need to figure that out.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, that circle passes through A and D, which are adjacent vertices of rectangle ABCD, and also H and G, which are adjacent vertices of rectangle EFGH. That seems significant.

Let me think about the properties of rectangles and circles. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD is one of its sides, which is 16 units. So, AD is 16. Similarly, in EFGH, HG is 17.

Wait, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that means ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles should be 180 degrees. Alternatively, the power of point or something else might come into play here.

But maybe it's better to consider coordinates. Yes, perhaps assigning coordinates to each point could help me model the problem and find CE.

Let me try that approach. I'll place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let's say point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C would be along the x-axis, and from D to A would be along the y-axis. So, point C would be at (107, 0), because DC = AB = 107. Point A would be at (0, 16), since AD = BC = 16.

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So, ABCD: AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then since AD is 16, point A would be at (0,16). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107,16). Then point C, which is opposite to A, would be at (107,0).

Hm, that makes sense. So, rectangle ABCD has coordinates:
- D: (0,0)
- C: (107,0)
- B: (107,16)
- A: (0,16)

Now, rectangle EFGH. Points E and F are on the same line as D and C. Since D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), and E and F are collinear with them, it's possible that E and F lie on the x-axis as well. But let me think about how the rectangles
