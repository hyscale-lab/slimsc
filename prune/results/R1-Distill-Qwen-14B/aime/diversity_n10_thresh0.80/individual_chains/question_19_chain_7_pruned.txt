Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, alright. Let's see. First, I should recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. IA is perpendicular to OI, which is an interesting condition. So, in triangle ABC, the line from the inradius to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter.

Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA is one of the internal angle bisectors, right? Because the incenter lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. So, maybe that condition can help me relate the sides or other elements of the triangle.

Circumradius R is given as 13, inradius r is 6. So, R = 13, r = 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm. Let me think about the formula that relates AB, AC, etc. Maybe using the formula for inradius and circumradius, and properties related to perpendicularity.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Is that right? Wait, let me think. Yes, I think that's correct. So, OI squared equals R times (R minus 2r). Let me compute that.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, so OI^2 = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI is sqrt(13). So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IAO, IA is perpendicular to OI, so by the Pythagorean theorem, IA² + OI² = OA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, so OA = R = 13. Therefore, IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13².

So, IA² + 13 = 169. Therefore, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156. So, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify that: sqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) which is 2*sqrt(39).

So, IA is 2*sqrt(39). Hmm. Now, IA is the length of the inradius from I to A. Wait, IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I might need a formula for that.

I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let me recall the formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius, and A is the angle at vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. In triangle ABC, the inradius is r, and the distance from I to A is indeed IA. So, in the triangle formed by I, A, and the point where the incircle touches side BC, which is called, say, D. In triangle AID, which is right-angled at D, we have ID = r, angle at I is A/2, so IA = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that's right.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). But we found that IA = 2*sqrt(39). So,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*
