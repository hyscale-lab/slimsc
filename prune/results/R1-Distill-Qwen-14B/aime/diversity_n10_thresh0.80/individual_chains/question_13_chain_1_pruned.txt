Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about Aya's walks. Let me read it again and break it down.

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and stops at a coffee shop. There are two scenarios given: one where she walks at a constant speed of 's' km/h, taking 4 hours including 't' minutes at the coffee shop. The second scenario is when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, taking 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same 't' minutes at the coffee shop. The question is, how long does her walk take when she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Hmm. So, I think I need to find the time it takes when her speed is s + 1/2. But to do that, I probably need to find the values of 's' and 't' first.

Wait, let me think. In both scenarios, the total time includes her walking time plus the coffee shop time 't'. Since the coffee shop time is the same in both cases, maybe I can set up equations based on the walking times.

Let me denote the walking time without the coffee break as T. So, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, which includes T1 (walking time at speed s) plus t minutes.

In the second case, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is T2 (walking time at speed s+2) plus t minutes.

But wait, the problem says that the walk takes 4 hours including t minutes. So actually, the total time is 4 hours, which is the time she spends walking plus the time she spends at the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks faster, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes.

So, the actual walking time is total time minus t. But since t is the same in both cases, perhaps I can subtract t from both equations and create two equations in terms of s and t.

Wait, but I don't know t. Hmm. Maybe I can express t in terms of the total time and walking time.

Let me structure this:

Case 1: Speed = s km/h, Total time = 4 hours.

Walking time = 4 hours - t minutes. But I should convert t into hours because the units should match.

Similarly, Case
