Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by using the logarithm properties.

Let me write down the equations first. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm rules, I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, the first equation becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other, right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

So, substituting into the first equation, the first equation becomes x * k = 10. The second equation is 4y * (1/k) = 10. So now I have two equations:

1) x * k = 10

2) (4y) / k = 10

Hmm, maybe I can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of k, and then find k. Let me try that.

From equation 1: x = 10 / k.

From equation 2: 4y / k = 10. So, 4y = 10k, which means y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have x in terms of k and y in terms of k. But I also know that log_x(y) = k. Because earlier I set log_x(y) = k.

So, log_x(y) = k. But x is 10/k, and y is (5k)/2. So, log_{10/k}((5k)/2) = k.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can convert that logarithmic equation into exponential form. So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Wait, is that right? Because if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So yes, here b is 10/k, c is k, so a is (5k)/2.

So, (10/k)^k = (5k)/2.

Hmm, that seems a bit tough to solve. Maybe I can take natural logarithms on both sides to simplify? Or perhaps look for a substitution.

Wait, let me think. Let's define z = k, so that the equation becomes (10/z)^z = (5z)/2.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(10/z)^z] = ln[(5z)/2]

Which simplifies to z * ln(10/z) = ln(5z/2)

So, let's write that out:

z * [ln(10) - ln(z)] = ln(5) + ln(z) - ln(2)

Wait, maybe breaking down the logs would be helpful.

Left side: z*(ln10 - lnz) = z ln10 - z lnz

Right side: ln(5z/2) = ln5 + lnz - ln2

So putting it all together:

z ln10 - z lnz = ln5 + lnz - ln2

Hmm, that's a complicated equation. Maybe I can bring all terms to one side:

z ln10 - z lnz - ln5 - lnz + ln2 = 0

Hmm, not sure. Let me try to see if I can factor or find a substitution.

Let me factor out lnz terms:

z ln10 - ln5 + ln2 - z lnz - lnz = 0

Wait, that's:

z ln10 - ln5 + ln2 - lnz (z + 1) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should consider possible integer values for z. Since x and y are both greater than 1, and k is log_x(y), which would be positive, I can assume z is positive.

Wait, maybe let's assume that k is an integer. Let me try k=2.

If z=2, then (10/2)^2 = (5*2)/2 => 5^2=5, which is 25=5? No, that's not true. So k can't be 2.

How about k=3? (10/3)^3 ≈ (3.333)^3 ≈ 37.037. On the right side, (5*3)/2 = 7.5. Not equal.

k=1: (10/1)^1 =10, right side (5*1)/2=2.5. Not equal.

k=4: (10/4)^4 = (2.5)^4= ~39.0625. Right side: (5*4)/2=10. Not equal.

k=5: (2)^5=32. Right side: (5*5)/2=12.5. Not equal.

Hmm, maybe k= something else. Let me check k= sqrt(5). Wait, that might not be an integer. Alternatively, perhaps k=5/2 or some fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation in terms of z and solve it numerically, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think of a substitution to make this equation in terms of a single variable.

Wait, let me consider that (10/z)^z = 5z/2. Maybe I can take both sides to the power of 1/z? Not sure. Alternatively, let me take the ratio of both sides.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote t = z. So the equation is (10/t)^t = (5t)/2.

Let me take the natural log of both sides:

t * ln(10/t) = ln(5t/2)

Which is the same as t*(ln10 - ln t) = ln5 + ln t - ln2.

Hmm, maybe rearranged:

t ln10 - t ln t = ln5 - ln2 + ln t.

Let me bring all terms to the left side:

t ln10 - t ln t - ln5 + ln2 - ln t = 0

Hmm, factor terms with ln t:

t ln10 - ln5 + ln2 - ln t (t + 1) = 0

Hmm, not so helpful. Maybe I can think of this as an equation where t is some variable and try to find t numerically. Since algebraically it's tough.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter substitution. Let me think about the original variables.

I have x = 10/k, y = 5k/2, and log_x(y) = k.

Wait, using the change of base formula, log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x) = k.

So, (ln y) = k (ln x).

But y = (5k)/2 and x = 10/k.

So, ln(5k/2) = k ln(10/k).

Let me write that out:

ln(5k/2) = k [ ln10 - ln k ]

Which is the same as:

ln(5k/2) = k ln10 - k ln k

Hmm, which is the same equation as before. So, I'm back to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can define u = ln k. Let me try that substitution.

Let me set u = ln k. Then, k = e^u.

So substituting into the equation:

ln(5 e^u / 2) = e^u * ln10 - e^u * u

Simplify left side:

ln(5/2) + ln(e^u) = ln(5/2) + u.

Right side: e^u (ln10 - u).

So equation becomes:

ln(5/2) + u = e^u (ln10 - u)

Hmm, still complicated, but maybe I can rearrange terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

e^u (ln10 - u) - u - ln(5/2) = 0

Not sure if that helps. Maybe I can try to find u numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a transcendental equation and try to find a solution by trial and error.

Wait, let's think about possible values for k. Earlier, I tried k=2,3,4,5, but none worked. Let me try k=√10, approximately 3.16.

Wait, k=√10. Let me compute left and right sides.

Left side: (10/√10)^√10 = (√10)^√10. Since √10 is about 3.16, so (√10)^3.16 ≈ (3.16)^3.16 ≈ 3.16^3 is about 31.6, times 3.16^0.16, which is about 1.2, so ~31.6 *1.2≈37.92.

Right side: (5*√10)/2 ≈ (5*3.16)/2 ≈ 15.8/2=7.9. So 37.92 ≈ 7.9? No, not equal.

Hmm, maybe k=2.5.

Left side: (10/2.5)^2.5 = 4^2.5 = (4^2)*sqrt(4)=16*2=32.

Right side: (5*2.5)/2=12.5/2=6.25. 32 vs 6.25. Not equal.

k=1.5.

Left side: (10/1.5)^1.5 ≈ (6.6667)^1.5 ≈ sqrt(6.6667^3). 6.6667^3≈296.296, sqrt of that≈17.21.

Right side: (5*1.5)/2=7.5/2=3.75. Not equal.

k= sqrt(5)= approximately 2.236.

Left side: (10/2.236)^2.236 ≈ (4.472)^2.236. Let's compute 4.472 squared is about 20. So 4.472^2.236 ≈ 20 * 4.472^0.236. Hmm, 4.472^0.236 is approximately e^(0.236 * ln4.472). ln4.472≈1.5, so 0.236*1.5≈0.354, so e^0.354≈1.425. So total ≈20*1.425=28.5.

Right side: (5*2.236)/2≈11.18/2≈5.59. Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps k=5/3≈1.6667.

Left side: (10/(5/3))^(5/3)= (6)^(5/3). 6^(1/3)≈1.817, so 6^(5/3)=1.817^5≈ approx? Let me compute 1.817^2≈3.3, then 1.817^4≈3.3^2≈10.89, 1.817^5≈10.89*1.817≈19.78.

Right side: (5*(5/3))/2= (25/3)/2≈8.333/2≈4.166.

Hmm, 19.78 ≈4.166? No.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, let's go back to the original equations.

We have:

log_x(y^x) =10 → x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10.

But since log_y(x)=1/(log_x(y)), so 4y / (log_x(y))=10.

We already know log_x(y)=10/x. So, substituting into the second equation:

4y / (10/x) )=10 → 4y * (x/10) =10 → (4xy)/10=10 → 4xy=100 → xy=25.

Wait, wait a second! Is that correct? Because I think I found xy=25.

Let me recheck. So, the first equation gives log_x(y)=10/x.

The second equation is 4y * log_y(x) =10. But log_y(x) is 1/(log_x(y)), which is x/10.

So 4y * (x/10) =10 → (4xy)/10=10 → 4xy=100 → xy=25.

Oh! So, I overcomplicated it earlier by introducing k. The answer is simply 25.

Wait, that was much simpler. So, I think the answer is 25. That makes sense.

Let me just verify to make sure.

So, if xy=25, then x =25/y.

From the first equation, log_x(y^x)=10.

Which is x log_x(y) =10.

But log_x(y)= (ln y)/(ln x). So, x*(ln y)/(ln x)=10.

But x=25/y, so (25/y)*(ln y)/(ln(25/y))=10.

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe I can check if such x and y exist.

Alternatively, let me assume that x=5 and y=5. Then, xy=25.

Check first equation: log_5(5^5)=log_5(3125)=5, which is not 10. So that's not correct.

Wait, so maybe x and y are different.

Wait, but according to the previous steps, xy must be 25. So, perhaps x=10 and y=2.5? Because 10*2.5=25.

Wait, check first equation: log_10((2.5)^10). Let's compute (2.5)^10. 2.5^2=6.25, ^4=39.0625, ^5=97.65625, ^10≈(97.65625)^2≈9536.743. Log base 10 of that is log10(9536.743)≈3.979≈4, not 10. So that's not satisfying the first equation.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through the steps again.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10. So, x log_x(y) =10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10.

But log_y(x)=1/(log_x(y)). So, second equation is 4y/(log_x(y))=10.

So, from first equation, log_x(y)=10/x.

Substitute into second equation: 4y/(10/x)=10 →4y*(x/10)=10 →(4xy)/10=10 →4xy=100 →xy=25.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, regardless of the specific x and y, as long as the two equations hold, their product is 25.

So, perhaps the answer is 25. Maybe the specific x and y are not needed, just the product.

I think that's correct.


We are given two logarithmic equations involving real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), both greater than 1. The equations are:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Equations Using Logarithm Properties

Using the logarithm power rule, \(\log_b(a^c) = c \cdot \log_b(a)\), we can rewrite the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\).

### Step 2: Express \(\log_x(y)\) and \(\log_y(x)\) in Terms of \(k\)

Let \(k = \log_x(y)\). By the reciprocal property of logarithms, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{k}\).

Substituting into the equations:

1. \(x \cdot k = 10 \implies x = \frac{10}{k}\).
2. \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \implies y = \frac{10k}{4} = \frac{5k}{2}\).

### Step 3: Use the Relationship Between \(x\) and \(y\)

We know that \(k = \log_x(y)\). Substituting \(x = \frac{10}{k}\) and \(y = \frac{5k}{2}\) into this logarithmic relationship:

\[
k = \log_{\frac{10}{k}}\left(\frac{5k}{2}\right).
\]

This equation is complex to solve directly, but we can use the earlier expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) to find a simpler relationship.

### Step 4: Solve for \(xy\)

From the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
x = \frac{10}{k}, \quad y = \frac{5k}{2}.
\]

Multiplying \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
xy = \left(\frac{10}{k}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{5k}{2}\right) = \frac{50k}{2k} = 25.
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is **25**, regardless of the specific values of \(x\) and \(y\).

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
