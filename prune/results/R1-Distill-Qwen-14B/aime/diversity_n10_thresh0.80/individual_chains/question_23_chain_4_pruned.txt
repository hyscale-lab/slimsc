Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound, but wait, no—wait, the question says the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, if BD² can get arbitrarily close to some value from above, then that value would be the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, I think that means I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², which is the smallest BD² can be, because then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimum. Wait, actually, no. Let me think.

Wait, if BD² can vary, and I need the greatest number that is less than BD² for every possible rhombus. That is, I need the maximum lower bound. So, if BD² is always greater than some number, say m, then m is the greatest such number. So, m is the infimum of BD², the greatest lower bound.

So, the problem reduces to finding the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi ABCD on the hyperbola as described.

Alright, so let's think about the properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no, is that correct?

Wait, hold on. In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles.

So, given that, the rhombus is determined by two perpendicular diagonals that intersect at
