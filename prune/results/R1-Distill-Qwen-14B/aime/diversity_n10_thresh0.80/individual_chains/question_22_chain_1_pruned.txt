Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300 units long. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel... So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Since it's equilateral, all the sides are the same length, which I'll call 's'. The problem is to find 's'.

Now, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, these three sides, when extended, meet to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. So, that triangle must be similar to some triangle related to the hexagon.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let's say the hexagon is inside the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides lying on lines that are sides of the triangle.

Wait, but in the problem, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these sides, when extended, become sides of the triangle. So, the triangle is larger than the hexagon, and the hexagon is sort of inscribed within this triangle, touching each side once.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled? But no, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and angles are all 120 degrees, but here it's just equilateral and opposite sides are parallel. So, it's more general.

Hmm, maybe I can model this using coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system. Let's say the triangle has vertices at (0, 0), (200, 0), and some other point. Wait, no, the sides are 200, 240, 300. Wait, which sides correspond to which lengths?

Wait, the problem says the triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and
