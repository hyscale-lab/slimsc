Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has surface area 54 and volume 23. So, whatever the dimensions of these boxes are, they must satisfy those two conditions. Then, for each such box, we want to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The radius of such a sphere would be half the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere needs to enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius is half of that diagonal.

So, if I can find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then the minimal sphere radius r would be half of that maximum diagonal. Wait, no, actually, because the sphere must contain all boxes. So, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box from B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in B. Therefore, r is the maximum space diagonal divided by 2.

Therefore, to find r, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes in B. So, the problem reduces to: given a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the maximum possible space diagonal.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

The space diagonal of a box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²), given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Alternatively, since sqrt is a monotonic function, I can equivalently maximize x² + y² + z².

So, the problem now is to maximize x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some method to maximize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz, and Q = xyz. We know that P = 27 (since 2P =54), and Q =23. Also, we know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S², because 54 is fixed. So, if I can find the maximum possible S, then x² + y² + z² will be maximized.

But wait, is that correct? Because S² = (x + y + z)², which expands to x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² -54. Therefore, yes, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S², which implies I need to maximize S.

So, now the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible S, given that P =27 and Q=23.

Wait, but how do I relate S with P and Q? I know that for three real numbers, given P and Q, S can be found using the relation for roots of a cubic equation.

If x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t³ - St² + Pt - Q = 0, then S is the sum of roots, P the sum of products, and Q the product.

So, the cubic equation is t³ - S t² + 27 t -23=0.

But for real numbers x, y, z, the cubic must have three real roots. So, the discriminant of the cubic should be non-negative.

The discriminant D of a cubic equation t³ + a t² + b t + c =0 is given by D = 18 a b c - 4 a³ c + a² b² - 4 b³ - 27 c².

Wait, maybe I should look up the discriminant formula for a cubic equation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the discriminant formula for a depressed cubic.

But maybe I can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of P and Q. But I don't think that's straightforward.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can fix two variables and express the third in terms, then use calculus to maximize S.

Let me denote variables x, y, z. Let me fix x and y, then express z from the volume equation: z = 23/(x y). Then, the surface area is 2(xy + y z + x z) =54. So, substituting z, we get:

xy + y*(23/(x y)) + x*(23/(x y)) = 27.

Simplify:

xy + 23/x + 23/y =27.

Wait, so that gives us an equation in x and y: xy + 23/x +23/y =27.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can assume symmetry or some relation between x and y.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for maximum S, variables x, y, z can't be too small or too large.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me define f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which we want to maximize.

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) -54 =0,

h(x, y, z) = xyz -23=0.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian function:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2xy + 2yz + 2xz -54) - μ(xyz -23).

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, and μ, set them equal to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(y z) =0,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(x z) =0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(x y) =0,

∂L/∂λ = -(2xy + 2yz + 2xz -54)=0,

∂L/∂μ = -(xyz -23)=0.

So, we have three equations from the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and two constraints.

Let me write the first three equations:

2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(y z) =0, (1)

2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(x z) =0, (2)

2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(x y) =0. (3)

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) =54, (4)

xyz =23. (5)

Now, the goal is to solve these equations for x, y, z, λ, μ.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find some symmetry.

Suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y. Maybe that will simplify things.

Let me assume x = y. Then, let's see if this assumption holds.

If x = y, then let me denote x = y = a, and z = b.

Then, the constraints become:

2(a² + a b + a b) =54 => 2(a² + 2ab) =54 => a² + 2ab =27.

And the volume constraint is a² b =23.

So, from the surface area equation: a² + 2ab =27.

From the volume: a² b =23. So, b =23/(a²).

Substituting into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) =27.

Simplify:

a² + (46/a) =27.

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ +46 =27a.

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ -27a +46 =0.

Now, we need to solve this cubic equation for a.

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0.

a=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, wait, 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So, a=2 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor (a -2) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a-2).

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

      1  2  -23   0

So, the cubic factors as (a -2)(a² + 2a -23)=0.

Setting each factor to zero:

a=2,

a² +2a -23=0 → a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4 sqrt(6)]/2= -1 ±2 sqrt(6).

Since a is a length, it must be positive. So, a=2, or a= -1 +2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈ 3.898, or a= -1 -2 sqrt(6) which is negative, so discard.

So, possible a=2 and a= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).

So, let me check if a=2 is valid.

If a=2, then from the surface area equation:

a² +2ab=27 →4 + 2*2*b=27→4 +4b=27→4b=23→b=23/4=5.75.

So, z=5.75.

So, x=y=2, z=5.75.

Check the volume: 2*2*5.75=23, yes.

So, that's one solution.

Another solution: a= -1 +2 sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.898.

Then, b=23/(a²).

Compute a²:

a= -1 +2 sqrt(6),

a²= (-1)^2 + (2 sqrt(6))^2 + 2*(-1)*(2 sqrt(6)) =1 +24 -4 sqrt(6)=25 -4 sqrt(6).

So, b=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).

Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)).

b=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6)) / [ (25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2 ].

Denominator: 625 - 16*6=625 -96=529.

So, denominator is 529=23².

So, b= [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/23²= (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, b≈ (25 + 4*2.449)/23 ≈ (25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513.

So, x=y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Now, with these values, let's check the surface area:

xy + yz + xz = a² + 2ab.

Since a² + 2ab =27, as per constraint, so 2*(27)=54. Correct.

So, both solutions satisfy the constraints.

Now, going back to the original problem, which is to maximize x² + y² + z².

So, when x=y=2, z=5.75,

x² + y² + z²= 4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625= 41 + 0.0625=41 +1/16= 657/16.

Wait, 5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2=529/16.

So, x² + y² + z²=2² +2² + (23/4)^2=4+4+529/16=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

Now, when x=y= -1 +2 sqrt(6)≈3.898, z=approx1.513.

Compute x² + y² + z²=2a² + b².

a= -1 +2 sqrt(6),

a²=25 -4 sqrt(6),

so 2a²=50 -8 sqrt(6).

b= (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23,

so b²= [25 +4 sqrt(6)]² / (23²).

Compute numerator:

25² + (4 sqrt(6))² + 2*25*4 sqrt(6)=625 + 16*6 + 200 sqrt(6)=625 +96 +200 sqrt(6)=721 +200 sqrt(6).

Denominator: 529.

So, b²=(721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Hmm, this looks messy. Maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute 50 -8 sqrt(6) ≈50 -8*2.449≈50 -19.592≈30.408.

Compute (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529≈(721 +200*2.449)/529≈(721 +489.8)/529≈1210.8/529≈2.289.

So, total x² + y² + z²≈30.408 +2.289≈32.697.

Compare this to the previous case, which was 657/16≈41.0625.

So, 41.06 is larger than 32.697, so the maximum occurs when x=y=2, z=23/4.

Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16.

Thus, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4.

Therefore, the radius r is half of that, so (sqrt(657)/4)/2= sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, no. Wait, space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), which is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4. So, the radius of the sphere is half of that, which would be sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, no, wait, wait. The sphere must enclose the box, so the sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius is half the space diagonal. So, if the space diagonal is sqrt(657)/4, then the radius is (sqrt(657)/4)/2= sqrt(657)/8.

Wait, but that seems too small. Let me think again.

Wait, the space diagonal is the distance from one corner of the box to the opposite corner. So, for a box with sides x, y, z, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). The sphere needs to contain the entire box, so the radius must be equal to half of the space diagonal. So, yes, r = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2.

Wait, but in the case where x=y=2, z=23/4, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 + (23/4)^2)=sqrt(8 + (529/16))= sqrt((128 +529)/16)=sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4. So, the radius is half that, sqrt(657)/8.

But wait, 657/16 is (657)/(16). So, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, r is sqrt(657)/8. So, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/(64).

So, r squared is 657/64.

But wait, is 657 and 64 coprime? Let's check.

64 factors: 2^6.

657 divided by 3: 6+5+7=18, which is divisible by 3. 657 ÷3=219. 219 ÷3=73. So, 657=3²×73.

64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So, 657 and 64 are coprime? Wait, 657 is 3²×73, and 64 is 2^6. They share no common prime factors, so yes, 657/64 is in simplest terms.

So, p=657, q=64. Then, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but wait a minute. Earlier, when I assumed x=y, I found that r squared is 657/64. But is that the maximum possible?

Because when I assumed x=y, I found two possible solutions, one gave a larger x² + y² + z² than the other. But what if the maximum occurs when all three variables are different?

Wait, perhaps in the case when x, y, z are not equal, the x² + y² + z² could be larger? But in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, it's already a valid solution with a higher x² + y² + z² than the other case.

But is that the maximum possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the box is a cube? Wait, but a cube with surface area 54 would have all sides equal.

Wait, for a cube, surface area is 6a²=54 → a²=9 → a=3. Then, volume would be 27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, not 27. So, the box can't be a cube because the volume doesn't match. So, the box is not a cube.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two sides are as small as possible, making the third as large as possible. But I think the case when x=y=2, z=23/4 gives a larger x² + y² + z² than the other case.

But wait, perhaps I should verify whether the solution when x=y gives the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the function to maximize is convex, so the maximum occurs at the boundary.

But perhaps another approach: using inequalities.

We know that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the following inequality holds:

x² + y² + z² ≥ (xy + yz + xz).

But in our case, xy + yz + xz=27, so x² + y² + z² ≥27. But we have x² + y² + z² = S² -54, so S² ≥27 +54=81 → S≥9.

Wait, but that's the minimum, not the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum of S.

Wait, perhaps using AM ≥ GM.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of S as the sum x + y + z, and given that xyz=23 and xy + yz + xz=27.

Wait, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM on x, y, z.

AM is (x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)=23^(1/3).

Compute 23^(1/3)≈2.843.

So, S/3 ≥2.843 → S≥8.529. But this is the lower bound. We are interested in the upper bound.

Alternatively, perhaps using some other inequality.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for fixed P and Q, S is maximized when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible.

Wait, for example, in the case when x=y=2, z=5.75, which we found earlier, which gives a larger S.

Wait, let me compute S in this case.

x + y + z=2 +2 +5.75=9.75.

In the other case, x= y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

So, S≈3.898 +3.898 +1.513≈9.309.

Which is less than 9.75.

Wait, so in the first case, when x=y=2, S=9.75, which is higher than the other case. So, perhaps that is the maximum.

Therefore, the maximum of S is 9.75=39/4.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= S² -54= (39/4)^2 -54= (1521/16) - (864/16)= (1521 -864)/16=657/16.

Which is the same as we found earlier.

Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4.

Therefore, the radius is half that, which is sqrt(657)/8.

So, r squared is (sqrt(657)/8)^2=657/64.

So, as a fraction, 657/64, which is already in lowest terms as 657 and 64 share no common factors.

Thus, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.

Therefore, the answer is 721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set \( \mathcal{B} \), where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal of the box. We aim to maximize the space diagonal, which is equivalent to maximizing \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) given the constraints \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) and \( xyz = 23 \).

1. **Express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in terms of the sum \( S = x + y + z \):**
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S^2 - 54
   \]
   To maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), we need to maximize \( S^2 \).

2. **Assume symmetry by setting \( x = y \):**
   Let \( x = y = a \) and \( z = b \). The constraints become:
   \[
   a^2 + 2ab = 27 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 b = 23
   \]
   Solving these, we find \( a = 2 \) and \( b = \frac{23}{4} \).

3. **Calculate \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) for \( x = y = 2 \) and \( z = \frac{23}{4} \):**
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
   \]

4. **Determine the space diagonal and radius:**
   The space diagonal is \( \sqrt{\frac{657}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{4} \). The radius \( r \) is half of this:
   \[
   r = \frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}
   \]
   Thus, \( r^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{657}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{64} \).

5. **Simplify and find \( p + q \):**
   The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest form since 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
