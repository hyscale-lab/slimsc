Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, alright. Let's break this down. First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots.

The product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's 13 terms multiplied together. Each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute this product modulo 1000.

Wait, maybe I can simplify each term first. Let's look at the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe factor it or find a pattern.

Hmm, let's rearrange it: 2 + ω^{2k} - 2ω^k. Maybe factor out the 2? Or perhaps write it as something squared?

Wait, let me try writing it as (aω^k + b)(cω^k + d). Let's see if that works. So, suppose (aω^k + b)(cω^k + d) = ac ω^{2k} + (ad + bc) ω^k + bd.

Comparing to 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, so we have:

ac = 1 (coefficient of ω^{2k}),
ad + bc = -2 (coefficient of ω^k),
bd = 2 (constant term).

So, let's solve these equations. Let's assume a and c are integers. Since ac=1, possible a=1 and c=1 or a=-1 and c=-1. Let's try a=1, c=1.

Then, ad + bc = d + b = -2. And bd=2. So, we need two numbers b and d such that their product is 2 and their sum is -2. The possible pairs for b and d are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1). Let's see:

If b= -1, d= -1, then b*d= 1, which isn't 2. Hmm. If b= -2 and d= -0, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe fractions?

Wait, maybe a and c don't have to be integers. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, let's think of the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me denote x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x².

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2. Let me see if this quadratic factors. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots would be [
