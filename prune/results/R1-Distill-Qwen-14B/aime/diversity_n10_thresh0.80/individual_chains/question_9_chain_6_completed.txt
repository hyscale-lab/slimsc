Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. The question is asking for the value of xy.

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember some properties. Let me write down the given equations first.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I think I can use the logarithm power rule here. The power rule says that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that to the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the power rule again:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10
2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to relate these two equations. I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A, so log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So, substituting into the equations:

1) x * A = 10
2) 4y * (1/A) = 10

From the first equation, I can express A as A = 10 / x.

Substituting this into the second equation:

4y * (1/(10 / x)) = 10

Simplify that:

4y * (x / 10) = 10

Which is (4xy) / 10 = 10.

Multiply both sides by 10:

4xy = 100

Divide both sides by 4:

xy = 25

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the product xy is 25.

But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

1) log_x(y^x) = 10 → x * log_x(y) = 10 → x * A = 10, where A = log_x(y).
2) log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Since log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/A, then 4y * (1/A) = 10.

Then, from equation 1: A = 10 / x.

Substitute into equation 2: 4y * (x / 10) = 10 → (4xy)/10 = 10 → 4xy = 100 → xy = 25.

Yep, that looks correct. So, xy is 25.

I think that's the answer. It all checks out, so I don't see any mistakes in the logic.


Given the equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the logarithm power rule, we rewrite them as:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(A = \log_x(y)\). Then, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{A}\). Substituting into the equations:

1. \(x \cdot A = 10 \implies A = \frac{10}{x}\)
2. \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{A} = 10 \implies 4y \cdot \frac{x}{10} = 10\)

Simplifying the second equation:

\[
\frac{4xy}{10} = 10 \implies 4xy = 100 \implies xy = 25
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
