Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and another equation involving squares and products, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is a linear equation, and the second one is a quadratic in terms of the variables multiplied together. I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations, it can help to use symmetric sums or maybe factor them in a clever way.

Let me write down what I know:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that all the terms are products of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a squared and multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly for the others. 

Wait a second, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it. 

I see that each term has two variables, so perhaps grouping them might help. Let me group the terms with a², b², and c²:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Oh, that looks better. So the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, now since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), because a + b + c = 300 implies b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

So that simplifies the second equation a bit. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Wait, I can factor out a 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can find another relation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation. 

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So since I know a + b + c is 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

Which means:

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, if I let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ac, and S3 = abc, then I know that a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2.

So, a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

So, going back to the
