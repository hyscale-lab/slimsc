Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

So, let me break that down. If n is a two-digit number in base b, that means in base 10, n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Here, a is the "tens" place and c is the "units" place.

But wait, in base b, two-digit numbers go from b (which is 1*b + 0, so a=1, c=0) up to b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)*b + (b-1)). So n must satisfy b ≤ n < b².

Additionally, the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, a + c = sqrt(n). 

So, putting these together, we have:

n = a*b + c
a + c = sqrt(n)

Let me square both sides of the second equation to get rid of the square root:

(a + c)^2 = n

But since n is also a*b + c, we can set them equal:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Expanding (a + c)^2:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can express this differently. Let me group terms:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Wait, maybe factor out some terms. Let me see:

Looking at terms with a:

a² + 2ac - a*b = a(a + 2c - b)

And then the remaining terms are c² - c.

So, a(a + 2c - b) + c(c - 1) = 0

Not sure if that's helpful yet. Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for each c, we can solve for a.

But a and c are digits in base b, so they must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. Also, since n is a two-digit number, a cannot be zero (otherwise, it's a single-digit number). So a must be at least 1, and up to b-1. Similarly, c must be between 0 and b-1.

So for each b, I need to find all pairs (a, c) where a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me note that the equation is:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me try to rearrange terms to see if I can express b in terms of a and c:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c
=> a*b = (a + c)^2 - c
=> b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a

Hmm, that might be useful. So for given a and c, b must equal [(a + c)^2 - c]/a.

But since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a. Also, since a and c are digits in base b, they must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1. So, perhaps I can fix a and c and see for which b's this holds.

Wait, but I think it's better to think in terms of for a given b, how many (a, c) pairs satisfy the equation. The problem asks for the smallest b where the number of such pairs is more than ten.

So, perhaps I can model this as for each b, count the number of valid (a, c) pairs, and find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.

But that might involve a lot of computation. Let me think if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I can note that n = (a + c)^2, and n is also a*b + c. So each b-eautiful number is a perfect square. So n must be a square, say k², where k = a + c.

So, k
