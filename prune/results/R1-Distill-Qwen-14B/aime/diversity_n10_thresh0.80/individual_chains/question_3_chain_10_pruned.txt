Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down and figure out how to solve it. I'll take it step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the problem says: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the chosen four. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, which means all four numbers match. Event B is winning a prize, which means at least two numbers match. So, the probability we're looking for is P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), because if A happens, then B must also happen. So, A is a subset of B.

Wait, let me think about that again. If Jen wins the grand prize, she definitely has all four numbers matching, which means she also has at least two matching. So, yes, A is a subset of B. So, the probability P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, we need to calculate two probabilities: P(A) and P(B), then divide them to get the conditional probability.

Let me start by calculating P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers from 10, and Jen also picks 4 numbers, the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is just 1, because there's only one specific set of 4 numbers that Jen has. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me compute C(10,4). The combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)). So, C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, onto P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. This is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four chosen.

Calculating P(B) might be a bit more involved. It's often easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract it from 1. The complement of having at least two matches is having fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

So, let's compute P(zero matches) and P(one match).

First, P(zero matches). This is the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen in the four-number draw. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4) = 210.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers that none are among Jen's four is equivalent to choosing all four numbers from the remaining six numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, it's C(6,4).

C(6,4) is 15. Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1 / 14.

Next, P(one match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three numbers are from the remaining six.

The number of ways to choose exactly one of Jen's numbers is C(4,1) (choosing 1 from her 4), multiplied by C(6,3) (choosing the remaining 3 from the 6 non-Jen numbers).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, P(one match) = 80 / 210. Let me simplify that. 80 divided by 210 is 8/21.

Wait, 80 divided by 210 is actually 8/21, because 80 ÷ 10 = 8, 210 ÷10=21. So, yes, that's correct.

So, now, P(B) is 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match) = 1 - (1/14) - (8/21).

Let me compute that. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 14 and 21. The least common multiple is 42.

So, converting each term:

1 = 42/42

1/14 = 3/42

8/21 = 16/42

So, P
