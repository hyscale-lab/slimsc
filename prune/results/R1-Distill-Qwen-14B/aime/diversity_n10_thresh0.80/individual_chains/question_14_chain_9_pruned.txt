Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And it's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7.

Alright, let's break this down. Let me consider N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9.

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7. The same goes for changing C to 1, giving AB1D, and changing D to 1, giving ABC1, all of which must be divisible by 7.

So N has this interesting property where altering any digit (except possibly keeping one digit as 1) to 1 forces the number to become a multiple of 7.

Now, since we're looking for the greatest such four-digit number, I think a good starting point is to consider that N itself might not be divisible by 7, because if it were, changing one of its digits to 1 might not necessarily preserve divisibility by 7. Or maybe it's even possible that N is not divisible by 7? Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but the problem says that when you change one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So N could be any number, but it must satisfy the condition that all four possible variations (changing A, B, C, D to 1) result in numbers divisible by 7.

So, perhaps N is such that when each digit is replaced by 1, it becomes a multiple of 7. So the problem is to find the largest four-digit number with this property.

I think the strategy here is to model this mathematically. Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, when we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Replacing C with 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Also divisible by 7.

Replacing D with 1 gives 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. That must be divisible by 7 as well.

So, let me write down these four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

These four congruences must all hold true.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to express each of these in terms of N. Let's denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, the four numbers after changing a digit to 1 are:

1. When A is changed to 1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 1000 = N - 1000(A - 1). Wait, perhaps that's not the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each modified number as N with one digit replaced by 1.

Wait, for the first case, changing A to 1: N' = 1BCD. Which is equal to 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, changing B to 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, A1CD = N - 100B + 100*1 = N - 100(B - 1).

Wait, that's a way to express it in terms of N. Similarly, for changing C to 1, it's AB1D = N - 10C + 10*1 = N - 10C + 10.

And for changing D to 1, it's ABC1 = N - D + 1 = N - (D - 1).

So, each modified number can be expressed as N minus some value plus 1. Let me denote:

1. When changing A to 1: N' = N - 1000(A - 1)
2. When changing B to 1: N' = N - 100(B - 1)
3. When changing C to 1: N' = N - 10(C - 1)
4. When changing D to 1: N' = N - (D - 1)

Each of these N' must be divisible by 7.

So, N' ≡ 0 mod 7.

Therefore, for each of these:

1. N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Alternatively, N ≡ 1000(A - 1) mod 7,

N ≡ 100(B - 1) mod 7,

N ≡ 10(C - 1) mod 7,

N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

Hmm, interesting. So, these four expressions for N modulo 7 must all be equal.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

1000 / 7 is 142*7 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 / 7 is 14*7 = 98, so 100 -98=2, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ≡ 3 mod 7, because 10-7=3.

1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, replacing these:

1. N ≡ 6*(A - 1) mod 7
2. N ≡ 2*(B - 1) mod 7
3. N ≡ 3*(C - 1) mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1) mod 7

So, all four expressions must equal N mod 7. Therefore, all four must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

So:

6*(A - 1) ≡ 2*(B - 1) ≡ 3*(C - 1) ≡ (D - 1) mod 7.

Let me denote this common value as k. So,

6*(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7,

2*(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7,

3*(C - 1) ≡ k mod 7,

(D - 1) ≡ k mod 7.

Therefore, k must satisfy all these congruences. So, for each digit, we can express it in terms of k.

Let me solve for each digit:

From 6*(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7,

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 6 mod 7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 is 6.

So, A - 1 ≡ 6k mod 7,

Thus, A ≡ 1 + 6k mod 7.

Similarly, for 2*(B - 1) ≡k mod7,

Multiply both sides by inverse of 2 mod7. 2*4=8≡1, so inverse is 4.

Thus, B - 1 ≡4k mod7,

So, B ≡1 +4k mod7.

For 3*(C - 1)≡k mod7,

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

Thus, C -1 ≡5k mod7,

So, C≡1 +5k mod7.

For (D -1)≡k mod7,

So, D≡1 +k mod7.

So, all digits A, B, C, D can be expressed in terms of k.

But since A, B, C, D are digits, each must be between 0 and 9 (except A, which is between 1 and 9). So, their expressions mod7 must result in integers in their respective ranges.

So, let's write down each digit:

A = 1 +6k +7m, where m is an integer such that A is between 1 and 9.

Similarly,

B=1 +4k +7n,

C=1 +5k +7p,

D=1 +k +7q,

where m, n, p, q are integers to adjust each digit into the correct range.

But since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we want N to be as large as possible, so we need A to be as large as possible, then B, then C, then D.

So, let me try to find the maximum possible value of A, given that A =1 +6k +7m, and 1 ≤ A ≤9.

Similarly, for B=1 +4k +7n, 0 ≤ B ≤9,

C=1 +5k +7p, 0 ≤ C ≤9,

D=1 +k +7q, 0 ≤ D ≤9.

Now, since N is a four-digit number, A must be at least 1 and at most 9.

Let me denote k as an integer between 0 and 6 because mod7 cycles every 7, so possible k values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Our goal is to find k such that all digits A, B, C, D are within their permissible ranges, and N is maximized.

Let me try to find k such that when we compute A, B, C, D from the above equations, each digit is valid.

Since we need N as large as possible, we should try the largest possible A, which is 9, and see if that's possible.

So, let's try A=9. Then, from A=1 +6k +7m,

Set 9=1 +6k +7m.

Thus, 6k +7m=8.

We need to find integers k and m such that 6k +7m=8, with k between 0 and6.

Let's solve for possible k:

For m=0: 6k=8→k=8/6=1.333, not integer.

m=1:6k=8-7=1→k=1/6≈0.166, not integer.

m=2:6k=8-14= -6→k=-1, which is below 0. Not allowed.

m= -1:6k=8 +7=15→k=15/6=2.5, not integer.

So, no solution for A=9.

Hmm, so A cannot be 9. Let's try A=8.

Set A=8: 8=1 +6k +7m→6k +7m=7.

Looking for k and m integers, 0 ≤k≤6.

Possible m:

m=0:6k=7→k≈1.166, no.

m=1:6k=0→k=0.

So, m=1, k=0.

Wait, 6k +7m=7: if m=1, 6k=0→k=0.

So, that's possible.

So, for A=8, k=0, m=1.

Then, let's check the other digits with k=0.

From above:

B=1 +4k +7n=1+0+7n=1+7n.

Since B must be between 0 and9, n can be 0 or 1.

If n=1: B=8.

If n=0: B=1.

Similarly, C=1 +5k +7p=1+0+7p=1+7p.

C must be between 0 and9, so p can be 0,1.

p=1→C=8, p=0→C=1.

D=1 +k +7q=1 +0 +7q=1+7q.

D must be 0-9: q=0→1, q=1→8.

So, with k=0, A=8, and the other digits can be 1 or8.

Since we're trying to maximize N, we want the highest possible digits. So, for A=8, we can set B=8, C=8, D=8.

Wait, but let's check if this is possible.

If k=0, then:

A=8,

B=1 +4*0 +7n=1+7n.

To have B=8, n=1.

Similarly, C=1 +5*0 +7p=1+7p=8 when p=1.

D=1 +0 +7q=1+7q=8 when q=1.

So, yes, N would be 8888.

Wait, but we need to check whether changing any digit to 1 would make the number divisible by 7.

Let me test this.

If N=8888, changing any digit to 1:

- Change A to 1: 1888. Is 1888 divisible by7?

Let me compute 1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So remainder 5. Not divisible by7. So N=8888 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so that's a problem. So, even though k=0 gives A=8, and other digits can be 8, that N=8888 doesn't satisfy the conditions. So, it's invalid.

So, perhaps k=0 is not acceptable, even though it gives A=8. Because when we change A to1, the number 1888 isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps I need to find a k where all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

So, perhaps k=0 is invalid because 1888 isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps I need to find another value of k.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me think about the four modified numbers: changing each digit to1 must result in a multiple of7. So, perhaps for each of those numbers, N' is divisible by7. So, perhaps I can write equations for each N' and find N.

But that seems complicated for four variables. Maybe a better approach is to model N in terms of k.

Wait, so from the earlier equations, we have:

A=1 +6k mod7,

But since A is a digit, A=1 +6k -7m, where m is chosen so that A is between1 and9.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each digit in terms of k, and then check if the resulting digits are valid.

Wait, in the earlier approach, setting A=8 with k=0 didn't work because 1888 isn't divisible by7. So, perhaps I need to try a different k.

Wait, perhaps k=1.

Let me try k=1.

So, k=1.

Then,

A=1 +6*1=7 mod7→7 mod7=0, but A must be at least1. So, A=0 +7m.

But 7m must be between1 and9. m=1→A=7, m=2→A=14, which is invalid.

So, A=7, m=1.

So, A=7.

Then, B=1 +4*1=5 mod7. So B=5 +7n.

Since B is a digit (0-9), n can be 0 or1.

n=0→B=5, n=1→B=12, which is invalid. So B=5.

C=1 +5*1=6 mod7. So C=6 +7p. p can be 0→C=6, p=1→13 invalid. So C=6.

D=1 +1=2 mod7. So D=2+7q. q=0→2, q=1→9, q=2→16 invalid. So D can be2 or9.

Since we want the largest N, we set D=9.

So, N=7 (A=7) 5 (B=5) 6 (C=6) 9 (D=9).

So, N=7569.

Now, let's check if changing each digit to1 gives a multiple of7.

Change A to1: 1569.

Compute 1569 ÷7. 7*224=1568, so 1569=7*224 +1→remainder1. Not divisible by7. So N=7569 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, that's an issue. So, maybe k=1 isn't acceptable either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in choosing D.

Wait, D=1 +k +7q=1+1 +7q=2 +7q.

So q can be 0→D=2, q=1→D=9, q=2→16 invalid.

If I set D=9, then changing D to1 would result in 7561. Let me check if that's divisible by7.

7561 ÷7: 7*1080=7560, so 7561=7*1080+1→remainder1. Not divisible by7.

So, changing D to1 gives 7561, which isn't divisible by7. So N=7569 is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps I need to try a different k.

Let me try k=2.

k=2.

Compute A=1 +6*2=13→13 mod7=6. So A=6 +7m.

A must be between1 and9, so m=0→A=6, m=1→13 invalid.

So A=6.

B=1 +4*2=9 mod7=2. So B=2 +7n.

n can be 0→B=2, n=1→9, n=2→16 invalid.

So, to maximize B, set B=9.

C=1 +5*2=11→11 mod7=4. So C=4 +7p.

p=0→4, p=1→11 invalid.

So C=4.

D=1 +2=3 mod7. So D=3 +7q.

q=0→3, q=1→10 invalid.

So D=3.

So, N=6 (A=6) 9 (B=9) 4 (C=4) 3 (D=3) →6943.

Wait, let me check the modified numbers.

Change A to1: 1943.

Check 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4→remainder4. Not divisible by7. So invalid.

So, N=6943 doesn't work.

Hmm. So k=2 gives A=6, but when we change A to1, it doesn't result in a multiple of7. So, this N is invalid.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust which digits to set to higher values.

Wait, perhaps when setting D, even though D=3, maybe setting D=3+7=10 is invalid, but perhaps I can't. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each modified number as N' and express N in terms of N'.

From the
