Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, for rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are both 107, and BC and AD are both 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17.

Points D, E, C, F are on the same straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. Let me visualize this: if I imagine both rectangles connected in some way, with D and C being adjacent corners of the first rectangle, and E and F being adjacent corners of the second rectangle. But since they're collinear, it's like the line goes through D, then E, then C, then F. So the order is D-E-C-F on a straight line.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. That suggests that quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I think I need to draw a diagram to visualize this. Maybe I can sketch both rectangles and see how they are connected.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points to model this. Let's set a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107, then AD must be 16 as well because it's the side opposite to BC.

Wait, no, wait. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0), because DC is 16. Then B is at (16, 107), and A is at (0, 107). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think.

Wait, actually, the sides AB and CD are 107, and BC and AD are 16. So if I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (16,0) because DC is 16. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, B is at (16, 107), and A is at (0,107). That makes AB = 107 (from (0,107) to (16,107)) and BC = 16 (from (16,107) to (16,0)).

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Given that FG = 17 and EF = 184. So EFGH has sides 17
