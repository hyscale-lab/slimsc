Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let's try to understand what it's asking for.

First, the problem says that for a given integer b (where b is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. They gave an example with 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Cool, I think I get that.

So, the task is to find the least integer b (which is 2 or higher) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. In other words, for that particular base b, there are over ten numbers n that satisfy the two conditions mentioned.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I need to understand what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can be from 1 to b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c can be from 0 to b-1.

So, n can be written as:

n = a * b + c

where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

Next, the sum of the digits a and c must equal sqrt(n). So,

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n is a * b + c, substituting that in, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Hmm, that's an equation we can work with. Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let's rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe we can reorganize this equation to solve for b or something else.

Let me try moving the terms around:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a * b

Then,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this.

Looking back, perhaps I can collect like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a * b

So,

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a * b

Let's factor the left side. Hmm, a^2 + 2ac + c^2 is (a + c)^2, so:

(a + c)^2 - c = a * b

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Hmm, that's another way to write it. Maybe that can help.

Alternatively, since a + c = sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c, we can write:

sqrt(n) = a + c

So,

n = (a + c)^2

But n is also a*b + c, so:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Which brings us back to the same equation.

So, the key equation is:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me think about how to approach this. Perhaps for each base b, we can iterate through possible a and c values and see which pairs satisfy the equation. But since the problem is asking for the minimal b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, maybe we can find a way to parameterize this.

Wait, maybe instead of fixing b and looking for a and c, we can fix a and c, compute b, and then count how many b's result in each a and c. But that might not be straightforward because b is dependent on a and c.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express b in terms of a and c:

From the equation,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Simplify:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Hmm, since b must be an integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer. So, a must divide (c^2 - c).

So, a |
