Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon where each side is equal and opposite sides are parallel. That makes me think of something like a regular hexagon, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles could be different. But in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, and opposite sides are parallel, but here it's just equilateral with opposite sides parallel.

Since all sides are equal, each side of the hexagon has the same length, let's say 's'. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. That triangle must be the outer triangle that encloses the hexagon.

Wait, how exactly are AB, CD, and EF extended to form a triangle? Let me think. In a convex hexagon, each side is connected sequentially. So AB is one side, BC the next, and so on until FA.

If all opposite sides are parallel, then AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. So, the sides come in three pairs of parallels.

When we extend AB, CD, and EF, they will meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, each of these extensions must be forming a side of the triangle.

I think this setup is similar to a triangular prism or maybe a hexagon that's part of a larger triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the opposite sides are parallel, there must be some proportional relationships here.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Imagine the hexagon inside a large triangle. The sides AB, CD, EF, when extended, form the sides of this larger triangle. The hexagon is between this triangle and another smaller triangle inside, perhaps.

Since each side of the hexagon is 's', and the sides of the larger triangle are 200, 240, and 300, maybe I can find the relationship between 's' and these lengths.

I remember something about similar triangles and the concept that when lines are drawn parallel to each other, they create similar triangles. So, if the hexagon is such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel, the triangles formed by these extensions should be similar to the inner triangles.

Wait, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are the midlines of the larger triangle. But no, the midline theorem says that the midline is half the length of the third side, but here the hexagon's side length isn't necessarily half.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is formed by taking a portion of each side of the triangle. Since it's a hexagon, each side of the triangle is divided into two parts by the hexagon.

Wait, let me try to think of the triangle as being split into smaller sections by the hexagon. Each side of the triangle is split into two segments. The length of each extension beyond the hexagon would be proportional.

But how exactly? Let me label the triangle as triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let's call the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF as triangle T.

So, sides AB, CD, EF when extended form triangle T. Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex and equilateral, each of these sides is length 's'.

But how do these sides of the hexagon relate to the sides of triangle T? Perhaps the sides of triangle T are composed of the extensions of AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon.

Wait, no. The sides of triangle T are exactly the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these extensions meet at points forming triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300.

But I'm a bit
