Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down one by one.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers we pick, when we add them all up, they should total 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. So 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, the median is the middle number when the list is ordered. So if the median is a positive integer not in the list, that means it's a number that sits right in the middle of the ordered list but isn't actually present in the list. Interesting.

Alright, so let's start by thinking about the mode first because that might narrow things down a bit.

Since the mode is 9, 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So the minimum number of times 9 appears is two, but if another number also appears twice, then 9 is only unique if it appears more than that. So perhaps 9 appears three times, and all other numbers appear at most two times?

But wait, maybe 9 appears four times? Let's think.

Wait, the problem says the unique mode is 9. So 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list. So if 9 appears, say, three times, then no other number can appear three or more times. So that's the key.

Now, the sum is 30, so the list can't have too many numbers. Let's consider how many numbers are in the list.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of elements in the list. Hmm. So we might have to figure that out as part of the problem.

Wait, but let's think about the median. The median depends on the number of elements. If the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle number. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this problem, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So let's consider both cases.

First, let's consider the number of elements in the list.

Let me denote the number of elements as n. So n could be any positive integer, but given that the sum is 30 and all are positive integers, n can't be too large. For example, if n is 30, all elements would be 1. But that would make the mode undefined or all numbers modes.
