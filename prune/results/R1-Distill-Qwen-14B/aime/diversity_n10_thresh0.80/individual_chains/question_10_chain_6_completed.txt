Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. So, first, let me parse what's going on here. Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, so Bob is listing all possible finite non-empty sets B where max(B) is in A. So each such set B has a maximum which is one of Alice's chosen numbers.

Let me think about how these sets B are structured. For a given maximum element m in A, how many sets B can we form where m is the maximum. Well, for each m, the other elements of B must be less than m. But they can be any positive integers less than m, right?

Wait, but the set B must be finite and non-empty. So, for a given m in A, the number of possible sets B where m is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, excluding the empty set. Because we can choose any combination of numbers less than m, and then add m to make B.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, for each m, the number of finite non-empty sets B with maximum m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, because each subset can be combined with m to form a set B where m is the maximum. But wait, how does that count? Let me think again.

Suppose m is in A. Then any set B where max(B) = m must consist of m together with any subset of the positive integers less than m. But since B has to be a set, the elements must be unique. So, for each m, the number of such sets is equal to 2^{m-1}. Because for each of the numbers less than m, you can choose whether to include it or not in B. But wait, including none of them would just give the set {m}, which is allowed because B is non-empty.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "finite non-empty sets B of positive integers". So for each m in A, the number of sets B with max(B) = m is 2^{m−1}. Because you can choose any subset of {1,2,...,m−1}, including the empty subset, which gives the set {m}.

But then, the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m−1}.

Wait, let me check that. Let's take a small example. Suppose A is {1}. Then m=1. The number of sets B with max(B)=1 is 2^{0}=1. So Bob's list has 1 set, which is {1}. Correct.

If A is {2}, then m=2. The number of sets B with max(B)=2 is 2^{1}=2. Those sets are {2}, and {1,2}. So Bob's list has 2 sets. That works.

If A is {1,2}, then the total number of sets would be 2^{1-1} + 2^{2-1} = 1 + 2 = 3. Let's see: the sets are {1}, {2}, {1,2}. Yes, that's 3 sets. So that seems correct.

So in general, if A is a set of positive integers, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m-1}. And this total is given as 2024. So the equation is:

Sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024

Our goal is to find the sum of elements of A, which is Sum_{m in A} m.

So we need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A is 2024. Then compute the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm. So the problem reduces to finding a set of exponents such that their sum of 2^{m-1} equals 2024, then sum the m's.

Let me think about how to represent 2024 in binary because 2^{m-1} are powers of two. So maybe the sum is a sum of distinct powers of two, each multiplied by 1.

Wait, because each 2^{m-1} is a power of two, and if A has elements m1, m2, etc., then the sum is the sum of 2^{m1-1} + 2^{m2-1} + ... etc.

Since each term is a unique power of two, the sum will have 1s in the binary representation corresponding to each term.

Wait, no, wait. Let's see. Let me think of 2024 as a binary number. Let me compute 2024 in binary.

2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2=1012, rem 0

1012/2=506, rem 0

506/2=253, rem 0

253/2=126 rem 1

126/2=63 rem 0

63/2=31 rem 1

31/2=15 rem 1

15/2=7 rem 1

7/2=3 rem 1

3/2=1 rem 1

1/2=0 rem 1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let's compute step by step:

2024 /2 = 1012, remainder 0

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0

506 /2=253, rem 0

253 /2=126, rem 1

126 /2=63, rem 0

63 /2=31, rem1

31 /2=15, rem1

15/2=7, rem1

7/2=3, rem1

3/2=1, rem1

1/2=0, rem1

So reading the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let's count the number of bits:

From last division to first:

1 (from 1/2), then 1 (3/2), 1 (7/2), 1 (15/2), 1 (31/2), 1 (63/2), 0 (126/2), 1 (253/2), 0 (506/2), 0 (1012/2), 0 (2024/2).

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it as:

Compute 2024 in binary.

We can also compute it by finding the highest power of 2 less than 2024.

Let me list the powers of two:

2^0=1

2^1=2

2^2=4

2^3=8

2^4=16

2^5=32

2^6=64

2^7=128

2^8=256

2^9=512

2^10=1024

2^11=2048

Ah, 2^11 is 2048, which is more than 2024. So the highest power is 2^10=1024.

So, 2024 = 1024 + 999 + ... wait, 2024 -1024=1000.

Wait, but 1000 is still a big number. Let me think in terms of binary.

But perhaps it's easier to just write 2024 in binary.

Let me compute:

2024 divided by 2 repeatedly.

2024 /2=1012 rem 0

1012 /2=506 rem 0

506/2=253 rem 0

253/2=126 rem 1

126/2=63 rem 0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So the remainders, from last to first, are: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0.

Wait, let me list them in order:

Start from the last division:

1 (from 1/2), then 1 (from 3/2), 1 (7/2), 1 (15/2), 1 (31/2), 1 (63/2), 0 (126/2), 1 (253/2), 0 (506/2), 0 (1012/2), 0 (2024/2).

Wait, that seems to correspond to bits from least significant to most. So the binary is 111111011000.

Wait, let me count the bits. The remainders are from last to first:

1 (LSB), 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 (MSB). So the binary is 111111011000.

Wait, let me check:

111111011000 in binary is equal to:

From right to left:

Positions 0 to 10.

Positions with 1s are:

Position 0: 0

Position 1: 0

Position 2: 0

Position 3: 1 (2^3=8)

Position 4: 1 (16)

Position 5: 0 (32)

Position 6:1 (64)

Position 7:1 (128)

Position 8:1 (256)

Position 9:1 (512)

Position 10:1 (1024)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the rightmost bit is position 0.

So 111111011000 is:

Positions: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:      1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me recount.

Wait, when I list the remainders, the first remainder is the least significant bit (position 0). So the remainders from the divisions are:

2024/2 → rem 0 (position 0)

1012/2 → rem 0 (position 1)

506/2 → rem 0 (position 2)

253/2 → rem 1 (position3)

126/2 → rem 0 (position4)

63/2 → rem1 (position5)

31/2 → rem1 (position6)

15/2 → rem1 (position7)

7/2 → rem1 (position8)

3/2 → rem1 (position9)

1/2 → rem1 (position10)

So the bits are:

Position: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bits:      1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Wait, let me write that down:

So bits from position 10 to 0 are:

1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

Wait, so the binary is 11111101000.

Wait, because starting from position 10, we have 1, then 1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0.

Wait, that would be:

1*(2^10) + 1*(2^9) + 1*(2^8) + 1*(2^7) + 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 0*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) + 0*(2^0).

Calculating this:

2^10=1024

2^9=512 → 1024+512=1536

2^8=256 → 1536+256=1792

2^7=128 →1792+128=1920

2^6=64 →1920+64=1984

2^5=32 →1984+32=2016

2^4=16 →0

2^3=8 →2016 +8=2024

Wait, so it's 11111101000 in binary.

Wait, but that's 11 bits, but let me confirm:

11111101000 equals 2024.

Let me add up:

1024 + 512 = 1536

+256 = 1792

+128 = 1920

+64 = 1984

+32 = 2016

+8 = 2024

Yes, that's correct.

So the binary representation is 11111101000, which is 11 bits.

Now, each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to a term in the sum Sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1}.

Wait, because each 2^{m-1} corresponds to a bit in the sum.

But for each m in A, 2^{m−1} is a term. So the sum is Sum_{m in A} 2^{m−1} = 2024.

Since 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 11 bits, that suggests that A contains m's where 2^{m−1} corresponds to the positions where the bits are 1 in 2024.

Wait, but 2024 is equal to the sum of certain 2^{m-1} terms. So each 1 in the binary representation corresponds to an m where 2^{m-1} is part of the sum.

Wait, but let's see: 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Because, as we saw, the binary digits are 1 at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So each of these corresponds to m where 2^{m−1} = 2^k, where k is the bit position.

Wait, so 2^{m−1} = 2^k implies m−1 =k, so m =k+1.

So for each bit position k where the bit is 1, m =k+1.

So in this case, the bits are set at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So m would be 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, because m =k+1.

So m's are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, let me check:

At k=3, m=4: 2^{4-1}=8, which is 2^3.

k=5: m=6: 2^{5}=32.

Wait, but in 2024, the bits are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So m would be 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, so A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, let me check the sum of 2^{m-1} for these m's:

2^{4-1}=8

2^{6-1}=32

2^{7-1}=64

2^{8-1}=128

2^{9-1}=256

2^{10-1}=512

2^{11-1}=1024

Adding these up: 8+32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024. Perfect.

So the set A consists of m's where m-1 is the positions where the binary digits of 2024 are 1. So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Now, the question is the sum of the elements of A.

So sum =4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that.

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

Wait, that's 55.

Wait, is that correct? Let me add them again:

4+6=10,

10+7=17,

17+8=25,

25+9=34,

34+10=44,

44+11=55.

Yes, that's 55.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any elements.

A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. So 7 elements.

Sum: 4+6=10, +7=17, +8=25, +9=34, +10=44, +11=55. Correct.

So the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Wait, but let me think again: is there another way to represent 2024 as a sum of 2^{m-1} terms? Because perhaps there are multiple sets A that could sum to 2024.

Wait, for example, maybe some higher m's could be used instead of several lower ones, but since 2^{m−1} are powers of two, each term is unique and additive without overlap. So the binary representation is unique, so there's only one set A that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, because each 2^{m−1} is a unique power of two, the sum is uniquely determined by the binary representation. So the only way to get 2024 is by having m's where m-1 are the positions where the binary digits are 1. So A must be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum 55.

Therefore, the answer is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each \( m \) in \( A \), the number of finite nonempty sets \( B \) with maximum element \( m \) is \( 2^{m-1} \). Thus, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{m-1} \) for all \( m \) in \( A \). This sum equals 2024. 

To find \( A \), we express 2024 in binary: \( 2024_{10} = 11111101000_2 \). The positions of the 1s in this binary number correspond to \( m-1 \) for each \( m \) in \( A \). Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are \( m = k + 1 \) where \( k \) is the position of a 1 in the binary representation. 

The binary representation \( 11111101000_2 \) has 1s at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3 (counting from 0). Thus, the elements of \( A \) are \( 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, \) and \( 4 \). Summing these elements:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \( \boxed{55} \).
