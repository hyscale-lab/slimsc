Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. 

The question is about finding the difference between two radii: r_i when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent along a circle, and r_o when the torus is outside and tangent along another circle. Then, I need to find r_i - r_o expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the generating circle has radius 3, so r = 3. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution, which is 6 units. So R = 6.

So the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases, then relate that to the tangent circles.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is resting inside, touching the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is surrounding the sphere and touching it along another circle.

I need to find the positions where the torus touches the sphere in each case.

Let me recall that for a torus, any point on its surface can be described in terms of two angles, but maybe it's easier to think geometrically.

First, let me consider the torus as a surface of revolution. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus's center (the center of its generating circle) is at another point. The distance between these two centers will affect where the torus and sphere are tangent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the sphere and torus in a coordinate system. Let me place the sphere at the origin, and the torus such that its axis of revolution is along the x-axis. So the center of the generating circle of the torus is at (R, 0, 0), which is (6, 0, 0) since R = 6. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the major radius is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, so if the generating circle
