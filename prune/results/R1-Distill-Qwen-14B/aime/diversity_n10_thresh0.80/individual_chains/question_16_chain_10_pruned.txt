Alright, so I have this math problem that I'm trying to solve. It says:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \)."

Wow, okay, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there's some positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, once I find that prime \( p \), I have to find the smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

So, the problem has two main parts:

1. Find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \).
2. For that prime \( p \), find the minimal \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me tackle the first part first.

I know that primes for which \( -1 \) is a quadratic residue are primes that are congruent to 1 mod 4. Because if \( p \) is 1 mod 4, then there exists some integer \( a \) such that \( a^2 \equiv -1 \mod p \). Similarly, primes that are 3 mod 4 don't have such a square root.

But in this problem, we're dealing with fourth powers, so it's about whether \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \). So perhaps it's related to higher powers of primes.

Let me recall some number theory. If \( p \) is a prime where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p \) has a solution, then we can check if it can be extended to a solution modulo \( p^2 \).

First, let me list some small primes and see.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check each prime \( p \) starting from the smallest to see if there exists an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

Starting with \( p=2 \):

Check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 4 for n=1,2,3,...

n=1: 1^4=1, 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4.
n=2: 2^4=16, 16+1=17, 17 mod 4 is 1. Not divisible.
n=3: 81, 81+1=82, 82 mod 4 is 2. Not divisible.
Wait, actually, since n^4 mod 4:

Any even n: n=2k, n^4=16k^4=0 mod 4.
Any odd n: n=2k+1, n^4=(2k+1)^4. Let's compute (1)^4=1 mod 4, (3)^4=81=1 mod 4. So any odd n^4 is 1 mod 4, so n^4+1 is 2 mod 4, which is not divisible by 4. So for p=2, there's no n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3.

Check if n^4 +1 is divisible by 9.

Compute n^4 mod 9 for n from 1 to 8, since mod 9 repeats every 9.

n=1: 1+1=2 mod 9. Not divisible.
n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8 mod9. Not divisible.
n=3: 81 mod9=0, 0+1=1 mod9. Not divisible.
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 4^4=256. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, remainder 4. So 4+1=5 mod9. Not divisible.
n=5: 5^4=625. 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13, 1+3=4. So 625 mod9 is 4, so 4+1=5 mod9. Not divisible.
n=6: 6^4=1296, mod9 is 0, 0+1=1 mod9. Not divisible.
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2+4+0+1=7, so 2401 mod9=7. 7+1=8 mod9. Not divisible.
n=8: 8^4=4096. 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1. 4096 mod9=1. So 1+1=2 mod9. Not divisible.

So for p=3, no n satisfies n^4 +1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 is also out.

Next, p=5.

Check if n^4 +1 is divisible by 25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24.

This might take a while, but perhaps there's a pattern or a smarter way.

Alternatively, think about solving n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

First, check if -1 is a quartic residue mod5. Since 5 is 1 mod4, it's possible.

But mod25 is more complicated.

Let me list n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But maybe I can find a smarter way.

First, let's note that if n^4 ≡ -1 mod5, then n^4 ≡4 mod5.

Because -1 mod5 is 4.

So, what are the solutions to x^4 ≡4 mod5.

Let me compute x^4 mod5 for x=0,1,2,3,4.

x=0: 0
x=1:1
x=2:16≡1
x=3:81≡1
x=4:256≡1

Wait, so 1^4=1, 2^4=16≡1, 3^4=81≡1, 4^4=256≡1. So all x^4 mod5 are either 0 or 1.

So, 4 mod5 is not achieved by any x^4. So, there is no solution to x^4≡-1 mod5. Therefore, in mod5, n^4 +1 cannot be zero. So, in mod25, since mod5 has no solution, mod25 also cannot have a solution.

Wait, but is that necessarily true? Because Hensel's lemma says that if f(x)≡0 mod p has a simple root, then it can be lifted to mod p^k. But in this case, since f(x)=x^4 +1. Let's compute f'(x)=4x^3.

If there's a solution x0 mod5 such that f(x0)≡0 mod5, then if f'(x0) not≡0
