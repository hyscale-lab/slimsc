Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the problem says that the list of positive integers has a few properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. But before that, I need to figure out what the list of numbers looks like.

Let's break down each property.

Starting with the mode: the unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same frequency as 9. So, 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number. Let's say 9 appears 'k' times. Since it's the unique mode, all other numbers appear fewer than 'k' times.

Next, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. But since the median is an integer and doesn't appear in the list, that suggests that the list has an odd number of elements. Because if it's even, the median could be a non-integer, but here the median is a positive integer, so maybe it's the case where the two middle numbers are the same, but that can't be because the median would equal those numbers, which would appear in the list, contradicting the third condition. So, perhaps the list has an odd number of elements, so the median is the middle number, which is an integer, but it doesn't appear in the list. That makes sense.

Wait, but if the median is the middle number, how can it not appear? That can't be. Oh, maybe the list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two middle numbers, which is an integer, but that average isn't present in the list. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the median. So in that case, the list doesn't have 9 in the middle, but since 9 is the mode, it must appear elsewhere. Hmm, but wait, the mode is 9, so 9 has to appear multiple times. So maybe the list has an even number of elements, with two middle numbers whose average is an integer not present in the list, but 9 is somewhere else.

Wait, but in the case of an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So for example, if the list has 8 elements, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. If those two elements are, say, 8 and 10, then the median is 9, which doesn't appear in the list. That would fit the condition. So in that case, the list has an even number of elements, and the median is an integer not present. But then, the list would have to have the 4th and 5th elements as 8 and 10, making the median 9.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 5, the median is the 3rd element. But if the 3rd element is not present in the list, that's impossible because the list must contain the elements in order. So, the median can't be a number that isn't in the list if the list has an odd number of elements. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements, with the median being the average of two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list.

So, the list has an even number of elements, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers,
