Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me understand the equations. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. So the sum of the three variables is fixed. The second equation is a bit more complex: it's a combination of terms where each term is the square of one variable multiplied by another. Let me write that second equation again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that this can be factored or rearranged somehow. Maybe I can factor out common terms. Let's see:

Looking at the first two terms, a²b + a²c, I can factor out a²: a²(b + c). Similarly, the next two terms, b²a + b²c, can be factored as b²(a + c), and the last two terms, c²a + c²b, as c²(a + b). So, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), because if a + b + c is 300, then b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the second equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about symmetric equations. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps assuming some symmetry in the values of a, b, c might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)^2. I know that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

We know a + b + c = 300, so:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Which gives:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Hmm, that might come in handy. Let me see if I can relate this to the second equation.

Wait, the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I can factor this as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

Wait, but a + b = 300 - c, etc. So substituting:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can expand this:

300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc = 6,000,000.

So that's 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me write that as:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So now I have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

And from earlier, I had:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Hmm, so if I let S = ab + bc + ca, then:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S.

And the other equation becomes:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

I wonder if I can express abc in terms of S and then plug that somewhere else.

Wait, but I have three variables and two equations so far. Maybe I can find another relation.

I also know that for three variables, the expression (a + b + c)^3 can be expanded as:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, there's the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).

Hmm, I have a² + b² + c² in terms of S, so maybe:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).

Substituting the known values:

a + b + c = 300.

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + 300*( (90,000 - 2S) - S ) = 3abc + 300*(90,000 - 3S).

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + 27,000,000 - 900S.

Earlier, I had another equation from the second condition:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substitute a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S and a³ + b³ + c³ from above:

300*(90,000 - 2S) - (3abc + 27,000,000 - 900S) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

300*(90,000 - 2S) = 27,000,000 - 600S.

Then subtract (3abc + 27,000,000 - 900S):

27,000,000 - 600S - 3abc - 27,000,000 + 900S = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) + (-600S + 900S) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So,

300S - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

Wait a minute, earlier I had this equation: 100S - abc = 2,000,000, which is consistent. So that doesn't give me any new information. Hmm, maybe I need another equation or approach.

Alternatively, let me think about the variables a, b, c. Since they're nonnegative integers summing to 300, maybe they can be arranged in non-decreasing order. That is, a ≤ b ≤ c. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Wait, perhaps we can consider substituting variables. Let me think: since a + b + c = 300, maybe let me define x = a, y = b, z = c. Not sure if substitution helps.

Alternatively, since the equation is symmetric, perhaps assuming two variables are equal. Let me try that.

Suppose a = b, then the equation may simplify. Let's try that. Let a = b. Then, from a + b + c = 300, 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.

Now, substitute into the second equation.

The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Which simplifies to:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

Substituting c = 300 - 2a:

2a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ].

Let me compute inside the brackets:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (300 - 2a)^2.

Simplify:

( a² - 2a² ) + 300a + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a² ).

So:

(-a²) + 300a + 90,000 - 1200a + 4a².

Combine like terms:

(-a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1200a) + 90,000.

Which is:

3a² - 900a + 90,000.

So the entire expression is 2a*(3a² -900a +90,000).

So the equation becomes:

2a*(3a² -900a +90,000) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a*(3a² -900a +90,000) = 3,000,000.

So:

3a³ -900a² +90,000a -3,000,000 = 0.

Divide all terms by 3:

a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, so I have a cubic equation in a: a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 = 0.

I need to find integer solutions for a. Let me try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). So possible roots could be 1, 2, 4, 5, etc. Let's try a = 100.

Plugging a = 100: 100³ -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000.

Which is 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0. Oh, a = 100 is a root.

So, we can factor this as (a - 100)(something) = 0.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's perform synthetic division with a = 100.

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 100 = 100. Add to -300: -200.

Multiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.

Multiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0. Perfect.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

Now, set each factor to zero:

a = 100.

Or, a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100.

So, the equation has a double root at a =100. So the only solution is a =100.

So, if a = b =100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 =100.

So, in this case, a = b = c = 100. So that's one triple.

But earlier, I assumed that a = b. What if a ≠ b? Then, maybe we can have other solutions.

Wait, but maybe all solutions have a = b = c. Let me check.

Suppose that a, b, c are all equal: a = b = c. Then, 3a =300 => a=100. So, (100,100,100) is a solution, which we already found.

But are there other solutions where a, b, c are not all
