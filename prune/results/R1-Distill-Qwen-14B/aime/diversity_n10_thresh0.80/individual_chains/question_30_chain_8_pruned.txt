Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. A primitive 13th root of unity, ω, satisfies ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me factor that a bit. Maybe I can write it in terms of ω^k. Let’s set z = ω^k. Then each term becomes (2 - 2z + z²). So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2z + z²) where z = ω^k.

Wait, but since ω is a primitive 13th root, the powers ω^k for k=0 to 12 give all the distinct 13th roots of unity. So, we're taking the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2z + z²). 

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all roots of a polynomial can sometimes be expressed as a resultant or using the properties of polynomials. Let me think: if I have a polynomial f(z), then the product of f(z) over all roots z of another polynomial g(z) is equal to the resultant of f and g, or something like that. Alternatively, if f(z) can be expressed in terms of g(z), perhaps I can find the product.

Alternatively, I might consider that the product over all z (where z^13 = 1) of (2 - 2z + z²) is equal to the product of f(z) where f(z) = z² - 2z + 2, evaluated at all 13th roots of unity. Since the product over roots of f(z) evaluated at all roots of z^13 =1 would relate to the resultant, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

Wait, another idea: the product over all 13th roots of unity of (a - b z + c z²) can be found by evaluating the resultant or perhaps by considering the minimal polynomial. Alternatively, maybe we can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at a certain point.

Specifically, suppose I consider the polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2. Then, the product we're looking for is the product of P(z) as z ranges over all 13th roots of unity. So, product_{z^13=1} P(z). 

I remember that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of unity can be found using the formula involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the polynomial and z^n - 1. Or, more precisely, perhaps using the fact that the product over all n-th roots of unity of P(z) is equal to the resultant of P(z) and z^n - 1, but I'm not exactly sure about the details.

Alternatively, I recall that for a polynomial Q(z), the product of Q(z) over all n-th roots of unity is equal to the resultant of Q(z) and z^n - 1. The resultant can be computed as the product of Q(z) for each root z of z^n - 1. So, in this case, since we're considering Q(z) = P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, and n=13, the product we're looking for is the resultant of Q(z) and z^13 - 1.

But how do I compute that? I think the resultant of two polynomials Q and z^13 -1 can be expressed as the product of Q(z_i) for each root z_i of z^13 -1, which is exactly what we have. So, the product is indeed the resultant of Q(z) and z^13 -1.

But calculating resultants is a bit involved. Maybe there's a smarter way. Another approach: if I can factor z^13 -1, then perhaps I can write it as a product of cyclotomic polynomials. But z^13 -1 = Φ₁(z) Φ₁₃(z),
