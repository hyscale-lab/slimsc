Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says that ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, the sides are all equal, so AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA. That's important.

Then, it mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. The goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to visualize this. I imagine a convex hexagon, which means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles could be different. However, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which gives it some symmetry.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these three extended sides will meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, these extended lines intersect to form a triangle with those specific side lengths.

I remember that in such hexagons, especially those with opposite sides parallel, there might be similar triangles involved. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to parts of the hexagon? Or perhaps the hexagon is related to the triangle through some scaling factor.

Let me try to diagram this mentally. Let's denote the hexagon ABCDEF. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA. Also, since it's convex and equilateral, each internal angle will be determined by the structure.

When we extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at some points, forming a larger triangle. Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD's extensions, Q is the intersection of CD and EF's extensions, and R is the intersection of EF and AB's extensions. So, triangle PQR has sides PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300.

Wait, but the problem says the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. So, that triangle is the external triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. Let me make sure I'm getting this right.

Another thought: perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down? Or maybe the hexagon's sides are proportional to the triangle's sides.

I recall that in problems involving equilateral polygons with opposite sides parallel, especially hexagons, the concept of similar triangles and ratios comes into play.

Let me consider the triangle formed by the extensions. Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, and when extended they form a larger triangle, maybe the hexagon is in some way inscribed within this triangle, with each side of the hexagon corresponding to a segment on the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is a truncated version of the triangle. Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe
