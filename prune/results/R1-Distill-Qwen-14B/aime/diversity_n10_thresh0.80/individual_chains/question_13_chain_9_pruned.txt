Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking me to find the number of minutes her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find 's' and 't' first, right? Because once I know those, I can calculate the time it takes for her to walk at 's + 1/2' km/h.

Let me break this down. She walks 9 kilometers each time. The time taken includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, when her walking speed changes, the time she spends walking changes, but the coffee shop time 't' remains the same.

So, first, let's convert all the times into hours because her speed is in kilometers per hour. That might make the equations easier.

In the first scenario, she walks at 's' km/h and takes 4 hours in total, which includes 't' minutes. Let's convert 't' minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 't' minutes is equal to t/60 hours.

So, the total time is 4 hours, which is the sum of the walking time and the coffee time. The walking time when her speed is 's' is the distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. Then, adding the coffee time t/60, we get:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at 's + 2' km/h. The total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So, the equation is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I can solve these two equations to find the values of 's' and 't'.

Let me write them down again:

1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2) (9/(s+2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Since both equations have the same 't/60' term, maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate 't'. Let's try that.

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Okay, so 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

Let me factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write this as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

So:

18 = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

Hmm, let's convert 1.6 and 3.2 into fractions to make it easier. 1.6 is 8/5, and 3.2 is 16/5.

So, 18 = (8/5)s² + (16/5)s

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:

90 = 8s² + 16s

Bring all terms to one side:

8s² + 16s - 90 = 0

Simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2:

4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, we have a quadratic equation: 4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

So plugging in the values:

s = [ -8 ± sqrt(8² - 4 * 4 * (-45)) ] / (2 * 4)
s = [ -8 ± sqrt(64 + 720) ] / 8
s = [ -8 ± sqrt(784) ] / 8
sqrt(784) is 28, because 28*28=784.

So:

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / 8

This gives two possible solutions:

1) s = (-8 + 28)/8 = (20)/8 = 2.5
2) s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h is the only valid solution.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the original equations. Let's pick equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

We know s = 2.5, so:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

Calculate 9 / 2.5:

2.5 goes into 9 three times (2.5 * 3 =7.5) with a remainder of 1.5. 1.5 is 0.6 times 2.5 (since 2.5 * 0.6=1.5). So, 3.6. Alternatively, 9 / 2.5 = (9 * 2) / 5 = 18/5 = 3.6.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 *60 =24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Okay, so now we know that Aya spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time. But wait, the problem says "including t minutes spent in the coffee shop" in both scenarios, so that makes sense.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how long does her walk take, including the coffee shop time?

s is 2.5 km/h, so s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her new walking speed is 3 km/h.

Now, the time she takes to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is 9 / 3 =3 hours.

Then, adding the coffee shop time, which is 24 minutes, so total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the problem asks for the number of minutes, including t minutes.

So, converting 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes. Plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

So, the total time is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, solving for 's' and 't' seems correct. The quadratic equation gave s=2.5, t=24. Then, at s + 0.5=3 km/h, time is 9/3=3 hours. 3 hours is 180 minutes plus 24 is 204. That seems right.

Alternatively, let me verify by plugging s=2.5 and t=24
