Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen numbers.

The problem is asking for the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two correct numbers, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B).

So, first, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

Let me think about how the lottery works. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is 210.

P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 favorable outcome out of 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, B includes all cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event (i.e., less than two numbers are chosen) and subtract it from 1.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(exactly 0 correct) + P(exactly 1 correct)].

Let me compute P(exactly k correct numbers) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

The number of ways to choose exactly k correct numbers from Jen's 4 is C(4,k), and then the remaining 4 - k numbers are chosen from the 6 numbers she didn't pick. Since the total set S has 10 numbers, and she picked 4, the other 6 numbers are the ones not chosen.

So, for exactly k correct numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers is C(10,4). The number of ways to choose exactly k numbers from Jen's 4 and the rest from the other 6 is C(4,k) * C(6,4 -k). Yes, that makes sense.

So, for exactly 0 correct numbers: C(4,0) * C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

Exactly 1 correct number: C(4,1) * C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

Exactly 2 correct: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3 correct: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4 correct: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Let me check if these add up to 210.

15 + 80 = 95; 95 +90 =185; 185 +24=209; 209 +1=210. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 1 - [P(0) + P(1)] = 1 - [(15 + 80)/210] = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. P(B) is the probability of at least two correct, so that's P(2) + P(3) + P(4). Which is 90 +24 +1 = 115. So, 115/210. Correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115
