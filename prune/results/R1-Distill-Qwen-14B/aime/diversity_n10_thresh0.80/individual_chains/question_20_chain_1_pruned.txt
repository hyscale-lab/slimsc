Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have a 5x5 grid, so that's 25 unit cells. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable, meaning you can't tell one white chip from another, same with black. The goal is to place some of these chips in the grid following certain conditions.

Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no two chips in the same cell. Got that. Next, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Hmm, so each row is either all white, all black, or empty? Wait, no, because you can have some rows empty, but each row that has chips must have all chips the same color. Same for columns.

Also, any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So the arrangement must be maximal in some senseâ€”it can't have any more chips added without breaking the row or column color rules.

Let me think about what this implies. If I have a grid where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is either all white, all black, or empty, but also that any additional chip would mess this up.

Wait, but if I have a row that's partially filled, like some white and some black chips, that would violate the condition since all chips in the same row must be the same color. So each row must be entirely white, entirely black, or empty.

Similarly for each column. But wait, if a column is partially filled, that would also violate the column condition. So, each column must be entirely white, entirely black, or empty.

So, in other words, each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and each column is either all white, all black, or empty.

But then, how do these interact? Because the arrangement must satisfy both row and column constraints.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must also be all white or empty, right? Because if a column has a white chip in this row, then the entire column must be white or empty.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Suppose a row is all white. Then each column that has a white chip in that row must be all white. So, if I have a row that's all white, then in each column that intersects this row, if there's a white chip in that row, the entire column must be white. But for the columns that don't have a white chip in that row, they can be black or empty.

But wait, if I have a row that's all white, then for each column, either the column is all white or it's something else. But if a column intersects the all-white row and is not all white, then that would mean that column has a non-white (black) chip in that row, which would violate the column's condition because the column must have all chips the same color.

So, actually, if a row is all white, then every column that intersects this row must also be all white. So, in that case, all columns that intersect the all-white row must also be all white. Similarly, if a row is all black, all the columns intersecting that row must be all black. If
