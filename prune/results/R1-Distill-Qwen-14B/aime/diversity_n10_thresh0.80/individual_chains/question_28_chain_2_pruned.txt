Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, the tetrahedron has edges AB and CD both equal to √41, AC and BD equal to √80, and BC and AD equal to √89. Hmm, that seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of "balanced" tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such a tetrahedron might be called isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key is that it's symmetric, which might help in calculations.

The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be calculated using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find V and S.

Let me first write down the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41
AC = BD = √80
BC = AD = √89

So, all opposite edges are equal. That's an interesting property. I think this kind of tetrahedron is called a "disphenoid." I remember that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Because if opposite edges are equal, the faces could be congruent.

Wait, let me check. In a disphenoid, it's a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, yes, all four faces are congruent triangles. No, wait, is that accurate? Because congruent triangles would require all edges to be equal, but in this case, each pair of opposite edges is equal, but different pairs have different lengths. So, each face is a triangle with edges of two different lengths.

Wait, maybe not congruent, but each face is congruent to another face. For example, faces ABC and ADC: AB = CD, AC is common, BC = AD. So, by SSS, those triangles are congruent. Similarly, faces ABD and BCD: AB = CD, BD is common, AD = BC. So, all four faces are congruent. Hmm, that's a big help.

So, if all four faces are congruent triangles, it's called an isohedral tetrahedron, I think. Anyway, the point is, each face is congruent, so their areas are equal. That will make the surface area easier to compute because I can find the area of one face and multiply by four.

First, let me find the area of one face. Let's pick face ABC. The sides of this triangle are AB = √41, BC = √89, and AC = √80. So, sides a=√41, b=√89, c=√80.

Wait, no, sorry, in triangle ABC, AB is √41, BC is √89, and AC is √80. So, we can use Heron's formula to find the area.

Heron's formula: area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

So, let's compute s for triangle ABC.

s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

Hmm, that looks messy. Maybe there is a better way since the edges have these specific lengths. Wait, maybe the triangle is right-angled?

Let me check: is 41 + 80 equal to 89? 41 + 80 is 121, and 89 squared is 7921, which is way bigger. So, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's another Pythagorean triple? Let's square the sides:

AB² = 41, BC² = 89, AC² = 80.

Check if 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², not 89. So, that's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinates? Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices in a way that makes calculations easier.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.

Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D space such that the points have coordinates that make the opposite edges equal. Maybe by symmetry, I can set the coordinates such that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide.

Wait, for a disphenoid, there's a nice
