Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. Sometimes probability problems can get tricky, especially when dealing with conditional probabilities, so I need to be careful.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen four. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize (at least two numbers match). So, P(A|B) is the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize.

Since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (because if all four match, she definitely has at least two), the intersection A ∩ B is just event A. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize (at least two numbers matching).

Let me compute each probability step by step.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), where C(n,k) denotes the combination of n things taken k at a time. So, let me calculate that:

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. That is, all four of her numbers are chosen. Since she picks exactly 4 numbers, there's only one way this can happen: all 4 are selected. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is having at least two numbers match. This can be calculated as 1 minus the probability that she has fewer than two numbers matching, i.e., 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).

So, I should calculate P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

Let me compute P(0 matches) first. This is the probability that none of her 4 numbers are chosen. So, all 4 numbers chosen are from the remaining 6 numbers (since there are 10 numbers in total, and she picked 4, leaving 6). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick is C(6,4). Therefore, P(0 matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Calculating C(6,4): 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/2 = 15.

So, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Now, P(1 match). This is the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. So, we need to choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the 6 she didn't pick. The number of ways to do this is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

Calculating C(4,1) = 4.

C(6,3) = 20.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

So now, the probability of not winning a prize is P(0 matches) + P(1 match) = 1/14 + 8/21. Let me compute that:

Convert to a common denominator, which is 42.

1/14 = 3/42.

8/21 = 16/42.

So, 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42.

Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 1 - 19/42 = (42 - 19)/42 = 23/42.

Wait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 1 - (15 + 80)/210. 15+80=95. 95/210 simplifies to 19/42. So 1 - 19/42 is indeed 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait a moment, but 23/42 seems a bit low for the probability of getting at least two matches... Let me think again. Wait, she's picking 4 numbers, and the lottery is also picking 4 numbers. The chance that at least two match... Hmm, maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, I can compute P(B) directly by adding the probabilities of having exactly two, three, or four matches.

Let me try that approach to verify.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k), where k is 2,3,4.

So, P(B) = [C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)] / C(10,4).

Calculating each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210. Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Okay, same result as before. So, that's correct.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, I had P(A) = 1/210. But wait, wait a minute. If event A is winning the grand prize, which is exactly 4 matches, then the number of favorable outcomes is 1, as I thought. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Wait, but in the second approach, when I computed P(B), I included 1 case where all four match. So, in the second approach, P(B) is the sum of P(2 matches) + P(3 matches) + P(4 matches). So, P(A) is part of P(B).

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42).

Let me compute that.

First, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5.

Therefore, (42)/(210*23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1, n=115. They are coprime since 115 is 5*23 and 1 shares no common factors besides 1.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check everything.

Wait, so P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42. So, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is indeed (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) )= 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of counts.

Total number of possible 4-number combinations: 210.

Number of combinations where at least two numbers match: 115 (as computed earlier).

Number of combinations where all four match: 1.

So, the probability is 1 / 115.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115, which gives m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.


Jen enters a lottery by selecting 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability of winning the grand prize (\( P(A) \)) is the probability that all four numbers match:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Next, calculate the probability of winning a prize (\( P(B) \)), which is the probability of having at least two numbers match. This can be found by subtracting the probabilities of having 0 or 1 matches from 1.

Calculate the number of ways to have 0 matches:
\[
\binom{6}{4} = 15
\]
\[
P(0 \text{ matches}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14}
\]

Calculate the number of ways to have 1 match:
\[
\binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
\]
\[
P(1 \text{ match}) = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21}
\]

Thus, the probability of not winning a prize is:
\[
P(0 \text{ matches}) + P(1 \text{ match}) = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} = \frac{3}{42} + \frac{16}{42} = \frac{19}{42}
\]
\[
P(B) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

Finally, the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), giving \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
