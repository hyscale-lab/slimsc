Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) 

and 

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, both of these are absolute value functions, so they're V-shaped graphs. Let me sketch them mentally.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner absolute value |x| creates a V with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, it reflects any negative parts back up. So, the graph of f(x) will have two vertices: one at (0, 0) and another at (1/2, 0), but wait, actually, let me think again.

Wait, when you have | |x| - a |, the graph will have a V shape with possible vertices depending on the value of a. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner |x| is a V with vertex at 0. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it, but since it's inside another absolute value, which can create a W shape or something else.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider different cases.

Case 1: x >= 0. Then |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

Similarly, when x is negative, |x| = -x, so f(x) = |-x - 1/2| = |x + 1/2|.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function:

f(x) = |x - 1/2| for x >= 0,

f(x) = |x + 1/2| for x < 0.

So, graphing this, for x >=0, it's a V with vertex at (1/2, 0), and for x <0, it's a V with vertex at (-1/2, 0). So together, it's a W shape with vertices at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2. Wait, but at x=0, |0 - 1/2| is 1/2, so the point is (0, 1/2). So, the graph of f(x) has three "valleys": at (-1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), and (1/2, 0). So, it's a W shape with the middle peak at (0, 1/2).

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Applying the same reasoning:

For x >=0, g(x) = |x - 1/4|.

For x <0, g(x) = |-x -1/4| = |x + 1/4|.

So, it's another piecewise function. For x >=0, it's a V with vertex at (1/4, 0). For x <0, it's a V with vertex at (-1/4, 0). So, the graph of g(x) is a V shape with peaks at x=1/4 and x=-1/4, but wait, at x=0, g(x) = |0 -1/4| = 1/4. So, the graph is a W shape with vertices at (-1/4,0), (0, 1/4), and (1/4,0).

So, f(x) and g(x) are both W-shaped functions with different scaling and positions.

Now, the functions we need to consider are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, these are transformations of the functions f and g, applied to sine and cosine functions, then scaled by 4.

Let me break down the function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

First, let's consider the inner function: sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π, but with 2πx inside, the period is 1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave that completes one full cycle every unit interval. So, it's a high-frequency sine wave that goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0 as x increases from 0 to 1.

Then, f is applied to this sine wave: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, take sin(2πx), which has a range from -1 to 1.

Take the absolute value: |sin(2πx)|, which ranges from 0 to 1.

Subtract 1/2: |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. This ranges from -1/2 to 1/2.

Then take the absolute value again: ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. So, the result is a function that is non-negative. Let's find the range.

When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| = |sin(2πx)| -1/2, which is between 0 and 1/2.

When |sin(2πx)| <1/2, it becomes 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, which is between 0 and 1/2.

So, regardless, f(sin(2πx)) ranges between 0 and 1/2.

Then, g is applied to this: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

Since f(sin(2πx)) is non-negative, |f(...) - 1/4|.

Since f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2, subtracting 1/4 gives a range from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, the result is between 0 and 1/4.

So, g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Then, multiplying by 4: 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that maps x to a value between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the other equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let's analyze this function.

First, cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of 2π, so 3πy gives a period of 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. So, the cosine function completes a cycle every 2/3 units in y.

But since we're taking cos(3πy), the period is 2/3. So, as y increases by 1, the argument 3πy increases by 3π, which is 1.5 periods. Wait, because a full period is 2π, so 3π corresponds to 1.5 periods.

Wait, no: For cos(ky), the period is 2π / k. So, cos(3πy) has period 2π/(3π) )= 2/3. So, yes, one full period over every 2/3 units in y direction.

So, cos(3πy) is a cosine wave with period 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1.

Then, f is applied to this: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Same as before, |cos(3πy)| ranges from 0 to 1.

Subtract 1/2: |cos(3πy)| - 1/2. This ranges from -1/2 to 1/2.

Take absolute value again: ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2| ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g is applied: g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|.

f(cos(3πy)) ranges from 0 to 1/2, so f(...) -1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking absolute value, g(...) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Multiply by 4: 4 * g(...) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, the function x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) maps y to x in [0,1].

Now, to find the number of intersections between the two graphs y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me denote:

Left side: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Right side: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

An intersection point (a, b) must satisfy both equations:

b = 4 g(f(sin(2πa)))

a = 4 g(f(cos(3πb)))

So, we have a system:

1. a = 4 g(f(cos(3πb)))

2. b = 4 g(f(sin(2πa)))

So, we can think of this as a system where a and b are functions of each other.

But it's a bit tricky because both a and b are defined in terms of each other. So, maybe it's better to analyze the possible ranges and periodicity.

But perhaps another approach is to consider that for each x, y is determined, and for each y, x is determined. So, the intersections are points where x is determined by y via the second equation, and y is determined by x via the first equation.

Alternatively, maybe parameterizing one variable.

Wait, maybe I can plot or find the number of possible solutions by considering the periodicity and the overlapping ranges.

Let me first analyze the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))).

First, let's understand the period of each function.

For y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))):

The inner function is sin(2πx), which has a period of 1. So, y is periodic with period 1 in x.

Similarly, for x =4g(f(cos(3πy))), the inner function is cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3 in y. So, x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

But since both functions have different periods, the system as a whole has a period that is the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 2/3, which is 2. So, the system is periodic with period 2.

Therefore, I can analyze the behavior in the interval x ∈ [0,1] and y ∈ [0, 2/3], and then multiply by the number of periods to find the total number of intersections.

Wait, perhaps not exactly, because the functions have different dependencies. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of intersections in the square [0,1] x [0,1] can be found, and then extended.

Wait, but the functions are periodic, so perhaps the intersections repeat every certain intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to analyze the functions over a fundamental interval and count the number of solutions there.

But given that the functions are periodic, perhaps the number of intersections within one period is the same as in all periods, so we can just calculate within a certain interval and then multiply by the number of periods.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think differently.

Let me first understand the behavior of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))).

We know that sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. So, for each integer x, the function repeats.

Similarly, cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

So, perhaps the system is periodic with period 1 in x and 2/3 in y.

But I'm not sure how that affects the number of intersections.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to analyze the injectivity or the number of times each function can take a value.

Wait, let's think about the mapping from x to y and from y to x.

Given that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), for each x, y is determined, but perhaps multiple x can map to the same y.

Similarly, for x =4g(f(cos(3πy))), each y gives an x, but perhaps multiple y's can give the same x.

So, the system is a set of equations where each x corresponds to a y, and each y corresponds to an x. So, the number of solutions is the number of fixed points of this mapping.

Hmm, but it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each x, y is a function of x, and x is a function of y. So, substituting, we get x =4g(f(cos(3π * (4g(f(sin(2πx))))))).

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and substitute y from the first equation.

So, x = 4g(f(cos(3π*(4g(f(sin(2πx)))))))

This is a very nested function, but perhaps I can find the possible values.

But maybe it's too abstract. Let me think of the ranges.

We know that both y and x are in [0,1], as 4g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, the possible (x, y) pairs lie within the unit square [0,1]x[0,1].

But each function can have multiple x or y for each value.

Let me think about how y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) behaves.

Since sin(2πx) is periodic, let's consider x in [0,1].

As x increases from 0 to 1, sin(2πx) goes from 0 up to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, down to -1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1.

But since we have |sin(2πx)|, it's always non-negative, so the function |sin(2πx)| goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1/2 and then to 1.

Then, f(|sin(2πx)|) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

So, when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f(...) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(...) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, f(...) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, reaching 0 at points where |sin(2πx)| is 1/2.

Now, g(f(...)) is ||f(...) - 1/4|. Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, f(...) - 1/4 is between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking absolute value, g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1/4.

Then, 4 * g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1.

So, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that varies between 0 and 1 as x goes from 0 to 1.

Similarly, for x =4g(f(cos(3πy))), when y varies, cos(3πy) varies between -1 and 1, so |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, then f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, then g(...) is between 0 and 1/4, so 4* g(...) is between 0 and 1.

So, both functions y and x are in [0,1], and for each x, y is determined, and for each y, x is determined.

But how do these functions behave?

Let me try to find how many times y =4g(f(sin(2πx))) can intersect with x=4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Hmm, maybe I can parameterize one variable and see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the possible intersections for each possible x and y.

Wait, but this is a bit vague.

Another idea: Since both functions are periodic, perhaps the number of intersections in each period is the same, so I can compute the number of solutions in [0,1]x[0,1] and then multiply by the number of periods.

Wait, but the functions have different periods in x and y. The x function is periodic with period 1, and the y function is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

So, if I consider the square [0,1]x[0,1], the functions would repeat every 1 in x and every 1 in y, but since the period in y is 2/3, perhaps in the square [0,1]x[0,1], the functions would repeat multiple times.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the behavior in a single period.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me think of the functions as y = h(x) and x = k(y), where h(x) =4g(f(sin(2πx))) and k(y)=4g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, the intersections occur where y = h(x) and x =k(y).

So, substituting, y = h(x) and x =k(y) =k(h(x)).

So, the solutions are the fixed points of the mapping x =k(h(x)).

Similarly, since h(x) and k(y) are both functions from [0,1] to [0,1], the number of solutions is the number of fixed points of the function F(x) =k(h(x)).

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of fixed points of F(x), where F(x) =k(h(x)).

Each fixed point x satisfies F(x) =x.

So, the number of solutions is the number of times F(x) =x.

Similarly, in the y direction, each x corresponds to a y via y =h(x), and each y corresponds to an x via x =k(y).

So, the system is symmetric in a way.

But since both h and k are complicated functions, it's not straightforward to find F(x) =k(h(x)).

So, perhaps I can instead think about how many times y =h(x) and x =k(y) can intersect.

Given that both functions are continuous and periodic, perhaps we can find the number of intersections by considering their oscillatory behavior.

Let me first analyze h(x) =4g(f(sin(2πx))).

As x increases from 0 to 1, sin(2πx) goes from 0 to 1 to 0 to -1 to 0.

But because we take absolute value, |sin(2πx)| creates a wave that goes from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 0 to 1/2, and then from 0 to 1 and back to 0 as x goes from 1/2 to 1.

Wait, actually, |sin(2πx)| is a full-wave rectified sine wave with period 1.

So, it's a "mountain" that peaks at 1 at x=1/4, goes back to 0 at x=1/2, then goes to 1 again at x=3/4 (but since it's absolute value, it's the same as going to 0 at 1/2, then up to 1 at 3/4, but wait, no, sin(2πx) at x=3/4 is sin(3π/2) = -1, so |sin(2πx)| is 1 at x=3/4.

Wait, let me plot sin(2πx) for x from 0 to 1:

At x=0: sin(0)=0

x=1/8: sin(π/4)=√2/2≈0.707

x=1/4: sin(π/2)=1

x=3/8: sin(3π/4)=√2/2≈0.707

x=1/2: sin(π)=0

x=5/8: sin(5π/4)=-√2/2≈-0.707

x=3/4: sin(3π/2)=-1

x=7/8: sin(7π/4)=-√2/2≈-0.707

x=1: sin(2π)=0

But since we take the absolute value, |sin(2πx)|, the negative parts become positive:

So, |sin(2πx)| is a wave that goes from 0 up to 1 at x=1/4, back to 0 at x=1/2, up to 1 at x=3/4, and back to 0 at x=1.

So, |sin(2πx)| is a "double hump" wave with peaks at x=1/4 and x=3/4.

Then, f(|sin(2πx)|) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

So, when |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, f(...) is |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So, let's consider the shape.

Between x=0 and x=1/4: |sin(2πx)| increases from 0 to 1.

At x=1/8: |sin(2πx)|≈0.707>1/2.

So, f(...) = |sin(2πx)| -1/2.

So, f starts at 0, increases to 0.707-0.5=0.207 at x=1/8, then to 1 -0.5=0.5 at x=1/4.

Then, from x=1/4 to x=3/4: |sin(2πx)| decreases from 1 to 0 to 1.

Wait, actually, |sin(2πx)| at x=1/4 is 1, then at x=1/2 is 0, then at x=3/4 is 1 again.

So, in the interval x=1/4 to x=3/4, |sin(2πx)| goes
