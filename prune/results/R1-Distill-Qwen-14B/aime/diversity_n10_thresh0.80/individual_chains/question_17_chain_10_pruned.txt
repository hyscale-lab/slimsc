Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, among all these boxes, I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any of them. The radius of this sphere will vary depending on the box's dimensions, so I need to find the maximum possible radius needed, which would correspond to the box that requires the largest sphere.

Wait, no, actually, the sphere must contain every box in B. So, the radius r must be such that every box from B can fit inside a sphere of radius r. So, I need to find the minimum such r, which would be determined by the box in B that has the maximum space diagonal. Because the sphere's diameter must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius would be half of that maximum space diagonal.

Right, so the key is to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Alternatively, since sqrt is a monotonically increasing function, I can instead maximize x² + y² + z². So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. Volume: xyz = 23

I need to maximize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I think I can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the Lagrangian.

Let me denote the function to maximize as f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

The constraints are:
g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0
h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, the Lagrangian would be:
L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Now, to find the extrema, I need to take the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Let's compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0
∂L/∂λ = -(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) = 0
∂L/∂μ = -(xyz - 23) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy = 0
4. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
5. xyz = 23

Looking at equations 1, 2, 3, I notice a symmetry. Perhaps the optimal x
