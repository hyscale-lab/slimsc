Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand the problem first.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize.

So, I need to compute P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, if A is a subset of B, then P(A and B) is just P(A), right? Because if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. So, yes, A is a subset of B. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, I need to find the probability of winning the grand prize, which is when all four numbers match. Then, I need to find the probability of winning at least two numbers (i.e., winning a prize). Then, divide the two.

Let me structure this:

1. Compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the denominator for both probabilities.

Total possible combinations: C(10,4).

2. Compute the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize. Since she has to pick exactly the same four numbers, there's only 1 such combination. So, number of favorable outcomes for A is 1.

So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

3. Now, compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching.

This means she could have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching. So, we need to compute the number of ways she can have exactly k matches for k=2,3,4 and sum them up.

But wait, since the grand prize is when k=4, and it's included in B, we can compute P(B) by summing the probabilities for k=2,3,4.

But let's think about how to compute the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches.

Wait, actually, in combinatorics, when considering the number of ways to choose k correct numbers and the remaining (4 - k) incorrect numbers.

Wait, but in this problem, the lottery is choosing 4 numbers, and Jen has also chosen 4 numbers. So, when they say "at least two of her numbers were two of the randomly chosen numbers," that means that out of her 4 numbers, at least two are in the randomly chosen 4.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a hypergeometric distribution problem.

Let me think. The hypergeometric probability gives the probability of k successes (in this case, matching numbers) in n draws (here, 4 numbers drawn by the lottery) without replacement from a finite population containing a specific number of successes (Jen's 4 numbers).

So, the population has 10 numbers. Jen has 4 "success" numbers, and the remaining 6 are "failures." The lottery draws 4 numbers, and we want the probability that at least 2 of them are successes.

So, the hypergeometric probability formula for exactly k successes is:

P(X = k) = C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k) / C(N, n)

Where:
- N = total population size = 10
- K = number of success states in the population = 4 (Jen's numbers)
- n = number of draws = 4
- k = number of observed successes = 2,3,4

So, P(B) is the sum of P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4).

Similarly, P(A) is P(X=4).

So, let me compute each term.

First, let's compute C(10,4), which is the total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers. That's 210.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4!6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

Now, compute P(X=4):

C(4,4)*C(6,0)/C(10,4) = 1 * 1 / 210 = 1/210.

That's P(A) = 1/210.

Next, compute P(X=3):

C(4,3)*C(6,1)/C(10,4) = 4 * 6 / 210 = 24 / 210.

Simplify that: 24 ÷ 6 = 4, 210 ÷6=35. So, 4/35.

Wait, wait, 24/210 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 6: 4/35.

Similarly, P(X=2):

C(4,2)*C(6,2)/C(10,4) = 6 * 15 / 210 = 90 / 210.

Simplify: 90 ÷ 30 = 3, 210 ÷30=7. So, 3/7.

Wait, wait, 90/210 = 3/7. Hmm, but 3/7 is about 0.428, which seems a bit high, but let me check calculations.

Wait, C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. 6*15=90. 90/210=3/7. That seems correct.

So, now, P(X=4) = 1/210, P(X=3)=24/210, P(X=2)=90/210.

So, P(B) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4) = 90/210 + 24/210 + 1/210 = (90 +24 +1)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115/5=23, 210/5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, let me verify: 23*5=115, 42*5=210. Yes.

Now, to compute P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that.

First, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is same as (1/210) * (42/23).

Simplify:

42/210 = 1/5.

So, (1/210) * (42/23) = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too simple, let me check.

Wait, 42/210 is indeed 1/5. So, (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m = 1, n = 115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with any number.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations in case I made a mistake.

Wait, so P(A|B) is 1/115? That seems low, but considering that only 1 way to get all four, and many ways to get at least two.

Let me compute again.

Total P(B) is 115/210 = 23/42.

P(A) is 1/210.

So, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way: the number of favorable for A is 1, the number of favorable for B is 115.

So, the probability is 1 / 115.

Yes, that's the same result.

So, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. We need to find the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is given by \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

Next, we compute the probability of winning the grand prize (all four numbers matching). There is only 1 way to do this, so the probability is:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \]

We then compute the probability of winning a prize (at least two numbers matching). This includes the probabilities of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. Using the hypergeometric distribution, we calculate these probabilities:

- For exactly 2 matches:
  \[ P(X = 2) = \frac{\binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{6 \times 15}{210} = \frac{90}{210} = \frac{3}{7} \]

- For exactly 3 matches:
  \[ P(X = 3) = \frac{\binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \times 6}{210} = \frac{24}{210} = \frac{4}{35} \]

- For exactly 4 matches:
  \[ P(X = 4) = \frac{\binom{4}{4} \binom{6}{0}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1 \times 1}{210} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Summing these probabilities gives the total probability of winning a prize:
\[ P(B) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) = \frac{90}{210} + \frac{24}{210} + \frac{1}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
