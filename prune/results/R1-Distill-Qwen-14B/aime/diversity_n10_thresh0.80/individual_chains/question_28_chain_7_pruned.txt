Alright, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, first, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of isohedral tetrahedron? Or perhaps it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. I remember that such tetrahedrons are called "equifacial" or maybe "isohedral," but I'm not entirely sure. But regardless, the key point is that it's symmetrical, which might help in calculations.

The point I is the incenter of the tetrahedron. The incenter is the point equidistant from all faces, and that distance is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I know that for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is similar to the 2D case with triangles. In a triangle, r = 3V / (a + b + c), where V is the area. For a tetrahedron, I think it's r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.

Wait, no, actually, in 3D, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Because in 2D, it's V (area) divided by semiperimeter, but in 3D, it's 3 times volume divided by surface area. Let me confirm that.

Yes, for a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. So, I'll need to compute both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

But before that, let me think about the surface area. Since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps all the faces are congruent triangles? Let me check.

Each face is a triangle, right? So, the four faces are triangles ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.

Let me see the edge lengths for each face.

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. So AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).

Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89).

Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89).

Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80).

So, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That makes sense because all edges are arranged symmetrically. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, the surface area is 4 times the area of one such triangle.

So, first, I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by four to get the total surface area A.

To compute the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, let's compute s for one face. Let me denote a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Compute s: (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

But that seems a bit messy with square roots. Maybe I can compute s squared or something else, but perhaps it's better to compute the area squared first.

Alternatively, since all four faces are congruent, maybe I can find the volume another way, perhaps using coordinates.

Alternatively, I remember that for a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, it's called a disphenoid. And in such cases, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / (72), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, another approach is to place the tetrahedron in coordinate space in such a way that the centroid is at the origin or something, but that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant. I've heard of that before. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:

Volume squared is equal to (1/288) times the determinant of the following matrix:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 AB² AC² AD²

1 AB² 0 BC² BD²

1 AC² BC² 0 CD²

1 AD² BD² CD² 0

So, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix. Let me write it out:

CM = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, AB², AC², AD²],
[1, AB², 0, BC², BD²],
[1, AC², BC², 0, CD²],
[1, AD², BD², CD², 0]
]

Then, determinant of CM, and volume V = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

So, let's assign the given lengths:

AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41.

AC = sqrt(80), so AC² = 80.

AD = sqrt(89), so AD² = 89.

BC = sqrt(89), so BC² = 89.

BD = sqrt(80), so BD² = 80.

CD = sqrt(41), so CD² = 41.

So, plugging these into the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me check:
