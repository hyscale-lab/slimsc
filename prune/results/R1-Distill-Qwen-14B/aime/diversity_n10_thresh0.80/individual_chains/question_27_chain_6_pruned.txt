Alright, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, I think that makes the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of this sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent to it along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, meaning it's outside but tangent along another circle. The problem is asking for the difference between the radii of these two tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, find m + n.

Okay, so I need to find r_i and r_o. Let's start by understanding what these radii mean. When the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangency is another circle. The radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, are likely related to the geometry of the torus and sphere.

First, let's recall some properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: R (the major radius) which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and r (the minor radius) which is the radius of the tube itself. In this problem, R is 6, and r is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a radius of 11. The torus is tangent to the sphere along a circle. Since the torus is inside, the point of tangency must be on the outermost part of the torus relative to the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, the tangency is on the innermost part relative to the sphere.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the centers. The sphere has a radius of 11, so its surface is 11 units from its center. The torus is a surface, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the torus just touches the sphere.

Let me model this. Let's place the sphere at the origin. When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the torus must be at some distance from the sphere's center. Similarly, when it's outside, the center is at a different distance.

But wait, the torus is a surface, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must satisfy certain conditions for tangency.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface. When the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the minimum distance is equal to the sphere's radius.

Hmm, maybe that's the right approach. Let me formalize this.

Let me denote O as the center of the sphere, and C as the center of the generating circle of the torus. The generating circle has radius 3, and the distance from C to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the axis of rotation is a line in the plane of the generating circle, 6 units away from its center.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the point on the torus that is farthest from O will lie along the line connecting O to the farthest point of the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, the closest point on the torus to O will lie along the line connecting O to C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the positions of the centers.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the center C must be located at a certain distance from O so that the torus just touches the sphere. The maximum distance from O to any point on the torus should be equal to 11, the radius of the sphere.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the minimum distance from O to any point on the torus is 11.

So, to find the positions of the torus relative to the sphere, we can compute the distance from O to C in each case.

Let me try to model this.

First, the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from its center. So, the major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3.

The sphere has
