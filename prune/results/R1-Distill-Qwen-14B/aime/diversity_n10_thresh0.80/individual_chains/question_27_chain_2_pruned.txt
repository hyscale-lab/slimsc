Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first.

The torus, T, is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from its center. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere, S, has a radius of 11. 

The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling what a torus looks like. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus in both cases and then relate that to the radii of the tangent circles.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, not a solid. So, when it's inside the sphere, the sphere touches the inner part of the torus, and when it's outside, the sphere touches the outer part of the torus.

Let me think of the torus as a surface of revolution. Any point on the torus can be represented in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, θ, z), where ρ is the radial distance from the z-axis. Because the torus is symmetric around the z-axis, the points of tangency will lie on a circle in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere touches the inner part of the torus. The distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus's generating circle must be such that the sphere just touches the inner surface.

Wait, but the torus is centered where? I think the center of the sphere and the center of the torus's generating circle are the same point. So, the sphere is centered at the same point as the torus's center.

But wait, no. Because when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is the same as the torus's center, right? So, when the torus is inside, the sphere will touch it at the innermost part, and when it's outside, it touches the outermost part.

Wait, but the torus is a surface. So, the sphere S has radius 11, and the torus T has a certain geometry. The sphere will be tangent to the torus along a circle. For internal tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, but wait, the torus is hollow, so actually, the sphere would enclose the torus when it's inside. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's like the torus is inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere, touching it along another circle.

Wait, actually, I think the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed inside or outside of it. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the sphere's surface is outside the torus's surface. So, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside, so again, they are tangent along a circle.

But how do I find the radii r_i and r_o of these tangent circles?

I think I need to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus when they are tangent. Wait, but the torus is a surface, so perhaps I should model the torus and the sphere as surfaces and find the points where they are tangent.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cross-section. Since both the torus and the sphere are symmetric around the same axis, let's take a cross-sectional view in the plane of the axis. The cross-section of the torus will look like two circles (the inner and outer parts of the donut). The cross-section of the sphere will be a circle as well.

Wait, so in cross-section, the sphere S with radius 11 will have a radius of 11 in
