Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Divide both sides by 2^(1/2):

y z = 2^(-7/24 - 1/2)

Compute exponent: -7/24 - 1/2 = -7/24 - 12/24 = -19/24

So y z = 2^(-19/24)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z

Combine exponents: 1/3 is 8/24, so 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24. So:

y = 2^(1/24) z

So y is expressed in terms of z. Now, substitute this into equation (1) result, which was y z = 2^(-19/24)

Substitute y = 2^(1/24) z into y z:

(2^(1/24) z) * z = 2^(-19/24)

Simplify:

2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-19/24 - 1/24) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

So z^2 = 2^(-5/6). Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.

Now, knowing z, we can find y.

From y = 2^(1/24) z:

y = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 5/12)

Convert 5/12 to 10/24:

1/24 -10/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

So y = 2^(-3/8)

So now, I have x, y, z expressed as powers of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, I need to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let's compute this.

First, express x^4 y^3 z^2 as:

(2^(-7/24))^4 * (2^(-3/8))^3 * (2^(-5/12))^2

Compute each exponent:

(2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)
(2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)
(2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply these together:

2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

Combine the exponents:

First, find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

So total exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.

Therefore, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value of this, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.

25 and 8 are coprime since their greatest common divisor is 1. So m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.

I think that's the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, when I converted log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2 to x = 2^(1/2) y z, that seems right.

Then, for equation (2), y = 2^(1/3) x z, which also looks correct.

Then, substituting into equation (3), I did z = 2^(1/4) x y, and since y = 2^(1/3) x z, substituting that in, I correctly calculated the exponent addition as 1/4 +1/3 = 7/12. Wait, no, 1/4 +1/3 = (3 +4)/12=7/12, yes. So z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z, leading to z(1 - 2^(7/12) x^2)=0, so x^2=2^(-7/12), hence x=2^(-7/24). That looks right.

Then, using equation (1) to express y z as 2^(-19/24), then from equation (2), y=2^(1/24) z, substituting that into y z gave z^2=2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6), so z=2^(-5/12). Then, y=2^(1/24 -5/12)=2^(-3/8). So x, y, z are all correctly computed.

Then, x^4 y^3 z^2 is 2^(-7/24*4) * 2^(-3/8 *3) * 2^(-5/12 *2) = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6). Adding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6. Convert to 24ths: -28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = -75/24, which is -25/8. So log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. Therefore, m +n=25+8=33.

I think all steps are correct.


The system of logarithmic equations can be converted into exponential form and solved for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). After finding each variable expressed as a power of 2, we compute the required logarithmic expression. The absolute value of the logarithm is \(\frac{25}{8}\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
