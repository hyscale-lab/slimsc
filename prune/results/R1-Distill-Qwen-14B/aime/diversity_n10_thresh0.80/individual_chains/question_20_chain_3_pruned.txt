Okay, so I have this problem where I need to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can use some or all of them. The rules are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, once I place the chips, if I try to add any more, it would violate one of the previous two conditions. 

Hmm, let me try to unpack this. So each row must have chips of the same color, right? And similarly, each column must have the same color. So, for each row, I can choose either white or black, and same for each column. But wait, that might not be entirely independent because the color of a row and the color of a column intersect at a cell, so that cell's color must satisfy both the row's and column's color constraints. 

So, for example, if row 1 is white and column 1 is black, then the cell at (1,1) would need to be both white and black, which is impossible. So that's a conflict. Therefore, for the configuration to be possible, the color assigned to each row must be compatible with the color assigned to each column. 

Wait, how does that work? Let's think. Let's say I assign a color to each row. If I do that, then for each column, the color of the column must be the same as the color of every row that it intersects. That is, if a column is colored black, then all the rows that intersect with that column must also be black. Otherwise, there's a conflict at the intersection cells. 

So, that suggests that the rows and columns can't be colored independently. Instead, the coloring has to be such that the rows and columns form a sort of consistent partition. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that each row is colored either white or black, and each column is also colored either white or black. But for the coloring to be consistent, if any column is colored white, then all the rows that have at least one white chip in that column must also be white. Similarly for black. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other is the columns, and edges represent cells. Then, coloring the
