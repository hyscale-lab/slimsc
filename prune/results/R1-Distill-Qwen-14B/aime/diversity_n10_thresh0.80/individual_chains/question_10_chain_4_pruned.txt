Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me parse this step by step.

First, Alice picks a set A. Then Bob considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So for each element 'a' in A, Bob can form sets B where 'a' is the maximum, and the other elements are any positive integers less than 'a'. 

Wait, so if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then for each ai, the number of possible sets B where ai is the maximum is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}. Because for each ai, the other elements in B must be less than ai, and since B must be non-empty, we can't have just {ai} alone unless we allow single-element sets, which we do because B is non-empty.

So, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is ai is 2^(ai - 1) - 1. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think.

If the maximum is ai, then the other elements must be chosen from {1, 2, ..., ai-1}. The number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} is 2^(ai - 1). But since B is non-empty and the maximum is ai, B must include ai and at least one other element from the lower numbers, or just ai alone.

Wait, no. Wait, the set B is non-empty and has maximum ai. So B can be {ai}, or {ai, x} where x < ai, or {ai, x, y}, etc. So the number of such sets is exactly equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1}, including the empty set (because if you take the empty set, then B is just {ai}). So the number of sets B with maximum ai is 2^(ai - 1). Because {1,2,...,ai-1} has 2^(ai-1) subsets, and each subset corresponds to a B where the maximum is ai (the subset can be empty, which gives B = {ai}).

Wait, that's right. So for each ai, the number of B's where max(B) = ai is 2^(ai -1).

So the total number of sets B Bob can list is the sum over each ai in A of 2^(ai -1).

In the problem, Bob's list has 2024 sets. So sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024.

So we can think of this as the sum of 2^{a_i -1} for all a_i in A is 2024.

Our task is to find the sum of elements of A.

So, since we need to find the sum of A, which is sum_{a in A} a, and we have the equation sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024.

So we need to find A
