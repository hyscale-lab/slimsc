Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So, z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, right? Because any complex number with magnitude r can be expressed as r times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument.

Alternatively, I can write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might come in handy later.

Since I'm dealing with complex numbers, and I need to find the maximum real part of the given expression, maybe I can express everything in terms of θ and then find the real part.

Let me rewrite the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z is just the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, because for a complex number z = a + bi, 1/z = (a - bi)/(a² + b²). And since |z| = 4, |z|² = 16. So, 1/z = conjugate(z)/16.

Therefore, 1/z = (4e^{-iθ})/16 = (cosθ - i sinθ)/4.

Wait, because z = 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ))/4 = (cosθ - i sinθ)/4.

Alternatively, since z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So, now I can express the entire expression in terms of θ.

Let me write both terms separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/(4e^{iθ})) = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, maybe I can compute this expression by expanding e^{iθ} and e^{-iθ} using Euler's formula.

So, let me denote e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ.

So, substituting:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ):

First, multiply 4*(75 + 117i):

4*75 = 300, 4*117i = 468i. So, 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

Now, multiply this by (cosθ + i sinθ):

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

So, the first term is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Now, compute the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiply 24*(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ.

Multiply 36i*(cosθ - i sinθ) = 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ = 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, adding them together:

24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ).

So, the second term is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ).

Now, add the first and second terms together:

Real parts: [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [ -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ] = (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

So, the entire expression becomes:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ).

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of this expression. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. We need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ.

So, the real part is a function of θ: Re(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum value of Re(θ), I can treat it as a single sinusoidal function. Remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and tanφ = B/A.

Wait, but in this case, Re(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but B is negative. So, the maximum value is sqrt(A² + B²). Wait, no, actually, the maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²), regardless of the signs of A and B.

So, let's compute the maximum value of Re(θ):

A = 324, B = -432.

So, the maximum real part is sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300² is 90,000, 24² is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400² is 160,000, 32² is 1,024, cross term is 2*400*32 = 25,600. So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Wait, but since B is -432, when we square, it's the same as 432 squared. So, 324² + 432² = 104,976 + 186,624.

Let me add them: 104,976 + 186,624. 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000. 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So, total is 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) = ?

Well, 500² = 250,000, 540² = 291,600. Because 54*54 = 2916, so 540² is 291,600.

Yes, so sqrt(291,600) = 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540.

But let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, I expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, then expressed 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Then, I expanded both terms: (75 + 117i)z and (96 + 144i)/z, substituting z and 1/z.

Then, I multiplied out the terms, expanded them, and grouped real and imaginary parts.

Adding the real parts together, I had 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Then, I recognized that this is a linear combination of sine and cosine, so its maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Which I computed as 540.

So, seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can write Re(θ) as a single sinusoid.

So, Re(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We can write this as R cos(θ + α), where R = sqrt(324² + 432²) and tanα = (432)/324.

Wait, wait, hold on. Because the coefficient of sinθ is negative, so maybe it's R cos(θ + α) where α is such that cosα = 324/R and sinα = -432/R.

Wait, because Re(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = R cos(θ + α), where R is sqrt(324² + 432²), and α is the phase shift.

But regardless, the maximum of Re(θ) is R, because the maximum of cos is 1, so R*1 is the maximum.

Which is 540.

Hmm, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus to find the maximum. Take the derivative of Re(θ) with respect to θ and set it to zero.

But that might be more involved. Let's try it.

Let me denote f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

df/dθ = -324 sinθ - 432 cosθ.

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ - 432 cosθ = 0.

Divide both sides by -36: 9 sinθ + 12 cosθ = 0.

So, 9 sinθ = -12 cosθ.

Divide both sides by cosθ: 9 tanθ = -12.

So, tanθ = -12/9 = -4/3.

So, θ = arctan(-4/3). Since tan is periodic every π, so θ can be in the second or fourth quadrants.

But when tanθ = -4/3, sinθ is negative when cosθ is positive (fourth quadrant) or sinθ positive and cosθ negative (second quadrant). Hmm, but we can compute sinθ and cosθ in terms of tanθ.

Alternatively, since we can represent tanθ = -4/3, so θ is in the fourth or second quadrant.

But regardless, to find the maximum of f(θ), perhaps it's more straightforward to compute R as before, and that's the maximum.

But to confirm, let's see.

We can write f(θ) = R cos(θ + α), where R = sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540.

So, the maximum value is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the critical points. Because sometimes when you take derivatives, you can have maxima and minima.

From df/dθ = 0, we have tanθ = -4/3.

So, θ is in the fourth or second quadrant.

Compute sinθ and cosθ for tanθ = -4/3.

Let's consider θ in the fourth quadrant: where cosθ is positive, sinθ is negative.

So, tanθ = -4/3 = opposite/adjacent = -4/3.

So, imagine a right triangle with adjacent side 3, opposite side -4 (since in fourth quadrant). Then hypotenuse would be sqrt(3² + (-4)^2) = 5.

So, sinθ = -4/5, cosθ = 3/5.

So, substituting into f(θ):

324*(3/5) - 432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1,728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540.

Similarly, if θ is in the second quadrant: cosθ is negative, sinθ is positive.

So, tanθ = -4/3 would imply opposite is 4, adjacent is -3. Hypotenuse is 5.

So, sinθ = 4/5, cosθ = -3/5.

Substitute into f(θ):

324*(-3/5) - 432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1,728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540.

Which is the minimum.

Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 540.

So, after verifying with calculus, I'm confident that the maximum real part is 540.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}


Given the problem of finding the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). 

First, we rewrite the expression:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]
Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) and \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\), we get:
\[
(75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Expanding using Euler's formula \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we compute the real and imaginary parts separately.

For the first term:
\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta
\]
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
\[
(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)
\]

For the second term:
\[
(24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
\[
(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)
\]

Adding the real parts together:
\[
300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

The real part of the expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find the maximum value, we recognize this as a sinusoidal function \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) with \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\). The maximum value is given by \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]
