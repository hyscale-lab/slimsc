Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, find m + n. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me visualize the torus. It's created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape where the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3.

I remember that the torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, R should be 6, and r is 3. So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i and r_o and then compute their difference.

Hmm, okay, so when the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. The sphere's center is fixed, and the torus is inside it. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's externally tangent, so the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

Wait, but actually, when T is inside S, the sphere is larger, and T is inside it, so the points of tangency must lie on the inner part of the torus relative to the sphere. Similarly, when T is outside S, the sphere is inside the torus, and the points of tangency are on the outer part of the torus.

I think I need to model the positions of the centers of the sphere and the torus in both cases.

Let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere first.

When T is inside S, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The torus is a surface, so the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus must be such that the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is at a distance of 11 - something, and the farthest point is 11 + something. Wait, no. Actually, when they are tangent, the distance between their centers should be equal to the sum or difference of their radii.

Wait, but the torus is a more complicated shape. It's not a solid sphere, so maybe I need to think about the positions where the sphere and torus touch.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus as a surface of revolution and find the points of tangency.

Alternatively, perhaps using some properties of the torus. The torus can be parametrized, but maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me recall that the torus is defined by two parameters: the major radius R (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and the minor radius r (radius of the tube). Here, R = 6 and r = 3.

The sphere has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is placed such that it's tangent to the sphere. Similarly when it's outside.

I think that in both cases, the centers of the sphere and the torus must lie along the same line, which would be the axis of the torus. Because the torus is symmetric around its axis, so the point of tangency should lie along this axis.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. When you have two surfaces tangent along a circle, the centers must lie along the axis of that circle. So, for the torus and sphere, the centers would lie along the line that is the axis of the torus. So, the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus would be important.

Wait, but the torus's center is the center of the tube, which is at a distance R from the axis. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me clarify.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus's generating circle.

Wait, the torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius r around an axis at distance R from the center of the circle. So, the center of the generating circle is R away from the axis.

When the torus is placed inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point, and the generating circle's center is at a distance d from the sphere's center. The sphere has radius 11, the torus has a tube radius of 3.

So, when they are tangent internally, the distance between the centers plus the tube radius equals the sphere's radius. Wait, no, it's the other way around.

Wait, if the torus is inside the sphere, then the distance from the sphere's center to the generating circle's center plus the tube radius equals the sphere's radius? Or is it minus?

Wait, let me think in 2D first. Imagine a circle of radius 3, and a sphere (in 3D, but in 2D it's a circle) of radius 11. If I have the generating circle inside the sphere, the distance between their centers plus the radius of the generating circle equals the radius of the sphere when they are externally tangent.

Wait, no, when two circles are externally tangent, the distance between centers is equal to the sum of their radii. When they're internally tangent, the distance is equal to the difference.

But in this case, the sphere is a 3D object, and the torus is a surface. So, perhaps the points of tangency lie along a circle, as given.

Wait, maybe I need to model this in terms of the sphere and the torus touching at a single point or along a circle.

Wait, but the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly for externally tangent.

So, the sphere and torus share a common circle where they are tangent. So, the sphere has a circle of radius r_i on its surface, and the torus also has a circle of radius r_i at the same location.

Wait, but the sphere's radius is 11, so the circle of tangency on the sphere would have radius r_i. Similarly, on the torus, the circle of tangency would also have radius r_i.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so the circle of tangency on the torus would be a circle on its surface. So, perhaps the radius of that circle is r_i.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should model the sphere and the torus as surfaces and find the distance between their centers when they are tangent along a circle.

Let me consider the sphere and the torus in 3D space. The sphere is centered at some point, and the torus is centered along an axis. Let me assume that the axis of the torus is aligned along the z-axis for simplicity. The sphere is centered at (0, 0, h) for some h, and the torus is centered at the origin.

Wait, but the torus is generated by revolving a circle around the z-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of the generating circle. So, the generating circle is in the plane z = 0, centered at (6, 0, 0), radius 3.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think more carefully.

The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius r=3 around an axis in its plane, at a distance R=6 from the center. So, the major radius R is 6, minor radius r is 3.

In parametric terms, any point on the torus can be described as:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ

y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ

z = r sin θ

Where θ and φ are angles parameterizing the torus.

Now, the sphere is centered at some point, say (0,0, a), with radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the sphere and torus are tangent. At these points, their normals must be the same, and they lie on both surfaces.

Alternatively, since it's a circle of tangency, the sphere and torus must share a common tangent plane along that circle, and the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must satisfy some condition.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus, and then use the fact that the sphere and torus must touch at a single circle.

But the torus's "center" is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the center of the torus is the center of the generating circle, which is at a distance R from the axis. Hmm, no, the generating circle's center is R away from the axis, but the entire torus is symmetric around the axis.

Wait, maybe the center of the torus is the midpoint of the axis? So, if the torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis at a distance 6 from the center, then the center of the torus is on the axis, at some point. Wait, perhaps the axis is considered the center of the torus.

Wait, perhaps I should model the sphere and the torus such that their centers (the center of the sphere and the center of the torus's axis) are separated by some distance D.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be where the sphere's surface just touches the torus.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch externally.

So, let me model the sphere at (0,0,0) for simplicity, and the torus's axis is along the z-axis, centered at (0,0,d) for some d. Wait, no, if the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers would be such that the sphere's radius minus the torus's "reach" equals the distance between centers.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface. The torus has a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3.

The minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface when it's inside would be 11 - (R + r) = 11 - (6 + 3) = 2. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the torus is a surface. The minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus is when the line from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is along the axis of the torus. So, the minimal distance would be R - r, and the maximal distance would be R + r, but I might have that reversed.

Wait, no. The torus's generating circle is at a distance R from the axis. So, the closest point on the torus to the axis is R - r, and the farthest is R + r.

If the sphere's center is on the axis of the torus, then the minimal distance from the sphere's center to the torus is (R - r) = 6 - 3 = 3, and the maximal distance is 6 + 3 = 9.

Wait, but the sphere has a radius of 11. So, if the sphere is enclosing the torus, the sphere's center must be at a distance such that the torus is just touching the sphere internally.

Wait, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's axis is such that the sphere's radius equals the distance from the center to the torus's surface plus the torus's minor radius.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to model this using coordinates.

Let me set up a coordinate system where the sphere is centered at (0,0,0), and the torus has its axis along the z-axis, centered at (0,0, d), where d is the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's axis.

Wait, no, no, the torus's axis goes through its center. Wait, actually, the torus's center is on the axis, but it's not a single point. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let me model the sphere at (0,0,0) and the torus's axis along the z-axis, with the generating circle in the plane z=0, centered at (6,0,0) with radius 3. So, the torus is generated by rotating this circle around the z-axis.

Wait, no, the generating circle is in a plane that is perpendicular to the axis, so if the axis is the z-axis, the generating circle is in the x-y plane, but centered at (6,0,0). So, the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis (z-axis) is 6 units.

So, the torus is generated by revolving the circle (x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 3^2 around the z-axis.

Now, the sphere is centered at (0,0,0) with radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle. Let's find where this happens.

The torus's equation can be written as sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 + 3 cos θ, but wait, no, the parametric equations are better. The standard parametrization is:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ

y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ

z = r sin θ

Where R is 6, r is 3.

So, x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ

z = 3 sin θ

The sphere's equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

At points of tangency, both the torus and sphere share the same tangent plane, so their normals are colinear.

The normal vector to the sphere at any point (x,y,z) is (x, y, z), since the gradient is (2x, 2y, 2z), which points radially outward.

The normal vector to the torus at a point (x,y,z) can be found using the gradient of the torus's equation. The implicit equation of the torus is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

Let me compute the gradient:

Let F(x,y,z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0.

Then, the gradient ∇F = ( (2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)(x/sqrt(x^2+y^2)), (2(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)(y/sqrt(x^2+y^2)), 2z )

Simplify:

∇F = ( 2(x)(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2+y^2), 2(y)(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2+y^2), 2z )

At the point of tangency, the normal vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. So, the sphere's normal (x,y,z) must be parallel to ∇F.

Therefore, there exists a scalar λ such that:

x = λ * [2x (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ]

y = λ * [2y (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ]

z = λ * [2z ]

Hmm, okay. Now, let's analyze these equations.

First, note that if x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, then we can divide both sides by x and y respectively.

From the x-component:

1 = λ * [2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ]

Similarly, from the y-component:

1 = λ * [2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ]

Thus, the x and y components give the same equation, which is consistent.

From the z-component:

z = λ * 2 z

If z ≠ 0, then 1 = 2λ, so λ = 1/2.

If z = 0, then the equation holds for any λ, but let's see.

Case 1: z ≠ 0.

Then, λ = 1/2.

Substituting back into the x-component equation:

1 = (1/2) * 2 (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 )

Simplify:

1 = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + y^2):

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6

Wait, that implies 0 = -6, which is impossible. So, this case leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, z must be zero.

Case 2: z = 0.

So, at points of tangency, z = 0.

So, the points lie in the plane z=0.

Now, the sphere's equation at z=0 is x^2 + y^2 = 121.

The torus's equation at z=0 is when z=3 sin θ = 0, so θ = 0 or π. But wait, the parametric equations when θ = 0: x = (6 + 3)(cos φ) = 9 cos φ, y = 9 sin φ, z=0. Similarly, when θ=π, x=(6-3) cos φ=3 cos φ, y=3 sin φ, z=0.

So, the intersection of the torus with the plane z=0 is two circles: one of radius 9 and another of radius 3, both centered at the origin.

But the sphere's intersection with z=0 is a circle of radius 11.

So, the points of tangency must lie where these circles coincide.

Wait, but the torus's z=0 intersection has two circles: radius 3 and 9. The sphere's z=0 intersection is radius 11.

So, the only overlapping point is if one of the torus's circles is tangent to the sphere's circle.

Wait, but the sphere's circle is radius 11, and the torus's circles are 3 and 9 in the same plane.

So, perhaps the point of tangency is where the sphere's circle (radius 11) touches the torus's circle of radius 9. Because 9 is closer to 11 than 3 is.

Wait, but 11 is larger than 9, so if the sphere is outside the torus, the point of tangency would be where the sphere's circle touches the torus's outer circle (radius 9). Similarly, when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency would be where the sphere's inner surface touches the torus's inner circle (radius 3).

Wait, but in this problem, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o.

So, perhaps when the torus is inside, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside, so the point of tangency is on the sphere's inner surface, but since the sphere is a solid, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the sphere as a surface, not a solid.

In that case, when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle on the sphere, and similarly when outside.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so they can be tangent along a circle. So, the sphere and torus share a common circle where they are tangent.

Now, in the previous analysis, when z=0, the sphere and torus intersect at two circles, but that's only when the sphere's center coincides with the torus's center.

Wait, perhaps I'm not setting this up right. Maybe the sphere is not centered at the same point as the torus's axis.

Wait, the problem says "when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle". So, the sphere S has radius 11, and the torus T is placed inside S such that they are tangent along a circle.

Similarly, when T rests on the outside of S, they are externally tangent along another circle.

So, in both cases, the sphere and torus share a common circle where they are tangent.

I think I need to find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (along the axis) such that they are tangent along a circle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the sphere and the torus in 3D and find the distance between their centers when they are tangent along a circle.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the circle of tangency.

Let me consider the circle on the sphere where they are tangent. The radius of this circle is r_i when the torus is inside, and r_o when it's outside.

The sphere has radius 11, so the circle of tangency lies at a distance d from the sphere's center, where d can be found using the formula for a circle on a sphere.

For a sphere of radius a, a circle at distance h from the center has radius b = sqrt(a^2 - h^2). So, in this case, for the sphere, the circle of tangency would have radius r_i = sqrt(11^2 - D^2), where D is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane of the circle.

But since the torus is tangent along this circle, the plane of the circle is also a plane where the torus lies.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution around the z-axis. So, the circle of tangency must lie in a plane that is either parallel or at some angle to the z-axis.

Wait, but since the sphere is centered at (0,0,0) and the torus's axis is along the z-axis, the circle of tangency must lie in a plane that is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus.

Wait, but if the sphere's center is at (0,0,0) and the torus's center is at (0,0,d), then the line connecting them is along the z-axis. So, the circle of tangency would lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, i.e., a horizontal plane.

Wait, but earlier, when we had z=0, that's a horizontal plane, but the torus at z=0 has two circles, which are in the same plane as the sphere's intersection.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle of tangency is a horizontal circle (constant z) on both the sphere and the torus.

So, let's suppose that the circle of tangency lies in the plane z = k for some k.

For the sphere, the radius of the circle at height z=k is sqrt(11^2 - k^2). Similarly, for the torus, the radius of the circle at height z=k can be found.

Wait, the torus is parametrized as:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ

z = 3 sin θ

So, for a fixed z=k, we can solve for θ:

k = 3 sin θ => sin θ = k/3 => θ = arcsin(k/3)

So, cos θ = sqrt(1 - (k^2)/9) = sqrt((9 - k^2)/9) )= sqrt(9 -k^2)/3.

Then, the radius of the circle on the torus at height z=k is:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 + 3 cos θ = 6 + 3*(sqrt(9 -k^2)/3) )= 6 + sqrt(9 -k^2).

So, the radius of the circle on the torus at height z=k is 6 + sqrt(9 -k^2).

But this circle is also the circle of tangency with the sphere, so its radius must equal the sphere's circle at z=k, which is sqrt(11^2 - k^2) = sqrt(121 -k^2).

So, we have:

6 + sqrt(9 -k^2) = sqrt(121 -k^2)

Let me write this equation down:

6 + sqrt(9 - k²) = sqrt(121 - k²)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

Left side: [6 + sqrt(9 - k²)]² = 36 + 12 sqrt(9 -k²) + (9 -k²) = 45 -k² + 12 sqrt(9 -k²)

Right side: [sqrt(121 -k²)]² = 121 -k²

So,

45 -k² + 12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 121 -k²

Simplify: The -k² terms cancel.

45 + 12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 121

Subtract 45:

12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 76

Divide by 12:

sqrt(9 -k²) = 76/12 = 19/3 ≈ 6.333...

Wait, but sqrt(9 -k²) must be less than or equal to 3, because 9 -k² >=0 implies k² <=9, so sqrt(9 -k²) <=3. But 19/3 ≈6.333>3, which is impossible.

Hmm, that suggests that there's no solution for the case when the torus is inside the sphere. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency is on the inner side of the torus. Wait, maybe the radius of the torus's circle is not 6 + sqrt(9 -k²), but 6 - sqrt(9 -k²). Because when you're inside, the radius would be smaller.

Wait, let's think: at a given height z=k, the torus has two possible circles: one on the outside (6 + sqrt(9 -k²)) and one on the inside (6 - sqrt(9 -k²)), but actually, the torus is a surface, so at each z=k, the radius is either 6 + sqrt(9 -k²) or 6 - sqrt(9 -k²), but only if that's positive.

Wait, no, each z=k cuts the torus at two points, top and bottom, but the radius of the circle is the same for both.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency is on the inner part of the torus, so the radius is 6 - sqrt(9 -k²), and when it's outside, it's 6 + sqrt(9 -k²).

Let me try that.

So, for internal tangency:

6 - sqrt(9 -k²) = sqrt(121 -k²)

Similarly, for external tangency:

6 + sqrt(9 -k²) = sqrt(121 -k²)

Let me try the internal case first.

Equation: 6 - sqrt(9 -k²) = sqrt(121 -k²)

Let me square both sides:

[6 - sqrt(9 -k²)]² = (sqrt(121 -k²))²

Left side: 36 - 12 sqrt(9 -k²) + (9 -k²) = 45 -k² -12 sqrt(9 -k²)

Right side: 121 -k²

So,

45 -k² -12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 121 -k²

Simplify: -k² cancels.

45 -12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 121

Subtract 45:

-12 sqrt(9 -k²) = 76

Divide by -12:

sqrt(9 -k²) = -76/12

But sqrt(9 -k²) is non-negative, and the RHS is negative. No solution. Hmm.

That's a problem. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the circle of tangency is not in the same plane as the sphere's center. Maybe the line connecting the sphere's center to the torus's center is at some angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is not centered on the torus's axis when they are tangent.

Wait, that makes more sense. If the sphere is not centered along the torus's axis, the points of tangency would lie along a circle that's not in a plane perpendicular to the axis.

This complicates things, but maybe I can model it.

Let me think: the sphere is centered at (0,0,d), and the torus is centered at the origin, with its axis along the z-axis. The points of tangency lie along a circle. The distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center is d.

At the points of tangency, the distance from the sphere's center to any point on the circle is 11, and the distance from the torus's center to the same point is determined by the torus's geometry.

Wait, perhaps the circle of tangency lies on a plane that is at a distance h from the sphere's center. Then, the sphere's circle has radius r_sphere = sqrt(11^2 - h^2).

Similarly, for the torus, the circle lies on a plane at some distance from the torus's center. But the torus's geometry is more complex.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the points on the circle of tangency satisfy both the sphere's equation and the torus's equation, and their normals are colinear.

This might get too involved, but let's try.

The sphere's equation: x² + y² + (z - d)^2 = 11² = 121.

The torus's equation: (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 3² = 9.

At the points of tangency, the normals are colinear. So, the gradient vectors of the sphere and torus at those points are scalar multiples.

The gradient of the sphere is (2x, 2y, 2(z - d)).

The gradient of the torus is as computed before: ( 2x (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), 2y (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), 2z )

So, setting (2x, 2y, 2(z - d)) = λ ( 2x (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), 2y (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), 2z )

Divide both sides by 2:

(x, y, z - d) = λ ( x (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), y (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²), z )

So, component-wise:

1. x = λ x ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²) )

2. y = λ y ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²) )

3. z - d = λ z

From equations 1 and 2, if x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0, then:

1/λ = (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)/sqrt(x² + y²) = 1 - 6/sqrt(x² + y²)

So, 1/λ = 1 - 6/s.

Where s = sqrt(x² + y²).

From equation 3: z - d = λ z → d = z (1 - λ )

From equation 1: x [1 - λ ( (s -6)/s ) ] = 0.

Wait, no, let me write equation 1 again:

x = λ x ( (s -6)/s )

If x ≠ 0, then:

1 = λ ( (s -6)/s ) → λ = s/(s -6 )

Similarly, from equation 2, same result.

So, λ = s/(s -6 )

From equation 3: d = z (1 - λ ) = z (1 - s/(s -6 )) = z ( (s -6 - s )/(s -6) ) ) = z ( -6/(s -6) )

So, d = -6 z / (s -6 )

Now, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + (z - d)^2 = 121.

We can write s² + (z - d)^2 = 121.

But s² = x² + y².

Also, from the torus's equation: (s -6)^2 + z² = 9.

So, (s -6)^2 + z² = 9.

Let me write down the equations I have:

1. λ = s/(s -6 )

2. d = -6 z / (s -6 )

3. s² + (z - d)^2 = 121

4. (s -6)^2 + z² = 9

Let me try to substitute d from equation 2 into equation 3.

From equation 3:

s² + (z - d)^2 = 121

Substitute d:

s² + [ z - (-6 z / (s -6 )) ]^2 = 121

Simplify inside the square:

z + (6 z)/(s -6 ) = z [ 1 + 6/(s -6) ] = z [ (s -6 +6 )/(s -6) ) ] = z ( s / (s -6 ) )

So, equation 3 becomes:

s² + [ z s / (s -6 ) ]^2 = 121

But from equation 4: (s -6)^2 + z² = 9 → z² = 9 - (s -6)^2

So, z² = 9 - (s² -12 s +36 ) = 9 - s² +12 s -36 = -s² +12 s -27

So, z² = -s² +12 s -27.

Now, substitute z² into equation 3:

s² + [ (z s )^2 ] / (s -6 )^2 = 121

But (z s )^2 = z² s² = [ -s² +12 s -27 ] s²

So,

s² + [ (-s^4 +12 s^3 -27 s² ) ] / (s -6 )^2 = 121

Let me factor numerator:

(-s^4 +12 s^3 -27 s² ) = -s² (s² -12 s +27 )

Factor s² -12 s +27: discriminant is 144 -108=36, roots at (12 ±6)/2= (18/2)=9 and (6/2)=3.

So, s² -12 s +27 = (s -9)(s -3 )

Thus,

(-s^4 +12 s^3 -27 s² ) = -s² (s -9)(s -3 )

Denominator is (s -6 )².

So, equation becomes:

s² + [ -s² (s -9)(s -3 ) ] / (s -6 )² = 121

Factor out s²:

s² [ 1 - ( (s -9)(s -3 ) ) / (s -6 )² ] = 121

Let me compute the term in the brackets:

1 - [ (s -9)(s -3) ] / (s -6 )²

Compute numerator: (s -9)(s -3 )= s² -12 s +27

Denominator: (s -6 )² = s² -12 s +36

So,

1 - (s² -12 s +27)/(s² -12 s +36 )

= [ (s² -12 s +36 ) - (s² -12 s +27 ) ] / (s² -12 s +36 )

Simplify numerator:

s² -12 s +36 -s² +12 s -27 = 9

So,

= 9/(s² -12 s +36 )

Thus, equation becomes:

s² [ 9/(s² -12 s +36 ) ] = 121

So,

9 s² / (s² -12 s +36 ) = 121

Multiply both sides by denominator:

9 s² = 121 (s² -12 s +36 )

Expand RHS:

9 s² = 121 s² - 1452 s + 4356

Bring all terms to left:

9 s² -121 s² +1452 s -4356 = 0

Simplify:

-112 s² +1452 s -4356 =0

Multiply both sides by -1:

112 s² -1452 s +4356 =0

Divide equation by 4 to simplify:

28 s² -363 s +1089 = 0

Now, solve for s using quadratic formula.

s = [363 ± sqrt(363² -4*28*1089 ) ]/(2*28 )

Compute discriminant:

D = 363² -4*28*1089

Compute 363²:

363 *363 = let's compute:

360² = 129600

360 *3 = 1080

3 *3 =9

So, (360 +3)^2 =360² + 2*360*3 +3²= 129600 +2160 +9= 131769.

4*28*1089= 112 *1089.

Compute 1089 *100=108900

1089*12=13068

So, 1089*112=1089*(100+12)=108900 +13068=121,968.

So, D=131,769 -121,968= 9,801.

sqrt(9801)= 99.

So, s = [363 ±99 ] /56

Compute both possibilities:

Case 1: s=(363 +99)/56=462/56=462 ÷14=33, 56 ÷14=4 → 33/4=8.25

Case 2: s=(363-99)/56=264/56=264 ÷8=33, 56 ÷8=7 →33/7≈4.714

So, s= 33/4 or s=33/7.

Now, s is sqrt(x² + y²), which must be positive and greater than or equal to |6 -3|=3 and less than or equal to 6 +3=9.

So, 3 ≤s ≤9.

33/4=8.25 which is within [3,9], and 33/7≈4.714, which is also within [3,9].

So, both are possible.

Now, let's find corresponding z for each s.

From equation 4: (s -6)^2 + z² =9

So, z²=9 - (s-6)^2

For s=33/4=8.25:

(s-6)=8.25 -6=2.25=9/4

So, z²=9 - (9/4)^2= 9 -81/16= (144 -81)/16=63/16 → z=±sqrt(63/16)=±(3√7)/4≈±1.984

Similarly, for s=33/7≈4.714:

(s-6)=4.714 -6≈-1.286= -18/14= -9/7

So, z²=9 - (-9/7)^2=9 -81/49= (441 -81)/49=360/49 → z=±sqrt(360/49)=±(6√10)/7≈±2.916

Now, from equation 3: s² + (z -d)^2=121.

But we also have from equation 2: d= -6 z/(s -6 )

Let me compute d for each case.

First, s=33/4=8.25, z=±3√7/4.

Compute d= -6 z/(s -6)= -6 z/(8.25 -6)= -6 z/(2.25)= -6 z/(9/4)= -6 z * (4/9)= - (24 z)/9= - (8 z)/3.

So, for z=3√7/4:

d= -8*(3√7/4)/3= -8*(√7)/4= -2√7 ≈-5.2915.

Similarly, for z=-3√7/4:

d= -8*(-3√7/4)/3=8*(3√7/4)/3=8*(√7)/4=2√7≈5.2915.

Now, let's check equation 3 for s=33/4 and d=-2√7.

s²= (33/4)^2=1089/16.

(z -d)^2= (3√7/4 - (-2√7 ))^2= (3√7/4 +2√7 )^2= ( (3√7 +8√7 )/4 )^2= (11√7 /4 )^2= (121 *7)/16=847/16.

So, s² + (z -d)^2=1089/16 +847/16=(1089+847)/16=1936/16=121. Which matches.

Similarly, for z=-3√7/4 and d=2√7, same result.

Now, for the second case, s=33/7≈4.714, z=±6√10/7.

Compute d= -6 z/(s -6)= -6 z/(33/7 -6)= -6 z/(33/7 -42/7)= -6 z/( -9/7 )= -6 z * (-7/9 )= (42 z)/9= (14 z)/3.

For z=6√10/7:

d=14*(6√10/7)/3= (14*6√10)/(7*3)= (84√10)/21=4√10≈12.649.

For z=-6√10/7:

d=14*(-6√10/7)/3= (-84√10)/21= -4√10≈-12.649.

Now, check equation 3 for s=33/7 and d=4√10.

s²=(33/7)^2=1089/49.

(z -d)^2= (6√10/7 -4√10)^2= [ (6√10 -28√10)/7 ]^2= [ (-22√10)/7 ]^2= (484*10)/49=4840/49.

So, s² + (z -d)^2=1089/49 +4840/49=5929/49=121. Which matches.

Similarly, for z=-6√10/7 and d=-4√10, same result.

So, we have two possible solutions:

1. s=33/4, z=±3√7/4, d=±2√7

2. s=33/7, z=±6√10/7, d=±4√10

Now, the first case, s=33/4=8.25, which is greater than 6 +3=9? No, 8.25 is less than 9. Because s is the distance from the origin in the x-y plane, so for the torus, s can be as high as 6 +3=9.

Wait, 33/4=8.25, which is less than 9, so valid.

Similarly, 33/7≈4.714, which is greater than 6 -3=3, so also valid.

Now, the question is which case corresponds to internal and external tangency.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between centers d should be such that the sphere's radius is larger than the torus's reach.

Wait, when the torus is inside, the sphere's center is closer to the torus's center, so d would be smaller.

In case 1, d=±2√7≈±5.2915.

In case 2, d=±4√10≈±12.649.

But the sphere has radius 11, so the maximum possible distance between centers is 11 + something. Wait, but when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the distance between centers would be larger.

Wait, let's see.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside, so the distance between centers d must satisfy d + something =11.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the sphere's center being at distance d from the torus's center.

In case 1, d=2√7≈5.2915, which is less than 11, so the sphere's center is relatively close.

In case 2, d=4√10≈12.649, which is greater than 11, so the sphere's center is outside the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is centered at (0,0,0), and the torus's center is at (0,0,d). So, the distance between centers is |d|.

In case 1, |d|=2√7≈5.2915, which is less than 11, so the sphere's center is inside the sphere (duh), but the torus is inside the sphere.

In case 2, |d|=4√10≈12.649, which is greater than 11, so the sphere's center is inside the sphere, but the torus's center is outside the sphere.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and the distance between centers is larger.

So, case 1: d=2√7, which is less than 11. This would correspond to the torus being inside the sphere, touching along a circle with s=33/4.

Case 2: d=4√10≈12.649>11, which would correspond to the torus being outside the sphere, touching along a circle with s=33/7.

Thus, for internal tangency (torus inside sphere), s=33/4=8.25, and the circle's radius r_i is the sphere's circle at height z=k: sqrt(11^2 -k^2).

Wait, but earlier I tried to find r_i as the sphere's circle at z=k, but it's unclear.

Wait, the circle of tangency on the sphere is at a certain radius. Let me compute that.

In case 1: s=33/4=8.25, and from the sphere's perspective, the circle lies at a radius r_i= sqrt(11^2 -d^2).

Wait, no, wait, the sphere is centered at (0,0,0), and the circle of tangency lies in the plane z=k, so the radius of the circle on the sphere is sqrt(11^2 -k^2).

But in this case, from the previous calculations, z=±3√7/4≈±1.984.

So, the radius of the circle on the sphere is sqrt(11^2 - (3√7/4)^2 )= sqrt(121 - (9*7)/16 )= sqrt(121 -63/16 )= sqrt( (1936 -63)/16 )= sqrt(1873/16 )= sqrt(1873)/4≈43.28/4≈10.82.

But wait, according to the problem, when T is inside S, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i. Similarly for external.

But in our case, the circle on the sphere has radius sqrt(11^2 -k^2)=sqrt(121 - (3√7/4)^2 )=sqrt(121 - 63/16 )=sqrt( (1936 -63)/16 )=sqrt(1873)/4≈10.82.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, the circle of tangency on the torus is s=33/4=8.25.

Wait, perhaps I confused the terms. The circle of tangency is on both the sphere and the torus, but their radii are different.

Wait, no, the circle of tangency is the same for both. So, the radius r_i is the radius of the circle on the sphere, which is sqrt(11^2 -k^2 ), and also the radius of the circle on the torus.

Wait, the torus's circle at height z=k has radius s=33/4=8.25.

So, the radius of the circle of tangency is s=8.25, which is r_i=33/4=8.25.

Similarly, for external tangency, the circle of tangency has radius s=33/7≈4.714, so r_o=33/7.

But wait, let me confirm.

In case 1: s=33/4, which is the radius of the torus's circle at z=k, which is equal to the radius of the sphere's circle at z=k.

So, r_i=33/4.

In case 2: s=33/7, so r_o=33/7.

Thus, the difference r_i - r_o=33/4 -33/7=33*(7-4)/(4*7)=33*3/28=99/28.

Simplify: 99 and 28 are coprime since 99=9*11, 28=4*7, no common factors.

So, m=99, n=28, m+n=127.

Wait, is this correct? Let me check.

Wait, in case 1, when the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency has radius r_i=33/4=8.25.

In case 2, when the torus is outside the sphere, the circle of tangency has radius r_o=33/7≈4.714.

So, r_i - r_o=33/4 -33/7= (231 -132)/28=99/28.

Yes, so m=99, n=28. They are coprime since 99 and 28 share no common divisors besides 1.

Thus, m +n=99+28=127.


To solve the problem, we analyze the torus \( T \) and sphere \( S \) when they are tangent along circles. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis at a distance 6 from the circle's center. The sphere \( S \) has a radius of 11.

### Key Steps:

1. **Torus and Sphere Equations**:
   - The torus \( T \) is defined by:
     \[
     (\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
     \]
   - The sphere \( S \) is centered at the origin with radius 11:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121
     \]

2. **Tangency Conditions**:
   - When \( T \) is inside \( S \), they are internally tangent along a circle with radius \( r_i \).
   - When \( T \) is outside \( S \), they are externally tangent along a circle with radius \( r_o \).

3. **Finding \( r_i \) and \( r_o \)**:
   - For internal tangency, solving the system of equations yields \( r_i = \frac{33}{4} \).
   - For external tangency, solving the system yields \( r_o = \frac{33}{7} \).

4. **Difference \( r_i - r_o \)**:
   - Compute the difference:
     \[
     r_i - r_o = \frac{33}{4} - \frac{33}{7} = \frac{231 - 132}{28} = \frac{99}{28}
     \]
   - The fraction \( \frac{99}{28} \) is in simplest form, so \( m = 99 \) and \( n = 28 \).

5. **Final Result**:
   - \( m + n = 99 + 28 = 127 \).

### Answer:
\boxed{127}
