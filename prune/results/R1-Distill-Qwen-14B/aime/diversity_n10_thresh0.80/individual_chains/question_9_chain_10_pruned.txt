Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and also the logarithm of x^(4y) with base y is 10. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to unpack it.

First, let me write down the equations as given. The first part is log base x of y^x equals 10. So, in mathematical terms, that would be:

log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is log base y of x^(4y) equals 10:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, so those are the two equations we have. Both equal to 10. I think I can use logarithm properties to simplify these.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), I can bring down the exponent. So this becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}), applying the same power rule:

4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, so we have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Now, I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is the same as 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A, then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So, substitute that into the equations.

First equation: x * A = 10

Second equation: 4y * (1/A) = 10

So, now I have:

x * A = 10 ...(1)

(4y) / A = 10 ...(2)

Hmm, so now I have two equations with two variables, x and y, and A. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of A and then find a relationship.

From equation (1), x = 10 / A.

From equation (2), 4y = 10A, so y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

So now, x is expressed as 10/A, and y is 5A/2.

But wait, I also know that A is log_x(y). Since A = log_x(y), that means that x^A = y.

So, x^A = y.

But I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Let's substitute them into this equation.

x is 10/A, so (10/A)^A = y, which is 5A/2.

So, (10/A)^A = (5A)/2.

Hmm, that's an equation involving A. Let me write that out:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln[(10/A)^A] = ln[(5A)/2]

Using the power rule again on the left side:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A/2)

Let me expand the left side:

A [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Wait, because ln(5A/2) is ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2), since ln(ab/c) = ln(a) + ln(b) - ln(c).

So, expanding that:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me rearrange the terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Let me factor where possible.

Looking at terms with A:

A [ln(10) - ln(A)] - [ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)] = 0

Wait, perhaps that's not the most useful way. Maybe group the terms differently.

Let me see:

A ln(10) - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, maybe factor A from the first two terms and -1 from the next two:

A [ln(10) - ln(A)] - [ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)] = 0

Wait, that's similar to before. Alternatively, perhaps let me factor out ln(A):

Looking at -A ln(A) - ln(A) = -ln(A)(A + 1)

So, the equation becomes:

A ln(10) - ln(A)(A + 1) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write ln(10) as ln(2*5) = ln(2) + ln(5). Let me try that.

So, ln(10) = ln(2) + ln(5). Substituting that into the equation:

A [ln(2) + ln(5)] - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Now, distribute A:

A ln(2) + A ln(5) - A ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, maybe group like terms:

Terms with ln(2): A ln(2) + ln(2) = ln(2)(A + 1)

Terms with ln(5): A ln(5) - ln(5) = ln(5)(A - 1)

Terms with ln(A): -A ln(A) - ln(A) = -ln(A)(A + 1)

So putting it all together:

ln(2)(A + 1) + ln(5)(A - 1) - ln(A)(A + 1) = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor (A + 1) out from the first and last terms:

(A + 1)[ln(2) - ln(A)] + ln(5)(A - 1) = 0

Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let me set B = A + 1, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps trying to see if A is a nice integer.

Wait, maybe A is an integer. Let's think about possible integer values of A.

If A is an integer, let's test A=2.

Let me plug A=2 into the equation:

Equation was (10/A)^A = 5A/2.

With A=2:

Left side: (10/2)^2 = 5^2 = 25

Right side: 5*2/2 = 5

25 ≠ 5, so nope.

A=3:

Left: (10/3)^3 ≈ (3.333)^3 ≈ 37.037

Right: 5*3/2=7.5

Not equal.

A=4:

Left: (10/4)^4 = (2.5)^4 = 39.0625

Right: 5
