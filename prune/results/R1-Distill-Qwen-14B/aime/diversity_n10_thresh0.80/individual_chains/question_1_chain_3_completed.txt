Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let me write that expression in terms of logarithms.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

So I need to find 4a + 3b + 2c, where a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z.

Alternatively, I can let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z, and express the given equations in terms of a, b, c.

Let me try that substitution. Since log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2, which is a - (b + c) = 1/2. Similarly for the others.

So:

Equation 1: a - (b + c) = 1/2

Equation 2: b - (a + c) = 1/3

Equation 3: c - (a + b) = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c.

Let me write them out:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(A)

2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(B)

3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(C)

Hmm, this seems manageable. Let me write this system:

Equation A: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation B: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation C: -a - b + c = 1/4

I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.

First, add equations A and B:

Equation A: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation B: -a + b - c = 1/3

Adding A + B:

(a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3

Which simplifies to:

0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

So -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12

Wait, that's interesting. c = log₂z = -5/12. So z = 2^(-5/12). Interesting.

Now, let's add equations A and C.

Equation A: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation C: -a - b + c = 1/4

Adding A + C:

(a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4

Simplifies to:

0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4

So -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/8

So b = log₂y = -3/8, which implies y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, having c and b, let's find a from equation A.

Equation A: a - b - c = 1/2

We know b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

So a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Convert 3/8 and 5/12 to a common denominator. Let's see, 24.

3/8 = 9/24

5/12 = 10/24

So a + 9/24 + 10/24 = 12/24

So a + 19/24 = 12/24

Thus, a = 12/24 - 19/24 = -7/24

So a = log₂x = -7/24, so x = 2^(-7/24)

Now, we have:

a = -7/24,

b = -3/8,

c = -5/12.

We need to compute 4a + 3b + 2c.

Let me compute each term:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8

2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Now sum them up:

-7/6 + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, find a common denominator. 24?

Let me convert each term:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

So sum is (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify -75/24. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8

So 4a + 3b + 2c = -25/8

But wait, the question is asking for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|, which is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So m = 25, n =8. They are coprime. So m + n = 33.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure.

First, in the system of equations, when we substituted, we ended up with a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Then, 4a is 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6.

3b is 3*(-3/8) = -9/8.

2c is 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.

Adding them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Let me compute this again.

First, combine (-7/6) + (-5/6) = (-12/6) = -2.

Then, add (-9/8) to that: -2 + (-9/8) = (-16/8) + (-9/8) = (-25/8). So same as before.

So the log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, but let me check if the initial step of converting the logarithmic equations into linear equations is correct.

Yes, because log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 implies that x/(y z) = 2^(1/2), so taking log both sides gives the linear equations.

Wait, no, actually, when we take the logarithm, it's already in the equation, so we have a - b - c =1/2, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the value of x y z.

From equation (4), x y z = 2^(-13/12). Let me compute that:

x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12)

Multiply them:

x y z = 2^(-7/24 -3/8 -5/12)

Convert to 24 denominator:

-7/24 - 9/24 (since 3/8 =9/24) -10/24 (since 5/12 =10/24)

Total exponent: (-7 -9 -10)/24 = (-26)/24 = -13/12

Which matches equation (4), so that's correct.

So all steps are correct, so the answer is 25/8, m + n =33.


The given system of equations involves logarithms, which we convert into exponential form. By expressing each variable in terms of the others and substituting, we find that the product \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\). Introducing variables \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\), we transform the original equations into a linear system:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \\
-b - a + c = \frac{1}{3} \\
-c - a - b = \frac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Solving this system, we find \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\). Substituting these into the expression \(4a + 3b + 2c\), we compute:

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
