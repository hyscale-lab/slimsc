Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit positive integer, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That's interesting. So, N has four digits, say, a, b, c, d. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change any digit to 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. So, if I change the thousands digit a to 1, the number becomes 1bcd, which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, which should be divisible by 7, and so on for c and d.

Wait, but N is the greatest such number. So, I want the largest possible N, meaning I want a to be as large as possible, then b, then c, then d. So, maybe starting from 9999 and checking each number down until I find the one that satisfies the condition.

But that sounds time-consuming. There has to be a smarter way.

Let me think about the implications. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: a b c d.

When we change a to 1, the number becomes 1 b c d. Let's call this N1. So, N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. N1 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1 gives a 1 c d, which is N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. N2 must be divisible by 7.

Similarly for changing c to 1: N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. And changing d to 1 gives N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. All these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

Therefore, N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡ 0 mod7, N3 ≡ 0 mod7, N4 ≡ 0 mod7.

Let me write down these congruences.

First, N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, I have four congruence equations:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

Hmm, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7 for each term.

First, 1000 mod7. Let's calculate that.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, replacing the coefficients:

1. 6 + (2b) + (3c) + d ≡ 0 mod7.

2. (6a) + 2 + (3c) + d ≡ 0 mod7.

3. (6a) + (2b) + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

4. (6a) + (2b) + (3c) + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7. --> Equation (1)

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7. --> Equation (2)

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7. --> Equation (3)

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7. --> Equation (4)

Now, let's see if we can find relationships between these equations.

I can subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):

Equation (1) - Equation (2):

[6 + 2b + 3c + d] - [6a + 2 + 3c + d] ≡ 0 - 0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 - 2 + 2b -6a + (3c -3c) + (d -d) ≡ 0 mod7.

So, 4 + 2b -6a ≡ 0 mod7.

Which can be written as:

-6a + 2b +4 ≡0 mod7.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, let's denote this as Equation (5):

6a - 2b -4 ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (5)

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

[6a + 2 + 3c + d] - [6a +2b +3 + d] ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify:

6a -6a +2 -3 +3c -2b +d -d ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

-1 +3c -2b ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c -2b -1 ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (6)

Similarly, subtract Equation (4) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (4):

[6a +2b +3 + d] - [6a +2b +3c +1] ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify:

6a -6a +2b -2b +3 -1 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

2 +d -3c ≡0 mod7.

So, d -3c +2 ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (7)

Similarly, subtract Equation (4) from Equation (1):

Equation (1) - Equation (4):

[6 + 2b +3c +d] - [6a +2b +3c +1] ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 -1 +2b -2b +3c -3c +d -6a ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

5 + d -6a ≡0 mod7.

So, d -6a +5 ≡0 mod7. --> Equation (8)

So now, we have Equations (5), (6), (7), (8):

Equation (5): 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Equation (6): 3c -2b -1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation (7): d -3c +2 ≡0 mod7.

Equation (8): d -6a +5 ≡0 mod7.

Perhaps we can express variables in terms of others. Let's see.

From Equation (5):

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me write this as:

2b ≡6a -4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7).

So,

b ≡ (6a -4)*4 mod7.

Compute (6a -4)*4:

6*4=24≡3 mod7, and -4*4=-16≡-2≡5 mod7.

So, 3a +5 mod7.

So, b ≡3a +5 mod7. --> Equation (5a)

Similarly, from Equation (6):

3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We can plug in b from Equation (5a):

3c -2*(3a +5) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

3c -6a -10 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

3c -6a ≡11 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4.

So,

3c -6a ≡4 mod7.

Factor:

3(c -2a) ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, the inverse is 5.

So,

c -2a ≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

Thus,

c ≡2a +6 mod7. --> Equation (6a)

From Equation (7):

d -3c ≡-2 mod7.

Plugging c from Equation (6a):

d -3*(2a +6) ≡-2 mod7.

Simplify:

d -6a -18 ≡-2 mod7.

-18 mod7: 18 /7=2*7=14, 18-14=4, so -18≡-4≡3 mod7.

So,

d -6a ≡-2 +3=1 mod7.

So,

d ≡6a +1 mod7. --> Equation (7a)

From Equation (8):

d -6a ≡-5 mod7.

So,

d ≡6a -5 mod7. --> Equation (8a)

Wait, but from Equation (7a) and Equation (8a), we have:

6a +1 ≡6a -5 mod7.

Subtract 6a from both sides:

1 ≡-5 mod7.

Which is 1 +5 =6≡0 mod7? Wait, 1 ≡-5 mod7 means 1 +5=6≡0 mod7, which is not true. 6≡0 mod7? No, 6≡6.

So, something's wrong here. There must be a mistake in my calculations.

Let me check the steps.

Starting from Equation (7):

d -3c +2 ≡0 mod7.

So, d -3c ≡-2 mod7.

From Equation (6a): c=2a +6 mod7.

So, d -3*(2a+6) ≡-2 mod7.

Compute that:

d -6a -18 ≡-2 mod7.

-18 mod7: 18 mod7 is 4, so -18 mod7 is -4 mod7=3.

So, d -6a +3 ≡-2 mod7.

Which is:

d -6a ≡-2 -3= -5≡2 mod7.

So, d ≡6a +2 mod7. --> Equation (7b)

Wait, previously I thought Equation (7a) was d ≡6a +1, but that was incorrect. Let me correct that.

So, from Equation (7):

d ≡6a +2 mod7.

From Equation (8):

d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, 6a +2 ≡6a -5 mod7.

Subtract 6a:

2≡-5 mod7.

Which is 2 +5=7≡0 mod7. So, 0≡0 mod7. So, no contradiction here. So, it's consistent.

So now, we have:

b=3a +5 mod7 (Equation 5a)

c=2a +6 mod7 (Equation 6a)

d=6a +2 mod7 (Equation 7b)

And from Equation (8a): d=6a -5 mod7, but since d=6a +2 mod7, and 6a +2 ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, 2≡-5 mod7: 2+5=7≡0 mod7, which is correct.

So, no problem here.

So, now we've expressed b, c, d in terms of a mod7.

So, let's see: a, b, c, d are digits. So, a is from 1 to9, b, c, d from 0 to9.

But since N is a four-digit number, a can be 1-9, but we want the greatest N, so a should be as large as possible, ideally 9.

But let's see.

So, let's note that:

b = (3a +5) mod7.

But since b is a digit (0-9), its value is between 0 and9. Similarly for c and d.

So, perhaps we can express b, c, d in terms of a, considering their possible ranges.

Let me think: Since a is from 1-9, let's compute b, c, d in terms of a.

First, compute b = (3a +5) mod7.

But 3a +5 mod7 can be expressed as:

Since a can be 1-9, let's compute 3a +5 for a=1 to9 and see what they are mod7.

a | 3a +5 | mod7
1 | 8 | 1
2 | 11 |4
3 |14 |0
4 |17 |3
5 |20 |6
6 |23 |2
7 |26 |5
8 |29 |1
9 |32 |4

So, for each a, b is as follows:

a=1: b=1
a=2: b=4
a=3: b=0
a=4: b=3
a=5: b=6
a=6: b=2
a=7: b=5
a=8: b=1
a=9: b=4

Similarly, c = (2a +6) mod7.

Compute 2a +6 mod7 for a=1-9:

a | 2a +6 | mod7
1 |8 |1
2 |10 |3
3 |12 |5
4 |14 |0
5 |16 |2
6 |18 |4
7 |20 |6
8 |22 |1
9 |24 |3

So, c for each a:

a=1: c=1
a=2: c=3
a=3: c=5
a=4: c=0
a=5: c=2
a=6: c=4
a=7: c=6
a=8: c=1
a=9: c=3

Similarly, d = (6a +2) mod7.

Compute for a=1-9:

6a +2 mod7:

a |6a +2 | mod7
1 |8 |1
2 |14 |0
3 |20 |6
4 |26 |5
5 |32 |4
6 |38 |3
7 |44 |2
8 |50 |1
9 |56 |0

So, d for each a:

a=1: d=1
a=2: d=0
a=3: d=6
a=4: d=5
a=5: d=4
a=6: d=3
a=7: d=2
a=8: d=1
a=9: d=0

So, now, for each a from 1 to9, we have b, c, d mod7, but since they are digits, they can be from 0-9. So, the actual value would be the mod result plus 7*k, where k is such that the digit is between 0-9.

But since mod7 gives values 0-6, adding 7 would make them 7-13, which is beyond single digits. So, the only possible way is that b, c, d are either equal to their mod7 value or mod7 +7.

But since we want the largest possible N, we should choose the largest possible digits for b, c, d, given their mod7 constraints.

So, for each a, we can compute the maximum possible digit for b, c, d.

Let me try to approach this. Since we're looking for the largest N, we want a as large as possible, then b, then c, then d.

So, let's start with a=9.

a=9:

From above:

b=4
c=3
d=0

These are the mod7 values. But wait, can they be higher? Since b is 4 mod7, the possible digits are 4 and 11, but 11 is not a digit, so b must be 4.

Similarly, c=3 mod7, possible digits are 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so c=3.

d=0 mod7, possible digits are 0 or7, so d can be 0 or7. Since we want the largest
