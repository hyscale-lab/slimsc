Okay, so I have this problem where points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and they form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me break it down.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no. Correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, they are perpendicular.

Wait, but in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the rhombus is centered at the origin.

So, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals must be the perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if I consider points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, meaning the origin is the midpoint of both AC and BD.

Wait, so if the origin is the midpoint, then if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D must be (-u, -v). Because the midpoint between (x, y) and (-x, -y) is (0, 0). Same for B and D.

So, points A, B, C, D are such that A = (x, y), C = (-x, -y), B = (u, v), D = (-u, -v). All four points lie on the hyperb
