Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20) which is 2*sqrt(5), and b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6).

Now, points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, which makes sense since the intersection is at the origin.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other, right? So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y), because the midpoint is the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D would be (-p, -q).

Wait, but since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to B to C, etc. But maybe it's easier to work with the properties of the diagonals.

Let me think: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.

But since the diagonals are AC and BD, which intersect at the origin, let's see. Suppose points are A, B, C, D in order, so the diagonals are AC and BD.

Let me denote the coordinates:

A = (x1, y1)
C = (-x1, -y1)
B = (x2, y2)
D = (-x2, -y2)

So, the diagonals are AC connecting (x1, y1) to (-x1, -y1), and BD connecting (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2).

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Slope of AC: ( -y1 - y1 ) / ( -x1 - x1 ) = (-2y1)/(-2x1) = y1/x1.

Slope of BD: ( -y2 - y2 ) / ( -x2 - x2 ) = (-2y2)/(-2x2) = y2/x2.

Since they are perpendicular, (y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.

So, (y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1.

That gives us y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

That's one equation.

Also, all four points lie on the hyperbola, so (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 = 1, and similarly for (x2, y2):

(x2²)/20 - (y2²)/24 = 1.

I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD squared, or maybe the minimum? Wait, the question is phrased as the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the supremum of the lower bounds, which would be the infimum of BD².

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum value of BD squared, so that all BD² are greater than or equal to this value. So, the greatest lower bound.

So, I need to find the minimal possible value of BD squared.

BD is the length of diagonal BD. Since BD connects (x2, y2) to (-x2, -y2), its length is sqrt[ (x2 - (-x2))² + (y2 - (-y2))² ] = sqrt[ (2x2)² + (2y2)² ] = 2*sqrt(x2² + y2²). So, BD squared is (2*sqrt(x2² + y2²))² = 4*(x2² + y2²).

So, BD² = 4(x2² + y2²). So, I need to minimize 4(x2² + y2²).

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, I have constraints on x1, y1 and x2, y2.

Wait, but I also have the condition from the slopes: y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

Hmm, so perhaps I can express x1 or y1 in terms of x2 and y2, or vice versa.

Let me consider that.

From y1 y2 = -x1 x2, I can write x1 = -(y1 y2)/x2.

But since x1 and y1 are related by the hyperbola equation:

x1² /20 - y1² /24 = 1.

So, substituting x1:

[ ( (y1 y2)/x2 )² ] /20 - y1² /24 = 1.

Wait, wait, actually, x1 is equal to -(y1 y2)/x2, so x1 squared is (y1² y2²)/(x2²).

So, substituting into the hyperbola equation for point A:

( (y1² y2²)/(x2²) ) /20 - y1² /24 = 1.

Let me write that down:

(y1² y2²)/(20 x2²) - y1² /24 = 1.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can express y1² in terms of x2².

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between y1 and y2.

Wait, another thought: Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors.

Let me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of AC is O, same for BD.

In a rhombus, the sides are vectors OA + OB, OA - OB, etc. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude.

Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinates for vectors. Let me think.

Points A = (x1, y1), B = (x2, y2), C = (-x1, -y1), D = (-x2, -y2).

So, vector AB would be (x2 - x1, y2 - y1).

Vector BC would be (-x1 - x2, -y1 - y2).

Vector CD would be (-x2 - (-x1), -y2 - (-y1)) = (x1 - x2, y1 - y2).

Vector DA would be (x1 - (-x2), y1 - (-y2)) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2).

Since it's a rhombus, all these vectors should have the same length.

So, |AB|² = |BC|².

So, let's compute |AB|²:

(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)².

|BC|²:

(-x1 - x2)² + (-y1 - y2)² = (x1 + x2)² + (y1 + y2)².

Set them equal:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x2 + x1)^2 + (y2 + y1)^2.

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (x2² - 2 x1 x2 + x1²) + (y2² - 2 y1 y2 + y1²).

Right side: (x2² + 2 x1 x2 + x1²) + (y2² + 2 y1 y2 + y1²).

Subtract left side from right side:

[ (x2² + 2x1x2 +x1²) + (y2² + 2y1y2 + y1²) ] - [ (x2² - 2x1x2 + x1²) + (y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²) ]

= (2x1x2 + 2y1y2) - (-2x1x2 - 2y1y2)

Wait, actually, let me compute each term:

For x terms:

(x2² + 2x1x2 +x1²) - (x2² - 2x1x2 + x1²) = 4x1x2.

For y terms:

Similarly, (y2² + 2y1y2 + y1²) - (y2² - 2y1y2 + y1²) = 4y1y2.

So, overall, right side minus left side is 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0.

So, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0 => x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

But from earlier, we had that (y1/x1)(y2/x2) = -1 => y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, substituting into x1x2 + y1y2 = 0:

x1x2 + (-x1x2) = 0 => 0 = 0.

So, it's consistent. So, that condition is already satisfied.

Hmm, so perhaps I need another condition.

Wait, what else do I know? The sides are equal, so |AB| = |BC|, which is what I used, and it gave me an identity. So, maybe I need to use another pair of sides.

Let's set |AB|² = |AD|².

Wait, vector AD is (x1 + x2, y1 + y2), so |AD|² is (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2, same as |BC|².

Wait, so |AB| = |AD| would imply:

(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2.

Which is similar to the previous condition.

Wait, expanding:

Left: x2² - 2x1x2 + x1² + y2² - 2y1y2 + y1².

Right: x1² + 2x1x2 + x2² + y1² + 2y1y2 + y2².

Subtract left from right:

(2x1x2 + 2y1y2) - (-2x1x2 - 2y1y2) = 4x1x2 + 4y1y2.

Set equal to zero: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Same as before. So, same condition.

Hmm, so maybe the condition is automatically satisfied because of the hyperbola and the diagonals being perpendicular?

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Since the rhombus is formed by points on the hyperbola with diagonals intersecting at the origin, and diagonals are perpendicular.

So, perhaps the diagonals are the axes of the hyperbola? Wait, no, because the hyperbola's transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily aligned with the axes.

Wait, but in our case, the diagonals are AC and BD, which are not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes. So, perhaps the hyperbola has to accommodate these two diagonals as chords.

Wait, another approach: parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, a standard parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions.

So, let me set A as (a cosh θ, b sinh θ), since it's a right-opening hyperbola.

Similarly, point C would be (-a cosh θ, -b sinh θ).

Wait, but that's just for one branch. Alternatively, we can parametrize points on the hyperbola as (sqrt(20) sec φ, sqrt(24) tan φ), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates for points A and B such that they satisfy the hyperbola equation and the condition of forming a rhombus.

Wait, let me think about the rhombus properties again.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, maybe if I can express the diagonals as vectors, and since they are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. So, vectors AC and BD.

Vector AC is from A to C: (-x1 -x1, -y1 - y1) = (-2x1, -2y1).

Vector BD is from B to D: (-x2 -x2, -y2 - y2) = (-2x2, -2y2).

So, AC vector is (-2x1, -2y1), BD vector is (-2x2, -2y2).

Dot product of AC and BD should be zero because they are perpendicular.

So, (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 0.

Which is 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0 => x1x2 + y1y2 =0.

Which is the same condition as before: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, that's a crucial equation.

We also have that all four points lie on the hyperbola, so:

x1² /20 - y1² /24 =1,

x2² /20 - y2² /24 =1.

So, perhaps I can parameterize points A and B in terms of angles or something, and then find BD squared.

Wait, but maybe I can express y1 in terms of x1, using the hyperbola equation.

From x1² /20 - y1² /24 =1,

y1² = (24/20)(x1² -20) = (6/5)(x1² -20).

Similarly, y2² = (6/5)(x2² -20).

So, y1 = sqrt(6/5(x1² -20)), but we have to be careful about the sign. Similarly for y2.

But since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps we can assume without loss of generality that y1 and y2 are positive? Or perhaps not, because the rhombus could be in any orientation.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps I can set y1 = k x1, and y2 = m x2, but I don't know if that helps.

Wait, another thought: from x1x2 + y1y2 =0,

we can write y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

So, if I let y1 = a x1, then y2 = (-1/(a)) x2.

Wait, let's see:

Let me assume that y1 = a x1, then from y1 y2 = -x1 x2,

(a x1) y2 = -x1 x2 => a y2 = -x2.

So, y2 = (-x2)/a.

Similarly, from the hyperbola equation:

For point A: (x1²)/20 - (y1²)/24 =1,

(x1²)/20 - (a² x1²)/24 =1.

Factor out x1²:

x1² [1/20 - a²/24] =1.

Similarly, for point B: (x2²)/20 - (y2²)/24 =1,

(x2²)/20 - ( (x2²)/(a²) )/24 =1.

Because y2 = (-x2)/a, so y2² = x2² / a².

So, equation for point B:

x2² [1/20 - 1/(24 a²)] =1.

So, both x1² and x2² are expressed in terms of a.

Let me write them as:

x1² = 1 / [1/20 - a²/24 ] = 1 / [ (24 -20 a²) / (20*24) ) ] = (20*24)/(24 -20 a²) = 480 / (24 -20 a²).

Similarly, x2² = 1 / [1/20 - 1/(24 a²) ] = 1 / [ (24 a² -20 ) / (20*24 a²) ) ] = (20*24 a²) / (24 a² -20 ) = 480 a² / (24 a² -20 ).

So, now, we have:

x1² = 480 / (24 -20 a²),

x2² = 480 a² / (24 a² -20 ).

So, since x1² and x2² must be positive, the denominators must be positive.

So, for x1²: 24 -20 a² >0 => 24 >20 a² => a² < 24/20 = 6/5.

For x2²: 24 a² -20 >0 => 24 a² >20 => a² > 20/24 =5/6.

So, a² must satisfy 5/6 < a² <6/5.

So, 5/6 < a² <6/5.

So, a² is between 5/6 and 6/5.

Now, let's compute BD squared, which is 4(x2² + y2²).

We can express y2² as (x2²)/a².

So, BD² =4(x2² + x2²/a² )=4x2²(1 +1/a²)=4x2²*( (a² +1)/a² )=4x2²*(a² +1)/a².

But from earlier, x2² =480 a² / (24 a² -20 ).

So, substitute:

BD²=4*(480 a² / (24 a² -20 ))*(a² +1)/a².

Simplify:

4*480 a² * (a² +1) / [ (24 a² -20 ) a² ]

= (4*480) * (a² +1) / (24 a² -20 )

= 1920 * (a² +1)/(24 a² -20 )

So, BD² = [1920 (a² +1)] / (24 a² -20 )

Let me denote f(a²) = [1920 (a² +1)] / (24 a² -20 )

We need to find the minimal value of f(a²) for a² in (5/6,6/5).

So, to find the minimal BD², we can minimize f(a²) over a² in (5/6,6/5).

So, let me set t = a², so t ∈ (5/6,6/5).

So, f(t) = [1920 (t +1)] / (24 t -20 )

We can simplify this expression:

f(t) = 1920 (t +1)/(24 t -20 )

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1920(t+1)

Denominator: 24 t -20 = 4*(6t -5)

So,

f(t) = [1920/(4)] * (t +1)/(6t -5) = 480 * (t +1)/(6t -5 )

So, f(t) = 480 (t +1)/(6t -5 )

We can write this as:

f(t) = 480 * [ (t +1) / (6t -5) ]

Let me denote g(t) = (t +1)/(6t -5).

We need to find the minimum of g(t) over t ∈ (5/6,6/5), then multiply by 480.

So, let's find the derivative of g(t) with respect to t.

g(t) = (t +1)/(6t -5)

g'(t) = [ (1)(6t -5) - (t +1)(6) ] / (6t -5)^2

= [6t -5 -6t -6 ] / (6t -5)^2

= [ (6t -6t) + (-5 -6) ] / (6t -5)^2

= (-11)/(6t -5)^2

So, g'(t) = -11 / (6t -5)^2.

Since (6t -5)^2 is always positive for t ≠5/6, and our t is greater than 5/6 (since t >5/6), so the derivative is negative.

Therefore, g(t) is decreasing on the interval (5/6,6/5).

Therefore, its minimum occurs at the right endpoint, t=6/5.

Wait, but wait, if g(t) is decreasing, then it attains its minimum at the maximum t, which is 6/5.

Similarly, it attains its maximum at the left endpoint, t=5/6.

So, the minimal value of g(t) is g(6/5):

g(6/5) = (6/5 +1)/(6*(6/5) -5 )= (11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)= (11/5)/(11/5)=1.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, let's compute it:

t=6/5,

g(t) = (6/5 +1)/(6*(6/5) -5 )= (11/5)/(36/5 -25/5)= (11/5)/(11/5)=1.

So, g(6/5)=1.

Similarly, at t=5/6,

g(t)= (5/6 +1)/(6*(5/6) -5 )= (11/6)/(5 -5)= (11/6)/0, which is undefined. But as t approaches 5/6 from the right, denominator approaches 0 from positive side, and numerator approaches 11/6, so g(t) approaches +infinity.

So, as t approaches 5/6+, g(t) tends to +infty, and as t=6/5, g(t)=1.

Wait, so the minimal value of g(t) is 1, and the maximum is unbounded.

Therefore, f(t) =480 g(t) has minimal value at t=6/5, which is 480 *1=480.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the idea that BD² is minimized at 480.

But wait, let me verify.

Wait, when t approaches 5/6 from above, BD² approaches infinity, so it's unbounded above. The minimal value is at t=6/5, which is 480.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, when t=6/5, let's compute BD²=480 *g(6/5)=480*1=480.

But is 480 the minimal value?

Wait, yes, because for t in (5/6,6/5), g(t) is decreasing, so its minimum is at t=6/5.

Therefore, BD² can be as small as 480, but can get larger as t approaches 5/6.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, and it can be larger than that, but not smaller.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD² is always greater than or equal to 480.

But wait, wait, the question is: Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

So, it's the infimum of BD², which is 480.

Thus, the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

But wait, wait, let me think again. If BD² can be 480, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 480, because BD² is always at least 480. So, 480 is the minimum value, so the greatest lower bound is 480.

Wait, but 480 is achieved when t=6/5, so it's attainable.

Therefore, the minimal BD² is 480, which is the greatest lower bound.

Hence, the answer is 480.

Wait, but let me just confirm all steps once again.

We started by parametrizing points A and B on the hyperbola, expressed the condition that they form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin and perpendicular. We found that BD squared is a function of a parameter t, which is a², and found that the minimal value is at t=6/5, giving BD squared as 480.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, the answer should be 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus formed by points \( A, B, C, D \) on the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other, leading to the condition \( x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0 \) for points \( A(x_1, y_1) \) and \( B(x_2, y_2) \). 

Using the hyperbola equation, we express \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) in terms of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), and derive the relationship \( y_1 = a x_1 \) and \( y_2 = -\frac{x_2}{a} \). Substituting into the hyperbola equation, we find expressions for \( x_1^2 \) and \( x_2^2 \) in terms of a parameter \( a^2 \). 

We then compute \( BD^2 \) as \( 4(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \) and simplify it to a function of \( a^2 \). By analyzing this function, we determine that the minimal value of \( BD^2 \) occurs at \( a^2 = \frac{6}{5} \), yielding \( BD^2 = 480 \). 

Thus, the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is \( 480 \).

\boxed{480}
