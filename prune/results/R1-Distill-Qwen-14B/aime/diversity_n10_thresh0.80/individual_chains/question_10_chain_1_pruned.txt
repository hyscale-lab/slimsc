Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements in set A. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, so Bob is listing all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. And the total number of such B's is 2024. So I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me break it down. First, let's think about what Bob is doing. For each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum? Well, if a is the maximum, then all the other elements in B must be less than a. So for each a, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set because B has to be nonempty.

Wait, no, actually, since B is finite and nonempty, and the maximum is a, then B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a} that includes a and excludes the empty set. So the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, because for each element less than a, you can choose whether to include it or not. But since B must include a, we don't have the choice there. So the total number is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let me verify that. If a is the maximum, then the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, and since B must be non-empty, but if a is included, then even if all other elements are excluded, B is just {a}, which is allowed. So the number of such subsets is indeed 2^{a-1}.

So, for each a in A, we have 2^{a-1} possible sets B where a is the maximum. Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

Given that the total number of sets Bob has is 2024, that means:

Sum_{a âˆˆ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So, I need to find the set A such that the sum of 2^{a - 1} for each a in A is equal to 2024. Then, compute the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, but A is a set of positive integers, so each a is a unique positive integer. So the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} equals 2024, and then summing the elements of A.

Alternatively, this is similar to expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Because each 2^{a-1} is a power of 2, and since A is a set, each a-1 must be unique, so each 2^{a-1} is a distinct power of 2.

Wait, yes, exactly. Because if
