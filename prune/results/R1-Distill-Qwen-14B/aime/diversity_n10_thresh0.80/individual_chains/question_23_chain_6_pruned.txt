Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Sometimes these geometry and conic section problems can get a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the problem says: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. So, first, let me visualize this. We have a hyperbola, and four points on it forming a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin must be the midpoint of both diagonals. For a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, is that always true? Actually, no, that's a property of a square. For a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in this case, since it's a rhombus, I think the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, wait, yes, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property. So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD of the rhombus ABCD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

So, if A, B, C, D are points on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, then the points are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of
