Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example given is 81, which is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, my goal is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's represent n in base b. If n has exactly two digits in base b, then n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero (otherwise, it would be a single-digit number). So, a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote m = sqrt(n). Then, n = m^2.

Putting it all together, we have:
m^2 = a*b + c
and
a + c = m.

So, we can write c = m - a. Substituting this into the first equation:
m^2 = a*b + (m - a)
Simplify:
m^2 = a*b + m - a
m^2 - m = a*(b - 1)
So,
a = (m^2 - m)/(b - 1)

But a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1. So, for a to be an integer, (b - 1) must divide (m^2 - m). Also, since a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, we have:
1 ≤ a = (m^2 - m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Which can be rewritten as:
1 ≤ (m^2 - m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1

Let me rearrange the inequalities:

First inequality:
(m^2 - m)/(b - 1) ≥ 1
=> m^2 - m ≥ b - 1
=> m^2 - m - (b - 1) ≥ 0

Second inequality:
(m^2 - m)/(b - 1) ≤ b - 1
=> m^2 - m ≤ (b - 1)^2
So,
m^2 - m - (b - 1)^2 ≤ 0

So, for each m, we can find the possible b's that satisfy these two inequalities.

But perhaps a better way is to express b in terms of m and a. From the equation:
a = (m^2 - m)/(b - 1)
We can solve for b:
b - 1 = (m^2 - m)/a
=> b = 1 + (m^2 - m)/a

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (m^2 - m) must be divisible by a, and a must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1.

But b is expressed in terms of a and m, so perhaps we can iterate over possible m and a to find possible b's.

Wait, maybe it's better to express the bounds for m in terms of b.

Since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So, n must satisfy:
b ≤ n ≤ b^2 - 1

But n is m^2, so:
b ≤ m^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Taking square roots:
sqrt(b) ≤ m ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But since m must be an integer, m ranges from the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b) to the largest integer less than or equal to sqrt(b^2 -1). Let's compute sqrt(b^2 -1). Since b^2 -1 is just one less than b^2, its square root is just a tiny bit less than b. So, the maximum m is b-1, because (b-1)^2 = b^2 - 2b + 1, which is less than b^2 -1 when b > 2. Wait, but when b=2, (b-1)^2 =1, which is less than 3 (since b^2 -1=3). Hmm, maybe my reasoning is off.

Wait, let's think again. The maximum m is the floor of sqrt(b^2 -1). Since b^2 -1 is less than b^2, sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b. So, the maximum m is b-1 when sqrt(b^2 -1) >= b-1. Let's see:

Is sqrt(b^2 -1) >= b -1?

Let me square both sides:

b^2 -1 >= (b -1)^2
b^2 -1 >= b^2 - 2b +1
Subtract b^2 from both sides:
-1 >= -2b +1
Add 2b to both sides:
2b -1 >=1
2b >=2
b >=1

Which is always true since b >=2. So sqrt(b^2 -1) is >= b -1.

Therefore, the maximum m is floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) which is b -1, because (b-1)^2 <= b^2 -1.

But for example, when b=2: b^2 -1=3. sqrt(3)≈1.732, which is less than 2, so the maximum m is 1. But (b-1)^2=1, which is indeed <=3.

Similarly, when b=3: b^2 -1=8. sqrt(8)≈2.828, so m_max=2, which is b-1.

So, in general, m can range from m_min to m_max, where m_min is the smallest integer >= sqrt(b), and m_max is b-1.

Wait, but for b=2: sqrt(b)=sqrt(2)≈1.414, so m_min=2? Wait no, m has to be at least 1 because n is at least b=2, so m would be at least 2? Wait, no, because n is m^2, which is at least b, which is 2. So m^2 >=2 => m>=2 when b=2.

Wait, but when b=2, n can be 2, 3. So m^2 can be 2 or 3, but m must be integer. So m can be 2 (since 2^2=4 which is greater than 3? Wait, no, 4 is greater than 3, which is b^2 -1=3. So for b=2, the maximum n is 3, so m can be sqrt(3)≈1.732, so m=1, but 1^2=1 <2, which is not allowed. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is flawed. Let me re-examine.

n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 -1, inclusive. Also, n must be a perfect square, so m^2
