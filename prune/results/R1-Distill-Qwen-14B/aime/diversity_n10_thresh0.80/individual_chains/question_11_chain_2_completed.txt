Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), since its magnitude is 4. That might make things easier because then \( \frac{1}{z} \) would just be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, let me try to express the entire expression in terms of \( \theta \).

Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

So substituting these into the original expression:

\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify the constants:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 = 300 + 468i \)
Second term: \( (96 + 144i) / 4 = 24 + 36i \)

So now the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression because the problem asks for the largest possible real part. To find the real part, I can express each term using Euler's formula and then separate the real and imaginary parts.

Let me recall Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, let's expand each term.

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each multiplication separately.

Starting with the first term:

Multiply \( 300 + 468i \) with \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \):

Use distributive property:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Now, group real and imaginary parts:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

So, the first term is \( [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + i[300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] \)

Now, the second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Again, distribute:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Simplify using \( i^2 = -1 \):

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

So, the second term is \( [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] + i[-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] \)

Now, adding the two terms together:

First, add the real parts:

First term real: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Second term real: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Sum real: \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Now, add the imaginary parts if needed, but since we're only concerned with the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary parts for now.

So the real part of the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part. Let me denote this as \( R(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

So, I need to find the maximum value of \( R(\theta) \). I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). The maximum value of such an expression is \( R \), so in this case, the maximum of \( R(\theta) \) would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Wait, but let me confirm that. Let me recall the identity:

\( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \). Hmm, but the maximum of cosine is 1, so the maximum value is indeed \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

So, in this case, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \). So, \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( 324^2 \):

324 * 324. Let me compute that:

324 * 300 = 97,200

324 * 24 = 7,776

So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Now, 432^2:

400^2 = 160,000

32^2 = 1,024

Cross term: 2*400*32 = 25,600

So, 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

So, \( a^2 + b^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \).

So, \( R = \sqrt{291,600} \).

What's the square root of 291,600? Let me see. 500^2 is 250,000, 600^2 is 360,000. So, looking for a number between 500 and 600.

Let me try 540^2: 540*540= (500+40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. Perfect!

So, \( R = 540 \). Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sign. Because my expression was \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). So when I write it as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), the maximum is R. Because cosine is between -1 and 1, so the maximum is R.

Hence, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check the calculations again.

Compute R: sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). As above, 324^2 is 104,976; 432^2 is 186,624. Sum is 291,600, sqrt is 540. Correct.

Therefore, the maximum possible real part is 540.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a chance that I made a mistake in expanding the terms?

Let me recheck the expansion:

Original expression after substitution:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Expanding the first term:

300e^{iθ} + 468i e^{iθ} = 300(cosθ + isinθ) + 468i (cosθ + isinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i -468 sinθ

Similarly, expanding the second term:

24 e^{-iθ} + 36i e^{-iθ} = 24(cosθ - i sinθ) + 36i (cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ
=24 cosθ +36 sinθ + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)i

So, when adding the real parts from both terms:

From first term: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ

From second term: 24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Sum: (300 +24)cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ

Yes, that seems correct.

So, my R(θ) is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Thus, the maximum is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) = 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


The largest possible real part is achieved when the expression is maximized, which occurs when the angle \( \theta \) is chosen such that the real part is maximized. Using the identity for the maximum of a sinusoidal function, the maximum real part is \( \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \).

\boxed{540}
