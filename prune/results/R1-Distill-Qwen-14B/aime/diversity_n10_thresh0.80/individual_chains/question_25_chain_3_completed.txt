Okay, so I have this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. I need to find out how many residents own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's list out the numbers I have:

- Total residents: 900
- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people.

Wait, so every resident has at least a candy heart. That might be important. Now, some residents own exactly two of these things, and some own exactly three. The numbers are 437 owning exactly two, and 234 owning exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

I remember something about using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for problems like this. But since some people own exactly two or three things, maybe I can set up some equations.

Let me define some variables:

Let A be the set of diamond ring owners.

B be the set of golf clubs owners.

C be the set of garden spade owners.

D be the set of candy heart owners.

But since everyone owns D, which is the candy hearts, the total number of people is the same as the union of A, B, C, and D. Wait, but D is 900, so the union is 900, which is the total number of residents.

Wait no, actually, all residents own D, so the other sets (A, B, C) are subsets of D. So the total number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is the union, which is less than or equal to 900, but since everyone owns D, the total union is 900. That might not be the right way to think about it.

Wait, no, the union of A, B, C, and D is 900 because everyone owns D. So the union is 900. But I'm trying to find the number of people who own all four, which is the intersection of A, B, C, D.

Wait, but since D is everyone, the intersection is just the intersection of A, B, C.

So the question is to find |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but maybe since D is universal, we can think in terms of three sets.

Wait, but in this case, all four items are being considered, but since D is owned by everyone, maybe the counts for exactly two and exactly three things include D.

Hmm, maybe I need to model this using the inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but let me see.

Wait, the problem says that each resident owns at least a candy heart, so D is universal. So, the number of people owning exactly two things could include D, meaning they own two things, one of which is D, but the problem statement says "exactly two of these things." Wait, but the four things include D.

Wait, the problem says: 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, when it counts exactly two, those two can include candy hearts.

Hmm, okay, so this is a four-set problem, but with D being universal. So, the way to model this is using inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but D is the entire population.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as three sets (A, B, C) with D being the universal set. So, the total number of people is 900.

Let me think about the formula for the union of three sets (A, B, C). The formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But since everyone owns D, which is the same as the universal set, the union |A ∪ B ∪ C| is equal to 900 because every resident owns at least D, so the ones not owning A, B, or C would still be in D. Wait no, that's not correct.

Wait, no. Because the residents can own things other than A, B, or C, but since they all have D, the union of A, B, and C is the same as the number of people owning at least one of A, B, or C, which is 900 minus those who don't own any of A, B, or C. But since D is universal, the people who don't own any of A, B, or C would still be owning D, so the union |A ∪ B ∪ C| is 900 minus the number of people who don't own A, B, or C, but own D only.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't give me the number of people who own exactly one thing, but it gives the number who own exactly two and exactly three. Maybe I should approach this by considering all possible overlaps.

Let me think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle, but considering the counts of exactly two and exactly three.

In inclusion-exclusion, the formula counts all the overlaps, but in our case, we know how many are in exactly two and exactly three.

Another approach is to use the formula that relates the counts of exactly k sets.

Let me denote:

- a: number of people owning exactly one item (but since D is universal, if someone owns exactly one, it has to be D, but the problem doesn't mention the number of people owning exactly one. Hmm, maybe this approach complicates things.)

Alternatively, I can model it using the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of people who own exactly two of the four items.

- Let y be the number of people who own exactly three.

- Let z be the number of people who own all four.

Given in the problem:

x = 437

y = 234

We need to find z.

Also, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, exactly four, and those owning none. Since everyone owns D, the number of people owning none of A, B, or C is equal to the number of people owning only D. So, the total is:

Number owning exactly one (only D) + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four = 900.

Wait, but we don't know the number of people owning exactly one. Let me denote:

Let s be the number of people who own exactly one item, which would only be D, because everyone owns D. So, s is the number of people who own only D.

Then, the total is s + x + y + z = 900.

But we don't know s. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the counts of people in A, B, C can be expressed in terms of s, x, y, z.

Wait, let's consider each set.

For example, the number of people in A is those who own exactly A and nothing else (but since D is universal, they must own D as well). Wait, no, because if someone owns exactly A, they have A and D, but not B or C. Similarly, someone owning exactly two could be A and B, A and C, A and D, B and C, B and D, C and D. But wait, in the problem statement, when it says "exactly two of these things," does that exclude D? Or include D?

Wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, when it says 437 own exactly two of these things, it's referring to the four things, including D.

So, someone owning exactly two of the four things could be owning any two, including D. Similarly, someone owning exactly three would own any three, including D. And z is the number owning all four, which includes D.

So, in terms of variables:

s = number of people owning exactly one thing: which can only be D, because they are the only ones who don't own any of A, B, or C.

x = number of people owning exactly two things.

y = number of people owning exactly three things.

z = number of people owning all four things.

So, s + x + y + z = 900.

But we don't know s yet.

Now, let's think about the counts for each individual set.

The number of people in A is equal to the number of people owning exactly A and another thing (could be two or three or four, but including A).

Wait, but to compute |A|, it would be the sum of:

- people owning exactly A and nothing else (but since D is required, they must own A and D only).

Wait, but earlier, I thought s is the number of people owning exactly D only. So, if someone owns exactly A and D, that's part of the exactly two category.

Wait, let me clarify.

Each resident owns at least D, so all counts for A, B, C include D.

So, when someone owns exactly A and D, that's exactly two things: A and D.

Similarly, someone owning exactly A, B, and D is exactly three things.

And someone owning all four is z.

So, the count for A (which is 195) is equal to:

Number of people owning exactly A and D (which is part of x, exactly two) +

Number of people owning exactly A, B, and D (part of y, exactly three) +

Number of people owning exactly A, C, and D (part of y) +

Number of people owning all four (z).

So, |A| = a + b + c + z, where a, b, c are the numbers of people owning exactly A and D, exactly A, B, D; exactly A, C, D respectively. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables.

But maybe an alternative approach is to express |A| as:

|A| = number of people owning exactly A and D (which is x1) +

number of people owning exactly A, B, D (x2) +

number of people owning exactly A, C, D (x3) +

number of people owning all four (z).

Similarly, the same applies for |B| and |C|.

But this might get complicated because we have multiple variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion formula, but relate it to the counts of exactly k things.

Wait, I remember that the sum of all the individual set sizes can be expressed in terms of the counts of exactly one, two, three, etc.

Wait, more precisely:

The sum of the sizes of each set (|A| + |B| + |C| + |D|) is equal to:

s (exactly one) * 1 + x * 2 + y * 3 + z * 4.

But since D is universal, |D| = 900.

So, |A| + |B| + |C| + 900 = s*1 + x*2 + y*3 + z*4.

Let me compute that.

Given:

|A| = 195, |B| = 367, |C| = 562, |D| = 900.

So, sum of |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let's calculate:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

So, 2024 = s*1 + x*2 + y*3 + z*4.

We know that x = 437, y = 234.

So, substituting:

2024 = s*1 + 437*2 + 234*3 + z*4.

Calculate 437 * 2 = 874.

234 *3 = 702.

So,

2024 = s + 874 + 702 + 4z.

Adding 874 and 702: 874 + 702 = 1576.

So,

2024 = s + 1576 + 4z.

Subtract 1576 from both sides:

2024 - 1576 = s + 4z.

2024 - 1576: Let's compute.

2024 - 1500 = 524.

524 - 76 = 448.

So, 448 = s + 4z.

So, equation 1: s + 4z = 448.

Now, we also have the total number of people: s + x + y + z = 900.

Substituting x=437, y=234:

s + 437 + 234 + z = 900.

Adding 437 and 234: 671.

So,

s + z = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, equation 2: s + z = 229.

Now, we have two equations:

1) s + 4z = 448

2) s + z = 229

We can subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(s +4z) - (s + z) = 448 - 229

Which gives: 3z = 219.

So, z = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, the number of people who own all four things is 73.

Wait, let me verify that.

If z=73, then from equation 2: s = 229 - 73 = 156.

So, s=156, z=73.

Now, check equation 1: 156 + 4*73 = 156 + 292 = 448. Correct.

And the total number of people: s + x + y + z = 156 + 437 + 234 +73.

Let's add them: 156 +437 = 593; 593 +234=827; 827+73=900. Correct.

So, the calculations seem consistent.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given counts of residents owning exactly two and three items. 

Let:
- \( s \) be the number of residents owning exactly one item (only D).
- \( x = 437 \) be the number of residents owning exactly two items.
- \( y = 234 \) be the number of residents owning exactly three items.
- \( z \) be the number of residents owning all four items.

From the total number of residents:
\[
s + x + y + z = 900
\]
\[
s + 437 + 234 + z = 900
\]
\[
s + z = 229 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

From the sum of the sizes of each set:
\[
|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024
\]
\[
s + 2x + 3y + 4z = 2024
\]
Substituting \( x = 437 \) and \( y = 234 \):
\[
s + 2(437) + 3(234) + 4z = 2024
\]
\[
s + 874 + 702 + 4z = 2024
\]
\[
s + 4z = 448 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
\[
(s + 4z) - (s + z) = 448 - 229
\]
\[
3z = 219
\]
\[
z = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
