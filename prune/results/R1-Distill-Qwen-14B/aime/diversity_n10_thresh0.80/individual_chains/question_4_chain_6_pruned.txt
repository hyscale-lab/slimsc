Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these types of games often involve determining winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

In this case, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn. So, from any position n, the next player can move to n-1 or n-4, assuming n is greater than or equal to those numbers.

I think the key is to find all the losing positions for Alice, which would mean Bob can win. So, if Alice starts at a losing position, no matter what she does, Bob can always respond in a way that forces Alice into another losing position, eventually leading her to lose.

Let me try to model this. Let's define a function W(n) which is true if the current player can force a win from position n, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- If n = 0, the game is already over, so the current player can't make a move and thus loses. So W(0) = false.
- If n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = true.
- If n = 4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4) = true.

Wait, but for n=2, the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but n=2 is less than 4, so that's not possible. So for n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So W(2)=false because no matter what the current player does, they lose.

Similarly, for n=3, the current player can take 1, leaving 2 for the opponent, which is a losing position for them. So W(3)=true because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position.

Wait, maybe I should structure this as a recurrence relation. The idea is that a position n is a winning position (W(n)=true) if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false. Because the current player can choose to move to either n-1 or n-4, and if either of those is a losing position for the opponent, then the current player can win by choosing that move.

So the recurrence is:
W(n) = (not W(n-1)) or (not W(n-4)) if n >=4
And for n <4, we have to handle the base cases.

Wait, let me double-check that. If from position n, the current player can move to positions n-1 or n-4. If either of those positions is a losing position for the opponent, then the current player can choose that move and win. So yes, W(n) is true if
