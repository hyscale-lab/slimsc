Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24, so:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

So now, a = log₂(x) = -7/24,
b = log₂(y) = -3/8,
c = log₂(z) = -5/12.

Double-checking these values with the equations:

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Substitute a, b, c:
-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12
Convert all to 24 denominator:
7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 - 9 + 10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Substitute:
-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 - 5/12
Convert to 24:
7/24 + 9/24 - 10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Correct.

Good, so the values are consistent.

Now, the question is to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

First, let's compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) using logarithm properties:

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²)
= 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z
= 4a + 3b + 2c.

We have a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.

Let me compute each term:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6.

3b = 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8.

2c = 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6.

So adding them together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, let's combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.

So now, total is -2 -9/8.

Convert  -2 to eighths: -16/8.

So, -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8.

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8.

The absolute value of this is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, m =25, n=8. They are coprime, since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.


The given system of equations involves logarithms, which can be converted into linear equations by letting \( a = \log_2(x) \), \( b = \log_2(y) \), and \( c = \log_2(z) \). This results in the following system:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \frac{1}{2} \\
-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3} \\
-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Solving this system, we find \( a = -\frac{7}{24} \), \( b = -\frac{3}{8} \), and \( c = -\frac{5}{12} \).

Next, we compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \( \left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8} \). Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to \( m + n = 33 \).

\boxed{33}
