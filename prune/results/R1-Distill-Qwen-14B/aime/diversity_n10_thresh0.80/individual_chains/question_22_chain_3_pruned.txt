Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All opposite sides are parallel, and when you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral, all sides are equal in length, and each internal angle is less than 180 degrees. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which makes me think of a hexagon that's similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF must be related to the hexagon somehow. Maybe this triangle is the "outer" triangle that bounds the hexagon? I'm not sure, but perhaps I can use similar triangles or some proportion.

Wait, in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of its sides might form a larger triangle outside the hexagon. Maybe the sides of this triangle are related to the side lengths of the hexagon and some scaling factors.

Let me try to recall if there's a formula or theorem related to such hexagons. I remember something about equilateral hexagons with opposite sides parallel being related to affine transformations of regular hexagons. Or maybe similar triangles are involved here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the hexagon as being part of a larger triangle, and the sides of the hexagon are proportionally related to the sides of this larger triangle.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's'. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let's denote these as the sides opposite to the vertices A, C, and E respectively? Or maybe not necessarily opposite, but just the triangle formed by these three extensions.

Wait, perhaps I can imagine the hexagon ABCDEF inscribed within this larger triangle, with each pair of opposite sides contributing to the sides of the triangle.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is what's called a "zonogon." In a zonogon, each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel. For a hexagon, this means it's a centrally symmetric figure.

In such cases, the hexagon can be thought
