Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, thinking about game theory problems, I remember that these often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

In this problem, Alice goes first, so if the starting position is a losing position, then Bob can win. So we need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote that a position is a losing position if all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if there's at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Let's start by looking at small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here; this is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is forced to take that last token and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, Bob can take it and win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice has only one move: take 1 token. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. Wait, so in n=2, Bob can win? Wait, but Alice is going first.

Wait, let me re-examine. When n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob's turn, he takes 1 and wins. So in this case, Alice has no good moves; she can't prevent Bob from winning. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice. Let me continue.

n=3: Alice
