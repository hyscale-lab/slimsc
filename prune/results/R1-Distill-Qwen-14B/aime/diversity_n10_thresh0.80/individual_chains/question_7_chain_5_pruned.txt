Okay, so I have this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, which is 1/2 for each color. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. I need to figure out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's some rotation mapping blue vertices to red ones. The total number of possible colorings is 2^8 since each of the 8 vertices can be red or blue independently. So the total number is 256.

Now, the problem is about the existence of a rotation that transforms blue vertices to red ones. So, essentially, after rotation, the set of blue vertices should coincide with the set of red vertices. That implies that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but in a regular octagon, rotations correspond to symmetries. So, perhaps I need to consider the symmetries of the octagon and how colorings can be related under these symmetries.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for a given coloring, there must exist a rotation such that applying that rotation maps every blue vertex to a red vertex. So, for each coloring, we check if such a rotation exists.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of group theory. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, so the rotation group is cyclic of order 8. So, the group elements are rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which are the 8 possible rotations.

Given a coloring, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotation image) of the set of red vertices. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

But in a regular octagon, the rotation of the set of red vertices by some angle would result in the set of blue vertices. So, the number of such colorings is the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation image of the red set.

Wait,
