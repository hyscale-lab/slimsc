Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

It says: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm. So, both logs are equal to 10, which is a key point. Let me write down the equations step by step.

First, log_x(y^x) = 10. Using logarithm properties, log_x(a^b) is equal to b * log_x(a). So, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Again, applying the logarithm power rule, this is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Maybe I can denote log_y(x) as some variable to make it easier.

Let me set log_y(x) = k. Then, log_x(y) would be 1/k.

Substituting into equation 1: x * (1/k) = 10. So, x = 10k.

For equation 2: 4y * k = 10. So, y = (10)/(4k) = (5)/(2k).

Now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. So, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k).

But I also know that log_y(x) = k. Let's write that out.

log_y(x) = k. Since x = 10k and y = 5/(2k), substitute these into the equation.

log_{5/(2k)}(10k) = k.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express this logarithm in terms of natural logs or common logs to make it easier.

Using the change of base formula: log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). So,

ln(10k) / ln(5/(2k)) = k.

Let me write that out:

ln(10k) = k * ln(5/(2k)).

Expanding the right side: k * [ln(5) - ln(2k)].

So, ln(10k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2k).

Let me expand ln(10k) as ln(10) + ln(k).

Similarly, ln(2k) is ln(2) + ln(k).

So, substituting back in:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k [ln(2) + ln(k)].

Let me distribute the k on the right side:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k).

Now, let's collect like terms. Bring all terms to the left side:

ln(10) + ln(k) - k ln(5) + k ln(2) + k ln(k) = 0.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out terms.

Let me group the terms with k:

k [ln(k) + ln(2) - ln(5)] + ln(10) + ln(k) = 0.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me factor terms with ln(k).

So, ln(k) (1 + k) + [ln(10) + k ln(2) - k ln(5)] = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can rewrite this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = k. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to substitute u = k. Let me try that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps instead of introducing k, I could have set variables differently. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can express x and y in terms of each other.

From earlier, I have x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). So, x = 10k and y = 5/(2k).

So, if I multiply x and y, I get x*y = (10k)*(5/(2k)) = (10*5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 *1 =25.

Wait, that's interesting. So, xy=25. Is that correct?

Wait, let me double-check. So, x=10k, y=5/(2k). So, x*y = 10k * 5/(2k) = (10 *5)/(2) * (k/k) = 50/2 *1= 25.

Yes, that's right. So, regardless of the value of k, the product xy is 25.

Wait, but I thought I needed to solve for k first. But maybe I don't have to because the product is already determined as 25.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify if this is correct.

So, according to this, regardless of the value of k, xy is 25. So, maybe the answer is 25.

But I should confirm if that's indeed the case. Because I derived this without considering the equation ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2k). So, is there a possibility that xy might not be 25?

Wait, but in the initial substitution, we found expressions for x and y in terms of k. Then, their product became 25, independent of k. So, as long as such a k exists, then xy is 25.

So, perhaps the answer is 25. But I need to make sure that such a k exists, i.e., that the equation I derived has a solution.

Wait, let me go back to the equation:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2k).

Wait, let me compute the right-hand side again.

k ln(5) - k ln(2k) = k ln(5) - k [ln(2) + ln(k)] = k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k).

So the equation is:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2) - k ln(k).

Let me rearrange terms:

ln(10) + ln(k) + k ln(k) + k ln(2) - k ln(5) = 0.

Hmm. Let me write this as:

k [ ln(k) + ln(2) - ln(5) ] + ln(10) + ln(k) = 0.

Alternatively, k [ ln(k) + ln(2/5) ] + ln(10) + ln(k) = 0.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation in k, which might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. But maybe I can check if k=2 is a solution, for example.

Let me try k=2.

Then, let's compute each term.

Left side: ln(10) + ln(2) + 2*(ln(2) + ln(2/5)).

Wait, no. Wait, let me substitute k=2 into the equation.

Wait, the equation is:

ln(10) + ln(k) = k ln(5) - k ln(2k).

So, substitute k=2:

Left side: ln(10) + ln(2) ≈ 2.302585 + 0.693147 ≈ 3.0 (approximate).

Right side: 2 ln(5) - 2 ln(4) ≈ 2*(1.6094) - 2*(1.386294) ≈ 3.2188 - 2.772588 ≈ 0.446.

So, left side is about 3.0, right side is about 0.446. Not equal.

Hmm, so k=2 isn't a solution.

Let me try k=1.

Left side: ln(10) + ln(1) = ln(10) + 0 ≈ 2.302585.

Right side: 1*ln(5) -1*ln(2*1) = ln(5) - ln(2) ≈ 1.6094 - 0.6931 ≈ 0.9163.

Still not equal. So, left side is 2.3 and right side is 0.916.

So, 2.3 > 0.916.

What about k=0.5.

Left side: ln(10) + ln(0.5) ≈ 2.302585 - 0.6931 ≈ 1.6095.

Right side: 0.5 ln(5) - 0.5 ln(1) = 0.5*(1.6094) -0 = 0.8047.

So, left side is about 1.6095, right side is 0.8047. Still, left > right.

Hmm. Maybe try k=0.25.

Left side: ln(10) + ln(0.25) ≈ 2.302585 -1.386294 ≈ 0.9162.

Right side: 0.25 ln(5) - 0.25 ln(0.5) ≈ 0.25*(1.6094) - 0.25*(-0.6931) ≈ 0.40235 + 0.173275≈ 0.5756.

Left side is 0.9162, right side is 0.5756. Still left > right.

Hmm. Maybe trying k=0.1.

Left side: ln(10) + ln(0.1) ≈ 2.302585 -2.302585=0.

Right side: 0.1 ln(5) -0.1 ln(0.2) ≈ 0.1*(1.6094) -0.1*(-1.6094) ≈ 0.16094 + 0.16094 ≈ 0.3219.

Left=0, Right=0.3219. So, left < right.

So, at k=0.1, left is 0, right is 0.3219.

At k=0.25, left is 0.9162, right is 0.5756.

So, the function crosses from left < right to left > right somewhere between k=0.1 and k=0.25.

So, there must be a solution in that interval. Therefore, such a k exists, which would make the equation valid, and thus, the product xy is 25.

Wait, but I thought maybe I was getting ahead of myself by saying that xy=25 without considering the equation. But it seems that such a k does exist, so xy must be 25.

Alternatively, another approach: Let me recall that x = 10k and y = 5/(2k). So, I can express y in terms of x.

From x=10k, so k= x/10.

Then, y=5/(2*(x/10))=5/(x/5)=25/x.

So, y=25/x. Therefore, xy=25. So, regardless of the value of k, the product is 25.

So, that's why I didn't need to solve for k. The product is directly 25.

But then, why did we get that equation with k? Because we have to make sure that such a k exists so that all the conditions are satisfied. But since x and y are greater than 1, and k is log_y(x), which is a positive real number, and k exists as shown by the intermediate value theorem in the earlier analysis, the product xy is indeed 25.

So, the answer is 25.


Given the problem, we start by translating the logarithmic equations into algebraic form. 

1. The first equation is \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Using the logarithm power rule, this simplifies to \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\), which further simplifies to \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\).

2. The second equation is \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, applying the logarithm power rule, this becomes \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\), which simplifies to \(\log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} = \frac{5}{2y}\).

Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_a(b) = \frac{1}{\log_b(a)}\). Let \(\log_y(x) = k\). Then, \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{k}\).

Substituting these into the equations:
1. \(x \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \implies x = 10k\).
2. \(4y \cdot k = 10 \implies y = \frac{5}{2k}\).

Now, we multiply \(x\) and \(y\):
\[
xy = (10k) \left(\frac{5}{2k}\right) = \frac{50}{2} = 25.
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
