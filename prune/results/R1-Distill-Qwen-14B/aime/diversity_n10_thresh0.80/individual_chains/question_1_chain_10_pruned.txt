Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. They’re all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the equations to make it clearer:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a fraction equal to a fraction. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to simplify.

Let me try that for each equation.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2

This means 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). Which is the same as:

x = 2^(1/2) * y z

Similarly, for the second equation:

log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3

That becomes:

2^(1/3) = y/(x z) => y = 2^(1/3) * x z

And the third equation:

log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

So:

2^(1/4) = z/(x y) => z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Alright, so now I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of the other two variables each time. Hmm, this seems like a system of equations that might be solvable by substitution or maybe by multiplying them together.

Let me see if I can express each variable in terms of another. Alternatively, maybe I can take the product of all three equations.

Wait, another thought: since each equation expresses one variable in terms of the others, perhaps I can substitute them into each other to find each variable.

Let me write down the three equations again:

1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z
2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z
3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Hmm. So each variable is expressed as a multiple of the product of the other two. Maybe I can substitute these into each other.

Let me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z

But from equation 2, y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So substitute that into equation 1:

x = 2^(1/2) * [2^(1/3) * x z] * z

Simplify the right side:

x = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z^2

Wait, 2^(1/2 + 1/3) is 2^(5/6). So:

x = 2^(5/6) * x * z^2

Hmm, so if I divide both sides by x (since x is positive and not zero), I get:

1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12).

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me write that down.

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, let's see if I can find x or y using this.

Let me use equation 3, which is z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Since I know z, let's substitute:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y

Let me solve for x
