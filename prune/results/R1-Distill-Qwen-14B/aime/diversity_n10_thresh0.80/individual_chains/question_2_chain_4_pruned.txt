Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to visualize it first. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis towards (1,0), and B is a bit higher up on the y-axis. I think AB connects these two points, making a line segment from A to B. 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, so P has coordinates (p, 0) for some p > 0, and Q is on the y-axis, so Q has coordinates (0, q) for some q > 0. The length of PQ is 1, so by the distance formula, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. That means p² + q² = 1. So each PQ is a segment of the first quadrant from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any segment from F except AB. So, all these segments PQ in F, except for AB itself, don't pass through C. I need to find OC², where OC is the distance from the origin to point C, and then express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's not on any other PQ from F except AB. That suggests that C is the only point on AB that's not overlapped by any other PQ segment from F.

Let me try to find the equation of line AB first. Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the slope of AB: (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3). 

Using point-slope form, the equation of AB: Let's use point A (1/2, 0). So y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). 

So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for some x between 0 and 1/2, since AB goes from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

Now, for point C to be on a segment PQ from F (other than AB), it should satisfy the equation of PQ. So, given that PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for point C = (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1. But since p² + q² = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²), but since both p and q are positive, q is positive.

Wait, but actually, for a given PQ, p and q are fixed such that p² + q² = 1. So, for each PQ, we have a specific p and q, and the equation x/p + y/q = 1.

Since the problem states that C doesn't lie on any PQ except AB, which is part of F. So, if we can find a C on AB such that when we plug x and y into x/p + y/q = 1, the only solution for p and q is when PQ is AB itself. Otherwise, for other p and q, the equation won't hold for C.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of parametrizing point C on AB and then ensuring that the equation of PQ doesn't pass through C unless it's AB.

Wait, since AB is a PQ segment with P=A and Q=B, right? Because point A is (1/2, 0), so p=1/2, and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), so q=sqrt(3)/2. Let's check p² + q²: (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2
