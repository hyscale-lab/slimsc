Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron is given with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like the tetrahedron has some symmetrical properties because opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron or something like that.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and this distance is called the inradius. To find the inradius, I think we can use the formula: inradius (r) equals 3 times the volume (V) divided by the surface area (S), right? So, r = 3V/S.

Wait, let me confirm that. For a tetrahedron, the volume can be related to the inradius and the surface area. The formula is similar to the 2D case where the area is r times the semiperimeter. In 3D, the volume is (1/3) times the inradius times the total surface area. So, V = (1/3) * r * S. Therefore, solving for r gives r = 3V/S. Yep, that seems right.

So, I need to find both the volume and the total surface area of this tetrahedron. Let's start with the surface area. The tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of which has a specific area. Since the edges are given in pairs, maybe each pair forms congruent triangles? Let's check that.

Given the edge lengths:
AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. Therefore, each face might be congruent to its opposite face. Let me see:

Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Looking at face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80)
Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89)
Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD are sqrt(80), sqrt(41), sqrt(89)
Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD are sqrt(89), sqrt(41), sqrt(80)

So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. That's helpful because it means each face has the same area, so I can compute the area of one face and multiply by four to get the total surface area.

So, let's compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). To find the area, I can use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter (s):

s = (a + b + c)/2 = [sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)] / 2.

But Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. That seems a bit messy with these square roots. Maybe there's a better way? Alternatively, since all sides are known, perhaps the triangle is right-angled?

Let me check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

a^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.

41 + 80 = 121, which is 11^2, but c^2 is 89, which is less than 121. So it's not a right triangle. Hmm, okay. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates?

Wait, perhaps the tetrahedron is orthocentric or something? Because the opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons are called isohedral or maybe isosceles. Maybe it's a disphenoid? A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is exactly the case here. And in a disphenoid, it's known that all four faces are congruent. So that's consistent with what I found earlier.

In a disphenoid, there's a formula for the volume. Let me recall. The volume of a disphenoid can be found using the formula:

V = (sqrt[(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)]) / 72.

Wait, no, maybe
