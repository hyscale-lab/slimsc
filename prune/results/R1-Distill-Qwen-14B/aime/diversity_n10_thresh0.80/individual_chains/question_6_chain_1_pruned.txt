Okay, so I have to find the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both are absolute value functions with some modifications. I think these are V-shaped graphs with possible multiple bends.

Let me sketch f(x) first. f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So the innermost part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. That would shift the V down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, ||x| - 1/2|, it reflects any negative parts back up. So where |x| - 1/2 is negative, which is between -1/2 and 1/2, the function will flip to positive. So the graph of f(x) will have a W shape, maybe? Let me think. For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2. So that's two lines with slopes 1 and -1, starting from (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). Between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a V upside down, so a peak at (0, 1/2). So yes, it's a W-shape with minima at (±1/2, 0) and a maximum at (0,1/2).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's see. The inner |x| is V at (0,0). Subtract 1/4, so |x| - 1/4. Then take absolute value again. So for |x| >=1/4, g(x) = |x| -1/4. For |x| <1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So the graph of g(x) will have a W-shape as well, similar but smaller. Minima at (±1/4, 0) and a maximum at (0,1/4).

So now, f and g are both piecewise linear functions with vertices at specific points.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me try to analyze each one.

Starting with y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)), then y = 4 g(h(x)).

Similarly, for the other equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me denote k(y) = f(cos(3πy)), then x = 4 g(k(y)).

So, first, I need to understand h(x) = f(sin(2πx)).

Let me think about sin(2πx). The function sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here 2π/(2π) = 1. So it's a sine wave that goes from 0 to 1 as x goes from 0 to 1, then repeats.

But f is applied to sin(2πx). Since f is a function that takes an input and outputs ||x| - 1/2|, which as I thought earlier is a W-shaped function.

So f(z) is defined as:
- For z >= 1/2, f(z) = z - 1/2
- For z <= -1/2, f(z) = -(z) -1/2 (since |z| is -z for negative z, so it's |z| -1/2, but then absolute again)
- For -1/2 < z < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|

Wait, no, actually, correct me. f(z) is ||z| - 1/2|. So when |z| >= 1/2, ||z| -1/2| = |z| - 1/2. When |z| <1/2, it's 1/2 - |z|. So yes, that's correct.

So f(z) has a maximum at z=0 of 1/2, and minima at z=±1/2, where f(z)=0.

Now, sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1. So when we compute f(sin(2πx)), we're taking the sin value, which is between -1 and 1, and applying f to it.

So let's see:

For sin(2πx) in [-1, -1/2], f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | = | (-sin(2πx)) - 1/2 | = | -sin(2πx) - 1/2 |.

Wait, maybe it's easier to break it down:

Since sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1,

- When sin(2πx) >= 1/2, then f(sin(2πx)) = sin(2πx) - 1/2.

- When sin(2πx) <= -1/2, then f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | = | -sin(2πx) - 1/2 | = same as above, since absolute value.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute f(z) for z = sin(2πx):

f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. So regardless of z's sign, we first take absolute value, then subtract 1/2, then take absolute value again.

So for z in [0,1], |z| is z. So f(z) becomes |z - 1/2|. So for z >= 1/2, f(z) = z -1/2. For z <1/2, f(z)=1/2 -z.

Similarly, for z in [-1,0], |z| is -z. So f(z) = | -z -1/2 | = | - (z +1/2) | = |z + 1/2|. So for z >= -1/2, |z +1/2|. So for z >= -1/2, f(z) = z +1/2. For z < -1/2, |z +1/2| = -z -1/2.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify:

Wait, f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. So for any z, |z| is non-negative. Then subtract 1/2, then take absolute value again.

So if |z| >= 1/2, f(z) = |z| -1/2.

If |z| <1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

So for sin(2πx), which ranges from -1 to 1:

- When sin(2πx) is in [-1, -1/2], |sin(2πx)| is in [1/2, 1], so f(z) = |z| -1/2, which is (-sin(2πx)) - 1/2.

Wait, no, wait. Because z is sin(2πx), which is negative here. So |z| = -z. So f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 | = | (-z) - 1/2 | = | - (z + 1/2) | = |z +1/2|.

Wait, that seems more accurate. So for z in [-1, -1/2], f(z) = |z +1/2|.

Similarly, for z in [1/2, 1], f(z) = |z -1/2|.

For z in (-1/2, 1/2), f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute f(z) in each interval.

So let's split into intervals based on the value of z = sin(2πx):

1. z >= 1/2: f(z) = z - 1/2.

2. z <= -1/2: f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 | = | (-z) -1/2 | = | - (z + 1/2) | = |z +1/2|.

3. -1/2 < z < 1/2: f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

So, for z in [1/2,1], f(z) increases from 0 to 1/2.

For z in [-1, -1/2], f(z) is |z +1/2|, which decreases from 1/2 to 0 as z goes from -1/2 to -1.

Wait, wait, actually:

Wait, when z is in [-1, -1/2], |z| is between 1/2 and 1. So f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 | = | (-z) -1/2 |. Let me compute f(z):

For z in [-1, -1/2], which is negative z, say z = -a where a is between 1/2 and 1.

Then |z| = a. So f(z) = |a - 1/2| = a -1/2 because a >=1/2. So f(z) = a -1/2 = (-z) - 1/2. So for z in [-1, -1/2], f(z) = (-z) -1/2.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me check with specific numbers.

Take z = -1/2: f(z) = ||-1/2| -1/2| = |1/2 -1/2| = 0.

Take z = -1: f(z) = ||-1| -1/2| = |1 -1/2| = 1/2.

So for z in [-1, -1/2], f(z) = | |z| -1/2 | = | (-z) -1/2 | = | - (z + 1/2) | = |z +1/2|.

Wait, but when z = -1, that's |-1 + 1/2| = | -1/2 | = 1/2. Correct.

When z = -3/4, | (-3/4) + 1/2 | = | -1/4 | = 1/4. But also, f(z) is ||z| -1/2| = |3/4 - 1/2| = 1/4. Correct.

So for z in [-1, -1/2], f(z) = |z +1/2|, which is a linear function increasing from 1/2 (at z=-1) to 0 (at z= -1/2).

Wait, no. Wait, as z increases from -1 to -1/2, |z +1/2| decreases from 1/2 to 0.

Wait, |z +1/2| is equal to (z +1/2) when z >= -1/2, but for z < -1/2, it's -(z +1/2). So for z in [-1, -1/2], |z +1/2| = -z -1/2.

So f(z) = -z -1/2 for z in [-1, -1/2].

Similarly, for z in [1/2,1], f(z) = z -1/2.

So that's the function h(x) = f(sin(2πx)).

Now, h(x) is a function that takes sin(2πx), which is periodic with period 1, and applies f to it. So h(x) will have a period of 1 as well.

Similarly, for each x, h(x) is determined based on sin(2πx).

Now, let's think about the range of h(x):

Since sin(2πx) ranges from -1 to 1, and h(x) is f(sin(2πx)), which we have:

- For z in [1/2,1], h(x) = z -1/2, so ranges from 0 to 1/2.

- For z in [-1,-1/2], h(x) = -z -1/2, which ranges from 1/2 to 0 as z goes from -1 to -1/2.

- For z in (-1/2,1/2), h(x) = 1/2 - |z|, so ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So overall, h(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, for z in [-1,-1/2], h(x) is equal to -z -1/2, which when z = -1, h(x) is -(-1) -1/2 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When z = -1/2, h(x) is -(-1/2) -1/2 = 1/2 -1/2 =0. So for z in [-1, -1/2], h(x) goes from 1/2 down to 0.

Similarly, for z in [1/2,1], h(x) goes from 0 up to 1/2.

And for z in (-1/2,1/2), h(x) = 1/2 - |z|, which goes from 0 (at z=±1/2) up to 1/2 (at z=0).

So overall, h(x) ranges between 0 and 1/2. So h(x) is always in [0, 1/2].

Thus, h(x) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2 as x varies.

Now, moving on to y =4 g(h(x)). Since h(x) ranges in [0,1/2], let's see what g does to h(x).

g is defined as ||x| -1/4|. So for input w in [0,1/2], let's compute g(w):

If w >= 1/4, then g(w) = |w -1/4| = w -1/4 (since w is non-negative).

If w <1/4, then g(w) = |1/4 - w| = 1/4 -w.

So, g(w) is a V-shaped function on [0,1/2], with a minimum at w=1/4, where g(w)=0, and peaks at w=0 and w=1/2, where g(w)=1/4.

Wait no: Wait, when w=0, g(w)= |0 -1/4|=1/4.

When w=1/4, g(w)=0.

When w=1/2, g(w)= |1/2 -1/4|=1/4.

So yes, g(w) on [0,1/2] is a V that goes down to 0 at w=1/4, then up again at both ends.

So when we compute g(h(x)), since h(x) is in [0,1/2], g(h(x)) will be:

- For h(x) in [0,1/4], g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x).

- For h(x) in [1/4,1/2], g(h(x)) = h(x) -1/4.

Thus, g(h(x)) is a function that starts at 1/4 when h(x)=0, decreases linearly to 0 at h(x)=1/4, then increases back to 1/4 at h(x)=1/2.

So y =4 g(h(x)) will scale this by 4. So the maximum value will be 4*(1/4)=1, and the minimum is 0.

So y ranges between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the other equation, x =4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me denote this as x = 4 g(k(y)), where k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

So first, let's compute k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

Again, cos(3πy) ranges between -1 and 1.

So, let's see:

For cos(3πy) in [1/2,1], k(y) = f(z)= z -1/2.

For cos(3πy) in [-1, -1/2], k(y) = | |z| -1/2 | = | (-z) -1/2 | = same as earlier.

Wait,
