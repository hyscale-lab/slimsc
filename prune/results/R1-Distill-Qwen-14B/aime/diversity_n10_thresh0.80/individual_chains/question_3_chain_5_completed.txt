Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B). In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize.

So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize (if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize), P(A and B) is just P(A). So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, let me break down what P(A) and P(B) are.

P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen picks 4 numbers, and 4 are drawn from 10, this is the probability of a specific 4-number combination being chosen. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for P(A) is 1, because only the exact set Jen picked will result in her winning the grand prize. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. So, she can win 2, 3, or 4 numbers. So, we need to compute the probability that exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability that fewer than 2 numbers are chosen. That is, 1 - P(0 or 1 number chosen). But since we need to compute P(B) directly, maybe it's better to compute the sum of probabilities for 2,3,4.

But wait, sometimes it's easier to compute 1 - P(not B). Let me think.

In any case, I need to compute the total number of possible ways where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of combinations where exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, the number of favorable outcomes for B is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Wait, why?

Because, for exactly k numbers chosen from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) from the other 6 numbers not chosen by Jen.

So, for exactly 2: C(4,2) ways to choose 2 from Jen's numbers, and C(6,2) ways to choose the other 2 from the remaining 6 numbers.

Similarly, for exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1), and for exactly 4: C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term.

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15. So, 6*15 = 90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 +24 +1 = 115.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115. The total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4)=210.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yeah, that's correct.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems low. Is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So when you divide, the 210s cancel, and you get 1/115.

Wait, but let me think again. Because if I'm being given that she won a prize (i.e., at least two numbers), what's the probability that all four were chosen.

So, in the conditional probability space where at least two numbers are chosen, the probability that all four were chosen is just the number of ways to choose all four divided by the total number of ways with at least two.

Which is 1 / 115. So, 1/115.

Hmm, 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115. So m + n is 116.

Wait, but I should double-check my initial calculations.

Wait, another approach: in the conditional probability, the sample space is restricted to cases where at least two numbers are chosen. So, the total number of possible cases is 115, as calculated.

Within this, the number of favorable cases for the grand prize is just 1, since only her exact set of four would result in the grand prize.

So, the probability is 1 / 115, which simplifies to 1/115, so m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, just to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of P(B). Let me recast it.

Alternative way: compute P(B) as 1 - P(0 or 1 numbers chosen).

So, P(B) = 1 - [C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Compute that:

C(4,0) = 1, C(6,4) = 15. So, 1*15=15.

C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So, 4*20=80.

Total of 15 +80=95.

So, P(not B) = 95 / 210.

Thus, P(B) = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210, which matches the earlier result.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115, meaning m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, let me think of another way.

We can think of the problem as follows: given that at least two of Jen's numbers are in the winning set, what's the probability that all four are in the winning set.

So, imagine all possible 4-number combinations, and we're restricting to the ones that have at least two of Jen's numbers.

The ratio of the number of such combinations that have all four of her numbers to the total number in this restricted set is our probability.

Which is 1 / 115, because there's only one combination (her exact set) that has all four, and the total number of combinations with at least two is 115.

So, yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.


The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize in a lottery. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 9, 10\} \), and 4 numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are chosen, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen.

To find the probability \( P(A|B) \), where \( A \) is winning the grand prize and \( B \) is winning a prize, we use the formula:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**
   - The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen.
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome for \( A \) (Jen's exact set of numbers).
   - Thus, \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**
   - The probability of winning a prize is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen.
   - This can be calculated as \( 1 - P(\text{0 or 1 number chosen}) \).
   - The number of ways to choose 0 numbers from Jen's 4 and 4 from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{4}{0} \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).
   - The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 80 \).
   - Total ways for 0 or 1 number chosen: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \).
   - Thus, \( P(B) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} \).

3. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \):**
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]
   - The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
