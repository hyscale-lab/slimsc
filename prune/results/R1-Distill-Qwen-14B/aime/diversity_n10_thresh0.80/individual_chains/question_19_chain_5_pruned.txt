Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay.

Let me start by recalling some properties. The circumradius R is given as 13, so R = 13. The inradius r is 6. The triangle has an incenter I and a circumcenter O. IA is perpendicular to OI, which is an interesting condition. I need to figure out how this helps me find AB·AC.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me imagine triangle ABC with O somewhere outside or inside? Wait, the circumradius is 13, which is a bit large, but without knowing the sides, it's hard to say. The inradius is 6, so that's a bit smaller. Hmm.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Wait, let me check that again. Yes, I think that's correct: OI² = R(R - 2r). So plugging in the given values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13-12) = 13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13). Okay, that's useful.

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So in the triangle, if I is the incenter, and OI is a segment from the inradius to the circumradius, and IA is perpendicular to that. Hmm, maybe I can use coordinates to model this.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and OI is a vector from I to O. Let me denote O as (a, b). Then, IA is a vector from I to A, which is some point (x, y). The condition is that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from I to O, so (a, b). So the dot product of IA and OI should be zero.

So, IA vector is (x, y), and OI vector is (
