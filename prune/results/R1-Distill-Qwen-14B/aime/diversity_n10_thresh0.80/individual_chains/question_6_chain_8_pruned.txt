Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand the functions f and g. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations.

Let me write down what f(x) and g(x) are:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

I can visualize f(x) as taking the absolute value of x, subtracting 1/2, and then taking the absolute value again. Similarly for g(x), subtracting 1/4 instead. These functions will create V-shaped graphs with possible reflections and shifts.

Maybe I should sketch or think about the shapes of f(x) and g(x) to get a better idea.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:

- When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, the inner expression |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape opening upwards with vertex at |x|=1/2.
- When |x| is less than 1/2, the inner expression becomes negative, so f(x) = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a V-shape opening downwards with vertex at |x|=1/2.
So, f(x) has a W-like shape with vertices at x = ±1/2 and forms a 'W' centered at x=0.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:

- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4, which is a V-shape upwards.
- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|, which is a V-shape downwards.
So, g(x) has a similar W-shape but with vertices at |x|=1/4.

Now, the functions we're dealing with are compositions of these functions with sin and cos.

First, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))):

Let me parse this step by step.

Starting with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π/(2π) = 1. So, sin(2πx) has a period of 1, oscillating between -1 and 1.

Then, f is applied to this: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | is f(sin(2πx)). Let me think about the range of f(sin(2πx)).

The input to f is between 0 and 1. So, when |x| (which is |sin(2πx)| here) is 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When |x|=1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. In between, at |x|=1/2, f(1/2) = 0. So, the graph of f(sin(2πx)) will have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1/2. Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then, g is applied to this result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

Since f(sin(2πx)) is between 0 and 1/2, |f(sin(2πx))| is the same as f(sin(2πx)), so we're looking at |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

Let me find the range of g(f(sin(2πx))).

Since f(sin(2πx)) is in [0, 1/2], let me consider the expression inside the absolute value:

Case 1: When f(sin(2πx)) >= 1/4. Then, the expression becomes f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4.

Case 2: When f(sin(2πx)) < 1/4. Then, the expression becomes 1/4 - f(sin(2πx)).

So, the minimum of g(f(...)) is 0, which occurs when f(...) is 1/4. The maximum would be when f(...) is 0 or 1/2, which would be 1/4 or 1/4 respectively. Wait: if f(...) is 0, then |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. If f(...) is 1/2, |1/2 -1/4|=1/4. So, actually, the output of g(f(...)) can't exceed 1/4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for f(...) in [0, 1/2], the expression inside the absolute value is f(...) -1/4. The maximum distance from 1/4 will be either when f(...) is 0 (distance 1/4) or when f(...) is 1/2 (distance 1/4). So, the output of g(f(...)) is between 0 and 1/4.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2, then when f(...) is 1/4, the expression is 0. When f(...) is 0 or 1/2, the expression is 1/4. So, the output of g(f(...)) is also in [0, 1/4].

So, 4 times that would be between 0 and 1.

Thus, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) would be a function that oscillates between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the other equation: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Same reasoning. Starting with cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1.

Then, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. The same as f(sin(...)), so it's in [0, 1/2].

Then, g(f(cos(3πy))) = ||f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|, which is in [0, 1/4].

Multiply by 4: 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) is in [0,1].

So, x is in [0,1], y is in [0,1].

Wait, but in the equation x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), x is determined by the value of y. So, for each y, x is a value between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), for each x, y is between 0 and 1.

So, the graphs of these equations are both in the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].

But how do they intersect? We need to find all (x,y) such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Each point (x,y) must satisfy both equations.

Let me consider parameterizing this. Let me denote:

Let’s denote A = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) = y

and B = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) = x.

So, A = y and B = x. Therefore, A = 4 g(f(sin(2πB))) and B = 4 g(f(cos(3πA))).

So, we can think of this as a system of equations:

A = 4 g(f(sin(2πB)))

B = 4 g(f(cos(3πA)))

We need to find all pairs (A,B) in [0,1]x[0,1] that satisfy these equations.

But this seems a bit circular. Maybe we can approach this by considering the functions involved and their periodicity.

Let me think about the periodicity of functions.

For the first equation, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

The sin(2πx) has a period of 1, so the function inside is periodic with period 1. Similarly, the functions f and g are absolute functions, so they won't affect the periodicity. Therefore, y is periodic with period 1 in x.

Similarly, for the second equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), the cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, so the right-hand side is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

Therefore, the system may repeat its behavior every certain intervals, but since we're looking within the unit square, perhaps the total number of intersections can be determined by analyzing the behavior in that domain.

But, considering the functions are periodic, but the equations are a bit intertwined, maybe it's better to analyze the functions in terms of their possible outputs and see how they can intersect.

Let me try to find the possible ranges of x and y.

From the first equation, y ∈ [0,1], and x is determined by the second equation, which also yields x ∈ [0,1].

So, both x and y are in [0,1]. So, all possible solutions lie within the unit square.

Now, let me consider the functions:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I can think of this as a mapping:
