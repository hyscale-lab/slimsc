Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. There's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon in terms of side lengths and opposite sides being parallel, but not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. Wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's just convex, equilateral, and opposite sides are parallel. So, it's a special kind of hexagon.

I remember that for such hexagons, when you extend the sides, they form a triangle. The given triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. So, the sides AB, CD, EF when extended form this triangle. 

I think I need to relate the sides of the triangle to the side length of the hexagon. Maybe using similar triangles or some proportional relationships.

Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side by some distance. So, perhaps the triangle's sides are proportional to the sides of the hexagon but scaled up by some factor.

Wait, another approach: if opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a "truncated" triangle. Like, each side of the triangle is extended and cut off by lines parallel to the other sides. So, the hexagon is in the center, and the triangle is the outer one formed by the extensions.

In that case, there might be a ratio between the side lengths of the triangle and the hexagon. Maybe similar triangles?

Let me think. If I have a triangle, and from each side, I create a smaller, similar triangle by moving inwards, maintaining parallelism. So, the hexagon would be the inner figure, and the triangle would be the outer one.

Wait, perhaps the triangle is divided into smaller similar triangles by the hexagon. So, the hexagon's sides are parts of lines that are parallel to the sides of the triangle.

I think I remember something about this. In such cases, the sides of the hexagon relate to the sides of the triangle by a
