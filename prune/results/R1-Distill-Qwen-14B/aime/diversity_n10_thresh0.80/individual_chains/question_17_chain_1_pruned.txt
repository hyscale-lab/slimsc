Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area (S) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. So, we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter has to be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal (d) of a rectangular box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r would be half of that, so r = d/2. Therefore, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, to minimize r, I need to minimize l² + w² + h².

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

I remember that in optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers can be used. But since it's a bit involved, maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of symmetric variables or inequalities.

Let me think about using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's denote the variables as x, y, z for simplicity. So, x = l, y = w, z = h.

We need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

Hmm, so it's a constrained optimization problem with two constraints. That's a bit more complicated, but maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume constraint and substitute into the surface area constraint.

From the volume constraint, z = 23/(xy). Let's plug that into the surface area equation:

2(xy + x*(23/(xy)) + y*(23/(xy))) = 54

Simplify this:

2[ xy + (23x)/(xy) + (23y)/(xy) ] = 54

Which simplifies to:

2[ xy + 23/(y) + 23/(x) ] = 54

Divide both sides by 2:

xy + 23/x + 23/y = 27

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can let u = x + y and v = xy, but I'm not sure if that will help. Alternatively, perhaps setting x = y could be a symmetric case where the minimum occurs. Let me test that.

Assume x = y. Then, from the volume constraint, z = 23/(x²). Then, surface area becomes:

2[ x² + 2x*(23/x²) ] = 54

Simplify:

2[ x² + 46/x ] = 54

Divide both sides by 2:

x² + 46/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x

Rearranged as:

x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, let's try to factor this. Let's plug x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0, so x=2 is a root. So, (x-2) is a factor.

Divide the polynomial by (x - 2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
        2   4  -46
      1  2  -23  0

So, the polynomial factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0

Set equal to zero, so x=2, or x² +2x -23=0. The quadratic equation gives x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4√6]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

But x has to be positive, so x=2, or x= -1 +2√6≈-1+4.898≈3.898.

So, possible x=2, then z=23/(2²) = 23/4=5.75. Then, the box would be 2x2x5.75.

Wait, but if x=2, then since we assumed x=y=2, z=5.75.

But is this the minimal case? Alternatively, when x= -1 +2√6, then x≈3.898, and z=23/(x²). Let's compute x²: ( (-1 +2√6) )² = 1 -4√6 + 24 =25 -4√6 ≈2
