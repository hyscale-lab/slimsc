Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention the probability is m/n, and we need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each connected in a cycle. Each vertex is colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance, independently. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, the main part is figuring out how many colorings allow for a rotation that maps all blue vertices to red ones. That is, after some rotation, wherever there was a blue vertex, it moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, so if I rotate the octagon by some multiple of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45), maybe by 0, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees, the blue vertices should end up on red positions.

But considering all possible rotations, how does this work?

I think it's helpful to consider the concept of rotational symmetry here. The octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which are 8 possible rotations. For each such rotation, we can check if the coloring satisfies the condition that all blue vertices under this rotation end up on red positions.

But wait, the problem says "the octagon can then be rotated" so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red. That means there exists at least one rotation (other than the identity, maybe?) that does this.

Wait no, actually, the identity rotation (0°) would just mean that the blue vertices are already in red positions. So the condition is that either the coloring is such that blue vertices are in red positions without any rotation, or that after some non-zero rotation, the blue positions shift to red ones.

But wait, perhaps a better way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if we can rotate the octagon such that blue vertices align with red ones, that suggests that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

Alternatively, maybe the blue set is a rotation of the red set, which would imply that the number of blue and red vertices must be the same, right? Because a rotation would preserve the number of vertices. So if the octagon has, say, k blue vertices, then after rotation, those k vertices must map to k red vertices. So in the original coloring, the number of red vertices must also be k.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices. If the number of blue and red vertices are different, say, 5 red and 3 blue, then a rotation can't map 3 blue to 5 red because they're different in count. So the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. So the only possible colorings that satisfy the condition must have exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. Because 8 is even,
