Okay, so I have this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it means. 

The problem says: For an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. If n has exactly two digits in base b, that means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is b^2 - 1. 

So, n is in the range [b, b² - 1]. 

Now, the two digits of n in base b sum up to sqrt(n). Let me denote the two digits as 'a' and 'c', where 'a' is the digit in the b's place and 'c' is the digit in the units place. So, n can be expressed as a*b + c. 

The condition given is that a + c = sqrt(n). Let me write that down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Since a and c are digits in base b, they must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c ≤ b-1. Also, since n is a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (since the first digit can't be zero). So, a is in [1, b-1], and c is in [0, b-1].

Let me try to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor or rearrange terms differently. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe express n in terms of a and c:

n = a*b + c

And the sum of digits is:

a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a*b + c)

So, if I let s = a + c, then s must equal sqrt(a*b + c). Therefore, s² = a*b + c.

But since s = a + c, I can substitute:

s² = a*b + (s - a)

Because c = s - a.

So, let's write that:

s² = a*b + s - a

Let me rearrange this:

s² - s = a*b - a

Factor the right side:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So, s² - s must be divisible by (b - 1), and the quotient is a.

But a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive. So, for each possible s, we can compute a as (s² - s)/(b - 1), and check if a is an integer in the allowed range, and then check if c = s - a is also within [0, b-1].

Alternatively, for each b, we can iterate through possible s and a to find the possible n.

Wait, but the problem asks for the least integer b ≥ 2 such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest b where the number of such n exceeds 10.

Hmm, so perhaps I can approach this by, for each b starting from 2 upwards, determine how many n satisfy the conditions, and stop when we find a b with more than 10 such numbers.

Let me consider how to model this. For a given b, we can find all possible pairs (a, c) such that:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1
2. 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1
3. a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Alternatively, using the earlier substitution, s = a + c, and s² = a*b + c.

So, s must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is sqrt(n), which must also be integer because n is a perfect square. So, n must be a perfect square. That's an important point—so n must be a perfect square.

So, for n to be a two-digit number in base b, and a perfect square, the square root of n must be an integer s. So s = a + c, and n = s².

But n is also a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b² - 1, and n = s², so s² is in [b, b² - 1].

Therefore, s must be in the range sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b² - 1). Since sqrt(b² - 1) is just a bit less than b, s can be up to b - 1. So, s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1].

But s must also satisfy that s = a + c, where a is at least 1 and at most b - 1, and c is between 0 and b - 1.

So, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from s_min to s_max, where s_min is the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b), and s_max is b - 1.

For each s, we can write the equation s² = a*b + c, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1, and c = s - a.

Wait, wait, let's see:

We have c = s - a, so substituting into s² = a*b + c:

s² = a*b + s - a

Which rearranged is:

s² - s = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (s² - s)/(b - 1)

Since a has to be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, for each s, we can compute (s² - s) and see if it's divisible by (b - 1). If it is, then a is that quotient, and c = s - a.

But c has to be between 0 and b -1. So, for each s, if a is computed as (s² - s)/(b -1), then c must be s - a, which must be ≥0 and ≤ b-1.

Wait, but for a given b, s can range from s_min to s_max. So, for each s in that range, we can check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then compute a and c, and check if c is within [0, b-1]. If so, then that n is a b-eautiful number.

So, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [s_min, s_max] where (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and c = s - a is within [0, b-1].

So, perhaps we can approach the problem by for each b starting from 2 up, compute the number of such s, and check when that number exceeds 10.

But that might take a while. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to find b such that (b -1) divides (s² - s) for multiple s.

Alternatively, note that (s² - s) = s(s -1). So, (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So, (b -1) | s(s -1). 

Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, (b -1) must divide the product s(s -1), which is the product of two consecutive integers, which are coprime.
