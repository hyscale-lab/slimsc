Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So first, Alice chooses a set A. Then Bob creates a list of sets B. Each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and importantly, the maximum element of each B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what A could be and then sum its elements.

Wait, so the key here is to relate the size of A to the number of possible sets B. Let me think about how the size of A affects the number of possible B sets.

Let's say A has k elements. Then for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum? Well, for a given a, the sets B can be any nonempty subset of the integers less than or equal to a, with the condition that the maximum is exactly a. That means the sets must include a and any combination of the numbers from 1 up to a-1.

So for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because for each of the numbers less than a, we can choose to include them or not, giving 2^{a-1} subsets. But wait, since B must be nonempty, but since we're including a in each case, all these subsets are nonempty. So that's correct.

But wait, if A has multiple elements, say a1, a2, ..., ak, then the total number of sets B would be the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, we have 2^{a-1} possible B sets with maximum a, and these are all distinct because their maxima are different.

So the total number of B sets is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, to rephrase, sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

We need to find A such that this sum is 2024, and then compute the sum of elements in A.

Hmm, so now the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024.

Wait a second, since 2^{a-1} is a power of two, the sum of distinct powers of two would just be a binary representation. But here, the sum is 2024, so maybe the set A corresponds to the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of 2024.

Let me test that idea. Let's compute the binary representation of 2024.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0.

506 /2 =253, rem 0.

253 /2=126 rem 1.

126/2=
