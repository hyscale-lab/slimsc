Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm, so Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She has two different walking speeds, and each time she stops at a coffee shop for t minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios: one where she walks at speed s km/h, which takes her 4 hours including t minutes, and another where she walks at s+2 km/h, taking 2 hours and 24 minutes including t minutes. Then, we need to find the time it takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Wait, so the main idea is to find t and s first, right? Because once I have those, I can compute the time for the new speed.

Let me start by setting up the equations based on the information provided.

First, when she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee stop. So, the time she spends walking plus t minutes equals 4 hours.

But wait, the problem mentions t minutes, which is part of the total time, so maybe I should convert everything into consistent units, like minutes or hours.

Let me convert everything into hours since the speeds are in km per hour. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Time walking + t minutes (coffee) = 4 hours.

Time walking is distance divided by speed, which is 9 km / s km/h. So:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario, she walks at s+2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours.

So, the equation is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, subtracting the second equation from the first:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2):

= 9[(s + 2) - s] / [s(s + 2)] 

= 9 * 2 / [s(s + 2)] 

= 18 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Then, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s(s + 2) = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

So, 18 = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

Let me write this as a quadratic equation:

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, no, wait: 1.6 * 10 is 16, 3.2 *10 is 32, and 18*10 is 180. So:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Hmm, perhaps we can divide both sides by 4 to simplify:

(16/4)s² + (32/4)s - (180/4) = 0

Which gives:

4 s² + 8 s - 45 =
