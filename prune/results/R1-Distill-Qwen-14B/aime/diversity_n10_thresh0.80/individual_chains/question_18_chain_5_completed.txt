Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, and all sides and angles are equal. So, it's a 12-sided polygon with each internal angle equal to... I think each internal angle is (12-2)*180/12 = 150 degrees. But maybe that's not directly important here.

I should visualize the dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each equally spaced around a circle. So, if I imagine the dodecagon inscribed in a unit circle, each vertex is at an angle of 30 degrees apart, since 360/12 = 30.

Now, the problem is about rectangles whose sides lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices.

I think the key here is that a rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by certain numbers of steps around the polygon.

Wait, so in a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if the number of edges between the vertices is the same. For example, in a hexagon, the opposite sides are parallel, and similarly, the longer diagonals are parallel.

In a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 10 others (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices). But for a side to be part of a rectangle, it needs to have another side parallel to it.

So, perhaps I should consider the vectors representing the sides and diagonals. In the complex plane, each vertex can be represented as e^{2πik/12} for k from 0 to 11. Then, the vector from vertex k to vertex m is e^{2πi(m - k)/12} - 1.

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the sides and diagonals as vectors with certain angles.

Each side of the dodecagon corresponds to a vector of 30 degrees, as each vertex is 30 degrees apart. So, the sides correspond to vectors at 30 degrees, and diagonals correspond to multiples of that, like 60, 90, etc.

Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because the sides are edges connecting adjacent vertices, so the vectors are each 30 degrees apart in terms of their direction.

Hmm, actually, each side is a vector with angle 0, 30, 60, ..., 330 degrees, right? Because each vertex is 30 degrees around the circle.

But for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. So, the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to two different directions, each direction corresponding to some step around the dodecagon.

Let me think about the possible directions. For example, sides could be parallel to step 1 (the actual sides), step 2, step 3, etc. Each step corresponds to moving a certain number of edges around the polygon.

So, a step of size k would mean moving k vertices away. For example, step 1 is the adjacent vertex, step 2 skips one vertex, etc. The maximum step in a dodecagon would be 5, since beyond that, it's the same as stepping backwards (e.g., step 6 is the same as step 6 in the opposite direction, but step 7 is equivalent to step 5 in the other direction because 7 = 12 - 5). So, steps can be 1 to 5.

But for a rectangle, we need two different step sizes (directions) that are perpendicular to each other. Because a rectangle has sides that are perpendicular.

So, I need to find all pairs of steps (a, b) such that the angle between the vectors corresponding to steps a and b is 90 degrees. Because the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular.

Wait, the angle between two vectors in the dodecagon. Each step corresponds to a vector with an angle of 30*a degrees, right? Because each step a skips (a-1) vertices, so the angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees, so stepping a vertices would create a vector with angle 30*a degrees.

Wait, no. Actually, the angle for a step of a is 30*a degrees relative to the starting vertex. Wait, no, that's not correct. The angle for each vertex is 30 degrees apart. So, the vector from vertex 0 to vertex k is at an angle of 30*k degrees.

Wait, when you step from vertex 0 to vertex k, the vector is at an angle of 30*k degrees. Similarly, stepping from vertex 0 to vertex m, the vector is at 30*m degrees.

But for two vectors to be perpendicular, the difference in their angles should be 90 degrees. So, 30*(m - k) ≡ 90 mod 360. So, 30*(m - k) ≡ 90 mod 360. So, m - k ≡ 3 mod 12, because 30*3=90.

Wait, so that the angle between the vectors is 90 degrees. So, the step sizes a and b must satisfy that the angle between them is 90 degrees.

So, if step a corresponds to angle 30*a degrees, and step b corresponds to angle 30*b degrees, then the angle between vectors a and b is |30*a - 30*b| = 30*|a - b| degrees.

We need this to be equal to 90 degrees. So, 30*|a - b| ≡ 90 mod 360.

So, |a - b| = 3 mod 12, because 30*3=90, 30*15=450 which is 90 mod 360.

But since a and b are steps between 1 and 5, because beyond that, the steps are equivalent to their complements.

Wait, so for a and b between 1 and 5, the difference |a - b| can only be up to 4, so 3 is possible, but 15 is too big.

Wait, so perhaps the only way for |a - b|*30 ≡ 90 mod 360 is when |a - b|=3 or 9, but since |a -b| can't be 9 in steps of 1-5, the only possibility is |a - b|=3.

So, the angle between the two step vectors must be 90 degrees. So, for step a and step b, we must have |a - b|=3.

But wait, step sizes are 1,2,3,4,5.

So, the possible pairs (a, b) where |a - b|=3 are:

(1,4), (4,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,6), but 6 is beyond 5, so not allowed.

Wait, so the valid pairs are (1,4), (4,1), (2,5), (5,2). Each of these pairs would result in two vectors that are 90 degrees apart.

So, these are the possible pairs of step sizes that can form the sides of a rectangle.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct?

Because, for example, step size 1 corresponds to a vector at 30 degrees. Step size 4 corresponds to a vector at 30*4=120 degrees. The angle between 30 and 120 is 90 degrees. So, yes, those vectors are perpendicular.

Similarly, step size 2 is 60 degrees, step size 5 is 150 degrees. The angle between them is 90 degrees. So, that also works.

So, each pair of step sizes a and b where |a - b|=3 will give us two vectors that are perpendicular. So, these can form the sides of a rectangle.

So, the possible step pairs are (1,4) and (2,5), each in both orders (since (1,4) and (4,1) are different if we consider direction, but for rectangles, maybe direction doesn't matter? Hmm, but rectangles can be placed in different orientations, so perhaps they are distinct.)

Wait, but actually, the rectangles are determined by their sides, so for a rectangle, the sides can be in any orientation as long as they're perpendicular. So, the step pairs (1,4) and (4,1) would result in rectangles that are rotated versions of each other, but they are still distinct rectangles.

So, perhaps I can consider each unordered pair, but then account for the different orientations.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about how many such rectangles can be formed for each pair of perpendicular steps.

So, for each pair of perpendicular step sizes, how many rectangles can we form?

Let me consider step pair (1,4). So, the vectors are step 1 and step 4. Each rectangle is determined by choosing two points that are connected by step 1 and another two points connected by step 4, but arranged in such a way that they form a rectangle.

Wait, actually, no. A rectangle in the dodecagon would be determined by selecting four points such that two sides are of step a and the other two sides are of step b, with a and b perpendicular.

But perhaps it's easier to model the dodecagon as a graph where each vertex is connected to others via steps, and then find all possible rectangles by selecting four points that form such a figure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon as a coordinate system because the vectors can be treated as axes.

Wait, each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel sides, which are steps a and b, and the angle between a and b is 90 degrees. So, for each such pair (a, b), the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two starting points such that the vectors a and b can form the sides of a rectangle.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the dodecagon as a grid, but since it's a 12-sided polygon, it's not a square grid but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the dodecagon as a combination of vectors with certain step sizes, and each rectangle is determined by two different step sizes that are perpendicular.

So, for each pair of step sizes (a, b) where |a - b|=3, the number of rectangles would be the number of positions where four points can form a rectangle with sides of step a and step b.

But how do I count that?

Wait, in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles formed by two perpendicular step sizes can be calculated by considering how many such rectangles can fit without overlapping.

But perhaps a more systematic approach is needed.

Let me consider each possible pair of step sizes (a, b) that are perpendicular, which are (1,4) and (2,5). Each of these pairs can be used to form rectangles.

For each such pair, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two starting points such that moving by step a and step b (in both directions) lands on other vertices.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model this by considering the dodecagon as a graph where each vertex is connected to others via steps a and b, and then count the number of rectangles.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of rectangles for a given pair (a, b) can be calculated as follows:

For each starting vertex, we can attempt to form a rectangle by moving a steps in one direction and b steps in a perpendicular direction. But since the polygon is regular, the number of such rectangles would be uniform across all starting points, except when the steps cause overlapping or going beyond the polygon.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about a specific example.

Take step pair (1,4). So, starting at vertex 0, moving step 1 takes us to vertex 1. From there, moving step 4 would take us to vertex 5. But we need to form a rectangle, so perhaps we need four points such that each pair is connected by either step a or step b.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of vectors. The vectors corresponding to step 1 and step 4 are perpendicular. So, any rectangle can be defined by two vectors: one along step 1 and another along step 4. The number of such rectangles would depend on how many such positions are possible.

But since the dodecagon is regular, the number of such rectangles should be consistent around the polygon.

Wait, perhaps the number of rectangles for each step pair is equal to the number of positions where the vectors don't overlap and form a valid rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps for each pair of step sizes (a, b), the number of rectangles is 12, because you can start at each vertex, but each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner), so the actual count would be 12/(number of times each rectangle is counted).

Wait, that might be a way to do it.

So, for each pair (a, b), how many unique rectangles are there?

Suppose for pair (1,4), each rectangle can be started at any of 12 vertices, but each rectangle is defined by four vertices, each of which can be the starting point. So, each rectangle is counted four times in the total count. Therefore, the total number of rectangles for pair (1,4) would be 12 / 4 = 3. But that seems too small.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of possible positions where you can fit the rectangle without overlapping.

Wait, maybe I should think about how many positions the rectangle can take.

For step pair (1,4), each rectangle has sides of length corresponding to step 1 and step 4.

Wait, but in terms of the polygon, the length of step 1 is the length of one side, and step 4 is the length of a diagonal.

But I'm not sure how to translate that into the number of rectangles.

Alternatively, perhaps each rectangle is determined uniquely by two parameters: the number of steps between the vertices in each direction.

Wait, perhaps for each pair (a, b), the number of rectangles is equal to 12 divided by the least common multiple of a and b or something like that.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

In a regular polygon, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering the number of pairs of parallel sides.

Wait, but for a rectangle, you need two pairs of parallel sides. Each pair must be parallel to each other and the other pair must be parallel to each other, and the two pairs must be perpendicular.

So, for each possible direction (step a), we can look for another direction (step b) that's perpendicular to it.

As we've established, the step pairs that are perpendicular are (1,4) and (2,5).

So, for each of these step pairs, we can compute the number of rectangles.

Now, for each such pair, how many rectangles can we form?

I think the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two starting points such that the vectors a and b can form the sides.

Wait, but perhaps for each step pair (a, b), the number of rectangles is equal to 12, but considering overlapping, maybe it's less.

Wait, maybe I can model the dodecagon as a grid where each step a is a horizontal move and step b is a vertical move. Then, the number of rectangles would be the number of such grids, which is (number of horizontal lines) * (number of vertical lines). But I'm not sure.

Wait, in a grid, the number of rectangles is (number of ways to choose two horizontal lines) * (number of ways to choose two vertical lines). But in this case, it's a circular grid, so the concept might not directly apply.

Alternatively, perhaps each pair (a, b) can form a grid-like structure within the dodecagon, and the number of rectangles would be the number of such grid points.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try a different approach.

I remember that in a regular n-gon, the number of rectangles is related to the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters. But wait, in a dodecagon, diameters are lines connecting opposite vertices, which would correspond to step 6. But since 12 is even, each diameter connects two opposite vertices.

But in our case, the step sizes are 1,2,3,4,5. So, perhaps each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular diameters, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular vectors, each of which is a side or a diagonal.

Wait, another idea: the number of rectangles is equal to the number of rectangles that can be formed by selecting four points where the midpoints of the diagonals are the same, and the diagonals are perpendicular.

But that's a bit abstract.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each vertex, count how many rectangles have that vertex as a corner. Then multiply by 12 and divide by 4 (since each rectangle has four corners).

But I'm not sure how to count the number of rectangles per vertex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon as a graph where each vertex is connected to others via edges (sides and diagonals). Then, a rectangle is a cycle of length 4 where opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Hmm, but counting such cycles is non-trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the dodecagon's vertices. Let me denote each vertex as V_k, where k ranges from 0 to 11. Each vertex V_k is located at an angle of 30*k degrees from the positive x-axis.

So, the coordinates are (cos(30k°), sin(30k°)).

Now, the sides and diagonals can be represented as vectors between these points.

A rectangle requires four points V_a, V_b, V_c, V_d such that the vectors V_aV_b and V_aV_d are perpendicular, and the vectors V_bV_c and V_dV_a are equal and opposite, etc. But perhaps this is too involved.

Wait, maybe instead, think about the vectors that form the sides of the rectangle. Since the sides are parallel to either step a or step b, which are perpendicular.

So, for a rectangle, you need two vectors that are perpendicular, say vector A and vector B. Then, the four vertices of the rectangle can be expressed as V, V+A, V+B, V+A+B.

But in our case, vectors A and B must correspond to steps in the dodecagon, i.e., integer steps between vertices.

So, for each possible pair of step sizes (a, b) that are perpendicular, how many such rectangles can be formed?

Wait, for each such pair, the number of rectangles would be equal to the number of possible starting points V such that V, V+a, V+b, V+a+b are all distinct vertices.

But in a dodecagon, adding steps wraps around modulo 12.

Wait, but the vectors must land on actual vertices. So, for example, starting at V_0, adding step a (1) would go to V_1, adding step b (4) would go to V_4, and adding both would go to V_5. So, this would form a rectangle with vertices 0,1,5,4.

But wait, is that a rectangle? Let me check.

The sides would be 0-1 (step 1), 1-5 (step 4), 5-4 (step 11, which is equivalent to step -1), and 4-0 (step 4). Wait, that seems to form a quadrilateral, but is it a rectangle?

Wait, to check if it's a rectangle, the sides must be perpendicular. So, the vectors from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 4 must be perpendicular.

Calculating the dot product: Vector 0-1 is (cos30°, sin30°), and vector 0-4 is (cos120°, sin120°). The dot product is cos30 * cos120 + sin30 * sin120.

cos30 = √3/2, cos120 = -1/2, sin30 = 1/2, sin120 = √3/2.

Dot product = (√3/2)(-1/2) + (1/2)(√3/2) = (-√3/4) + (√3/4) = 0. So yes, they are perpendicular.

So, the quadrilateral 0,1,5,4 is indeed a rectangle.

So, how many such rectangles exist for step pair (1,4)?

Each rectangle is determined by a starting vertex, but each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner as the starting vertex). So, for step pair (1,4), how many unique rectangles are there?

Since the dodecagon has 12 vertices, each rectangle is determined uniquely by the starting vertex, but each rectangle is counted four times. So, the total number would be 12 / 4 = 3 rectangles.

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier we saw that starting at 0 gives a rectangle, starting at 1 would give another, but perhaps they are all distinct.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think: for each step pair (1,4), the number of rectangles is actually 12, because each starting vertex gives a unique rectangle.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that starting at 0 gives rectangle 0,1,5,4. Starting at 1 would give rectangle 1,2,6,5. So, each starting vertex gives a distinct rectangle, so the total number would be 12.

But then, for each step pair (a, b) that is perpendicular, we have 12 rectangles. But considering that, for each rectangle, how many times is it counted?

Wait, each rectangle is determined by four starting points, each of which is a corner. So, if we count 12 rectangles for each step pair, but each rectangle is counted four times, the actual number is 12 / 4 = 3 rectangles per step pair.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the earlier example where starting at 0 gives a unique rectangle, and starting at 1 gives another. So, perhaps each step pair (a, b) gives 3 unique rectangles.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach.

Each rectangle is determined by two vectors, A and B, which are perpendicular and correspond to step sizes a and b. The number of such rectangles is equal to the number of distinct positions where the vectors A and B can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, for each pair of perpendicular steps (a, b), the number of rectangles is equal to the number of times the vectors A and B can be placed end-to-end without wrapping around the polygon. 

So, for step pair (1,4), the vectors are of lengths corresponding to step 1 and step 4. How many positions can these vectors fit without overlapping?

Wait, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of distinct starting points such that moving a steps and b steps lands on other vertices, forming a rectangle.

But in a dodecagon, for each starting point, you can form exactly one rectangle with step pair (a, b). So, 12 starting points, but each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner), so the number of rectangles is 12 / 4 = 3.

Similarly, for step pair (2,5), the same reasoning applies: 12 starting points, each rectangle counted four times, so 3 rectangles.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me check with a smaller polygon. For example, in a square (4-gon), how many rectangles are there? Well, only one rectangle, the square itself. But according to this method, for step pair (1,2), we'd have 4 starting points, each rectangle counted four times, so 4/4 =1, which is correct.

Wait, another example: a regular hexagon (6-gon). How many rectangles can be formed? In a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by selecting every other vertex, but actually, the regular hexagon itself doesn't have rectangles except for the ones formed by three pairs of opposite sides. Wait, no, actually, a regular hexagon doesn't have any rectangles because the angles are 120 degrees, not 90. Wait, so maybe my method isn't applicable there.

Wait, perhaps my approach is correct for step pairs that are perpendicular, but in the case of the dodecagon, with step pairs (1,4) and (2,5), each giving 3 rectangles.

So, for each step pair, 3 rectangles. So, with two step pairs, (1,4) and (2,5), each contributing 3 rectangles, the total would be 6 rectangles.

Wait, but the problem statement mentions that the diagram shows three rectangles, implying that perhaps there are more than three, but maybe the diagram is just an example.

Wait, perhaps I'm undercounting. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe each step pair (a, b) can form multiple rectangles, not just 3. Because, for example, in the dodecagon, the step pair (1,4) can form rectangles of different sizes.

Wait, but in the case of step pair (1,4), the vectors are step 1 and step 4, which are perpendicular. So, the rectangle formed is determined by these two steps.

But in the dodecagon, depending on how many steps you take, you can form different sizes of rectangles.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the step sizes with the actual lengths. So, step 1 is one side, step 4 is a diagonal that spans four edges.

Wait, perhaps the number of rectangles for each step pair (a, b) is equal to 12, because you can start at each vertex, but each rectangle is counted multiple times.

Wait, let's think of it this way: For each step pair (a, b), how many distinct rectangles can be formed by choosing a starting vertex and moving a steps in one direction and b steps in the perpendicular direction.

So, for step pair (1,4), starting at vertex 0: 0,1,5,4.

Starting at vertex 1: 1,2,6,5.

Starting at vertex 2: 2,3,7,6.

And so on, up to starting at vertex 11: 11,0,4,3.

Wait, each starting vertex gives a distinct rectangle, but each rectangle is counted four times because each rectangle has four corners. So, the total number of rectangles for step pair (1,4) would be 12 / 4 = 3.

Similarly, for step pair (2,5):

Starting at 0: 0,2,7,5.

Starting at 1:1,3,8,6.

Starting at 2:2,4,9,7.

Continuing this way, each starting vertex gives a rectangle, but each rectangle is counted four times, so 12 /4=3 rectangles.

So, each step pair (1,4) and (2,5) gives 3 rectangles. Therefore, total rectangles would be 3 + 3 = 6.

But the problem statement shows three rectangles in the diagram, which might just be an example, but perhaps I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps there are more step pairs that result in perpendicular vectors. Earlier, I considered only |a - b|=3, but maybe other combinations also result in perpendicular vectors.

Wait, let me recast the condition. The angle between the vectors corresponding to steps a and b must be 90 degrees. The angle between two vectors is given by the difference in their angles. Each step a corresponds to an angle of 30*a degrees. So, the angle between vectors a and b is |30a - 30b| degrees. We need this to be 90 degrees.

So, |30a - 30b| ≡ 90 mod 360.

Which simplifies to |a - b| ≡ 3 mod 12, because 30*(a - b) = 90 => a - b = 3.

So, |a - b| must be 3, 9, 15, etc., but since a and b are between 1 and 5, the only possible differences are 3 and 9. But 9 is larger than 5, so the only possible difference is 3.

So, the only possible step pairs are those where |a - b|=3, i.e., (1,4), (4,1), (2,5), (5,2).

So, for each of these pairs, we have three rectangles as calculated before, but since some pairs are the same, perhaps we should consider each unordered pair once.

Wait, for step pair (1,4), we have three rectangles, and for (2,5), another three. So, total is six.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think of the dodecagon and see.

Alternatively, perhaps each rectangle is counted twice because each step pair is considered once in each direction.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each step pair (a, b) where a < b and |a - b|=3. So, the valid step pairs are (1,4) and (2,5). Each of these would contribute 3 rectangles, as before, giving a total of 6 rectangles.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing other step pairs where the angle between them is 90 degrees.

Wait, let me check for other possible step pairs. For example, step 3 and step 6. But step 6 is equivalent to step 6 mod 12, which is the same as step 6 in the opposite direction. But since step sizes beyond 5 are equivalent to their complements, step 6 is equivalent to step 6-12= -6, but that's the same as step 6 in the other direction.

Wait, step 3 and step 6: the angle between them would be |30*3 - 30*6|= |90 - 180|=90 degrees. So, they are perpendicular.

Wait, but step 6 is not allowed because step sizes beyond 5 are equivalent to their complements. Wait, in our earlier consideration, we considered steps up to 5 because beyond that, they are equivalent to steps in the other direction.

So, step 6 is equivalent to step 6-12= -6, which is equivalent to step 6 in the opposite direction, which would be step 6 in the other direction, but that's equivalent to step 6 in the same direction as step 6 is 180 degrees, so opposite.

Wait, but step 6 connects opposite vertices, so it's a diameter. So, step 3 would connect vertices three apart, which is 90 degrees apart.

Wait, so the angle between step 3 and step 6 is 90 degrees. So, vectors step 3 (90 degrees) and step 6 (180 degrees) have an angle of 90 degrees between them. So, they are perpendicular.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we didn't consider step 3 and step 6 as a valid pair because step 6 is beyond 5. So, perhaps we need to reconsider.

Wait, but step 6 is a diameter, and step 3 is a diagonal that's three steps away.

So, the vectors step 3 and step 6 are perpendicular. So, they can form rectangles.

So, perhaps the step pairs are not only (1,4) and (2,5) but also (3,6). But since step 6 is equivalent to step 6 in the other direction, perhaps it's allowed.

Wait, but step 6 is beyond our initial consideration of steps up to 5. So, perhaps we should include step 6 as a valid step size, but since 6 is equivalent to step 6 in the opposite direction, which is step 6 again.

Wait, but step 6 is a straight line across the dodecagon, so it's a diameter. So, perhaps we can have rectangles where one pair of sides is step 3 and the other is step 6.

But wait, step 6 would mean moving six steps, which is the same as the opposite vertex. So, the vector is in the opposite direction, but perhaps that's acceptable.

So, let's consider step pair (3,6). The angle between step 3 and step 6 is 90 degrees, so they can form rectangles.

Similarly, step pair (6,3) is the same as (3,6), so we don't need to consider them separately.

So, now we have three step pairs: (1,4), (2,5), and (3,6).

Each of these can form rectangles.

So, for each of these three step pairs, how many rectangles can we form?

For (1,4), as before, 3 rectangles.

For (2,5), another 3 rectangles.

For (3,6), how many?

Let me try to visualize: starting at vertex 0, step 3 would take us to vertex 3, and step 6 would take us to vertex 6. But wait, vertex 6 is opposite vertex 0, so the rectangle would be 0,3,6, something.

Wait, let me try to compute the rectangle formed by starting at 0, moving step 3 to 3, then step 6 would take us to 9 (since 3 +6=9), but that would make the rectangle 0,3,9,6.

Wait, but is that a rectangle? Let me check the vectors.

Vector from 0 to 3 is step 3 (90 degrees), and vector from 0 to 6 is step 6 (180 degrees). The angle between them is 90 degrees, so yes, they are perpendicular.

So, the rectangle would have vertices 0,3,6,9.

Wait, but 0,3,6,9: connecting these would form a rectangle because the vectors 0-3 and 0-6 are perpendicular.

So, how many such rectangles are there for step pair (3,6)?

Starting at each vertex:

Starting at 0: 0,3,6,9.

Starting at 1:1,4,7,10.

Starting at 2:2,5,8,11.

Starting at 3:3,6,9,0.

And so on. Each starting vertex gives a rectangle, and each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner). So, the total number of rectangles for step pair (3,6) would be 12 /4 =3.

So, now, with three step pairs, each contributing 3 rectangles, the total number of rectangles is 3 *3=9.

Wait, but I'm not sure if step pair (3,6) is valid because step 6 is a diameter, and perhaps the rectangle formed is actually a line or something else.

Wait, looking back, the rectangle formed by 0,3,6,9 is indeed a rectangle, as the sides are step 3 and step 6, which are perpendicular.

So, yes, that's a valid rectangle.

So, now, considering all three step pairs, (1,4), (2,5), and (3,6), each contributing 3 rectangles, the total is 9 rectangles.

Wait, but earlier, I thought step pair (3,6) would only contribute 3, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps each step pair contributes 3 rectangles, so with three step pairs, the total is 9.

But wait, another thought: step pair (3,6) is actually the same as step pair (6,3), but since 6 is equivalent to -6 mod 12, perhaps we're double-counting.

Wait, but no, each step pair is unique in terms of their step sizes. So, (3,6) is a separate case from (1,4) and (2,5).

So, if each of these three step pairs contributes 3 rectangles, the total is 9.

Wait, but let me count them manually.

For step pair (1,4):

Rectangles are:

0,1,5,4

1,2,6,5

2,3,7,6

3,4,8,7

4,5,9,8

5,6,10,9

6,7,11,10

7,8,0,11

8,9,1,0

9,10,2,1

10,11,3,2

11,0,4,3

Wait, that's 12 rectangles, but each is counted four times because each rectangle has four corners. So, 12 /4=3 unique rectangles.

Similarly, for step pair (2,5):

0,2,7,5

1,3,8,6

2,4,9,7

3,5,10,8

4,6,11,9

5,7,0,10

6,8,1,11

7,9,2,0

8,10,3,1

9,11,4,2

10,0,5,3

11,1,6,4

Again, 12 rectangles, but 3 unique ones.

For step pair (3,6):

0,3,6,9

1,4,7,10

2,5,8,11

3,6,9,0

... and so on, leading to 3 unique rectangles.

So, total rectangles: 3 +3 +3=9.

But wait, when I look at the dodecagon, I can see that some rectangles might be overlapping or not, but according to this calculation, there are 9.

But the problem statement mentions that the diagram shows three of those rectangles. So, perhaps the answer is 9.

But wait, another thought: perhaps step pairs (3,6) are not valid because the sides would overlap or something.

Wait, the rectangle formed by step pair (3,6) is a larger rectangle, but it's still valid.

Wait, let me check the rectangle 0,3,6,9.

The sides are from 0 to 3 (step 3), 3 to 6 (step 3), 6 to9 (step 3), and 9 to0 (step 3). Wait, no, that's not correct because the other sides would be steps of 6.

Wait, no, the rectangle is formed by two different step sizes: step 3 and step 6.

Wait, no, in the rectangle 0,3,6,9, the sides are 0-3 (step3), 3-6 (step3), 6-9 (step3), and 9-0 (step3). Wait, that's not a rectangle, that's a square.

Wait, but step 6 is a straight line across the dodecagon, so the rectangle would have sides of step3 and step6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the rectangle should have two sides of step3 and two sides of step6, arranged perpendicularly.

Wait, but when I connect 0,3,6,9, it's actually a square, because all sides are equal (steps of 3), but in a dodecagon, step3 is three edges apart, which is 90 degrees.

Wait, no, step3 corresponds to a vector of 90 degrees, and step6 corresponds to a vector of 180 degrees, which is directly opposite. But wait, vectors step3 and step6 are perpendicular because 90 and 180 are 90 degrees apart.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to compute the vectors.

Vector from 0 to 3: angle 90 degrees.

Vector from 0 to 6: angle 180 degrees.

The angle between them is 90 degrees, so they are perpendicular.

So, the rectangle would have vertices at 0,3,6,9.

Wait, but in reality, moving from 0 to3 to6 would be stepping by 3 each time, but that's not a rectangle because the sides are parallel.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the rectangles are formed.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is formed not by moving step3 and then step6, but by moving step3 in one direction and step6 in a perpendicular direction.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it as vectors. The rectangle is formed by two vectors: one along step3 and another along step6, which are perpendicular.

So, starting at 0, moving step3 to 3, then from 3, moving step6 to 9. Then from 9, moving step3 back to 6, and from 6, moving step6 back to 0. Wait, that's not forming a rectangle; that's forming a bowtie shape.

Wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is formed by two vectors: step3 and step6, starting at each vertex.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is formed by points 0,3,6, and something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates:

Vertex 0: (1,0)

Vertex 1: (cos30°, sin30°) ≈ (0.866, 0.5)

Vertex 2: (cos60°, sin60°) ≈ (0.5, 0.866)

Vertex 3: (0,1)

Vertex 4: (-0.5, 0.866)

Vertex 5: (-0.866, 0.5)

Vertex 6: (-1, 0)

Vertex 7: (-0.866, -0.5)

Vertex 8: (-0.5, -0.866)

Vertex 9: (0, -1)

Vertex 10: (0.5, -0.866)

Vertex 11: (0.866, -0.5)

So, the rectangle formed by step pair (3,6) starting at 0 would be 0,3,6,9.

Wait, vertex0 is (1,0), vertex3 is (0,1), vertex6 is (-1,0), vertex9 is (0,-1).

Connecting these points: 0(1,0),3(0,1),6(-1,0),9(0,-1). Yes, that's a rectangle centered at the origin, with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1). It's actually a square rotated 45 degrees.

So, yes, that's a valid rectangle.

Similarly, starting at vertex1:1,4,7,10.

Vertex1: (0.866, 0.5)

Vertex4: (-0.5, 0.866)

Vertex7: (-0.866, -0.5)

Vertex10: (0.5, -0.866)

Plotting these points, it seems they form another rectangle.

So, each step pair (a, b) where |a - b|=3 gives three unique rectangles, so with three such step pairs, the total is 9 rectangles.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for each step pair, the number of rectangles is 3, but now I'm considering three step pairs, leading to 9 rectangles.

But wait, let me check if there are more step pairs.

Wait, earlier I thought that only |a - b|=3 gives perpendicular vectors, but let me confirm.

Suppose a=1, b=4: |1-4|=3.

a=2, b=5: |2-5|=3.

a=3, b=6: |3-6|=3.

a=4, b=7: |4-7|=3, but 7 is equivalent to -5 (since 7-12=-5). So, step7 is equivalent to step-5, which is step5 in the opposite direction. So, step4 and step7 would correspond to step4 and step5, which we've already considered.

Similarly, a=5, b=8: |5-8|=3, but step8 is equivalent to step-4, which is step4 in the opposite direction. So, step5 and step8 would correspond to step5 and step4, which is the same as (2,5) and (5,2), which we've already considered.

So, the only unique step pairs are (1,4), (2,5), and (3,6). Each contributing 3 rectangles, leading to a total of 9 rectangles.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing another set of step pairs where the angle between them is 90 degrees but |a - b| is not 3.

Wait, let me think: the condition is that 30*(a - b) ≡90 mod 360, which simplifies to (a - b) ≡3 mod 12.

So, the only possible differences are 3, 15, etc., but since a and b are between 1 and 6 (since step6 is allowed now), the only possible differences are 3 and 9.

But 9 is not possible with a and b up to 6, because the maximum a is6, so a - b=9 would require b to be negative, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but a and b can be up to 6, but let's see:

If a=6, then b= a -3=3.

So, step pair (3,6), which we've already considered.

Similarly, a=5, then b=5-3=2: step pair (2,5).

a=4, b=1: step pair (1,4).

a=3, b=0: but step0 isn't allowed.

So, yeah, only three step pairs.

Thus, the total number of rectangles is 3 step pairs *3 rectangles each=9.

But wait, I'm now thinking that maybe my earlier count for each step pair was incorrect. Because when I considered step pair (1,4), I found 12 rectangles, but each is counted four times, giving 3 unique ones.

Similarly, for (2,5) and (3,6), each gives 3 unique rectangles.

So, 3*3=9.

But wait, let me think: is there another way to find the number of rectangles?

Another approach: In a regular dodecagon, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters.

Wait, but diameters are only step6, so perhaps that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two perpendicular vectors from the set of all possible vectors in the dodecagon.

But each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular vectors, each of which can be a side or a diagonal.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of pairs of perpendicular vectors (a, b) multiplied by the number of positions each can take.

But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, perhaps another way: the number of rectangles is equal to the number of distinct pairs of perpendicular step sizes multiplied by the number of positions each can take.

But I think I've already considered this.

Wait, another thought: in a regular n-gon, the number of rectangles is given by floor(n/4) * floor(n/4). But for n=12, that would be 3*3=9, which matches our earlier count.

Wait, perhaps that's a formula I can use.

But I'm not sure about the formula's origin. It might be specific to certain n-gons.

But if I accept that for n=12, the number is 9, then that would match.

So, putting it all together, the number of rectangles is 9.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to list all possible rectangles.

From step pair (1,4):

1. 0,1,5,4

2. 1,2,6,5

3. 2,3,7,6

4. 3,4,8,7

5. 4,5,9,8

6. 5,6,10,9

7. 6,7,11,10

8. 7,8,0,11

9. 8,9,1,0

10.9,10,2,1

11.10,11,3,2

12.11,0,4,3

But as each rectangle is counted four times, unique rectangles are 3.

Similarly for (2,5):

1.0,2,7,5

2.1,3,8,6

3.2,4,9,7

4.3,5,10,8

5.4,6,11,9

6.5,7,0,10

7.6,8,1,11

8.7,9,2,0

9.8,10,3,1

10.9,11,4,2

11.10,0,5,3

12.11,1,6,4

Again, 3 unique rectangles.

For (3,6):

1.0,3,6,9

2.1,4,7,10

3.2,5,8,11

4.3,6,9,0

5.4,7,10,1

6.5,8,11,2

7.6,9,0,3

8.7,10,1,4

9.8,11,2,5

10.9,0,3,6

11.10,1,4,7

12.11,2,5,8

Again, 3 unique rectangles.

So, in total, 3 +3 +3=9 rectangles.

Therefore, the answer should be 9.


To solve the problem of finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we analyze the possible step pairs that form perpendicular vectors.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding Perpendicular Vectors**:  
   In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is separated by 30 degrees. For two vectors to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90 degrees. This occurs when the difference in their step sizes is 3 (i.e., |a - b| = 3). This gives the valid step pairs: (1, 4), (2, 5), and (3, 6).

2. **Counting Rectangles for Each Step Pair**:  
   For each valid step pair (a, b), rectangles are formed by starting at each vertex and moving along the steps. Each rectangle is counted four times (once for each corner), so the number of unique rectangles per step pair is 12 / 4 = 3.

3. **Total Number of Rectangles**:  
   Since there are three valid step pairs, each contributing 3 unique rectangles, the total number of rectangles is 3 × 3 = 9.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{9}
