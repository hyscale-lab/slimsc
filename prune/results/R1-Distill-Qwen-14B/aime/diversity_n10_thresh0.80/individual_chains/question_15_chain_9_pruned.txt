Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, they have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, but maybe in any order. So, without any restrictions, the total number of paths would be the number of ways to arrange these steps. That's a combination problem, right? So it's 16 choose 8, which is 12870. But wait, that's without considering direction changes.

The problem specifies that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I think each direction change happens when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, each time the path changes direction, it's like starting a new segment of movement.

Let me visualize this. Suppose the path starts moving right, then at some point turns up, then right again, and so on. Each turn is a direction change. So, for four direction changes, how many segments of movement do we have?

If the path changes direction four times, that means it has five segments. Because the first segment is without any change, then each change starts a new segment. So, five segments in total.

Now, each segment must consist of either moving right or up. Since the path starts at the lower left, I think the first segment could be either right or up. Wait, no, actually, on a grid, you can choose to go right or up first. So, the initial direction isn't fixed.

So, in general, the path alternates between right and up segments. So, for each of the five segments, it's either right or up, alternating. So, the number of direction changes being four would mean the path alternates four times, so the number of segments is five.

Wait, but how can that be? Let me think. If I have four direction changes, that splits the path into five segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. The sequence of directions alternates between right and up or up and right.

So, for example, a path could start with a right segment, then up, then right, then up, then right. Or it could start
