Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I have to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That's because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p must divide 8 but not 4, right? Because n⁴ ≡ -1 means it's not 1 mod p, so the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group modulo p has order p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but that's just for p dividing n⁴ +1. But here, the question is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So p must be such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². I think this requires a higher-order condition.

I recall from number theory that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue, but here it's about quartic residues. So maybe I need to look into primes where 8 divides p-1 because the multiplicative order of n modulo p² needs to be considered.

Wait, let me think again. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then (n²)² ≡ -1 mod p². So, -1 must be a quadratic residue modulo p². But for -1 to be a quadratic residue mod p², it must also be a quadratic residue mod p. Since we're dealing with p ≡ 1 mod 4, because p² divides n⁴ + 1, and if p were 2, let's see, n⁴ +1 is even, but 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 when n is even or odd. Let me check: If n is even, n=2k, then n⁴=16k⁴, so n⁴ +1 = 16k⁴ +1, which is 1 mod 4, so 4 doesn't divide it. If n is odd, n=2k+1, then n⁴ = (16k⁴ + 32k³ + 24k² + 8k +1), so mod 4, that's 1. So n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 4. So 4 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 either. So p can't be 2. So p must be an odd prime.

So p ≡ 1 mod 4, and from earlier, since the order is 8, p must be 1 mod 8. So the primes we're looking at are 17, 97,  etc., but I need the least such p.

Wait, wait, hold on. Let me get this straight. If p² divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². So the multiplicative order of n modulo p² must divide 8. But n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², so the order can't be 4, because that would imply n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p², which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1. Therefore, the order must be 8. So 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group modulo p², which is p(p-1). So 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is 1 mod 8, p-1 is divisible by 8, so p(p-1) is divisible by
