Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down and figure out how to approach it.

First, the problem states there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but we only need to place some of them on the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. Also, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Additionally, the arrangement should be such that if we add any more chips, it would violate one or more of these conditions. So, the final arrangement must be maximal in some wayâ€”meaning it can't have any more chips added without breaking the rules.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. Each row can have either all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But wait, each row and column must have chips of the same color if they have any. So, if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color, and similarly for the columns.

Wait a second, that seems a bit conflicting. Because if a row has all white chips, then every column that intersects this row must also have white chips. But if a column has any chips, all must be the same color. So, if a column intersects a row that's white, then maybe the column must be white? Or maybe not, because the column could have no chips in that particular row but white chips elsewhere.

Wait, no. If a column has any chips, all of them must be the same color. So, suppose in a column, if there's a white chip in a particular row, then that entire column must be white, right? Because all chips in the same column must be the same color.

Wait, but the same logic applies to the row. If in a row, there's a white chip in a column, then the entire row must be white. So, the color assignments are interdependent between rows and columns.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using a bipartite graph, maybe. Let me think. The rows and columns form a bipartition, and the color assignments would correspond to selecting edges or something. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is either white, black, or empty. But with the constraint that if a row is white,
