Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, interesting. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Let me try to visualize this. There are two rectangles. The first one is ABCD. So, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, ABCD must have AB and CD as one pair of sides, and BC and AD as the other pair. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so EF and GH are one pair, and FG and EH are the other.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, that means they lie on a straight line. So, if I imagine the line D-E-C-F, it's a straight line. Let me arrange the rectangles such that this line is a common side or something. Wait, but D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and E is a corner of rectangle EFGH. So, perhaps the rectangles are placed such that this line is a side for both? Not sure yet.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That means the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. This might be useful because cyclic quadrilaterals have some properties, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or the power of a point.

Let me note down all the given lengths:

- BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of the sides. So, BC is a vertical or horizontal side? Well, in a rectangle, typically we can consider AB and CD as the lengths, and BC and AD as the widths. So if BC = 16, then AD would also be 16.

- AB = 107. So AB is the length of the rectangle ABCD, making CD also 107.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH:

- FG = 17. So FG is one side, making EH also 17.

- EF = 184. So EF is the length, making GH also 184.

So, rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16, and rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me think about their arrangement. Since D is a corner of ABCD and E is a corner of EFGH, and both are on the same line. Similarly, C is another corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH.

Wait, maybe the line D-E-C-F is a diagonal line? Or perhaps it's a side line where both rectangles are adjacent. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Suppose I have rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. Let me denote the points: A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. So, points D and C are at the bottom. Now, EFGH is another rectangle; points E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps E and F are placed along the line that extends from D to C.

Wait, actually, if D and C are adjacent corners in ABCD, then the line DC is one side. But in the problem, D, E, C, F are collinear, so E and F lie somewhere on the line DC. But wait, in rectangle ABCD, DC is a side. So, if E and F are on DC, but E is a corner of EFGH, and F is another corner.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles are placed such that DC is a side of ABCD, and EFGH is placed such that E is on DC beyond D, and F is on DC beyond C.

Alternatively, maybe E and F are on DC but in between D and C? Hmm, not sure yet.

But since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, that gives some constraints on the positions.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinate system can help.

Let me set up a coordinate system where point D is at (0, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 0), because DC is the length 107. Point B would be at (107, 16), and point A at (0, 16).

So, ABCD has coordinates:

- D: (0, 0)
- C: (107, 0)
- B: (107, 16)
- A: (0, 16)

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Points E, F, G, H. The problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F lie on the line DC, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107, 0). So, if E and F are on this line, then their y-coordinates are 0.

But wait, E and F are corners of rectangle EFGH. So, let me denote their coordinates.

Suppose E is at (x, 0) and F is at (y, 0), where x < y, but since D and C are at (0,0) and (107, 0), E could be on the extension beyond D (x < 0) or
