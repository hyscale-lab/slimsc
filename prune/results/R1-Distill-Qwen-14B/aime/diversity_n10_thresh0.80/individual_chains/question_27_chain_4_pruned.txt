Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the plane of the circle, 6 units away from the center. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent along a circle, which gives us r_i, the radius of the inner tangent circle. Similarly, when the torus rests outside the sphere, it's tangent along another circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I should probably find expressions for r_i and r_o in terms of the given radii of the torus and the sphere.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. The torus has a major radius, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation. That's 6 in this case. The minor radius is the radius of the generating circle, which is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is nestled inside. The internal tangent circle would be where the torus just touches the sphere on the inside. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's touching the sphere externally along a circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. For a torus, the surface can be described in 3D coordinates, but maybe there's a way to relate the tangent circles' radii using distances.

Let me think about the geometry.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the sphere is at some point, and the torus is around it. The point of tangency would be where the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface is equal to the sphere's radius minus something?

Wait, no, when the torus is inside, the sphere has radius 11. The torus must be entirely inside, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's innermost point plus the torus's minor radius should equal the sphere's radius?

Hmm, maybe I should model the torus mathematically.

The torus can be represented parametrically as:
x = (R + r cosθ) cosφ
y = (R + r cosθ) sinφ
z = r sinθ
where R is the major radius (6), r is the minor radius (3), θ and φ are angles.

But maybe there's a better approach. Let me consider the cross-section. If I take a cross-section in the plane of the generating circle, the torus will look like two circles of radius 3, each centered at points 6 units away from the origin on opposite sides. So, in the cross-section, the torus is like two circles, each with radius 3, centered at (6,0) and (-6,0). But wait, when rotated, it's a surface of revolution, so in cross-section, it's just a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the sphere's center must coincide with the torus's center, right? Because otherwise, the torus would have to be asymmetric relative to the sphere's center, which might complicate things. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere and torus are concentric when tangent. No, because a torus has a hole, but a sphere is solid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the
