Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then z can be written in polar form as z = r * e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. But since |z| is 4, z can also be written as 4 * (cosθ + i sinθ). Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to write z as 4e^{iθ}.

But maybe I can represent z as 4 times some complex number of unit modulus. Let me think: Let’s say z = 4w, where |w| = 1. That might make the expressions a bit simpler because then 1/z would be (1/4w̄), since |w| = 1. So, 1/z would be (1/4) * (1/w) = (1/4) * w̄. That might help.

So, substituting z = 4w into the expression, we get:

(75 + 117i) * 4w + (96 + 144i)/(4w).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First part: (75 + 117i) * 4w. Let me compute (75 + 117i) * 4.

75*4 = 300, 117*4 = 468. So that's 300 + 468i. So the first term is (300 + 468i) w.

Second part: (96 + 144i)/(4w) = (96/4 + 144/4i)/w = (24 + 36i)/w.

So the entire expression becomes (300 + 468i)w + (24 + 36i)/w.

Since w is a complex number with |w| = 1, w̄ = 1/w. So, 1/w is equal to w̄. Therefore, (24 + 36i)/w = (24 + 36i)w̄.

So now the expression is (300 + 468i)w + (24 + 36i)w̄.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression, and then find its maximum value.

Let me denote Re[(300 + 468i)w + (24 + 36i)w̄].

I can split this into two parts: Re[(300 + 468i)w] + Re[(24 + 36i)w̄].

Let’s compute each real part separately.

First, Re[(300 + 468i)w]. If w = e^{iθ}, then Re[(300 + 468i)w] = Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}].

Similarly, Re[(24 + 36i)w̄] = Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}], because w̄ = e^{-iθ}.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express w as cosθ + i sinθ. Let me write w = cosθ + i sinθ, and w̄ = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's compute each term:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).
Multiply this out:
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ
Because i^2 = -1.

So, the real part of this is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).
Multiply this out:
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)i + 36 sinθ
Because i^2 = -1.

So, the real part of this is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding the two real parts together:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Calculating the coefficients:

300 + 24 = 324
-468 + 36 = -432

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, this is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. I remember that any expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude, given by sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is the phase shift.

Alternatively, the maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²).

Wait, but in my case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, A is 324, and B is -432. The maximum value will be sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324
