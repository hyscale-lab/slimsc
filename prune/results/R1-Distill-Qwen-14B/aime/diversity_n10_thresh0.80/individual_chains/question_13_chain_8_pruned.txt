Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will her walk take, including the t minutes in the coffee shop?

Hmm. So, the key here is to find out how long her walk takes when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h. But first, I think I need to find the values of s and t. Because the problem gives me two different scenarios with different speeds and different total times, including t minutes of coffee shop time.

Wait, the total time includes the walking time plus the coffee shop time. So, I can set up equations based on that.

Let me write down what I know.

First scenario:
- Speed = s km/h
- Distance = 9 km
- Total time = 4 hours, which includes t minutes of coffee.

Second scenario:
- Speed = s + 2 km/h
- Distance = 9 km
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes, which includes t minutes of coffee.

I need to convert the time into hours because the speed is in km/h. So, t is in minutes, but I think I should convert it to hours to keep the units consistent.

Wait, but in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4 hours, and t minutes. So, the walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, so the walking time is 2h24m minus t minutes.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the equations in terms of hours. Let me try that.

Let me denote t as the time in hours. Wait, no. Because the problem says t minutes. So, t is in minutes. So, I can convert the coffee time into hours by dividing by 60.

In the first scenario:

Total time = 4 hours = walking time + coffee time.

Walking time = 9 km / s km/h = 9/s hours.

Coffee time = t minutes = t/60 hours.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, in the second scenario:

Speed = s + 2 km/h.

Walking time = 9/(s+2) hours.

Coffee time = t/60 hours.

Total time = 2h24m = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2
