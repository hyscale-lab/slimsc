Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it must be a special kind of hexagon. Maybe similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with equal angles. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but here, it's just equilateral, not regular. So the angles could be different.

Given that opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is what's called a "zonogon," right? Because zonogons are convex polygons with opposite sides equal and parallel. So, yeah, that makes sense here.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me try to imagine this. Each of these sides is being extended until they meet to form a triangle. So, the extensions of AB and CD meet at a point, and similarly for the other pairs. That triangle is given with sides 200, 240, 300.

I think I need to relate the triangle's sides to the sides of the hexagon. Since every extension of these sides leads to a triangle, the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle.

Wait, maybe similar triangles come into play here. If I can find ratios of sides or something.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

But because the sides are opposite and parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by translating each side to the opposite side. So, for example, AB translated by some vector gives DE, but since it's a hexagon, maybe the vectors are related.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the hexagon as a combination of a smaller triangle similar to the given triangle, but scaled down by some factor due to the extensions.

Wait, another approach: in such a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also equal in length. So, if I consider the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF, this triangle is actually the "outer" triangle, and the hexagon is somehow nested inside it.

Let
