Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let's try to unpack this.

First, Alice picks a set A. A is a set of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of elements in A.

So, let's rephrase. For each element m in A, how many finite nonempty sets B have maximum element m? Then, the total number of such sets is the sum over each m in A of the number of subsets where m is the maximum. 

Wait, because for each m in A, the sets B with maximum m are exactly the sets where all elements are less than or equal to m, and at least one element is equal to m. So, for each m, the number of such sets is 2^{m-1}. Because we can choose any subset of the numbers from 1 to m-1, and then include m. So the number is 2^{m-1}.

Therefore, if A is a set with elements m1, m2, ..., mk, then the total number of B sets is the sum over each mi of 2^{mi - 1}.

Wait, but we have to make sure that these sets B are unique. So, for example, if A has elements 1 and 2, then the sets with max 1 are {1}, and the sets with max 2 are {2}, {1,2}. So total of 1 + 2 = 3 sets. So 2^{1-1} + 2^{2-1} = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches.

Okay, so the total number of sets is the sum over all m in A of 2^{m - 1}.

Given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, that means sum_{m in A} 2^{m - 1} = 2024.

So we need to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{m -1} for all m in A is 2024. Then find the sum of elements of A.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{m-1} over m in A equals 2024.

Hmm, okay. So perhaps A is a set where each m is chosen so that 2^{m-1} is a part of the binary representation of 2024. Wait, because 2024 is a number, and if we break it down into powers of 2, perhaps the exponents plus one will give the elements of A.

Wait, let's test this idea. Let me see.

First, let's factorize 2024.

2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2 = 1012.

1012 /
