Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω¹³ = 1, and ωᵏ for k from 0 to 12 are all distinct roots. So, maybe I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something related to roots of unity here.

The expression given is a product: ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). Wait, but when k=0, ω⁰ is 1, right? So the term when k=0 is 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). So I can ignore the k=0 term because it's 1.

So now, the problem reduces to finding the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). Hmm. Maybe I can write that expression in a different form. Let me see: 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let's factor out ω²ᵏ? Wait, no, that might not help. Alternatively, let's factor out 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ωᵏ) + ω²ᵏ. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in ωᵏ.

Wait, the expression is 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let me write it as ω²ᵏ - 2ωᵏ + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in ωᵏ. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let me try to factor it.

Let me consider the quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0. The roots would be [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, ω²ᵏ - 2ωᵏ + 2 = (ωᵏ - (1 + i))(ωᵏ - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product can be written as (ωᵏ - (1 + i))(ωᵏ - (1 - i)). So, the entire product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of (ωᵏ - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (ωᵏ - (1 - i)).

So, that's the same as [product_{k=1}^{12} (ωᵏ - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=1}^{12} (ωᵏ - (1 - i))]. Hmm, okay, so I can compute each product separately.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ωᵏ) for k=1 to n-1 is the minimal polynomial for ω, but I'm not sure exactly. Wait, more precisely, the minimal polynomial for ω is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x), which is of degree 12 because 13 is prime. But here, the product is over (x - ωᵏ) for k=1 to 12 is Φ₁₃(x), which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1.
