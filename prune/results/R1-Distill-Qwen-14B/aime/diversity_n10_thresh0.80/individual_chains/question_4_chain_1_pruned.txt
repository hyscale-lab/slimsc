Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about game theory here. This seems like a classic combinatorial game where we can determine winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can force a win.

So, let's model this. Let's define a position as losing (P-position) if the current player will lose with optimal play, and a winning position (N-position) otherwise.

The base case is when there are 0 tokens left. But wait, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over, and the player who just moved has already taken the last token, so the next player can't move. So, 0 tokens is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But in this setup, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=0, the game is already over, so the previous player has won. So maybe I should adjust my understanding.

Wait, let's think about n=1. If n=1, Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice. Similarly, n=4: Alice can take all 4 and win. So n=4 is also a winning position.

What about n=2? Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last token and wins. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but that's not possible because n=2 <4. So Alice is forced to take 1, leaving Bob to win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the problem statement, the player who removes the last token wins. So if Alice leaves 1 token for Bob, Bob can take it and win. So actually, when n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then can take that and win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terminology. Let me clarify: a P-position is a losing position for the player about to move. So if n=0, the player can't move, so it's a P-position. For n=1, the player can take 1 token and win, so it's an N-position. For n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then can win. Wait, no, because if n=2, you can take 1, leaving n=1, which is an N-position for the opponent, meaning the opponent can win. So if you leave the opponent in an N-position, that's good for you because the opponent can win. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In standard game theory, a position is a P-position if the previous player can force a win, i.e., the current player cannot. So, if n=0, current player can't
