Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that if you change any single digit of N to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. My goal is to find the largest such N and then compute Q + R, where Q is N divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Let me try to break this down.

First, let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A can be from 1 to 9, and B, C, D can be from 0 to 9.

The condition is that if any one digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position (A, B, C, D), changing that digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's think about each digit:

1. If we change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7.
2. If we change B to 1, the number becomes A1CD, which must be divisible by 7.
3. If we change C to 1, the number becomes AB1D, which must be divisible by 7.
4. If we change D to 1, the number becomes ABC1, which must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, it's logical to start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies all these conditions.

But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of numbers divisible by 7. Divisibility by 7 isn't as straightforward as some other numbers, but there are tricks. For example, you can take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, knowing that a number is divisible by 7 if it's congruent to 0 modulo 7. So, perhaps I can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and set up congruence equations.

Let me try that.

Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When we change a digit to 1, depending on which digit it is, the modified number can be expressed as:

1. Change A to 1: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.
2. Change B to 1: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.
3. Change C to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.
4. Change D to 1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So, mathematically, we can write:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm. Let's compute each of these modulo 7. Since 1000, 100, 10, etc., can be reduced mod 7 first.

Let me compute the coefficients modulo 7.

1000 mod 7: 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7: 3, since 10-7=3.

1 mod7: 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C +1 ≡ 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡ 0 mod7

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7
4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡ 0 mod7

Let me write these as:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7 ≡ 5 mod7
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7 ≡ 4 mod7
4. 6A + 2B +3C ≡ -1 mod7 ≡ 6 mod7

So, we have four equations:

(1) 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod7
(2) 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod7
(3) 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod7
(4) 6A + 2B +3C ≡ 6 mod7

Hmm. Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - equation (1):

(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ 5 -1 mod7
So, 6A -2B ≡4 mod7
Let me write that as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

We can factor out a 2: 2(3A - B) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed). So:

3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Let me note that as equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - equation (1):

(6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡4 -1 mod7
So, 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Factor out 3: 3(2A - C) ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3, since 3 and 7 are coprime.

2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Let me note that as equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Now, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - equation (3):

(6A + 2B +3C) - (6A + 2B + D) ≡6 -4 mod7
So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Let me write that as equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, now I have equations (5), (6), (7).

Equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7
Equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7
Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7

And we still have equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

So, perhaps we can express B, C, D in terms of A.

From equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7 => B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Similarly, from equation (6): 2A - C ≡1 mod7 => C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7 => D ≡3C -2 mod7.

So, let's express all variables in terms of A.

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

D ≡3*(2A -1) -2 mod7 = 6A -3 -2 = 6A -5 mod7.

So, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

Now, let's plug these into equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Substituting B, C, D:

2*(3A -2) +3*(2A -1) + (6A -5) ≡1 mod7.

Let's compute each term:

2*(3A -2) =6A -4
3*(2A -1) =6A -3
D =6A -5

Adding them up:

6A -4 +6A -3 +6A -5 = (6A +6A +6A) + (-4 -3 -5) =18A -12.

Now, 18A mod7: 18 divided by7 is 2*7=14, remainder 4. So 18A ≡4A mod7.

-12 mod7: Let's compute 12 divided by7 is 1*7=7, remainder5. So -12 ≡ -5 mod7, but -5 mod7 is 2.

So, 18A -12 ≡4A +2 mod7.

Set this equal to 1 mod7:

4A +2 ≡1 mod7 => 4A ≡ -1 mod7 ≡6 mod7.

So, 4A ≡6 mod7.

We can solve for A: Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2, because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, A ≡6*2 mod7 => A≡12 mod7 => A≡5 mod7.

Since A is a digit from 1 to9, possible values for A are 5, 12 (but 12 is invalid since A is a single digit), so only A=5.

Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, but 5 +7=12, which is beyond single digit. So A=5.

So, A=5.

Now, let's find B, C, D based on A=5.

From equation (5): B≡3A -2 mod7 => 3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So B=6 or B=6 +7k. Since B is a digit (0-9), possible B=6 or 6+7=13 (invalid). So B=6.

From equation (6): C≡2A -1 mod7 =>2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So C=2 or 2+7=9. Since C is a digit, possible C=2 or 9.

From equation (7): D≡6A -5 mod7 =>6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7 (since 25/7=3*7=21, remainder4). So D=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So D=4.

Wait, let me double-check that: D≡6A -5 mod7. For A=5: 6*5=30, 30-5=25. 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So yes, D≡4 mod7, so D=4.

But wait, let's go back to C. From equation (6), C≡2A -1 mod7. For A=5, this is 10-1=9≡2 mod7. So C can be 2 or 9.

So, C is either 2 or 9.

But since we are looking for the greatest possible N, which is a four-digit number, we want to maximize N. So, let's see which choice of C gives a larger N.

If C=9, that's higher than C=2, so perhaps we should take C=9. But wait, let's check if that's possible.

Wait, but if C=9, let's make sure that all the conditions hold. Because sometimes, even if a variable can take a higher value, substituting it might not satisfy the other equations.

Wait, no. Because when we substituted A=5, we found the congruence conditions for B, C, D. So, for B, it's fixed at 6. For C, it's either 2 or 9. For D, it's fixed at 4.

But wait, is C allowed to be 9? Let me check equation (1): 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

We have B=6, D=4, and C is either 2 or9.

Let's check both cases:

Case 1: C=2.

2*6 +3*2 +4 =12 +6 +4=22. 22 mod7: 7*3=21, so 22-21=1. So 22≡1 mod7. That satisfies equation (1).

Case 2: C=9.

2*6 +3*9 +4=12 +27 +4=43. 43 mod7: 7*6=42, so 43-42=1. So 43≡1 mod7. Also satisfies equation (1).

So both C=2 and C=9 satisfy equation (1) when A=5, B=6, D=4.

So, N can be either 5 6 2 4 or 5 6 9 4.

But since we want the greatest N, which is larger: 5694 or 5624? 5694 is larger. So, we can take C=9 and D=4, giving N=5694.

Wait, but let's make sure that all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Because changing each digit to1 should give a number divisible by7. So, let's test N=5694.

Changing each digit to1:

1. Change A to1: 1694. Is 1694 divisible by7?

Let me compute 1694 ÷7.

7*242=1694. Because 7*240=1680, 7*2=14, so 1680+14=1694. So yes, 1694 is divisible by7.

2. Change B to1: 5194. Is 5194 divisible by7?

Compute 5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194? Let's see: 7*700=4900, 7*40=280, 7*2=14. 4900+280=5180, 5180+14=5194. Yes, it is.

3. Change C to1: 5614. Is 5614 divisible by7?

Compute 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Because 7*800=5600, 7*2=14, so 5600+14=5614. So yes.

4. Change D to1: 5691. Is 5691 divisible by7?

Compute 5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. 7*800=5600, 7*13=91, so 5600+91=5691. Yes.

So, N=5694 satisfies all the conditions. But wait, is it the largest possible?

Because earlier, when I found A=5, B=6, and C can be either 2 or9, I chose C=9 to get 5694. But maybe there's a larger N with A=5 and higher digits.

Wait, but let's check if C can be higher than9, but since C is a single digit, the maximum is9. So 5694 is the largest possible with A=5.

But wait, perhaps N can be larger than 5694? Because 5694 is just 5 thousand something. There could be larger numbers with A=6, but in my solution above, I found A=5.

Wait, hold on. When I solved for A, I concluded A≡5 mod7. So possible A=5, 12, 19, etc. But since A is a digit (1-9), only A=5 is possible.

So, A must be5. So, N must be in the 5000s. So, 5694 is the largest possible N in the 5000s with the given property.

Wait, but let's think again. Is there a larger N with A=5?

Wait, 5694 is the largest in the 5000s because the thousands digit is5, and we've maximized the hundreds, tens, and units digits. So, 5694 would be the maximum possible N.

But hold on, let me see if there's a number larger than 5694 with the same property. For example, 5694 is followed by 5695, 5696, ..., up to 9999. But since our analysis shows that only A=5 satisfies the condition, all higher numbers with A>5 (i.e., 6000 to9999) cannot satisfy the condition. Because when we solved the congruence, A had to be5 mod7, which in the digit range is only5.

So, 5694 is indeed the maximum possible N.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let's take another number, say 5694 +1 =5695. Changing its digits:

Change A to1: 1695. 1695 ÷7: 7*242=1694, 1695 is 1694+1, so remainder1. Not divisible by7. So, 5695 doesn't satisfy the condition. So, N can't be higher than5694.

So, N=5694 is the number.

Then, Q is N divided by1000, which is the thousands digit part. So, 5694 ÷1000=5.694, so Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about Q and R.

Wait, when you divide N by1000, the quotient Q is the integer part, and R is the remainder. So, 5694 divided by1000 is5 with a remainder of694. So, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q + R =5 +694=699.

But before I get too confident, let me make sure I didn't miss any possibilities where A=5 but with a higher N.

Wait, for instance, if C=9, D=4, as in 5694, but what if C=9 and D=11? But D must be a single digit, so D=4 is the only possibility.

Alternatively, could N be 5994 or something? Let me see.

Wait, but N=5994. Let's see if changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Change A to1: 1994. 1994 ÷7: 7*284=1988, 1994-1988=6. Not divisible by7. So, N=5994 doesn't work.

So, 5994 is invalid. Thus, 5694 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, another thought: Suppose I make C=9, but D is something else, can that work? But according to our earlier analysis, D must be4 when A=5.

So, D is fixed at4. So, the last digit is4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but let's see if N=5694 is indeed the maximum. Could there be a larger N with A=5, but B higher than6?

Wait, for A=5, B was determined as6. Because from equation (5): B≡3A -2 mod7. So, with A=5, B≡13 mod7=6 mod7. So, B=6.

So, B can't be higher because it's fixed by the congruence.

Similarly, C=9 is allowed because it's 2 mod7. So, it's allowed.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

So, Q is5, R is694, so Q+R=699.

But wait, let me just check if N=5694 is indeed the correct number.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the congruence steps? Let me recheck.

We had four equations:

(1) 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7
(2) 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7
(3) 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7
(4) 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Then, we subtracted (1) from (2) to get 6A -2B≡4 mod7 =>3A - B≡2 mod7.

Subtract (1) from (3): 6A -3C≡3 mod7 =>2A - C≡1 mod7.

Subtract (3) from (4): 3C - D≡2 mod7.

So, B=3A-2 mod7, C=2A-1 mod7, D=3C-2 mod7.

Substituting back into equation (1), we arrived at A≡5 mod7, so A=5.

So, with A=5, B=6, C=2 or9, D=4.

Wait, but when I substituted C=9, equation (1) still held because 2B +3C + D=12 +27 +4=43≡1 mod7.

So, that's correct.

So, N=5694 is the maximum, Q=5, R=694, sum=699.

But wait, let me think again. What if N is 5894? Let's see if it satisfies the conditions.

Wait, N=5894. Let's change each digit to1:

1. 1894: 1894 ÷7=270.571... Not an integer. So, 1894 is not divisible by7. Thus, N=5894 doesn't work.

Hence, 5694 is indeed the maximum.

So, the final answer is 699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

1. Let \( N = ABCD \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are digits. The conditions are:
   - Changing \( A \) to 1: \( 1BCD \) is divisible by 7.
   - Changing \( B \) to 1: \( A1CD \) is divisible by 7.
   - Changing \( C \) to 1: \( AB1D \) is divisible by 7.
   - Changing \( D \) to 1: \( ABC1 \) is divisible by 7.

2. Using modular arithmetic, we derive four congruences:
   - \( 2B + 3C + D \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( 6A + 3C + D \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( 6A + 2B + D \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
   - \( 6A + 2B + 3C \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)

3. Solving these congruences, we find:
   - \( A \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \) ⟹ \( A = 5 \)
   - \( B \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) ⟹ \( B = 6 \)
   - \( C \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) ⟹ \( C = 2 \) or \( C = 9 \)
   - \( D \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \) ⟹ \( D = 4 \)

4. To maximize \( N \), we choose \( C = 9 \), giving \( N = 5694 \).

5. Dividing \( N \) by 1000:
   - \( Q = 5 \), \( R = 694 \)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{699}\).
