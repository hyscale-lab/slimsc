Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus T can rest inside or outside of this sphere, touching it along a circle. When T is inside, it's internally tangent, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent. The problem asks for the difference between the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then to express this difference as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to find the radii of the circles where T is tangent to S in both the internal and external cases.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. The torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, so any cross-section perpendicular to the axis of the torus will be a circle. The sphere S has a constant radius of 11, so when the torus is tangent to S, the distance between their centers must relate to their radii.

Wait, the torus is a bit more complex because it's a surface in 3D. So, when it's inside the sphere, the sphere contains the torus, and they touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus encloses the sphere and they touch along another circle.

I think I should model this in a coordinate system. Let me imagine the axis of the torus is along the z-axis. The center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) when the torus is inside the sphere. Wait, actually, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle would be at a point that is (6 - 3, 0, 0) or something? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the distance between the centers.

No, perhaps a better approach is to consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus. Since the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers plus the radius of the sphere and the minor radius of the torus must relate to the point of tangency.

Wait, maybe I can model the torus as a surface with a major radius R (6) and minor radius r (3). The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus is something, and when it's outside, it's another value.

Let me denote the center of the sphere as O, and the center of the generating circle of the torus as C.
