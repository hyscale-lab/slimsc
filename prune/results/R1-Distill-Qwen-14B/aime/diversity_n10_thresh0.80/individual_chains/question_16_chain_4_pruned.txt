Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². And then give the answer as an integer in a box.

Alright, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

I remember that for primes p, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², which is 1. So the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1, the order can't be 4 because (-1)^2 = 1, so the order is 8.

Wait, so the multiplicative order of n modulo p² is 8. But for this to be possible, the multiplicative group modulo p² must have an element of order 8. I remember that the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic if p is an odd prime, except when p=2, where it's cyclic if p² is 2 or 4, but for higher powers, it's not cyclic.

Wait, no, actually, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic for odd primes p. So, if p is an odd prime, then the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, for there to be an element of order 8 in this group, 8 must divide the order of the group, which is p(p-1). So, 8 divides p(p-1).

Since p is prime, p and p-1 are coprime. Therefore, 8 must divide either p or p-1. But p is prime, so p can't be divisible by 8 unless p=2. So, if p is an odd prime, 8 must divide p-1. So, p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, so p must be 1 mod 8. So the smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc. But wait, 17 is the first one. But is that the case?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because for p=2, let's check if 2² divides n⁴ +1. Let's try n=1: 1+1=2. 2 is not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82. 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, so not an integer. n=5: 625+1=626. 626/4=156.5. Not integer. Hmm, so maybe p=2 doesn't satisfy the condition. Let me see. So p=2: Does there exist n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? Let's check n=1: 1+1=2, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 82 mod 4 is 2, so no. n=0: 0+1=1, which isn't divisible by 4. So, no solution for p=2.

So the next candidate is p=5? Wait, wait. Wait, I thought p must be 1 mod 8. But maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps p=5? Let me try n=2: 16 +1=17. 17 mod 25 is 17, which isn't 0. n=3: 81 +1=82. 82 mod 25 is 6, not 0. n=7: 7⁴ is 2401. 2401 +1=2402. 2402 divided by 25 is 96.08, so no.

Wait, maybe p=17? Let me try n=4. 4⁴=256. 256+1=257. 257 mod 289 is 257, which is not 0. Hmm, maybe I need a better approach.

I remember that primes p for which n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has solutions are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. Because the multiplicative order of n modulo p would be 8, which divides p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8. But here, it's modulo p², which is a bit different.

Wait, but maybe Hensel's lemma can be applied here. If n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, and if certain conditions are met, we can lift it to a solution mod p². So let's think about that.

First, find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Then, check whether it can be lifted to a solution mod p².

So, let's start with the smallest primes and see.

p=2: As before, no solution.

p=3: Let's see, n⁴ mod 3. Since 3 is small, let's compute n⁴ mod 3 for n=1,2.

1⁴=1 mod3=1

2⁴=16 mod3=1

So, n⁴ ≡ 1 mod3. So, n⁴ +1 ≡ 2 mod3. So, no solution where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod3.

p=5: Let's compute n⁴ mod5.

n=1:1, n=2:16 mod5=1, n=3:81 mod5=1, n=4:256 mod5=1. So, n⁴ ≡1 mod5 always. So n⁴ +1≡2 mod5. So no solution for p=5.

p=7: Let's compute n⁴ mod7.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7=4

n=4:256 mod7: 256 /7=36*7=252, 256-252=4, so 4.

n=5: 625 mod7: 625 /7=89*7=623, 625-623=2.

n=6: 1296 mod7: 1296 /7=185*7=1295, 1296-1295=1.

So n⁴ mod7 can be 1,2,4. So, n⁴ +1 mod7 can be 2,3,5. So no solution, since -1 mod7 is 6. So no solution for p=7.

Next prime p=11.

Compute n⁴ mod11.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod11=5

n=3:81 mod11=4

n=4:256 mod11: 256/11=23*11=253, 256-253=3

n=5:625 mod11. 625/11=56*11=616, 625-616=9.

n=6:1296 mod11: 1296-117*11=1296-1287=9.

Wait, no, let me compute 1296 ÷11. 11*117=1287, so 1296-1287=9.

Similarly, n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401 ÷11: 11*218=2398, 2401-2398=3.

n=8:4096 mod11. 4096 - 372*11=4096-4092=4.

n=9:6561 mod11. 6561 - 596*11=6561-6556=5.

n=10:10⁴=10000 mod11. 10000 ÷11 is 909*11=9999, so 10000-9999=1.

So n⁴ mod11 can be 1,3,4,5,9.

n⁴ +1 mod11 can be 2,4,5,6,10. So, for n⁴ +1≡0 mod11, we need n⁴≡10 mod11. But from above, n⁴ mod11 isn't 10. So no solution for p=11.

Next prime p=13.

Compute n⁴ mod13.

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod13=3

n=3:81 mod13=3

Wait, n=2: 2^4=16 mod13=3

n=3: 81 mod13=81-6*13=81-78=3

n=4: 256 mod13: 256 -19*13=256-247=9

n=5: 625 mod13: 625 -48*13=625-624=1

n=6: 1296 mod13: 1296 -99*13=1296-1287=9

n=7: 2401 mod13: 2401 -184*13=2401-2392=9

Wait, that seems off. Let me compute 7⁴=2401. 2401 ÷13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9. So 9.

n=8:4096 mod13. 4096 ÷13: 13*315=4095, so 4096-4095=1.

n=9:6561 mod13: 6561 ÷13. 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9.

n=10:10000 mod13: 10000 ÷13=769*13=9997, 10000-9997=3.

n=11:14641 mod13: 14641 ÷13. 13*1126=14638, 14641-14638=3.

n=12:20736 mod13: 20736 ÷13=1595*13=20735, 20736-20735=1.

So n⁴ mod13 can be 1,3,9.

So n⁴ +1 mod13 can be 2,4,10. So, looking for n⁴ +1≡0 mod13, which would require n⁴≡12 mod13. But 12 isn't in {1,3,9}, so no solution for p=13.

Hmm, this is taking longer than I thought. Maybe I should look for the primes where -1 is a quartic residue. Wait, from number theory, I remember that -1 is a quartic residue mod p if and only if p ≡1 mod8. So, the primes p where n⁴ ≡-1 mod p has a solution are primes p≡1 mod8.

So the smallest primes are 17, 97,  etc. So, the least prime p is 17. So let's check p=17.

First, check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

Let's compute n⁴ mod17 for n=1 to 8 (since 17 is prime, and the residues repeat every 16 due to Fermat's little theorem).

n=1:1

n=2:16 mod17=16

n=3:81 mod17: 81-4*17=81-68=13

n=4:256 mod17: 256 ÷17=15*17=255, 256-255=1

n=5:625 mod17: 625 ÷17=36*17=612, 625-612=13

n=6:1296 mod17: Let's compute 6²=36, 6⁴=36²=1296. 1296 ÷17: 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4. So 4.

n=7:7²=49, 49 mod17=15. Then 15²=225 mod17: 225 ÷17=13*17=221, 225-221=4. So 4.

n=8:8²=64 mod17=13. Then 13²=169 mod17=16.

Wait, so n=2:16, n=8:16. So n=2 and n=15 (since 17-2=15), which would give the same result. So, their fourth powers are 16 mod17= -1 mod17.

Wait, n=2: 2⁴=16≡-1 mod17. So, yes, n=2 works for p=17.

So, now, we have a solution n=2 mod17. But we need a solution mod17²=289. So, can we lift this solution to mod289?

This is where Hensel's lemma comes into play. Hensel's lemma allows us to lift solutions from mod p to mod p² under certain conditions. The condition is that the derivative of the function f(n)=n⁴ +1 should not be congruent to 0 mod p at the solution n.

So, let's compute f'(n)=4n³. Evaluate this at n=2 mod17. So f'(2)=4*(8)=32. 32 mod17=32-17=15≡-2 mod17. Since 15 isn't 0 mod17, Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, there exists a unique m ≡2 mod17 such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Our goal is to find the smallest positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 289. So, m must be congruent to 2 mod17, and we need to find the smallest such m where m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Let me try to find such m. Since m ≡2 mod17, we can write m=2 +17k, where k is an integer ≥0. We need to find the smallest k such that (2 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289.

But calculating (2 +17k)^4 mod289 directly might be tedious. Maybe I can compute it step by step, expanding the expression, and find k.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute m=2 +17k, and compute m^4 +1 mod289, looking for when it's 0.

So let's compute m=2: 2⁴+1=17, which is 17 mod289≠0.

m=2+17=19: 19⁴ +1
