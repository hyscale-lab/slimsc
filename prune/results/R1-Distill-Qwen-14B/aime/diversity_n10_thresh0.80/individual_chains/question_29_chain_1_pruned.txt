Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these rectangle and circle theorems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. So, ABCD is a rectangle, which means all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. So, EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. Let's try to visualize this. If I imagine rectangle ABCD, with D being one of the vertices, then E must be another point on the same line as D, C, F.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's the direction I need to go right now.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD with AB = 107, BC =16. So, ABCD is a long rectangle. Then, rectangle EFGH is another one, maybe attached or placed such that D, E, C, F are on a straight line.

Wait, since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is beyond D, and F is somewhere else. Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates to each point so I can visualize it better.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's let point D be at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0), because BC = 16, which is the height, so moving up 16 units from D, point A would be at (0,16), and point B would be at (107,16).

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides AB and BC are adjacent. So, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB is adjacent to BC. So, starting from A, it goes to B, then C, then D. Wait, no, the order depends on how the rectangle is labeled. Let me make sure.

In rectangle ABCD, the points are in order, so AB is one side, BC is the next, CD is the opposite of AB, and DA is the opposite of BC.

So, if I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (x,0). But since BC =16, and BC is adjacent to both B and C. Hmm, maybe it's better to assign coordinates more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps assign point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107,0). BC is 16, so point C would be at (107,16). Then, point D would be at (0,16). That makes ABCD a rectangle.

Yes, that makes sense. So:

A: (0,0)

B: (107,0)

C: (107,16)

D: (0,16)

Okay, that seems correct.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Let's denote the points as E, F, G, H. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal.

Given EF = 184 and FG =17, so EF is one side, FG is another, so the sides are 184 and 17.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line.

Point D is at (0,16), point C is at (107,16). So, the line DC is the line y=16, from (0,16) to (107,16). So, E and F are also on this line.

Wait, so E and F lie on the line y=16 as well. That's because D and C are on y=16.

So, E and F must lie somewhere on the line y=1
