Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting vertices in a symmetric way. But wait, a dodecagon is 12-sided, which is even, so that might make things a bit easier.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices placed equally around a circle. The sides are the edges connecting consecutive vertices, and the diagonals are the lines connecting non-consecutive vertices. So, in this case, the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

I think the key here is to figure out how to choose four vertices that form a rectangle. For a quadrilateral to be a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the diagonals must be equal in length. In a regular polygon, this usually means that the vertices are symmetric with respect to the center.

So, let me think: in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of vertices that are diametrically opposite each other. But wait, not necessarily diametrically opposite—because the distance can vary based on how many steps apart the vertices are around the polygon.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of choosing two pairs of parallel sides. Since the polygon is regular, sides and diagonals that are the same number of steps apart will be parallel. So, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of such lines that are perpendicular to each other.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the dodecagon on a coordinate system. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle, with angles at 30-degree increments (since 360/12 = 30). So, the coordinates of the vertices can be given by (cos θ, sin θ), where θ = 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.

In this coordinate system, a rectangle would be defined by four points such that their coordinates satisfy the properties of a rectangle. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of vectors. For four points a, b, c, d, the vectors a-b and c-d should be equal, and vectors a-d and b-c should be equal, and the sides should be perpendicular.

But maybe this is getting too mathematical. Let me think combinatorially. How many rectangles can be formed by choosing four vertices such that they form a rectangle.

Wait, in a regular n-gon, the number of rectangles can be calculated if we can determine how many pairs of perpendicular diameters exist. Because in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, a diameter connects two opposite vertices. So, in a dodecagon, there are 6 diameters. Each diameter can be paired with another diameter that is perpendicular to it.

Hmm, but wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think. In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected by a diameter to the vertex 6 steps away. So, the diameters are along the lines connecting vertex 0 to 6, 1 to 7, 2 to 8, and so on, up to 5 to 11.

Now, for a rectangle, we need two diameters that are perpendicular to each other. Because the sides of the rectangle would lie along these diameters. So, how many such pairs of perpendicular diameters are there?

In a regular dodecagon, the angle between adjacent diameters is 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, a diameter from vertex 0 to 6 is along the x-axis (if we place the dodecagon with a vertex at (1,0)). The next diameter, from vertex 1 to 7, is at 30 degrees. The diameter from vertex 2 to 8 is at 60 degrees, and so on.

So, to find a pair of perpendicular diameters, we need two diameters whose central angles differ by 90 degrees. Since each diameter is 30 degrees apart, how many such pairs are there?

Well, 90 degrees is 3 steps of 30 degrees. So, for any diameter, the diameters that are perpendicular to it are those 3 steps ahead and 3 steps behind. Let's see:

Take the diameter from 0 to 6. A diameter perpendicular to this would be from 3 to 9, because that's 90 degrees away. Similarly, another perpendicular diameter would be from 6 to 12 (but 12 is same as 0), but wait, 6 is already connected to 0, so perhaps not. Wait, no, the diameters are determined by their starting points. So, the diameter from 3 to 9 is perpendicular to 0-6.

Wait, let me confirm. If the diameter 0-6 is along the x-axis, then the diameter 3-9 would be along the y-axis, which is perpendicular. So, that's one pair. Similarly, the diameter 1-7 is at 30 degrees. A diameter perpendicular to that would be at 30 + 90 = 120 degrees, which is the diameter from 4 to 10. So, 1-7 and 4-10 are perpendicular. Similarly, the diameter 2-8 is at 60 degrees; a perpendicular would be at 150 degrees, which is 5
