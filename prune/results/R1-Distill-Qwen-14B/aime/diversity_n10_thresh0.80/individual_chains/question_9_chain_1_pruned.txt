Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log_x(y^x) equals log_y(x^{4y}) and both of these are equal to 10. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember some logarithm properties. I know that log_b(a) = c can be rewritten as b^c = a. Also, log_b(a^k) is equal to k*log_b(a). So maybe I can use these properties to simplify the given equations.

Let me take the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. I can express this in terms of natural logarithms if that helps. Remember that log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). So substituting that in, the equation becomes x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10. Let me write that as equation (1): x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Similarly, log_y(x) is equal to ln(x)/ln(y). Substituting that in, the equation becomes 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. Let me call this equation (2): 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

So now I have two equations:
1) x * (ln y / ln x) = 10
2) 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find a relationship between x and y.

If I denote equation (1) as x*(ln y / ln x) = 10, I can write this as (x / ln x) * ln y = 10. Similarly, equation (2) can be written as (4y / ln y) * ln x = 10.

Wait, maybe I can express both equations in terms of (ln x) and (ln y). Let me denote a = ln x and b = ln y. So, x = e^a and y = e^b. Then, equation (1) becomes:

e^a * (b / a) = 10.

Equation (2) becomes:

4 e^b * (a / b) = 10.

So now, equation (1): (e^a * b)/a = 10 → (b e^a)/a = 10.

Equation (2): (4 a e^b)/b = 10.

Hmm, now I have these two equations:

1) (b e^a)/a = 10
2) (4 a e^b)/b = 10

Wait, perhaps I can set these two expressions equal to each other or find a ratio. Let me see.

From equation (1), (b e^a)/a = 10 → Let's call this 10 = (b e^a)/a.

From equation (2), (4 a e^b)/b = 10 → Similarly, 10 = (4 a e^b)/b.

So, setting the two expressions equal because both are equal to 10:

(b e^a)/a = (4 a e^b)/b.

Cross-multiplying to eliminate denominators:

b^2 e^a = 4 a^2 e^b.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it.

Divide both sides by e^a:

b^2 = 4 a^2 e^{b - a}.

Or, alternatively, take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponents. Let me try that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln(b^2) = ln(4 a^2 e^{b - a}).

Using logarithm properties:

2 ln b = ln 4 + 2 ln a + (b - a).

Hmm, so 2 ln b = ln 4 + 2 ln a + b - a.

Wait, maybe I can express this as:

2 (ln b - ln a) = ln 4 + (b - a).

But ln b - ln a is ln(y/x), right? Because ln(b) is ln y, and ln(a) is ln x. Wait, no, wait: a = ln x, so ln a is ln(ln x). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, scratch that. Let me think again. a is ln x, so ln a is ln(ln x). Hmm, that might complicate things. Maybe I should find another way.

Let me go back to the equations we had earlier:

From (1): (b e^a)/a = 10 → Let's write this as e^a = (10 a)/b.

From (2): (4 a e^b)/b = 10 → 4 a e^b = 10 b → e^b = (10 b)/(4 a).

So, e^a = (10 a)/b → equation (1a)

e^b = (10 b)/(4 a) → equation (2a)

Now, if I substitute e^a from equation (1a) into equation (2a):

Wait, no, perhaps I can express e^b in terms of e^a.

Wait, let me see: From (1a), e^a = (10 a)/b. So, e^a = 10 a / b.

Similarly, from (2a), e^b = (10 b)/(4 a) = (5 b)/(2 a).

So, let me write e^a and e^b in terms of a and b.

Now, what if I take e^a * e^b?

e^{a + b} = (10 a / b) * (5 b / 2 a) = (10 a * 5 b) / (b * 2 a) ) = (50 a b) / (2 a b) = 50/2 = 25.

So, e^{a + b} = 25.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

a + b = ln(25).

Which is a + b = 2 ln 5, since ln(25) = ln(5^2) = 2 ln 5.

So, a + b = 2 ln 5. Let me remember that.

Now, let's see if I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

From equation (1a): e^a = 10 a / b.

From equation (2a): e^b = 5 b / (2 a).

Hmm, perhaps I can write e^a and e^b in terms of each other.

From (1a): e^a = (10 a)/b → b = (10 a)/e^a.

From (2a): e^b = (5 b)/(2 a).

Substituting b from (1a) into (2a):

e^b = [5 * (10 a / e^a)] / (2 a) ) = (50 a / e^a) / (2 a) ) = (50 a) / (2 a e^a) ) = 25 / e^a.

So, e^b = 25 / e^a → e^{a + b} = e^{a} * e^{b} = e^a * (25 / e^a) ) = 25. Which matches our earlier result that e^{a + b} =25. So that's consistent.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe I need another approach.

Wait, since a + b = 2 ln 5, perhaps I can denote a = 2 ln 5 - b. Let me try that.

So, a = 2 ln 5 - b.

Now, let's substitute this into equation (1a): e^a = (10 a)/b.

So, e^{2 ln 5 - b} = (10 (2 ln 5 - b)) / b.

Simplify the left side: e^{2 ln 5} * e^{-b} = (10 (2 ln 5 - b)) / b.

e^{2 ln 5} is e^{ln(5^2)} = 5^2 =25. So,

25 e^{-b} = (10 (2 ln 5 - b)) / b.

Multiply both sides by b:

25 e^{-b} * b = 10 (2 ln 5 - b).

Divide both sides by 5:

5 e^{-b} * b = 2 (2 ln 5 - b).

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe I can proceed.

Let me rewrite this equation:

5 b e^{-b} = 4 ln 5 - 2 b.

Bring all terms to one side:

5 b e^{-b} + 2 b - 4 ln 5 = 0.

Factor out b:

b (5 e^{-b} + 2) = 4 ln 5.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can let u = b, so it's u (5 e^{-u} + 2) = 4 ln 5.

I could try to solve for u numerically, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution or maybe a particular solution that fits.

Wait, perhaps if I set 5 e^{-b} + 2 = k, then we have b * k = 4 ln 5.

But that might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe I can assume that 5 e^{-b} + 2 is proportional to 1/b, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess a value for b that satisfies this equation. Let me think about possible values.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider making a substitution where u = b.

Wait, maybe I can let t = b, so the equation is 5 t e^{-t} + 2 t -4 ln5 =0.

Hmm, perhaps trying t=1: 5*1*e^{-1} +2*1 -4 ln5 ≈5*(0.3678)+2 -4*(1.6094) ≈1.839 +2 -6.437 ≈(3.839)-6.437≈-2.598 <0.

t=2: 5*2*e^{-2} +2*2 -4 ln5 ≈10*(0.1353) +4 -6.437≈1.353 +4 -6.437≈5.353-6.437≈-1.084 <0.

t=3:5*3*e^{-3} +2*3 -4 ln5≈15*(0.0498)+6 -6.437≈0.747 +6 -6.437≈6.747-6.437≈0.31>0.

So, between t=2 and t=3, the function crosses zero. Let's try t=2.5:

5*2.5*e^{-2.5} ≈12.5 *0.0821≈1.026.

2*2.5=5.

So, 1.026 +5=6.026. Minus 4 ln5≈6.437. So 6.026 -6.437≈-0.411<0.

t=2.75:

5*2.75=13.75; e^{-2.75}≈0.064. 13.75*0.064≈0.88.

2*2.75=5.5.

0.88+5.5=6.38. 6.38 -6.437≈-0.057 <0.

t=2.8:

5*2.8=14; e^{-2.8}≈0.0606. 14*0.0606≈0.848.

2*2.8=5.6.

0.848 +5.6=6.448.

6.448 -6.437≈0.011>0.

So, somewhere between 2.75 and 2.8.

Using linear approximation between t=2.75 and t=2.8.

At t=2.75, value≈-0.057.

At t=2.8, value≈+0.011.

The difference in t is 0.05, and the difference in value is 0.011 - (-0.057)=0.068.

We want to find t where the value is 0. So, the fraction is 0.057/0.068≈0.838.

So, t≈2.75 + 0.05*(0.057/0.068) ≈2.75 + 0.05*(0.838)≈2.75 +0.042≈2.792.

So, approximate solution t≈2.792.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe
