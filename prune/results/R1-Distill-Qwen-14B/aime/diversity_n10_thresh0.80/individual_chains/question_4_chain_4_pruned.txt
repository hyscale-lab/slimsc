Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. The game is turn-based, so each player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The key is to figure out for which n Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves.

First, I think I'll model this using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to determine the pattern of winning (W) and losing (L) positions. Starting from small n and working up might help.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a W position for Alice (which is Bob's L, because he can't make a move).

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 token from n=2, it leaves 1 token. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. So Alice would lose. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 tokens, she can't do that because there are only 2. So Alice's only option is to take 1. So she leaves 1 token for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Bob is the second player. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should model it from the perspective of whose turn it is. Let me define each position n as either W or L, depending on whether the current player can win from that position.

So, for n=0: Well, that's an invalid position because there are no tokens left. So the player who is supposed to move at n=0 loses, because they can't move.

n=1: Current player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: Current player can take
