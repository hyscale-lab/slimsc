Alright, so I've got this problem about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right, their sum should be 999. And when I read them top to bottom, their sum should be 99. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a single digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the first row is a, b, c, and the second row is d, e, f. Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9.

Now, when I read the two numbers left to right, that would be the first row as a three-digit number, say ABC, and the second row as DEF. So, ABC + DEF = 999. Similarly, when I read them top to bottom, that would be two three-digit numbers, ADE and BCF? Wait, no, wait. Wait, top to bottom per column? Wait, the problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom." Wait, hold on.

Wait, I need to clarify this. The problem says: "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99." So, top to bottom, meaning for each column, you read top then bottom. So, each column forms a two-digit number. So, columns are:

First column: a d

Second column: b e

Third column: c f

So, the three numbers are AD, BE, CF. And their sum is 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, the problem says "three numbers formed by reading top to bottom." So, each column has two digits, so each column forms a two-digit number. So, each column is a two-digit number, and there are three such numbers, so their sum is 99.

Okay, that makes sense. So, the first condition is that ABC + DEF = 999, where ABC is the first row, DEF is the second row. The second condition is that (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, now I have two equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999

2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I need to find the number of ways to assign digits a, b, c, d, e, f such that these two equations are satisfied.

Let me write ABC as 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, DEF is 100d + 10e + f. So, equation 1 becomes:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Or, grouping terms:

(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999

Which is 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

But S1, S2, S3 are sums of digits a + d, etc., so each S is between 0 and 18 (since each digit can be 0-9). But wait, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S
