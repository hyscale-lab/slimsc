Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem states there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but we're only placing some of them on the grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are about the colors in each row and column. Specifically, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate these conditions. So, the arrangement must be such that it's as "full" as possible without being able to add any more chips without breaking the rules.

Hmm, okay. So each row and each column must be all one color, either all white or all black. Wait, no. Actually, the condition says that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. But the row might not have any chips as well. Similarly for columns. But then, the second condition requires that any additional chip would violate the previous conditions. So, we need to arrange the chips in such a way that adding any more chips would mean that either a row or column now has chips of different colors.

Wait, that's a bit vague. Let me think. So, after placing some chips, every row either has no chips or all its chips are the same color. Same for every column. Moreover, if I try to add another chip, it would have to go into a row or column that already has a chip of a different color. So, to prevent that, each row and each column must either be entirely filled with chips of a single color or be completely empty. Because if a row has some chips but isn't full, then we could add another chip to that row, provided it's the same color as the existing ones. But wait, the condition says that adding any additional chip would violate the conditions. So perhaps the arrangement is such that every row and every column that has any chips must have all their cells filled with chips of the same color, and no row or column is partially filled.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if a row is partially filled, then we can add another chip of the same color without violating the conditions. So the arrangement must be that every row and every column is either entirely filled with chips of a single color or is empty. Moreover, the arrangement is
