Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point inside it to each of its faces. This point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter in a triangle, which is the center of the inscribed sphere. The distance from the incenter to each face is the radius of this inscribed sphere, which is what we're looking for.

First, let me note down what's given:

- AB = CD = sqrt(41)
- AC = BD = sqrt(80)
- BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, all opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe this tetrahedron has some properties that could help simplify calculations.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

Wait, but let me confirm: the formula for the inradius in a tetrahedron is indeed 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Yep, that's correct because the volume can also be expressed as (1/3)*surface area*radius, so rearranging gives r = 3V / S.

So, my plan is:

1. Calculate the volume V of the tetrahedron.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum those areas to get S.
4. Plug V and S into r = 3V / S to find the inradius.

Alright, step 1 is to find the volume. Hmm, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know all the edges? Maybe using the Cayley-Menger determinant? I think that's the way to go when you have all the edge lengths.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, let me assign the given lengths:

AB = sqrt(41) => a² = 41
AC = sqrt(80) => b² = 80
AD = sqrt(89) => c² = 89
BC = sqrt(89) => d² = 89
BD = sqrt(80) => e² = 80
CD = sqrt(41) => f² = 41

So, the determinant matrix will be:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure I filled that correctly. Each row corresponds to the squares of the edges from that vertex. So, for row i (i=1 to 4), the entries are the squares of the edges from vertex i to the other three vertices, and the last entry is the square of the edge from vertex i to vertex 4? Or maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger determinant is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are for the points, and the other entries are the squared distances. Let me just write it correctly.

The matrix is:

[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, AB², AC², AD²],
  [1, AB², 0, BC², BD²],
  [1, AC², BC², 0, CD²],
  [1, AD², BD², CD², 0] ]

So, substituting the given squared lengths:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89,
BC² = 89, BD² =
