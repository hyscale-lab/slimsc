Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

From the Asymptote code, I can see that point D is where the tangents at B and C meet. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents. Then, AD intersects ω again at P, and I need to find AP.

Given sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.

Hmm, okay. So triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me first check if this is a valid triangle. 5 + 9 = 14 > 10, 5 + 10 = 15 > 9, 9 +10=19>5. So yes, it's valid.

I think I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and power of a point here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the two tangent segments from a single point to a circle are equal. So, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC, perhaps?

Wait, actually, when you have the two tangent points, BD and CD are equal. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, since AD is a secant of the circle ω, intersecting it at A and P, the power of point A with respect to ω might come into play. Wait, but A is on ω, so the power of A is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using power of point D with respect to ω. Since DB and DC are tangents, the power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Yes, that seems useful. So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP.

Power of point D: DB² = DP * DA.

So, DA = DP + PA. Wait, but DP is the length from D to P, which is beyond A? Wait, no. AD passes through A and goes to P on ω, so the order is A, then P, then D? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, actually, point P is where AD intersects ω again, so starting from A, going through P, then D is outside. So, the order is A, P, D. So, the lengths would be AP and PD.

So, DA = AP + PD.

Wait, but in the power of a point, it's DP * DA. Hmm, no, wait: the power of D is equal to DP * DA. Wait, no, let me think again.

The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB². And since AD is a secant, the power is also equal to DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA.

Wait, let me write that down:

DB² = DP * DA

But DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. But since P is between A and D, DA = AP + PD. So, DP = DA - AP. Hmm, but I'm not sure that's the most helpful.

Alternatively, maybe express DP as DA - AP. Wait, but then:

DB² = (DA - AP) * DA = DA² - DA * AP.

Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should find DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC first. Because if I can find the circumradius R, then maybe I can find DB.

Wait, but DB is the length of the tangent from D to ω. The length of the tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt(OD² - R²), where O is the center of the circle. Hmm, but without knowing O, that might be harder.

Alternatively, maybe using some triangle properties. Let me think about triangle ABC with sides 5,9,10.

Let me compute the semi-perimeter first: s = (5 + 9 +10)/2 = 12.

Then, area using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, that's not very clean. Let me compute 12*7*3*2 = 504, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5) = 4*sqrt(63/2) = 4*(3*sqrt(14)/sqrt(2)) )= 4*(3*sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) )= 4*3*sqrt(7) )= 12 sqrt(7). Oh, wait, that's not right. Wait, 504 factors into 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 504 ÷16 = 31.5? No, 16 * 31 = 496, which is less than 504. Hmm, perhaps another way.

Wait, 504 = 72 * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(72*7) = sqrt(36*2*7) = 6*sqrt(14). Because 72=36*2, so sqrt(72)=6 sqrt(2). Wait, 72*7=504, so sqrt
