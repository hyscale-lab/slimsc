Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that log base a of b equals c means that a^c = b. So, applying that to the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. That should translate to x^10 = y^x. Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which would mean y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

My goal is to find xy. So, I need to find expressions for x and y that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to linearize these equations. Let's try that.

Taking natural log (ln) of both sides for the first equation:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 ln x = x ln y

Similarly, for the second equation:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes:

10 ln y = 4y ln x

So now I have:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, okay. Let me denote a = ln x and b = ln y to make it simpler. Then, the equations become:

1. 10a = x b
2. 10b = 4y a

But wait, x and y are in terms of a and b. Since a = ln x, then x = e^a. Similarly, y = e^b. Let's substitute these into the equations.

So equation 1 becomes:

10a = e^a * b

Equation 2 becomes:

10b = 4 e^b * a

Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables a and b:

10a = b e^a  --> Equation (1)
10b = 4 a e^b --> Equation (2)

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express b from Equation (1) and substitute into Equation (2).

From Equation (1): b = (10a) / e^a

Plugging this into Equation (2):

10 * (10a / e^a) = 4a e^b

Simplify left side: 100a / e^a = 4a e^b

Hmm, I can divide both sides by a (assuming a ≠ 0, which it isn't because x >1, so a >0).

So, 100 / e^a = 4 e^b

Then, 25 / e^a = e^b

Taking natural log on both sides:

ln(25) - a = b

So, b = ln(25) - a  --> Equation (3)

Now, from Equation (1), we have b = 10a / e^a.

So, substitute b from Equation (3) into that:

ln(25) - a = 10a / e^a

Let me rewrite that:

ln(25) = a + (10a) / e^a

Hmm, factor out a on the right side:

ln(25) = a (1 + 10 / e^a )

So, ln(25) = a (1 + 10 e^{-a} )

This equation looks a bit tricky because a is both outside and inside the exponential. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let me let t = a. Then, the equation is:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t} )

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can try to find a solution by inspection or guess. Let's see.

I know that ln(25) is approximately 3.2189. Let me see if t is a rational number that makes this hold.

Let me try t = 2:

RHS = 2*(1 + 10 e^{-2}) ≈ 2*(1 + 10*(0.1353)) ≈ 2*(1 + 1.353) ≈ 2*(2.353) ≈ 4.706. That's bigger than ln(25) ≈ 3.2189.

So maybe t is less than 2.

Try t =1:

RHS =1*(1 + 10 e^{-1}) ≈1*(1 + 10*(0.3679)) ≈1*(1 + 3.679)≈4.679. Still bigger.

Hmm, maybe t is less than 1.

Wait, but ln(25) is about 3.2. So, maybe t is around 2.5?

Wait, let me try t = 3:

RHS =3*(1 + 10 e^{-3}) ≈3*(1 + 10*(0.0498)) ≈3*(1 + 0.498)≈3*1.498≈4.494. Still bigger than 3.2189.

Wait, I'm not getting closer. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to find t numerically, I can relate the two equations differently.

I have:

From Equation (3): b = ln(25) - a

From Equation (1): b = 10a / e^a

So, equate these two:

10a / e^a = ln(25) - a

Which is the same as the equation I had before.

Hmm. Let's rearrange it:

10a / e^a + a = ln(25)

Factor out a:

a (10 / e^a + 1) = ln(25)

Hmm. Maybe I can write this as:

a (1 + 10 e^{-a}) = ln(25)

Let me define f(a) = a (1 + 10 e^{-a}) - ln(25). We need to find a such that f(a)=0.

We can try to find a root for this function.

We can attempt to use the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. Let's try that.

First, let's compute f(a) and its derivative f'(a).

f(a) = a (1 + 10 e^{-a}) - ln(25)

f'(a) = (1 + 10 e^{-a}) + a*(-10 e^{-a}) 

= 1 + 10 e^{-a} -10 a e^{-a}

= 1 + 10 e^{-a}(1 - a)

We can start with an initial guess for a. Since when I tried a=2, f(a)=4.706 -3.2189=1.487>0

At a=2: f(a)=2*(1 + 10 e^{-2}) - ln(25)=2*(1 + ~1.353)≈2*2.353≈4.706 -3.2189≈1.487>0

At a=3: f(a)=3*(1 + 10 e^{-3}) - ln(25)≈3*(1 +0.498)=3*1.498≈4.494 -3.2189≈1.275>0

Wait, that's not correct because when a increases, e^{-a} decreases, so 10 e^{-a} decreases. Let me see.

Wait, let's compute f(a) for a=1:

a=1:

f(1)=1*(1 + 10 e^{-1}) - ln(25)=1*(1 +10*(0.3679))≈1*(1+3.679)=4.679 -3.2189≈1.460>0

a=0.5:

f(0.5)=0.5*(1 +10 e^{-0.5}) - ln(25) ≈0.5*(1 +10*(0.6065))≈0.5*(1 +6.065)=0.5*7.065≈3.5325 -3.2189≈0.3136>0

a=0.4:

f(0.4)=0.4*(1 +10 e^{-0.4}) ≈0.4*(1 +10*(0.6703))=0.4*(1 +6.703)=0.4*7.703≈3.0812 -3.2189≈-0.1377<0

So between a=0.4 and a=0.5, f(a) crosses zero.

So, let me try a=0.45:

Compute f(0.45):

0.45*(1 +10 e^{-0.45}) - ln(25)

First, e^{-0.45}=approx 0.6376

10 e^{-0.45}=6.376

1 +6.
