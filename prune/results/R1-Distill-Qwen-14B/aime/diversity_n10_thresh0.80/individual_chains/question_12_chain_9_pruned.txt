Okay, so I have this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can place digits in each cell such that two conditions are met: 

1. When I read the numbers left to right, the two numbers add up to 999.
2. When I read the numbers top to bottom, the three numbers add up to 99.

The example given is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

Because 008 + 991 = 999, and 0 + 9 + 99 = 99. Hmm, wait, actually, that doesn't seem right. Let me check:

Wait, 008 is 8, and 991 is 991, so 8 + 991 = 999. That works. Then, reading top to bottom, the first column is 0 and 9, forming 09 (which is 9). The second column is 0 and 9, forming 09 (again 9). The third column is 8 and 1, forming 81. So adding them: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That's correct. Okay, so the example makes sense.

So, the grid has two rows and three columns. Let me denote the cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

So, the first row is the number abc (that is, 100a + 10b + c), and the second row is def (100d + 10e + f). The sum of these two numbers is 999. So, equation one is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation two is about the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom. Each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is 10a + d, the second is 10b + e, and the third is 10c + f. The sum is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, equation two is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, okay. So now I have two equations:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

I can try to manipulate these equations to find relationships between the variables.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see what happens.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a -10a) + (10b -10b) + (c -10c) + (100d -d) + (10e -e) + (f -f) = 999 - 99.

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d +9e + 0f = 900.

So, 90a -9c + 99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out 9 from each term:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

So, that's a new equation: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100. Let me call this equation 3.

Now, equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm. Let's think about this. Since a, b, c, d, e, f are digits, they can only be integers from 0 to 9.

Wait, but in the example, a is 0, so a can be zero. So, we have to consider digits 0-9 for each variable.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

It might be helpful to group terms. Let's see: 10a +11d + (-c + e) = 100.

Alternatively, 10a +11d + (e - c) = 100.

Hmm. Since e and c are digits (0-9), e - c can range from -9 to 9.

So, 10a + 11d is 100 minus (e - c). So, 10a + 11d = 100 - (e - c).

But 10a + 11d is a number that depends on a and d. Let's see what possible values 10a + 11d can take, given that a and d are digits (0-9).

a can be from 0 to 9, d can be from 0 to 9.

So, the smallest 10a +11d can be is 0 +0=0.

The largest is 10*9 +11*9=90+99=189.

So, 10a +11d can be between 0 and 189.

But in equation 3, 10a +11d = 100 - (e - c).

Since e - c can be from -9 to 9, 100 - (e - c) can be from 91 to 109.

So, 10a +11d must be between 91 and 109.

So, 91 ≤ 10a +11d ≤ 109.

Thus, a and d must satisfy 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

So, I can iterate through possible a and d values to find which pairs (a,d) satisfy this condition.

Let me list possible a and d:

a can be 0-9, d can be 0-9.

But 10a +11d is in 91-109.

So, let's think of possible combinations.

Let me try a=9:

10*9=90. So 90 +11d must be between 91 and 109.

So 90 +11d ≥91 → 11d ≥1 → d≥1 (since d is integer).

90 +11d ≤109 → 11d ≤19 → d ≤1.727, so d=1.

So, a=9, d=1: 10*9 +11*1=90+11=101.

So that's 101, which is within 91-109.

Next, a=8:

10*8=80. So 80 +11d must be between 91 and 109.

80 +11d ≥91 → 11d ≥11 → d ≥1.

80 +11d ≤109 → 11d ≤29 → d ≤2.636, so d=1 or 2.

So a=8, d=1: 80+11=91.

a=8, d=2:80+22=102.

Both are within 91-109.

Okay.

a=7:

10*7=70.

70 +11d must be between 91 and 109.

70 +11d ≥91 → 11d ≥21 → d ≥2. (since 21/11=1.909, so d≥2).

70 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤39 →d ≤3.545, so d=2,3.

So, a=7, d=2:70+22=92.

a=7, d=3:70+33=103.

Both in range.

a=6:

10*6=60.

60 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥31 →d ≥3 (31/11≈2.818).

60 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤49 →d ≤4.454. So d=3,4.

a=6,d=3:60+33=93.

a=6,d=4:60+44=104.

Both okay.

a=5:

10*5=50.

50 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥41 →d ≥4 (41/11≈3.727).

50 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤59 →d ≤5.363. So d=4,5.

a=5,d=4:50+44=94.

a=5,d=5:50+55=105.

Good.

a=4:

10*4=40.

40 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥51 →d ≥5 (51/11≈4.636).

40 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤69 →d ≤6.272. So d=5,6.

a=4,d=5:40+55=95.

a=4,d=6:40+66=106.

Okay.

a=3:

10*3=30.

30 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥61 →d ≥6 (61/11≈5.545).

30 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤79 →d ≤7.181. So d=6,7.

a=3,d=6:30+66=96.

a=3,d=7:30+77=107.

Good.

a=2:

10*2=20.

20 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥71 →d ≥7 (71/11≈6.454).

20 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤89 →d ≤8.09. So d=7,8.

a=2,d=7:20+77=97.

a=2,d=8:20+88=108.

Okay.

a=1:

10*1=10.

10 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥81 →d ≥8 (81/11≈7.36).

10 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤99 →d ≤9.

So d=8,9.

a=1,d=8:10+88=98.

a=1,d=9:10+99=109.

Alright.

a=0:

10*0=0.

0 +11d ≥91 →11d ≥91 →d ≥91/11≈8.272 →d=9.

0 +11d ≤109 →11d ≤109 →d ≤9.909. So d=9.

a=0,d=9:0+99=99.

Wait, but 99 is less than 91? No, 99 is 99, which is in the range 91-109. Wait, but 99 is within that, so okay.

So, a=0, d=9: 0+99=99.

But wait, 10a +11d =99, which is 99, which is in 91-109, so it's acceptable.

So, compiling all possible (a,d) pairs:

From a=9: d=1 → (9,1)

a=8: d=1,2 → (8,1), (8,2)

a=7: d=2,3 → (7,2), (7,3)

a=6: d=3,4 → (
