Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about finding the number of intersections between two graphs: one is a function y defined in terms of some nested functions involving sine, and the other is x defined in terms of nested functions involving cosine. The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. 

First, I think I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Since they involve absolute values, they're probably piecewise functions. Let me try to visualize f(x) first.

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's break it down. The inner part is |x| - 1/2, and then the outer absolute value is taken. So, |x| is a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative values will be flipped above the x-axis.

So, let's consider when |x| - 1/2 is positive or negative. |x| - 1/2 ≥ 0 implies |x| ≥ 1/2, so x ≤ -1/2 or x ≥ 1/2. In these regions, f(x) is |x| - 1/2. In the middle region, where |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function:
- For |x| ≥ 1/2: f(x) = |x| - 1/2
- For |x| < 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - |x|

This makes f(x) a V-shaped graph that touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2. So, it's like two Vs: one pointing upwards for |x| ≥ 1/2 and one pointing downwards in between.

Similarly, let's analyze g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Again, break it down. The inner function is |x| - 1/4, which is a V shifted down by 1/4. The outer absolute value affects any negative parts.

So, |x| - 1/4 ≥ 0 when |x| ≥ 1/4. So, for |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. For |x| < 1/4, it becomes 1/4 - |x|.

Graphically, g(x) will have a V-shape pointing upwards for |x| ≥ 1/4 and a V-shape pointing downwards between -1/4 and 1/4.

Now, moving on to the functions y and x in the problem.

First function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's parse this step by step.

Starting from the inside: sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π, but with 2πx inside, the period becomes 1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave that completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis. It oscillates between -1 and 1.

Then, f is applied to sin(2πx). f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's think about sin(2πx) varying between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| varies between 0 and 1.

So, |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. Then, subtract 1/2: so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Applying the outer absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) becomes | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, when |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

Then, this result is passed into g. So, g(f(sin(2πx))) = || f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |. But since f(sin(2πx)) is an absolute value, it's non-negative. So, it's | f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 |.

So, let's denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)). Then, g(h(x)) = |h(x) - 1/4|.

But h(x) is already an absolute value, so h(x) is non-negative.

So, g(h(x)) is |h(x) - 1/4|. Depending on whether h(x) is greater than or equal to 1/4, or less than 1/4, this expression will change.

So, y = 4 * g(h(x)) = 4 * |h(x) - 1/4|.

Similarly, for the other function: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's parse this.

Starting from the inside: cos(3πy). The cosine function varies between -1 and 1. The argument is 3πy, so the period is 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1.

Then, f is applied: f(cos(3πy)) = || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |. Similar to the sine case, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2, and the outer absolute makes it 1/2 - |cos(3πy)| when |cos(3πy)| < 1/2 and |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 otherwise.

Then, this is passed into g: g(f(cos(3πy))) = || f(cos(3πy)) | - 1/4 |. Again, as before, this is |f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|, since f(cos(3πy)) is non-negative.

So, let's denote k(y) = f(cos(3πy)), then g(k(y)) = |k(y) - 1/4|. So, x = 4 * g(k(y)) = 4 * |k(y) - 1/4|.

So, our two equations are:

1. y = 4 * | | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |
2. x = 4 * | | |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe we can simplify or find the possible ranges for y and x.

Let's first find the possible values of y and x.

Looking at the first equation: y = 4 * | h(x) - 1/4 |, where h(x) is in the range of f(sin(2πx)).

Since f(sin(2πx)) is || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. The inner |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, subtracting 1/2, we can have from -1/2 to 1/2, then taking absolute gives us between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, let's think again. |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1. So, subtracting 1/2: |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 can be from -1/2 to 1/2.

Then, taking absolute: ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| is in 0 to 1/2. So, h(x) is in [0, 1/2].

Then, g(h(x)) = | h(x) - 1/4 |. Since h(x) is between 0 and 1/2, h(x) - 1/4 can be negative or positive.

Specifically, when h(x) < 1/4, h(x) - 1/4 is negative, so |h(x) - 1/4| = 1/4 - h(x). When h(x) ≥ 1/4, it's h(x) - 1/4.

So, g(h(x)) ranges from 0 to 1/4. Because when h(x)=0, g(h(x))=1/4; when h(x)=1/4, g(h(x))=0; when h(x)=1/2, g(h(x))=1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Wait, no. Wait, if h(x) is in [0, 1/2], then h(x) -1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. So, the absolute |h(x)-1/4| is in [0, 1/4]. So, g(h(x)) is between 0 and 1/4.

So, y = 4 * g(h(x)) is between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the second equation, x = 4 * | k(y) - 1/4 |, where k(y) = f(cos(3πy)).

Similarly, k(y) is || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |, which, like h(x), is in [0, 1/2].

So, k(y) is in [0, 1/2]. Then, |k(y) - 1/4| is in [0, 1/4], so x = 4 * |k(y) -1/4| is in [0,1].

So, both x and y are restricted between 0 and 1. So, we're looking for the number of intersection points in the square [0,1] x [0,1].

Now, perhaps it's useful to consider the behavior of y and x in terms of periodicity.

Looking at y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). The function sin(2πx) has period 1, so y is periodic with period 1. Similarly, the second equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), cos(3πy) has period 2/3, so x is periodic with period 2/3 in y. But since y is in [0,1], and x is in [0,1], it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, but since both x and y are in [0,1], maybe it's helpful to consider the functions over this square and count the intersections.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach: since both equations are parametrized, perhaps we can set y as a function of x and x as a function of y, and look for points where y(x) = y and x(y) = x, but that might not directly help.

Alternatively, perhaps substituting one into the other. For instance, express y in terms of x, then plug into the second equation.

But since the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), which involves y, and y itself is a function of x, it's a system of equations
