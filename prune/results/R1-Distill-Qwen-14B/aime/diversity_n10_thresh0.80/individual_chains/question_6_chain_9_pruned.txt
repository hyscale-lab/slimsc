Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations. The first equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and the second one is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, maybe I should understand what f and g look like. Both are absolute value functions, so they'll have V-shapes, but with some transformations.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The outer absolute value just makes sure it's non-negative, but the inner part is |x| - 1/2. Let me graph this mentally. The function |x| is a V with the vertex at (0,0). If I subtract 1/2, it shifts the V down by 1/2. But since the absolute value is taken again, it might create another V. Wait, actually, if I have | |x| - 1/2 |, that's different. So, for f(x), it's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V opening upwards, starting from (0.5, 0) on the right and (-0.5, 0) on the left. But because of the outer absolute value, any parts where |x| < 1/2 would flip to positive. So, between -0.5 and 0.5, f(x) becomes 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a W-shaped graph with the central dip between -0.5 and 0.5, and then upward Vs on either side. Interesting.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Following the same logic, when |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4, which is a V starting at (0.25, 0) and (-0.25, 0). But for |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|, so between -0.25 and 0.25, it's an upside-down V. So g(x) is like a smaller W compared to f(x).

Now, I need to compute f(sin(2πx)) and then g of that. Let me denote f(sin(2πx)) as f1(x) and g(f1(x)) as g1(x). Similarly, for the other equation, f(cos(3πy)) is f2(y) and g(f2(y)) is g2(y).

Wait, let me write down the functions step by step.

First, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, so f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me call that f1(x). Then, g(f1(x)) is ||f1(x)| - 1/4|. But since f1(x) is already an absolute value, maybe I don't need the outer absolute in g(f1(x)). Wait, no, because g is defined as ||x| - 1/4|, so regardless of the input, it's going to take the absolute value twice. But since f1(x) is non-negative, ||f1(x)| - 1/4| is the same as |f1(x) - 1/4|. So, g(f1(x)) is |f1(x) - 1/4|.

Similarly, g(f(sin(2πx))) is | ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |. Same for the other function: g(f(cos(3πy))) is | ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

So, the first equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) = 4 * | ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

The second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4 * | ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Hmm, okay, so both functions involve nested absolute values and trigonometric functions inside. The variables are x and y, but the functions are a bit complex.

My goal is to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs. So, that means finding all (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations.

Since the equations are symmetrical in a way—both involve similar compositions of functions but with sine and cosine inside—I wonder if I can exploit that symmetry.

But wait, the first equation has sin(2πx) and the second has cos(3πy). So, the arguments inside are different: one is 2πx, the other is 3πy. That might complicate things.

Let me think about the period of these functions. The sin(2πx) has a period of 1 because sin(2π(x + 1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx). Similarly, cos(3πy) has a period
