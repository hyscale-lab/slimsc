Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. Each path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. An 8x8 grid has 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines, right? So, moving from the lower left (which I'll consider as (0,0)) to the upper right (which is (8,8)), each path consists of a series of moves either to the right or upwards. Since the grid is 8x8, the path will consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. So, the total number of possible paths without any restrictions is C(16,8), which is 12870. But the problem here is that we need to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. Let me think about what that means. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or up to right. So, a path that changes direction four times would have five segments of consecutive moves in the same direction. For example, right, up, right, up, right—this would change direction three times, resulting in four segments. Wait, no. Let me correct that. If you start moving right, then change direction to up, that's one change. Then change back to right, that's two, and so on. So, number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, four direction changes would mean five segments.

Wait, let me clarify. Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, after a certain number of steps, it changes direction to up—that's one change. Then, after some more steps, changes back to right—that's two changes. So, each change adds a new segment. So, the number of direction changes plus one equals the number of segments. So, four direction changes would result in five segments.

Each segment is a consecutive run of either right or up moves. So, for the path, these five segments would alternate between right and up. Since the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8), the number of right and up moves must each be 8. So, these five segments would consist
