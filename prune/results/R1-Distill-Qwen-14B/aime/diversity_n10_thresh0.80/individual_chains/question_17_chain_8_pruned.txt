Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, find p + q. Hmm, okay.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The set B consists of all rectangular boxes (so, rectangular prisms) where each has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. For each such box, we can imagine it fitting inside a sphere. The sphere needs to be the smallest possible such that every box from B fits inside it. So, the radius r of this sphere is the minimal radius such that all boxes in B are contained within a sphere of radius r. Then, we need to find r squared as a reduced fraction and sum its numerator and denominator.

I think the first step is to model the problem mathematically. Let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as x, y, z, where x, y, z are positive real numbers. The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by the formula:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

And the volume V is:

V = xyz = 23.

So, given these two equations, we have:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

Our goal is to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box, because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two points in the box. So, the space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere must be at least d/2. So, to minimize the sphere, we need to minimize the maximum possible d over all boxes in B. Therefore, r will be half of the maximum value of d across all boxes in B.

Wait, no. Alternatively, since r needs to be the radius that can contain all boxes in B, the sphere must be large enough to contain any box in B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least the maximum space diagonal divided by 2 over all boxes in B. So, r = (max d)/2, where d is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Hence, to find r², we need to find (max d/2)² = (max d)² /4.

But to find the minimal such r, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, the problem reduces to optimizing the function f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², given the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem. I remember that for such problems, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. So, perhaps I should set up the Lagrangian with two constraints.

Let me write down the Lagrangian function:

L(x, y, z, λ, μ) = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23).

Then, we can take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, and μ, set them equal to zero, and solve the system.

So, compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0.

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0.

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0.

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27.

xyz = 23.

So, now we have five equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0.
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0.
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y = 0.
4. xy + yz + zx = 27.
5. xyz = 23.

Hmm, this looks quite complicated. Maybe there's a symmetry or substitution that can help here.

Let me consider whether the optimal box is a cube. For a cube, x = y = z. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then volume would be x³ = 27, which is more than 23. So, it's not a cube.

Therefore, the box must be a rectangular prism with unequal sides. But perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when two sides are equal, or maybe when they're in some particular ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the box with maximum space diagonal is the one where x, y, z are as "stretched out" as possible given the constraints. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use substitution to reduce the number
