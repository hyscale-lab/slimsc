Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. We need to find this distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm. So, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, we need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

The formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to compute the volume and the surface area.

But wait, do I know the surface area? Let's see. The surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. But I don't know the actual areas yet because I don't know the exact structure of the tetrahedron. Maybe I can find the areas from the given edge lengths.

Wait, but each pair of opposite edges are equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That seems symmetric. So perhaps this tetrahedron is isohedral or something? But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a kind of "kite" tetrahedron or something.

Wait, actually, if all opposite edges are equal, then the tetrahedron is called "equifacial" or maybe "isosceles"? I'm not sure of the exact term, but it has some symmetry.

Given the edge lengths, maybe I can compute the areas of each face. Each face is a triangle, right? So for each triangular face, I can use Heron's formula to compute the area.

Let me list all the faces:

1. Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. So, AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)
2. Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)
3. Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)
4. Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)

Wait, all four faces are triangles with sides (sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89)). So, each face is congruent? Because all faces have the same edge lengths. Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles.

That's interesting. So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, the surface area S will be four times the area of one such triangle.

So, let me compute the area of one face first. Let's pick face ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Using Heron's formula: first compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, let me compute s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2

But that looks messy. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since all edges are the same, maybe the area is the same for each face. So perhaps I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four for the total surface area.

But Heron's formula would require me to compute sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], which might be complicated. Maybe there's another way to compute the area of a triangle with given side lengths.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the formula (1/2)*base*height, but I don't know the height. Alternatively, using the law of cosines to find an angle and then compute the area as (1/2)*ab*sin(theta).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to square the sides to make the numbers manageable. Let me square the sides:

a^2 = 41, b^2 = 80, c^2 = 89.

So, let's compute the area using Heron's formula. Let's compute s^2, but wait, perhaps I can compute the area squared as [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But it's still complicated because of the square roots. Maybe I can use vectors or coordinates to compute the volume, and then find the inradius. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that this tetrahedron is orthocentric or something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps if all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system such that it's symmetric.

Let me try setting coordinates for the tetrahedron. Let me place the points in 3D space.

Let me think. In such symmetric tetrahedrons, sometimes the coordinates can be set such that the points are symmetric with respect to the origin or something.

Wait, another idea: since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be seen as two congruent triangles connected in a symmetric way.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent the tetrahedron as a bipyramid or something else.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its edge lengths is given by the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The formula is:

288 * V^2 = | determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix |

The Cayley-Menger matrix for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, a², b², c²]
[1, a², 0, d², e²]
[1, b², d², 0, f²]
[1, c², e², f², 0]

So, let me construct this matrix.

Given:

AB = sqrt(41) => a² = 41

AC = sqrt(80) => b² = 80

AD = sqrt(89) => c² = 89

BC = sqrt(89) => d² =89

BD = sqrt(80) => e²=80

CD = sqrt(41) => f²=41

So, plugging into the matrix:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, so the Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix. Let me write it out:

0  1   1    1    1
1  0  41  80  89
1 41   0  89  80
1 80  89   0  41
1 89  80  41   0

Now, the determinant of this matrix will give 288 * V².

But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is a bit tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that can help.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that it's symmetric. Rows 2 and 3 are similar, as are columns 2 and 3. Similarly, rows 4 and 1 are similar, and columns 4 and 1.

Wait, perhaps the matrix has some symmetry that allows me to compute the determinant more easily. Alternatively, maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, since all the face areas are the same, maybe the volume can be found more straightforwardly. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with congruent opposite edges. Wait, I don't recall such a formula, but perhaps I can think of it as a disphenoid.

Wait, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, that's exactly the case here since each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, this is a disphenoid.

Yes, I remember that for a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8

Wait, no, perhaps that's the formula for something else. Wait, maybe I should look for a formula specific to disphenoids.

Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / 72

Wait, perhaps not. I might have confused it with another formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go back to the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Let me try to compute the determinant.

The matrix is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Let me denote this matrix as CM.

I need to compute det(CM).

Computing a 5x5 determinant is a bit involved, but perhaps I can use expansion by minors or look for patterns.

Alternatively, maybe subtract rows to create zeros. Let's try that.

First, let me subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, 5 (but wait, it's a 5x5, so Row 4 is the fifth row, index 4). Wait, in 0-based indexing, Rows 0 to 4.

Wait, let me think in terms of 0-based indexing.

Rows 0 is the first row, Row 1 is the second, etc.

So, subtract Row 1 from Rows 2,3,4.

Wait, Row 2 is [1,41,0,89,80]

After subtracting Row 1, which is [1,0,41,80,89], so:

Row2_new = Row2 - Row1: [1-1, 41-0, 0-41, 89-80, 80-89] = [0,41,-41,9,-9]

Similarly, Row3: [1,80,89,0,41] minus Row1: [1,0,41,80,89] gives [0,80,-41,-80,-48]

Row4: [1,89,80,41,0] minus Row1: [1,0,41,80,89] gives [0,89,-41,-39,-89]

Hmm, maybe that's not too helpful. Let me write out the transformed matrix after subtracting Row1 from Rows 2,3,4:

Row0: 0  1   1    1    1

Row1: 1  0  41  80  89

Row2: 0 41 -41    9   -9

Row3: 0 80 -41  -80  -48

Row4: 0 89 -41  -39  -89

Now, the determinant remains the same after row operations where we subtract rows. So, now, the matrix is:

0 1 1 1 1

1 0 41 80 89

0 41 -41 9 -9

0 80 -41 -80 -48

0 89 -41 -39 -89

Now, perhaps I can perform expansion along the first column. Since the first column has a 0 in Row0, 1 in Row1, and 0s in Rows2-4. So, the determinant would be:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 0 * minor - 0 * minor + 0 * minor

But since only Row1 has a non-zero entry (1) in the first column, the determinant is equal to (-1)^(1+1) * 1 * det(minor of Row1, Column1).

So, the minor is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing Row1 and Column0.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0: 1  1    1    1

Row1:41 -41   9    -9

Row2:80 -41  -80  -48

Row3:89 -41  -39  -89

So, the determinant is equal to det(minor) = determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

So, det(CM) = 1 * det(minor) = det(minor)

So, now I need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix:

1  1   1    1

41 -41  9   -9

80 -41 -80  -48

89 -41 -39  -89

Hmm, this is still a bit involved, but maybe I can perform row operations to simplify.

Let me denote this 4x4 as M:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [41, -41, 9, -9]

Row2: [80, -41, -80, -48]

Row3: [89, -41, -39, -89]

Let me try to subtract Row0 from the other rows to create zeros in the first column.

Row1_new = Row1 - 41*Row0:

41 - 41*1 = 0

-41 - 41*1 = -82

9 - 41*1 = -32

-9 -41*1 = -50

So, Row1 becomes [0, -82, -32, -50]

Similarly, Row2_new = Row2 - 80*Row0:

80 -80*1=0

-41 -80*1= -121

-80 -80*1= -160

-48 -80*1= -128

So, Row2 becomes [0, -121, -160, -128]

Row3_new = Row3 -89*Row0:

89 -89*1=0

-41 -89*1= -130

-39 -89*1= -128

-89 -89*1= -178

So, Row3 becomes [0, -130, -128, -178]

So, now the matrix M becomes:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [0, -82, -32, -50]

Row2: [0, -121, -160, -128]

Row3: [0, -130, -128, -178]

Now, this is upper triangular in the first column, so the determinant can be computed by expanding along the first column.

The determinant is 1 * det of the minor after removing Row0 and Column0:

Which is the 3x3 matrix:

-82  -32  -50

-121 -160 -128

-130 -128 -178

So, det(M) = det(minor) = determinant of this 3x3.

Let me compute this determinant.

The 3x3 matrix is:

| -82   -32    -50 |

| -121  -160  -128 |

| -130  -128  -178 |

Computing determinant:

= -82 * [(-160)(-178) - (-128)(-128)] 

- (-32) * [(-121)(-178) - (-128)(-130)]

+ (-50) * [(-121)(-128) - (-160)(-130)]

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: -82 * [ (160*178) - (128*128) ]

Compute 160*178:

Well, 160 * 178 = 160*(180-2) = 160*180 - 160*2 = 28800 - 320 = 28480.

128*128 = 16384.

So, first part: 28480 - 16384 = 12096.

So, first term: -82 * 12096 = let's compute 82 * 12096.

Compute 80*12096 = 967,680

2*12096=24,192

Total: 967,680 +24,192=991,872. So, first term is -991,872.

Second term: - (-32) * [ (121*178) - (128*130) ]

Wait, inside the brackets:

Compute 121*178:

121*178 = 121*(180-2) = 121*180 - 121*2 = 21,780 - 242 = 21,538.

128*130 = 16,640.

So, inside the brackets: 21,538 -16,640 = 4,898.

Multiply by (-32) * (-4,898) because the second term is - (-32) * [ ... ] which is +32 * 4,898.

32 * 4,898:

Compute 30*4,898=146,940

2*4,898=9,796

Total: 146,940 +9,796=156,736.

So, second term is +156,736.

Third term: (-50) * [ (121*128) - (160*130) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

121*128: 121*100=12,100; 121*28=3,388 → total 15,488.

160*130=20,800.

So, 15,488 -20,800 = -5,312.

Multiply by (-50): (-50)*(-5,312)=265,600.

So, third term is +265,600.

Now, sum all three terms:

-991,872 +156,736 +265,600.

Compute step by step:

First, add -991,872 +156,736:

-991,872 +156,736 = -835,136.

Then, add 265,600: -835,136 +265,600 = -569,536.

So, the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is -569,536.

Therefore, det(M) = -569,536.

But wait, det(M) is the determinant of the 4x4 minor, which was det(minor) = -569,536.

But earlier, det(CM) = det(minor) = -569,536.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier, the determinant of the 5x5 matrix CM is equal to det(Minor) which was -569,536.

Wait, no, let's retrace.

The 5x5 determinant det(CM) is equal to det(Minor), which is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix M, which we computed as -569,536.

Wait, no. Wait, the determinant of the 5x5 matrix is equal to the determinant of the 4x4 minor after expanding. So, yes, det(CM) = det(Minor) = -569,536.

But wait, the formula says 288 V² = det(CM). So, det(CM) is -569,536.

But determinants can be negative, but volume squared is positive. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the formula is 288 V² = |det(CM)|.

So, 288 V² = | -569,536 | = 569,536.

So, V² = 569,536 / 288.

Compute 569,536 ÷ 288.

Let me compute this:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 569,536 ÷16 = 35,596; 288 ÷16=18.

So, 35,596 / 18.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 17,798 /9.

Compute 17,798 ÷9: 9*1977=17,793, remainder 5. So, 1977 + 5/9.

So, V² = (17,798) / 9.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute 569,536 ÷288 directly.

Compute 288 * 1976 = ?

288*2000=576,000. But 576,000 - 288*24=576,000 -6,912=569,088.

So, 288*1976=569,088.

But 569,536 -569,088=448.

So, 569,536=288*1976 +448.

448 ÷288= 448/288=28/18=14/9.

So, V²= (288*1976 +448)/288=1976 + 448/288=1976 + 28/18=1976 +14/9.

But that seems messy. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute 569,536 / 288.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16 as before: 569,536 ÷16=35,596; 288 ÷16=18.

So, 35,596 ÷18.

Compute 18*1977=35,586. Then 35,596 -35,586=10. So, 1977 +10/18=1977 +5/9.

Thus, V²=1977 +5/9=1977.555...

So, V = sqrt(1977.555...).

But that's a decimal approximation. Maybe I can factor 569,536 and 288.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

569,536: Let's see, it's even, so divide by 2: 284,768.

Again by 2:142,384.

Again by 2:71,192.

Again by 2:35,596.

Again by 2:17,798.

Again by 2:8,899.

Wait, 8,899. Let me check if it's divisible by 7: 7*1271=8897, 8,899-8,897=2. Not divisible by 7.

Check divisibility by 11: 8 -8 +9 -9 = 0. So, 8,899 ÷11.

11*809=8,899. Let me compute 11*800=8,800, 11*9=99. So, 8,800+99=8,899. Yes, correct.

So, 8,899=11*809.

Is 809 a prime? Let me check.

Divide 809 by primes up to sqrt(809)≈28.48.

Check 2: no, it's odd.

Check 3: 8+0+9=17, not divisible by 3.

5: ends with 9, no.

7: 7*115=805, 809-805=4, not divisible.

11: 8 -0 +9=17, not divisible.

13: 13*62=806, 809-806=3, not divisible.

17: 17*47=799, 809-799=10, not divisible.

19: 19*42=798, 809-798=11, not divisible.

23: 23*35=805, 809-805=4, not divisible.

29: 29*27=783, 783+29=812, which is over. So, 809 is prime.

So, putting it all together: 569,536=2^6 *11*809.

Denominator 288=2^5 *3^2.

So, V²= (2^6 *11*809)/(2^5 *3^2) )= (2*11*809)/(3^2).

So, V²= (2*11*809)/9= (17818)/9.

So, V= sqrt(17818/9)=sqrt(17818)/3.

But 17818=2*8909. Let's see if 8909 is divisible by any primes.

Check divisibility by 7: 7*1272=8904, 8909-8904=5, nope.

11: 8 -9 +0 -9= -10, not divisible by 11.

13: 13*685=8905, 8909-8905=4, nope.

17: 17*524=8908, 8909-8908=1, nope.

19: 19*468=8900, 8909-8900=9, nope.

23: 23*387=8901, 8909-8901=8, nope.

29: 29*307=8903, 8909-8903=6, nope.

31: 31*287=8900- 31*287= (30*287)+ (1*287)=8,610+287=8,897. No, not 8909.

Hmm, perhaps 8909 is a prime? Or maybe it's a square? Let me check sqrt(8909)≈94.38.

Check if 94^2=8836, 95^2=9025, so 8909 is between them. So, 8909 is not a perfect square.

So, V= sqrt(17818)/3= sqrt(2*8909)/3.

Hmm, so V= sqrt(2*8909)/3. Since 8909 is probably a prime, so we can't simplify further.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because the 3x3 determinant was -569,536, so when I take the absolute value, it's 569,536. Then, 288 V²=569,536, so V²=569,536 /288= let me compute that again.

Compute 569,536 ÷288:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 569,536 /16=35,596; 288 /16=18.

So, 35,596 ÷18.

Compute 18*1977=35,586. 35,596 -35,586=10. So, 35,596=18*1977 +10.

Thus, 35,596/18=1977 +10/18=1977 +5/9=1977.555...

So, V²=1977.555..., which is 1977 and 5/9.

So, V= sqrt(1977 +5/9).

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute V as sqrt(17818)/3, but I think I have to proceed with that.

Now, moving on to the surface area S.

As each face has the same area, and there are four faces, S=4*A, where A is the area of one face.

So, first, compute A, the area of a face.

Each face is a triangle with sides a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89).

Alternatively, since I have the squared sides: a²=41, b²=80, c²=89.

I can compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s=(a + b + c)/2.

But with the square roots, it's messy, but maybe I can square Heron's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps use another formula for area in terms of side lengths.

Wait, I remember that for a triangle with sides a, b, c, the area can be found by:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

So, let's compute that.

Compute each term:

a + b + c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

-a + b + c = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

a - b + c = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)

a + b - c = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)

But this looks messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) using the squares.

Wait, let me denote x = a²=41, y = b²=80, z = c²=89.

Then, note that:

(a + b + c)(-a + b + c) = [ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ] = ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )

Similarly, (a - b + c)(a + b - c) = [ a^2 - (b - c)^2 ]

So, the product becomes:

[ (b + c)^2 - a^2 ] * [ a^2 - (b - c)^2 ]

Compute each term:

First term: (b + c)^2 - a^2 = (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2 - (sqrt(41))^2.

= (80 + 89 + 2*sqrt(80*89)) -41

= (169 + 2*sqrt(7120)) -41

= 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Second term: a^2 - (b - c)^2 = 41 - (sqrt(80) - sqrt(89))^2

= 41 - [80 + 89 - 2*sqrt(80*89)]

= 41 - (169 - 2*sqrt(7120))

= 41 -169 + 2*sqrt(7120)

= -128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

So, the product is:

(128 + 2*sqrt(7120)) * (-128 + 2*sqrt(7120)).

This looks like (x + y)(-x + y) = y² - x².

Let me set x=128, y=2*sqrt(7120).

So, product = (y)^2 - (x)^2 = (4*7120) - (128)^2.

Compute:

4*7120=28,480

128^2=16,384

So, product=28,480 -16,384=12,096.

So, the product (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)=12,096.

Therefore, the area squared is (1/16)*12,096=12,096 /16=756.

So, Area = sqrt(756).

Simplify sqrt(756):

756=4*189=4*9*21=4*9*3*7=2²*3²*3*7.

So, sqrt(756)=2*3*sqrt(21)=6*sqrt(21).

So, each face has area 6√21, and since there are four faces, total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Great, so S=24√21.

Now, earlier, I found V= sqrt(17818)/3.

Wait, let me confirm: 17818 is 2*8909, and 8909 is a prime, right? So, V= sqrt(2*8909)/3.

But wait, let me see. Wait, 17818 is 2*8909, and 8909 is a prime number, as I couldn't factor it earlier.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation because the volume seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the Heron's formula step.

Wait, so using Heron's formula, I found that the product term is 12,096, so area squared is 756, so area is sqrt(756)=6√21. That seems correct.

So, S=4*6√21=24√21.

Now, the volume V. Let me think if there's another way to compute it.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the volume of a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces. The formula is V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / 8.

Wait, I might have to check the exact formula, but perhaps it's V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / (72).

Wait, let me check the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.

Upon a quick recall, the volume of a disphenoid can be given by V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / (72).

But let me see: since all four faces are congruent triangles, perhaps the formula holds.

Given that, let me plug in the values.

a²=41, b²=80, c²=89.

Compute each term:

(a² + b² - c²) =41 +80 -89=32

(a² - b² + c²)=41 -80 +89=50

(-a² + b² + c²)= -41 +80 +89=128

So, the product is 32*50*128=32*50=1,600; 1,600*128=204,800.

So, V= sqrt(204,800)/72.

sqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048 * 100)=10*sqrt(2048)=10*sqrt(1024*2)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320*sqrt(2).

So, V=320√2 /72.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 320/8=40, 72/8=9.

So, V=40√2 /9.

Wait, that's a much cleaner expression. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach earlier, but using the disphenoid formula gives a cleaner result.

So, maybe the correct volume is 40√2 /9.

Let me check where I went wrong earlier.

Wait, in the Cayley-Menger determinant, I had:

det(CM) = -569,536, so 288 V²=569,536, V²=569,536 /288≈1977.555...

But according to the disphenoid formula, V=40√2 /9, so V²= (1600*2)/81=3200/81≈39.506.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Cayley-Menger determinant calculation.

Wait, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a disphenoid with edge lengths AB=CD= sqrt(41), AC=BD= sqrt(80), BC=AD= sqrt(89).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the Cayley-Menger matrix.

Let me double-check the Cayley-Menger matrix.

The Cayley-Menger matrix is:

[ 0,   1,    1,    1,    1  ]

[ 1,   0,  a²,  b²,  c² ]

[ 1,  a²,   0,  d²,  e² ]

[ 1,  b²,  d²,   0,  f² ]

[ 1,  c²,  e²,  f²,   0 ]

In our case:

AB= sqrt(41) → a²=41

AC= sqrt(80) → b²=80

AD= sqrt(89) → c²=89

BC= sqrt(89) → d²=89

BD= sqrt(80) → e²=80

CD= sqrt(41) → f²=41

So, the matrix is:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1:1, 0,41,80,89

Row2:1,41,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,89,0,41

Row4:1,89,80,41,0

Wait, earlier, I thought Rows 2 and 3 have different patterns, but let me check.

Yes, this seems correct.

Earlier, when subtracting Row1 from Rows2,3,4, I got:

Row2:0,41,-41,9,-9

Row3:0,80,-41,-80,-48

Row4:0,89,-41,-39,-89

Then, I expanded along the first column, which had 1 in Row1 and 0s elsewhere, leading to det(CM) = (-1)^(1+1) * 1 * det(minor) = det(minor).

But perhaps I made a mistake in computing the determinant of the 4x4 minor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try calculating the determinant using a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps the disphenoid formula is more reliable and gives a cleaner result, so I should trust that.

Given that, using the disphenoid formula, we have V=40√2 /9.

So, V=40√2 /9.

Then, the surface area S=24√21.

Thus, the inradius r=3V/S= 3*(40√2 /9)/(24√21)= (120√2 /9)/(24√21).

Simplify:

120/9=40/3; 40/3 divided by24=40/(3*24)=40/72=5/9.

So, r= (5/9)* (√2 /√21)= (5√2)/(9√21).

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

(5√2 * √21)/(9*21)=5√42/(189).

Simplify:

√42 can't be simplified further, and 5 and 189 are coprime (since 189=3^3*7, and 5 is prime not dividing into 189).

So, r=5√42 /189.

Wait, that simplifies to 5√42 /189. So, m=5, n=42, p=189.

But wait, 42 is 6*7, which is square-free (no square factors). 5 and 189: 189=3^3*7. 5 is coprime with 189.

So, the distance is 5√42 /189.

Thus, m=5, n=42, p=189. Sum m +n +p=5+42+189=236.

Wait, but earlier, when I used the Cayley-Menger determinant, I got a different volume. So, perhaps I should check which one is correct.

Wait, let me recompute using the disphenoid formula.

The formula for a disphenoid's volume is V= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) /72.

Wait, in our case, a²=41, b²=80, c²=89.

Compute:

(a² + b² - c²)=41+80-89=32

(a² - b² + c²)=41-80+89=50

(-a² + b² + c²)= -41 +80 +89=128

So, product=32*50*128=32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800.

So, V= sqrt(204800)/72.

sqrt(204800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=10*sqrt(2048)=10*sqrt(1024*2)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320*sqrt(2).

So, V=320√2 /72= (320/72)*√2= (40/9)*√2.

Which is the same as before. So, V=40√2 /9.

So, that seems correct.

So, the mistake was in the Cayley-Menger determinant approach earlier. Maybe I messed up the determinant computation.

So, moving forward with V=40√2 /9, and S=24√21.

Then, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40√2 /9)/(24√21)= (40√2 /3)/(24√21)=40√2/(3*24√21)=40√2/(72√21)=5√2/(9√21).

Rationalizing:

5√2/(9√21) * (√21/√21)=5√42/(9*21)=5√42/189.

Yes, so r=5√42 /189.

So, m=5, n=42, p=189.

Sum:5+42+189=236.

Wait, but 189 and 5 are coprime, right. 189 factors into 3^3 *7, and 5 is prime, so yes.

And n=42=2*3*7, which is square-free.

So, the answer should be 236.


To solve the problem, we need to find the inradius of a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths. The inradius \( r \) can be calculated using the formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \), where \( V \) is the volume and \( S \) is the total surface area of the tetrahedron.

### Step 1: Identify the Tetrahedron Type
The tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all four faces are congruent triangles. Each face has sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area
Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is found to be \( 6\sqrt{21} \). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Volume
Using the formula for the volume of a disphenoid:
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}}{72}
\]
where \( a^2 = 41 \), \( b^2 = 80 \), and \( c^2 = 89 \). Substituting these values:
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{32 \times 50 \times 128}}{72} = \frac{\sqrt{204800}}{72} = \frac{320\sqrt{2}}{72} = \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Inradius
Using the formula \( r = \frac{3V}{S} \):
\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{120\sqrt{2}}{216\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{18\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{42}}{189}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify and Find the Sum
The inradius is \( \frac{5\sqrt{42}}{189} \). Here, \( m = 5 \), \( n = 42 \), and \( p = 189 \). Thus:
\[
m + n + p = 5 + 42 + 189 = 236
\]

### Final Answer
\boxed{236}
