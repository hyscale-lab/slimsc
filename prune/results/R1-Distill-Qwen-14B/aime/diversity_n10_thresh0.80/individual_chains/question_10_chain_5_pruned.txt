Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let me understand what exactly Bob is doing. He's listing all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. So each set B must have a maximum element, and that maximum has to be a member of A.

Wait, so for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum. Since B is a finite nonempty set, for each a in A, the sets B with maximum a can be constructed by choosing any subset of the positive integers less than a, and then adding a to it. Because if a is the maximum, then all other elements in B must be less than a.

But wait, no. Because the elements of B are positive integers. So if a is in A, then for each a, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each subset can be combined with a to form a set B where a is the maximum.

But hold on, each B is a finite nonempty set, so for each a, the number of possible B's with max a is 2^{a-1}. Because the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} are 2^{a-1}, and each subset corresponds to a B when combined with a. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Because the subsets can be empty as well. So if we take all subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, then adding a to the empty set gives us {a}, which is a valid nonempty set. So the number of sets B with maximum a is indeed 2^{a-1}.

So, if A has elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. So total sets = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

But the problem says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. So sum
