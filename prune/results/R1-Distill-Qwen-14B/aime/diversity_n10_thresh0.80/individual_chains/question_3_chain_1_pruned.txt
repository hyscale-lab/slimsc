Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which contains numbers from 1 to 10. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize, A is a subset of B, so P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability would be P(A)/P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize and B is the event of winning a prize.

So first, I need to calculate P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize.

Let me start by figuring out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). That's the denominator for all probabilities.

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So the total number of possible 4-number combinations is 210.

Now, for P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked 4 specific numbers, there's only 1 way that the lottery numbers match her numbers. So P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is winning at least two of her numbers. So that includes the cases where exactly 2, 3, or all 4 of her numbers are chosen. So P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios.

Alternatively, it might be easier to calculate 1 minus the probability of not winning a prize. The probability of not winning a prize is the probability of having fewer than two numbers matching, i.e., 0 or 1 numbers matching. So P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match) first.

P(0 matches): The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S such that none of them are in Jen's 4 numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick is C(6,4). So the number of combinations is C(6,4) = 15. Therefore, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

P(1 match): The number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So the number of such combinations is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

So P(B) = 1 - [15/210 + 80/210] = 1 - (95/210) = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplifying 115/210: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So that reduces to 23/42. So P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, when I calculated P(0 matches) as C(6,4)=15, that's correct. For P(1 match), it's C(4,1)*C(6,3)=4*20=80, which is correct. So 15 + 80 = 95. So 1 - 95/210 = 115/210. Yep, that's right. 115/210 reduces to 23/42.

Now, P(A) is 1/210, as we said earlier.

So the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, so the probability is 1/115. Is that correct?

Wait, let me think again. So the probability that she has the grand prize given that she won a prize is 1/115? That seems low, but perhaps it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me see.

Wait, another approach: to find P(B), the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two are among Jen's 4. So that's the same as the total number of such combinations.

Which is equal to the sum of combinations where exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers are chosen from Jen's 4.

So the number of such combinations is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me calculate each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2)=15. 6*15=90.

C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6.
