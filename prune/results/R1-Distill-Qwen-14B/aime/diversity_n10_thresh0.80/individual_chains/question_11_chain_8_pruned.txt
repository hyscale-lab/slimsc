Alright, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is asking me to find the largest possible real part of the expression:

\[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay. So \( z \) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4 centered at the origin in the complex plane.

Let me denote \( z \) as a complex number. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, I can express \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary parts, like \( z = a + bi \), but maybe using the exponential form might be more convenient here.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of \( z \) and its reciprocal. Since \( |z| = 4 \), the reciprocal of \( z \) is \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). That could be useful later on.

So, the expression we have is:

\[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]

Let me denote this expression as \( E \). So,

\[ E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

We need to find the maximum real part of \( E \) over all possible \( z \) with \( |z| = 4 \).

Let me try expressing \( E \) in terms of \( z \) and \( 1/z \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), \( |1/z| = 1/4 \). So, maybe I can represent \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), which would make \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} \). That might help.

Let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression:

\[ E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So, putting it together:

\[ E = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Hmm, okay. Let me compute these coefficients to make it clearer.

Compute 4*(75 + 117i):

4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468, so the first term becomes 300 + 468i.

So,

\[ E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Now, let me express each of these in terms of cosine and sine. Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, expanding the first term:

\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)

Multiply this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes -468 sinθ.

So, combining real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

Similarly, the second term is \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiply this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term is +36 sinθ.

So, real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

Now, let's combine both terms for the real part of E and the imaginary part of E.

Real part of E:

= [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary part of E:

= [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ] + [-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ]

= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ

= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, E = (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But we're interested in the real part of E, which is:

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, our goal is to maximize this expression with respect to θ.

So, Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

This is a function of θ, and we can find its maximum value.

I remember that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude, and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then C.

Alternatively, the maximum value is sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Wait, let me verify.

Yes, because A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as sqrt(A^2 + B^2) cos(θ - φ), where φ = arctan(B/A) or something like that. So,
