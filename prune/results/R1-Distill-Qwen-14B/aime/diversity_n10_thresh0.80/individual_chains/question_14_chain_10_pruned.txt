Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property here is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Interesting. So, for each digit position in N, replacing that digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

I think I need to figure out what the original number N is, and then compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000. Since dividing by 1000 would essentially give me the last three digits as the remainder and the first digit as the quotient. So Q would be the thousands digit, and R would be the last three digits. Then adding them together.

But first, I need to find N. Let's think about how to approach this.

Let’s denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

The problem states that changing any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, if I replace A with 1, the new number is 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1, and all these must be divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Therefore, for each position, the original number N has a certain relationship to 7 such that when a digit is replaced, it becomes a multiple of 7.

Maybe I can express N in terms of the digits and the positions. Let me write N as:

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D

When we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D.

Replacing C with 1 gives N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D.

Replacing D with 1 gives N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these, N1, N2, N3, N4, must be divisible by 7.

So, the four conditions are:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Additionally, N itself must be the greatest such four-digit number, so we want the maximum possible N that satisfies all these conditions.

Let me think about how to handle these modular conditions.

First, maybe I can express N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N. Let's see.

Looking at N1: N1 is N with A replaced by 1. So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = N - 1000A + 1000*1.

Therefore, N1 = N - 1000(A - 1).

Similarly, N2 is N with B replaced by 1: N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100.

Similarly, N3 = N - 10C + 10.

N4 = N - D + 1.

So, each of these is equal to N minus some amount related to the digit and its position, plus the new digit.

Since N1, N2, N3, N4 must all be divisible by 7, we can write:

N1 ≡ 0 mod7

N2 ≡ 0 mod7

N3 ≡ 0 mod7

N4 ≡ 0 mod7

Which can be rewritten as:

N - 1000(A - 1) ≡ 0 mod7

N - 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod7

N - 10(C - 1) ≡ 0 mod7

N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod7

Wait, let me check that.

Wait, N1 is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So N1 = N - 1000A + 1000*1.

So N1 = N - 1000(A - 1). So, N1 = N + 1000(1 - A).

Similarly, N2 = N - 100B + 100.

N3 = N - 10C + 10.

N4 = N - D + 1.

Therefore, each of these is equal to N plus some adjustment. So, each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be ≡ 0 mod7.

So:

N + 1000(1 - A) ≡ 0 mod7.

N + 100(1 - B) ≡ 0 mod7.

N + 10(1 - C) ≡ 0 mod7.

N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod7.

These four conditions.

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange them.

Let me write each as:

N ≡ -1000(1 - A) mod7

N ≡ -100(1 - B) mod7

N ≡ -10(1 - C) mod7

N ≡ -(1 - D) mod7

So, N must satisfy all four congruences.

But since N is the same in all, perhaps we can express N in terms of each digit.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each coefficient modulo7.

First, let's compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

Let me compute:

1000 / 7: 7*142 = 994, 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 /7: 7*14=98, 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 /7: 10-7=3, so 10≡3 mod7.

1≡1 mod7.

So:

1000 ≡6

100 ≡2

10≡3

1≡1

So, substituting into the four congruences:

1. N ≡ -6*(1 - A) mod7

2. N ≡ -2*(1 - B) mod7

3. N ≡ -3*(1 - C) mod7

4. N ≡ -(1 - D) mod7

Simplify each:

1. N ≡ -6 +6A mod7. Since -6 ≡1 mod7, because 7-6=1. So N ≡1 +6A mod7.

2. N ≡ -2 +2B mod7. Since -2 ≡5 mod7, because 7-2=5. So N ≡5 +2B mod7.

3. N ≡ -3 +3C mod7. Since -3 ≡4 mod7, because 7-3=4. So N ≡4 +3C mod7.

4. N ≡ -1 + D mod7. Since -1 ≡6 mod7. So N ≡6 + D mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. N ≡1 +6A mod7

2. N ≡5 +2B mod7

3. N ≡4 +3C mod7

4. N ≡6 + D mod7

Since all four congruences must hold, they must all be equal to N mod7. Therefore:

1 +6A ≡5 +2B ≡4 +3C ≡6 + D mod7.

So, all these expressions must be congruent modulo7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod7. So,

1 +6A ≡k,

5 +2B ≡k,

4 +3C ≡k,

6 + D ≡k.

So, from each equation, I can express A, B, C, D in terms of k.

Let me write each as:

6A ≡k -1 mod7 --> A ≡ (k-1)*6^{-1} mod7

Similarly,

2B ≡k -5 mod7 --> B ≡ (k-5)*2^{-1} mod7

3C ≡k -4 mod7 --> C ≡ (k-4)*3^{-1} mod7

D ≡k -6 mod7.

Now, I need to find the inverse elements for 6, 2, and 3 modulo7.

The inverses:

6^{-1} mod7: since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}=6.

2^{-1} mod7: 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so 2^{-1}=4.

3^{-1} mod7: 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so 3^{-1}=5.

So, substituting back:

A ≡ (k -1)*6 mod7

B ≡ (k -5)*4 mod7

C ≡ (k -4)*5 mod7

D ≡ (k -6) mod7.

So, now we have:

A ≡6(k -1) mod7

B ≡4(k -5) mod7

C ≡5(k -4) mod7

D ≡(k -6) mod7.

Since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9 for B, C, D; 1-9 for A), their values modulo7 are determined by k.

But since A, B, C, D are digits, their actual values must satisfy:

A: 1 ≤ A ≤9, A ≡6(k-1) mod7

B: 0 ≤ B ≤9, B ≡4(k-5) mod7

C: 0 ≤ C ≤9, C ≡5(k-4) mod7

D: 0 ≤ D ≤9, D ≡k -6 mod7

Given that, perhaps we can express A, B, C, D in terms of k, where k is from 0 to6, since it's mod7.

But since N is a four-digit number, A can't be zero, so A must be at least1.

But let's try to see if we can find possible k values.

We need to find k (0-6) such that:

A =6(k-1) +7m, where m is integer, 1 ≤A ≤9.

Similarly for B, C, D.

But maybe we can look for k such that when A is computed, it's a digit between1-9, and similarly for B, C, D.

Let me list the possible k values, 0-6, and compute A, B, C, D for each, then see if they form a valid four-digit number.

Wait, but this might take a while, but perhaps manageable.

Let me make a table for k=0 to6.

For each k, compute:

A =6(k-1) mod7, but we need the actual value to be between1
