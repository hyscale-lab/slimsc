Okay, so I have this problem with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The task is to find a point C on AB, which isn't A or B, such that C isn't on any other segment from this family except AB. Then, compute OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime. Finally, find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis. If I draw points A and B, connecting them gives me the line segment AB. The family F consists of all possible unit-length segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and both P and Q are in the first quadrant. So, PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), and the length of PQ is 1. That means the distance from P to Q is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

Wait, so for any point (p,0) on the x-axis and (0,q) on the y-axis, if their distance is 1, the family F consists of all such segments PQ. So, F is a set of line segments each of length 1, connecting the axes in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, besides A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So, OA squared plus OB squared is (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, OA^2 + OB^2 = 1, which implies that the length of AB is sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is in F.

Wait, no. Wait, AB is from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute its length. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] =1. So yes, AB is one of the segments in F.

So, the family F includes all such segments, and AB is one of them. Now, the point C is on AB, but it's unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.

Hmm. So, for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), point C is not on PQ. So, C is only on AB, not on any other segment in F. So, we need to find such a point C on AB.

I think this point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, since all segments PQ are straight lines, the envelope might be some kind of curve. The point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps point C is the point where AB is the only segment from F that passes through it. So, all other segments in F don't pass through C. So, no other PQ in F contains C except AB.

Wait, but how do I find such a point? Maybe I can parametrize AB and then find conditions where C doesn't lie on any other PQ.

Let me parametrize AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write the parametric equations for AB. Let's say t goes from 0 to 1, with t=0 at A and t=1 at B.

So, the parametric equations would be x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, and y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, point C can be represented as (1/2 - (1/2)t, sqrt(3)/2 t) for some t between 0 and 1.

So, C is ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3) t)/2 ).

Now, I need to find t such that C is not on any other PQ in F except AB.

But how do I ensure that? Maybe I can consider the condition that for any other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

But that seems complicated because there are infinitely many PQs in F.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. So, the envelope is a curve that is tangent to all PQs in F, and AB is one of those tangents, so C is the point of tangency.

Hmm, maybe that's the way to go. So, let me try to find the envelope of the family F.

Each segment PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1.

So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1.

Because the intercepts are (p,0) and (0,q), so the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

Now, since p² + q² = 1, we can think of p and q as parameters satisfying this condition.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the condition that the derivative with respect to the parameter is zero.

Wait, but here we have two parameters, p and q, but they are related by p
