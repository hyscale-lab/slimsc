Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, that's moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up. So, the total number of steps is 16, which matches the path length given. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right (or up), which is C(16,8). But here, we have a constraint on the number of direction changes.

Wait, direction changes. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that affect the structure of the path?

Let me think. If a path has four direction changes, that means it alternates between moving right and up four times. So, the path can be broken down into segments where each segment is a consecutive series of right or up moves.

Each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, for four direction changes, there are five segments. Hmm, because each direction change increases the number of segments by one. Starting with one segment, each change adds another. So, four changes lead to five segments.

Now, these five segments must alternate between right and up moves. So, the path could start with right, then up, then right, then up, then right, and so on, or it could start with up, then right, then up, etc. So, there are two possibilities for the starting direction.

Let me formalize this. Let's say the path starts with a right move. Then the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. That's five segments with four direction changes. Similarly, if it starts with up, the segments are up, right, up, right, up. So, two cases.

In each case, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether the path starts with right or up.

If it starts with right, the segments are right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, it'll have three up segments and two right segments.

Wait, but in total, the entire path must move 8 right and 8 up steps. So, the sum of the lengths of all right segments must be 8, and the sum of up segments must be 8.

So, for the case where it starts with right, the three right segments must add up to 8, and the two up segments must also add up to 8.

Similarly, for the starting with up case, the two right segments add to 8, and the three up segments add to 8.

So, in both cases, we can model this as a problem of partitioning the steps into a certain number of segments with each segment being at least 1 step, because you can't have a segment of length zero, right? Because that would mean not moving at all, which isn't part of the path.

Wait, actually, is that the case? Hmm. Let me think. If a segment is zero length, that would mean a direction change without moving, which isn't allowed because each step is either right or up. So, each segment must consist of at least one step.

So, for the starting with right case: three right segments each at least 1, adding to 8. Similarly, two up segments each at least 1, adding to 8.

Similarly, for starting with up: two right segments each at least 1, adding to 8, and three up segments each at least 1, adding to 8.

So, the number of ways to partition 8 steps into k segments each at least 1 is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1). Because it's a stars and bars problem where we put k-1 dividers among 7 spaces between the 8 stars.

So, for the starting with right case:

Number of ways for right segments: C(7, 2) because 8 steps into 3 segments: 8-1 choose 3-1.

Similarly, number of ways for up segments: C(7, 1) because 8 steps into 2 segments.

So, the total number of such paths starting with right is C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Similarly, for starting with up case:

Number of ways for right segments: C(7,1) because 8 into 2 segments.

Number of ways for up segments: C(7,2) because 8 into 3 segments.

So, total for starting with up is C(7,1)*C(7,2).

Since both cases are similar, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, no, actually, let me check. No, because in each case, starting with right or up, the computation is the same. But wait, C(7,2) is 21, and C(7,1) is 7, so 21*7=147, and then multiplied by 2 gives 294. Hmm, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, actually, let's think again. For each starting direction, the number is C(7,2)*C(7,1). So, for starting with right, it's 21*7=147. For starting with up, it's 7*21=147. So, total is 147+147=294.

Wait, but does this give the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times?

Hmm, but wait, let's think about the number of direction changes. Each time the direction changes, it's a switch. So, if you have five segments, that requires four direction changes.

Wait, but wait, each direction change is a switch between right and up. So, starting with right, then up, then right, etc. Each switch is a direction change.

So, five segments would have four direction changes. So, that's correct.

But wait, let me make sure about the number of direction changes. For example, if you have a path with two segments, one right and one up, that's one direction change. So, direction changes are one less than the number of segments. So, yes, five segments imply four direction changes.

So, that logic seems correct.

So, the total number of such paths is 294. But wait, 294 is a relatively small number compared to the total number of paths, which is C(16,8)=12870. So, 294 is a plausible answer? Maybe.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, in the problem statement, the grid is 8x8, so moving 8 right and 8 up. So, perhaps another approach is to model this as sequences of runs.

Each path can be represented as a sequence of runs, where each run is a consecutive right or up moves. Each run alternates direction, so the number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one.

Wait, so if direction changes are four, then the number of runs is five. So, the number of runs alternates between right and up. So, if it starts with right, the runs are right, up, right, up, right, which is three right runs and two up runs. Similarly, starting with up would give three up runs and two right runs.

In each case, the sum of the right runs is 8, and the sum of the up runs is 8.

So, the number of ways to split 8 into k runs is C(8-1, k-1) as before.

So, for starting with right:

Number of ways to split right runs: C(7, 2)

Number of ways to split up runs: C(7,1)

So, total for starting with right: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 * 7 = 147

Similarly, for starting with up:

Number of ways to split right runs: C(7,1)

Number of ways to split up runs: C(7,2)

So, again, 7 * 21 = 147

Total: 147 + 147 = 294

So, that seems consistent.

But wait, I think I might be overcounting. Because in each run, the steps are ordered. So, for example, when you split the right runs into three parts, each part is a specific number of steps, and their order matters in the path.

Wait, no. Because when you split 8 into three parts, say a, b, c, where a + b + c =8, each part is a specific number of steps in the path. So, the order is determined by the sequence of runs.

So, for example, for starting with right, the path is R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a + c + e =8 and b + d=8. So, the positions of the runs determine the path.

So, the number of such paths is the product of the number of ways to split the right steps and the up steps, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the runs.

Wait, but in this case, the runs are already determined: the starting direction and the number of runs. So, for starting with right, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to split the right and up steps into the required runs.

So, yes, the number is C(7,2)*C(7,1) for starting with right, and similarly for starting with up.

So, the total number is 294.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, people model it as the number of compositions. A composition of an integer is a way of writing it as the sum of positive integers, where order matters.

So, in this case, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2), as we have. So, yes, that's correct.

So, putting it all together, the number of paths is 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1))=2*21*7=294.

Therefore, the answer should be 294.

But wait, let me test this with a smaller grid to see if it makes sense.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, so moving from (0,0) to (2,2). Let's say we want paths that change direction exactly two times.

What's the number of such paths?

Well, in a 2x2 grid, the total number of paths is C(4,2)=6.

Now, paths that change direction exactly two times.

So, how does that break down?

Each path must have three segments (since two direction changes), so starting with right, then up, then right, or starting with up, then right, then up.

For the starting with right case:

Right segments: two runs (since three runs total: R, U, R). Wait, no, wait. Wait, direction changes is two, so runs are three. So, for starting with right, the runs would be R, U, R.

So, the right runs must add up to 2, split into two parts (since two R runs). Similarly, the up runs must add up to 2, split into one part.

So, number of ways starting with right:

C(1,1)*C(1,0). Wait, no, wait.

Wait, number of ways to split 2 into two runs (for R): C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1.

Number of ways to split 2 into one run (for U): C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1.

So, total is 1*1=1 path starting with right.

Similarly, starting with up:

Splitting up into two runs: C(1,1)=1.

Splitting right into one run: C(1,0)=1.

Total: 1*1=1 path starting with up.

So, total number of such paths is 1+1=2.

Let's list them:

Starting with right:

R R U U (but that's only one direction change, from R to U). Wait, no, no. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, moving two rights and two ups.

Wait, the path R R U U changes direction once. Because it goes R twice, then U twice.

Wait, but we want paths that change direction exactly two times. So, how does that happen?

Ah, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the small example.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, to have two direction changes, the path must have three runs.

So, starting with R, then U, then R: R U R U? But wait, that's four steps, but 2 right and 2 up steps.

Wait, no, hold on: R U R U would be R, U, R, U, which is four segments, so three direction changes, which is more than two.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the reasoning.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). The paths that change direction exactly two times.

So, possible paths are:

1. R, U, R, U: four segments, three direction changes.

Wait, that's more than two. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe R, U, U, R: but that's two direction changes.

Wait, no:

Wait, R, then U: that's one direction change. Then from U to R again: another direction change. So, that's two direction changes. So, the path is R, U, R, U: but wait, that's four segments, three direction changes.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me actually think.

Wait, in a grid, a direction change happens when you switch from moving right to up or vice versa.

So, for a 2x2 grid, let's list all possible paths:

1. R, R, U, U: direction changes once.

2. R, U, R, U: direction changes three times.

3. R, U, U, R: direction changes twice.

4. U, R, R, U: direction changes twice.

5. U, R, U, R: direction changes three times.

6. U, U, R, R: direction changes once.

So, from the six paths, how many have exactly two direction changes?

Looking at the list:

- Path 3: R, U, U, R: changes direction at step 2 (R to U), then again at step 3 (U to R). So, two direction changes.

- Path 4: U, R, R, U: changes direction at step 1 (U to R), then again at step 3 (R to U). So, two direction changes.

So, only two paths have exactly two direction changes.

So, according to the formula I used earlier, for a 2x2 grid, changing direction exactly two times:

Number of direction changes is 2, so number of runs is 3.

Starting with right: runs would be R, U, R. So, split R into two runs (since 3 runs, starting with R, so R, U, R). So, right steps are 2, split into two runs: C(1,1)=1 way. Up steps are 2, split into one run: C(1,0)=1 way. So, 1*1=1 path starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U: runs are U, R, U. Up steps split into two runs: C(1,1)=1. Right steps split into one run: C(1,0)=1. So, 1 path starting with U.

Total: 2 paths, which matches our manual count. So, the formula works for the 2x2 case.

So, that gives me confidence that in the 8x8 case, the formula would correctly compute 294.

Wait, but wait, in the 2x2 case, the number of direction changes is two, so runs are three, which gives us two paths. So, our formula correctly returned 2, which matched the manual count.

So, in the 8x8 case, four direction changes correspond to five runs. So, five runs, which can start with R or U.

Each starting direction leads to 21*7=147 paths, so total is 294.

Therefore, the answer is 294.

But wait, let me just think about another aspect. When you split the steps into runs, the order of the runs is fixed by the starting direction. So, for starting with R, it's R, U, R, U, R. So, the runs alternate, and the number of R and U runs depends on whether the starting direction is R or U.

Wait, in the 8x8 grid, if the path starts with R, then the number of R runs is three and U runs is two.

Similarly, starting with U, R runs are two and U runs are three.

So, in each case, the number of R runs is either three or two, and U runs accordingly.

So, for starting with R:

Number of ways to split R steps into three runs: C(7,2) = 21

Number of ways to split U steps into two runs: C(7,1) =7

Total for starting with R: 21*7=147

Same for starting with U: 7*21=147

Total: 294.

So, yeah, that seems correct.

Therefore, I think the answer is 294.


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

Each path moves from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, requiring 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. Exactly four direction changes imply the path is divided into five segments, alternating between R and U.

There are two cases based on the starting direction:
1. **Starting with R**: The path consists of three R segments and two U segments.
2. **Starting with U**: The path consists of two R segments and three U segments.

For each case:
- The number of ways to split 8 R steps into 3 segments is given by the stars and bars method: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to split 8 U steps into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).

Thus, for each starting direction, the number of paths is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \). Since there are two starting directions (R or U), the total number of paths is:
\[ 147 \times 2 = 294 \]

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
