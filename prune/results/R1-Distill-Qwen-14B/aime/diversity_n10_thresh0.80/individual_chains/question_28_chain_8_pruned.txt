Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I'm supposed to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but let's break it down.

First, let me note down all the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. That seems symmetrical in some way, which might help later.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yeah, for a tetrahedron, the volume can be related to the inradius and surface area similar to how in 2D, the area is r times the semiperimeter. So, yes, the formula should be r = 3V / S, since the surface area S in 3D is like the sum of all face areas, and the volume is proportional to the inradius times the surface area.

So, I need to find both the volume V and the surface area S of the tetrahedron.

First, let's tackle the surface area. Since all edges are given, each face is a triangle with known side lengths. Let me figure out the area of each face.

Looking at the edges:

- Face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC: AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80
- Face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89
- Face ACD has edges AC, CD, AD: AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89
- Face BCD has edges BC, CD, BD: BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80

Wait, so each face is a triangle with sides (√41, √80, √89). Hmm, so all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each face has the same set of edge lengths. So, each face is congruent, which might make things easier because each face has the same area.

If that's the case, the surface area S would be 4 times the area of one face.

So, let me compute the area of one face, say, triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √89, c = √80.

I can use Heron's formula for the area of a triangle. Heron's formula is:

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

where s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, let me compute s:

a = √41 ≈ 6.403
b = √89 ≈ 9.434
c = √80 ≈ 8.944

But I should keep them as exact values. So:

s = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

Hmm, that looks messy, but maybe I can simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute s² or something else to make it manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the area using vectors or coordinates, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the squares of the sides:

a² = 41, b² = 89, c² = 80.

Let me see if this triplet satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11². Wait, so 41 + 80 = 121, which is 11², and 121 is 11². So, is this a right triangle?

Yes, because a² + c² = b²? Let's check: 41 + 80 = 121, but b² is 89, which is not 121. Wait, that's not right.

Wait, 41 + 80 is 121, which is larger than 89. So maybe it's not a right triangle. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me calculate a² + c²: √41² + √8
