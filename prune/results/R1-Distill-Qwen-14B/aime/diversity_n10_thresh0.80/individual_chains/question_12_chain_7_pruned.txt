Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. The task is to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (from 0 to 9, I suppose) such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. So, the two numbers are 008 (which is 8) and 991, and 8 + 991 equals 999. Then, reading top to bottom, the three numbers are 09, 09, and 81, which add up to 99. That makes sense.

Let me try to break this down. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, top row has three cells, bottom row has three cells. When read left to right, each row forms a three-digit number. Let's denote the top row as ABC and the bottom row as DEF. So, the top number is 100*A + 10*B + C, and the bottom number is 100*D + 10*E + F. The sum of these two numbers is 999, so:

100*A + 10*B + C + 100*D + 10*E + F = 999.

When read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. So, the sum is 10*A + D + 10*B + E + 10*C + F = 99.

So, we have two equations:

1. 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
2. 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Let me write these equations more clearly.

Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999
Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables or find a relationship.

Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(100A - 10A) + (10B - 10B) + (C - 10C) + (100D - D) + (10E - E) + (F - F) = 999 - 99

Simplify each term:

90A + 0B -9C +99D +9E +0F = 900

So that's:

90A - 9C +99D +9E = 900

I can factor out a 9 from each term:

9*(10A - C +11D + E) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C +11D + E = 100

So now I have a simplified equation:

10A - C +11D + E = 100. Let's call this Equation 3.

Now, I need to find digits A, B, C, D, E, F (each from 0 to 9, I think) that satisfy both Equation 2 and Equation 3.

Wait, Equation 2 is:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

So, Equation 2 is the sum of the columns, each column being a two-digit number. So, each column's value is 10*(top digit) + (bottom digit). So, the sum is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

But each term in the sum is a two-digit number, so each is between 0 and 99. But since the total is 99, the sum of three two-digit numbers is 99, so each of them must be between 0 and 99, but probably each is at least 1, but maybe 0 is allowed. Wait, no, digits can be 0, so the two-digit number can be as low as 00 (if A and D are 0) or as high as 99. But their sum is 99.

So, the sum is 99.

So, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking back at Equation 3:

10A - C +11D + E = 100.

Hmm, since A, C, D, E are digits (0-9), let's see what possible values can make this equation hold.

10A is a multiple of 10. Let's think about the maximum and minimum possible values.

A can be from 0 to 9, so 10A can be from 0 to 90.

C is from 0 to 9, so -C is from -9 to 0.

11D: D is from 0 to 9, so 11D is from 0 to 99.

E is from 0 to 9.

So, the left-hand side (LHS) of Equation 3 is:

10A - C +11D + E.

So, let's find the possible maximum and minimum.

Maximum possible LHS:

10*9 - 0 + 11*9 +9 = 90 + 99 +9 = 198.

Minimum possible LHS:

10*0 -9 +11*0 +0 = 0 -9 +0 +0 = -9.

But the equation is equal to 100, so LHS must be exactly 100.

So, 10A - C +11D + E = 100.

Let me think about this. It's a bit complex, so perhaps I can find a way to express variables in terms of others.

Alternatively, maybe I can express E from Equation 3:

E = 100 -10A + C -11D.

But since E is a digit (0-9), the right-hand side (RHS) must satisfy 0 ≤ E ≤9.

So,

0 ≤ 100 -10A + C -11D ≤9.

Which can be rewritten as:

100 -10A + C -11D ≥0,

and

100 -10A + C -11D ≤9.

So,

10
