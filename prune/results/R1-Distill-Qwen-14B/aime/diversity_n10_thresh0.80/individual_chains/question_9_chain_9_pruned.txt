Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find xy. Hmm, alright, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but using the change of base formula might help here. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = (ln a) / (ln b), where ln is the natural logarithm. Maybe I can use that to rewrite both equations in terms of natural logs.

So, let's start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the change of base formula, that becomes (ln y^x) / (ln x) = 10. I can simplify the numerator since ln y^x is x ln y. So, that gives me (x ln y) / (ln x) = 10. Hmm, that's one equation.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the change of base formula, that's (ln x^{4y}) / (ln y) = 10. The numerator simplifies to 4y ln x, so that's (4y ln x) / (ln y) = 10.

Now I have two equations:

1. (x ln y) / (ln x) = 10
2. (4y ln x) / (ln y) = 10

Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me denote equation 1 as:

(x ln y) = 10 ln x → Equation 1

And equation 2 as:

4y ln x = 10 ln y → Equation 2

Wait, that's a good point. So from equation 1, I can write x ln y = 10 ln x. From equation 2, 4y ln x = 10 ln y. Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

Let me try to solve for ln y from equation 1. From equation 1:

ln y = (10 ln x) / x → Equation 1a

Now, substitute this into equation 2. Equation 2 says:

4y ln x = 10 ln y → 4y ln x = 10 * (10 ln x / x)

Because ln y is 10 ln x / x, from equation 1a.

So, replacing ln y in equation 2:

4y ln x = 10 * (10 ln x / x)

Simplify the right side: 100 ln x / x

So, 4y ln x = (100 ln x) / x

Hmm, now, since ln x is not zero (because x > 1, so ln x > 0), I can divide both sides by ln x:

4y = 100 / x

So, 4y = 100 / x → y = (100) / (4x) → y = 25 / x → Equation 3

Alright, so now I have y in terms of x: y = 25/x.

Now, let's plug this back into equation 1a, which is ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

But since y = 25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So, equation 1a becomes:

ln 25 - ln x = (10 ln x) / x

Hmm, let's write that down:

ln 25 - ln x = (10 ln x) / x → Equation 4

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it. Let me bring all terms to one side:

ln 25 = ln x + (10 ln x)/x

Factor out ln x:

ln 25 = ln x [1 + 10/x]

Hmm, so ln 25 = ln x (1 + 10/x)

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

ln x = (ln 25) / (1 + 10/x)

But that still seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = ln x, so that x = e^t.

Wait, let me try that substitution. Let t = ln x. Since x > 1, t > 0.

Then, ln 25 = t [1 + 10 / x] → ln 25 = t [1 + 10 / e^t]

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a relation.

Alternatively, maybe express x in terms of y from equation 3. Since y = 25/x, then x = 25/y.

Wait, but that might not help directly. Maybe I can plug x =25/y into equation 1.

Wait, equation 1 was x ln y = 10 ln x.

Substituting x =25/y:

(25/y) ln y = 10 ln(25/y)

Simplify the right side: ln(25/y) = ln25 - ln y.

So, equation becomes:

(25 ln y) / y = 10 (ln25 - ln y)

Hmm, let's write that:

25 ln y / y = 10 ln25 - 10 ln y

Bring all terms to one side:

25 ln y / y + 10 ln y -10 ln25 =0

Factor out ln y where possible:

ln y (25/y +10 ) -10 ln25 =0

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can rearrange:

ln y (25/y +10 ) =10 ln25

So, ln y = [10 ln25] / (25/y +10 )

But 25/y is 25/(25/x) [since y=25/x], so 25/y = x. So 25/y +10 = x +10.

Wait, let me check: if y=25/x, then 25/y = x. So, yes, 25/y +10 = x +10.

So, ln y = [10 ln25 ] / (x +10 )

But from equation 1a: ln y = (10 ln x) / x

So, setting equal:

(10 ln x ) / x = [10 ln25 ] / (x +10 )

Divide both sides by 10:

(ln x ) /
