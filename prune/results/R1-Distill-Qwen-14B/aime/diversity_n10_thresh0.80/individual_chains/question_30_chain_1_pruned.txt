Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, interesting.

So first, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. Since ω is a 13th root, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. That means ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity. But wait, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the product includes (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) as the first term. Let me compute that: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. That might simplify things a bit.

So the product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Now, I need to compute this product. It looks complicated, but maybe there's a pattern or some symmetry I can exploit.

Let me consider the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to some known polynomial. Let's think about it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x². So that's x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this?

Let me compute the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = (2 ± 2i)/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So then, 2 - 2x + x² = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, each term in the product can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So the entire product becomes the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Hmm, that's interesting. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the product over all ω^k where k=1 to 12. So for each k, we're taking (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b), where a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i. So the product becomes the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b). 

Wait, but the product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to Φ_13(x), right? Because Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to n-1 when n is prime. Since 13 is prime, Φ_13(x) = product_{k=1}^{12}(x - ω^k) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. 

But in our case, we have the product of (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) for k=1 to 12. Let me write this as product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^k - a)(ω^
