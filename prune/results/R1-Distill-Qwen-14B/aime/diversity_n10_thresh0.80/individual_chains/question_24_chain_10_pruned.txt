Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the question is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, I know that the sum of all numbers is 30. So, whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, they should total 30.

Next, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So, 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list. And since it's the unique mode, no other number can appear as many times as 9.

Then, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, so the median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. But this median isn't actually in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. But here, it's different. So the list must have an even number of elements because when you have an even number, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Wait, but if it's an integer, the average of two integers, which is the median, is also an integer. But the median itself isn't in the list. That's a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, actually, for even-numbered lists, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if the median is an integer, that average must be integer. So, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, meaning both are even or both are odd. But the median is this integer, which is not in the list. So, the two middle numbers must sum to twice the median, but the median itself doesn't appear anywhere in the list. Interesting.

So, let's consider possible lists that meet these conditions.

First, the list must have positive integers. So, all numbers are at least 1.

Also, the mode is 9, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, for example, if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. But wait, if 9 appears twice, another number could also appear twice as long as 9 appears more than that? Wait, no, because if another number appears the same number of times, it would make the mode not unique. So, 9 has to appear more times than any other number. So, if another number appears twice, 9 has to appear at least three times.

But let's think about how many numbers are in the list. The length of the list affects the median and how many times 9 appears. Let me try to figure out the possible lengths of the list.

Letâ€™s denote the number of elements in the list as n. The median depends on n: if n is odd, the median is the middle element; if n is even, it's the average of the two middle elements.

Given that the median is an integer not in the list, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: n is odd.

If n is odd, the median is the middle element, which is an integer. But the problem states that the median is not in the list. So, the middle element is not in the list. Wait, that can't happen because in an odd-length list, the middle element is part of the list. So, this case is impossible. Therefore, n must be even.

So, n must be even. Therefore, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in
