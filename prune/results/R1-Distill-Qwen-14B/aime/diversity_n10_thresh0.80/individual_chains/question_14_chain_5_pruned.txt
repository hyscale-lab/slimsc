Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if any single digit of N is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where Q is N divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, N is a four-digit number, so it can be written as N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits. Since it's the greatest such four-digit number, we can assume that N is as close as possible to 9999, but with the given property.

The property is that changing any one digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for example, changing a to 1 gives a new number, which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing b to 1, c to 1, or d to 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, when we change any digit to 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. So, let's consider each case:

1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: the new number is 1bcd = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's denote this as N1. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: the new number is a1cd = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's denote this as N2. So, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: the new number is ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's denote this as N3. So, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: the new number is abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's denote this as N4. So, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Our goal is to find N such that all four of these conditions hold, and N is as large as possible.

To tackle this, maybe we can express each of these modified numbers in terms of N and the digit that's changed.

Let me think. For each digit, changing it to 1 will subtract the original digit's contribution and add 1 times the place value.

For example:

- For N1, which changes a to 1: N1 = N - (a*1000) + 1*1000 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. So, N1 = N - 1000a + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = N - (b*100) + 100.

N3 = N - (c*10) + 10.

N4 = N - d + 1.

So, each modified number can be written in terms of N and the digit that was changed. Since each modified number must be divisible by 7, we can write congruences:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 1000a + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 1000a - 1000 mod 7.

2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 100b + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 100b - 100 mod 7.

3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - 10c + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ 10c - 10 mod 7.

4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (N - d + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ N ≡ d - 1 mod 7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. N ≡ (1000a - 1000) mod 7.

2. N ≡ (100b - 100) mod 7.

3. N ≡ (10c - 10) mod 7.

4. N ≡ (d - 1) mod 7.

But since N ≡ same value mod7 in all cases, all four expressions must be congruent mod7.

So, we can write:

1000a - 1000 ≡ 100b - 100 ≡ 10c - 10 ≡ d - 1 mod7.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo7.

First, since 1000 mod7. Let's compute 1000 /7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

So, let's rewrite each congruence:

1. 1000a -1000 ≡6a -6 mod7.

2. 100b -100 ≡2b -2 mod7.

3. 10c -10≡3c -3 mod7.

4. d -1 mod7.

All these expressions must be congruent mod7.

So, 6a -6 ≡ 2b -2 ≡3c -3 ≡d -1 mod7.

Let me denote this common value as k, so:

6a -6 ≡k mod7,

2b -2≡k mod7,

3c -3≡k mod7,

d -1≡k mod7.

So, we can write each variable in terms of k:

From the first equation: 6a ≡k +6 mod7.

From the second: 2b ≡k +2 mod7.

Third: 3c ≡k +3 mod7.

Fourth: d ≡k +1 mod7.

Since a, b, c, d are digits (a from 1-9, others 0-9), we can find possible values for each digit in terms of k.

Our goal is to maximize N, which is 1000a + 100b +10c +d. So, to maximize N, we want a to be as large as possible, then b, then c, then d.

But they must satisfy the above congruences for some k modulo7.

So perhaps we can express each digit in terms of k, then find the possible values for k that allow each digit to be a valid digit (0-9 for b,c,d, and 1-9 for a).

Let me write each digit in terms of k:

a: 6a ≡k +6 mod7 → 6a ≡k+6 mod7.

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, inverse of 6 is 6.

So, a ≡6*(k+6) mod7.

Similarly for b: 2b ≡k+2 mod7.

Inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b≡4*(k+2) mod7.

For c: 3c ≡k+3 mod7.

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

Thus, c≡5*(k+3) mod7.

For d: d≡k +1 mod7.

So, now, let's write each digit in terms of k:

a ≡6*(k +6) mod7,

b≡4*(k +2) mod7,

c≡5*(k +3) mod7,

d≡k +1 mod7.

Since a must be between 1 and 9, let's compute possible a for each k.

Similarly, b, c, d must be between 0 and 9.

But since k is between 0 and 6 (as it's modulo7), let's consider each possible k (0 to6) and find the corresponding a, b, c, d.

But wait, since we need to maximize N, which is 1000a+100b+10c+d, we need to maximize a first, then b, then c, then d.

So, perhaps we can iterate k from 0 to6, compute a, b, c, d, and see which combination gives the largest N.

But let's see if we can find a better way.

Alternatively, for each k in 0-6, compute a, b, c, d, then check if they are valid digits, and then compute N, and pick the maximum.

But maybe we can think of k that would make a as large as possible.

Since a is a digit from 1-9, a ≡6*(k +6) mod7.

Let me compute 6*(k+6) mod7 for each k:

Compute for k=0 to6:

k | 6*(k+6) mod7 | a mod7 | possible a values (from 1-9, same as mod7 +7*m)
0 |6*(0+6)=36≡1 mod7 → a≡1 → a=1,8
1 |6*(1+6)=42≡0 mod7 → a≡0 → a=7
2 |6*(2+6)=48≡6 mod7 → a≡6 → a=6,13 (but 13 is invalid, so a=6)
3 |6*(3+6)=54≡5 mod7 → a≡5 → a=5,12 (invalid, so a=5)
4 |6*(4+6)=60≡4 mod7 → a≡4 → a=4,11 (invalid, so a=4)
5 |6*(5+6)=66≡3 mod7 → a≡3 → a=3,10 (invalid, so a=3)
6 |6*(6+6)=72≡2 mod7 → a≡2 → a=2,9

So, for each k, possible a and the maximum a possible.

Now, since we want to maximize N, we should choose the largest possible a for each k, then see which k allows the other digits to be as large as possible.

So, let's go through each k:

Case 1: k=0

a ≡1 mod7 → a=1 or 8. We choose a=8.

Compute b from k=0:

b≡4*(0 +2)=8≡1 mod7 → b=1 or 8. To maximize, choose b=8.

c≡5*(0 +3)=15≡1 mod7 → c=1 or 8. Choose c=8.

d≡0 +1=1 mod7 → d=1 or8. Choose d=8.

So, N=8 8 8 8? Wait, 8888.

Wait, but let's check if this N=8888 satisfies the original condition.

Wait, changing any digit to 1: let's check N1=1888, N2=8188, N3=8818, N4=8881.

We need each of these to be divisible by7.

Let me check 1888:
