Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions. The first condition is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second condition is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. So, we're looking for all possible combinations of nonnegative integers a, b, and c where their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals 6 million.

First, maybe I can find a way to express this second equation in terms of the first equation. Since a + b + c is 300, perhaps there's a way to rewrite the second equation using that sum.

Looking at the second equation: it's symmetric in a, b, and c. Let me write it out again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, for example, a²b is a squared times b. Similarly, a²c is a squared times c. So, if I factor a² out of the first two terms, I get a²(b + c). Similarly, the next two terms can be factored as b²(a + c), and the last two as c²(a + b).

So, the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

But wait, from the first equation, a + b + c = 300. So, b + c = 300 - a, similarly for the others. Let me substitute those in.

So, substituting:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Now, maybe I can group the terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, another way to write this is:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can relate this to something else. Maybe express a² + b² + c² in terms of a + b + c and ab + bc + ca. Because I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

We know a + b + c is 300, so (a + b + c)² is 300² = 90,000.

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Therefore, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Maybe I can express the other equation in terms of S, Q, and P.

Wait, the second equation is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I need to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P. I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be written as (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, let's compute that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

Substituting S = 300, this becomes:

300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

Similarly, a² + b² + c² is 90,000 - 2Q, as I found earlier.

So, substituting back into the second equation:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - [300³ - 3*
