Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The answer should be in the form m√n / p, and then find m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (which is the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S,

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

But wait, how do I find the volume when all the edges are given in these pairs? Hmm, maybe this tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something? Or perhaps it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Maybe it's a "kite tetrahedron"? I'm not exactly sure about the terminology, but I know that when opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron might have some symmetry that can help.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to model the tetrahedron. That might be a more straightforward approach, although it could get complicated with four points in 3D space. But perhaps if I place the points in a way that takes advantage of the symmetry, it might simplify calculations.

Let me try that. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is symmetric. Maybe place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (d, e, f), and so on, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can place points in a way that makes the opposite edges equal, which could help in calculations.

Wait, another approach: There's a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when all six edges are known. It's called the Cayley-Menger determinant. The formula is:

V = sqrt( |CM| ) / 288,

where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC² 0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD² 0  |

But wait, I think I might have messed up the order. Let me double-check the Cayley-Menger determinant. It's a 5x5 determinant where the first row and column are 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, and the other entries are the squares of the distances between the points. So, the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

Yes, that seems right. So, with AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² =89, BC²=89, BD²=80, CD²=41.

So, the determinant will be:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]

Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]

Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]

Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

Wait, is that correct? Let me check:

AB is opposite to CD, so AB² and CD² are 41. Similarly, AC² is 80, BD² is 80; BC² is 89, AD² is 89. So, the determinant should have:

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² => 1,0,41,80,89

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² =>1,41,0,89,80

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² =>1,80,89,0,41

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 =>1,89,80,41,0

Yes, that looks correct.

So, the Cayley-Menger determinant CM is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Then the volume V is sqrt(|CM|)/288.

But calculating a 5x5 determinant manually is going to be a bit tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or some symmetry to exploit here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that the edges are paired, so the determinant matrix might have some symmetry, making it easier to compute.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is "equifacial," but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Since all opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is called "equilic" or something? Maybe it's a special type of tetrahedron where the opposite edges are equal, which might make it possible to compute the volume more easily.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with three pairs of opposite edges equal.

Wait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with edges AB=CD=a, AC=BD=b, AD=BC=c, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / (8 * sqrt(2)).

Wait, is that correct? I'm not entirely sure, but let me check the formula.

Wait, actually, I think that formula is similar to Heron's formula for the area of a triangle, but extended to 3D. Let me see. No, perhaps it's the formula for a tet
