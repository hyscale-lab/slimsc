Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what this product is. It's a product over all the 13th roots of unity, except when ω^k = 1. Wait, but ω is a primitive 13th root, so ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the 13th roots of unity, right? So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including ω^0 = 1. But the problem says ω ≠ 1, so maybe I should exclude k=0? Wait, no, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0. But since ω^0 is 1, maybe I need to check that term.

Let me compute the term when k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the term is 1, so maybe it doesn't affect the product. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1, but when k=0, the term is 1. So the product is the same as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I wonder if there's a clever way to evaluate this product. Maybe using properties of roots of unity or polynomials.

Let me think about the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor or rewrite it somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all ω^k as roots of a certain polynomial. Since the product is over all ω^k, which are the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. So maybe the terms in the product can be related to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.

Wait, the product is over (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k. Let's denote each term as (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 2(1 - ω^k) + (ω^k)^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} as something. Let me try to see if it's a quadratic in ω^k.

So, treating ω^k as x, each term is 2 - 2x + x². Hmm, that's x² - 2x + 2. Let me see if this factors or has roots.

The quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0 has discriminant D = 4 - 8 = -4, so roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, each term (2 - 2x + x²) can be written as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which is the same as the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, each of these products is the product of (x - (1 ± i)) evaluated at all the 13th roots of unity ω^k.

But wait, for a polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is f(x). So, if I have a product over (ω^k - a), that's the same as evaluating f(a) because f(a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k). Wait, but in our case, it's product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} product (a - ω^k) = -f(a), since f(x) = product (x - ω^k), so product (a - ω^k) = f(a). So product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 f(a) = -f(a).

But 13 is odd, so (-1)^13 is -1.

So, the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1).

So, applying this to a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i:

Product (ω^k - (1 + i)) = -[(1 + i)^13 - 1]

Similarly, Product (ω^k - (1 - i)) = -[(1 - i)^13 - 1]

Therefore, the original product is equal to:

[-((1 + i)^13 - 1)] * [ -((1 - i)^13 - 1) ] 

Which simplifies to [ ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ) ]

So, our problem reduces to calculating this product.

Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 first.

I know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}

Compute [sqrt(2)]^13. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, for the exponential parts:

13 * π/4 = (12 + 1)π/4 = 3π + π/4. Since e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, e^{i * 3π + iπ/4} = e^{iπ + iπ/4} = e^{i5π/4} because 3π is equivalent to π modulo 2π.

Similarly, e^{-i * 13π/4} = e^{-i(3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ - iπ/4} = e^{-i5π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)] = 64*sqrt(2)*(-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-√2/2)(1 + i) = 64*(-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [cos(-5π/4) + i sin(-5π/4)] = 64*sqrt(2)*(√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(√2/2)(1 - i) = 64*(1 - i).

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), and (1 - i)^13 = 64(1 - i).

Wait, let me double-check that. Because 5π/4 is in the third quadrant, so cos(5π/4) is -√2/2, sin is also -√2/2. So when multiplied by sqrt(2), it's -1 for both real and imaginary parts. So yeah, (1 + i)^13 is 64*sqrt(2) [ (-√2/2) + i (-√2/2) ] = 64*(-1 -i). Similarly for (1 - i)^13, it's 64*(1 -i).

So now, let's compute each term:

(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = 64(1 - i) -1 = 64 -64i -1 = 63 -64i.

So, the original product is (-65 -64i)(63 -64i
