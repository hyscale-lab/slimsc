Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me parse the problem again. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop after her walk, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the total time taken, including the coffee shop time. I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Alright, so let's list out the given information:

1. When she walks at speed s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop.
2. When she walks at speed (s + 2) km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes.

And the question is, what is the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including t minutes.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is that the coffee shop time t is the same in both scenarios. So for both speeds, the total time is the walking time plus t minutes. So maybe I can set up equations based on that.

Wait, but the problem is giving me the total time including t, so I can express the walking time as total time minus t. Then, using the distance formula (distance = speed × time), I can set up equations.

Let me denote the walking time without the coffee shop as T. So, in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So the walking time would be 240 - t minutes. Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes, so the walking time is 144 - t minutes.

Wait, but the distance is the same, 9 km. So in terms of equations, when she walks at speed s km/h, the walking time in hours would be (240 - t)/60 hours, because 240 minutes is 4 hours, but t is in minutes, so I have to convert it to hours. Alternatively, maybe I should keep everything in hours or everything in minutes to avoid confusion.

Hmm, maybe it's better to convert everything into hours. Let's see.

First, in the first scenario: total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes. So walking time is 4 hours minus t/60 hours. Similarly, the second scenario has a total time of 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. So walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours.

Wait, but maybe I should convert t into hours because speed is in km per hour. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the distance for both scenarios is 9 km, so we can set up two equations using the formula distance = speed × time.

First equation: 9 = s
