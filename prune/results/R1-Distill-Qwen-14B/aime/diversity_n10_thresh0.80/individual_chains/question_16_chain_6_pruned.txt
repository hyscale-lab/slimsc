Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Alright, so the first part is to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, once I have that p, I have to find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ + 1 being divisible by p squared.

Let me break this down. I think I should start by looking at small primes and see if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p² for some n. The smallest primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. So let me check each one.

First, p=2. Let me see if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4 (since p²=4). Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1=2. 2 is not divisible by 4. Next, n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4, so no. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. Hmm, n=4: 256 +1=257, which is 1 mod 4. Wait, is there any n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4?

Wait a second, n⁴ mod 4: Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1: 1 mod4=1, then 1+1=2 mod4. n=2: 0 mod4, 0+1=1 mod4. n=3: 3⁴=81 mod4=1, so 1+1=2 mod4. n=4: same as n=0, which is 0 mod4, so 0+1=1 mod4. So for any n, n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod4. So n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4. So it's never 0 mod4. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 can't be divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8, since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9, so 1+1=2 mod9.

n=2: 16 mod9=7, 7+1=8 mod9.

n=3: 81 mod9=0, 0+1=1 mod9.

n=4: 4⁴=256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9.

n=5: 5⁴=625 mod9. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9, 4+1=5.

Wait, same as n=4? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate 5⁴. 5²=25, 5⁴=625. 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13, 1+3=4. So yes, 4 mod9. So 5⁴ +1 is 5 mod9.

n=6: 6⁴=(6²)²=36²=1296. 1296 mod9 is 0, since 9 divides 36. So 0+1=1 mod9.

n=7: 7⁴= (7²)²=49²=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8 mod9.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1. So 1 mod9. 1+1=2 mod9.

So looking at these, n⁴ +1 mod9 for n=1 to 8: 2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2. None of these are 0 mod9. So p=3 also doesn't work. So move to next prime.

p=5. Check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24; but perhaps I can find an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Let me see. So n^4 ≡ -1 mod25. Let me compute n^4 mod25 for some n.

n=1: 1 mod25, 1
