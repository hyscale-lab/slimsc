Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, in this case, S = 54 and V = 23. So, we have:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
lwh = 23

I think the first step is to find the dimensions l, w, h of the box that satisfy these conditions. But wait, actually, the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere needs to fit around the box, touching all its corners, so the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius r is half of that diagonal. So, if I can find the space diagonal, then I can find r.

The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, r = d/2, so r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4. Therefore, to find r², I need to find l² + w² + h², then divide by 4.

Wait, so my goal is to find l² + w² + h² given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

I remember that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). So, if I can find (l + w + h)², then I can subtract 2(lw + lh + wh) to get l² + w² + h².

Given that 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54, so lw + lh + wh = 27.

So, (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2*27 => (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 54.

Hmm, but I don't know l + w + h. Maybe I can find it somehow. Alternatively, maybe I can express l² + w² + h² in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps using some inequality. Since we're dealing with a box with fixed surface area and volume, maybe there's a way to minimize the space diagonal, which would correspond to the minimal sphere radius.

Wait, the problem states that r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box in B. So, actually, r is the minimal radius that works for all boxes in B. So, perhaps I need to find the maximum of the space diagonals among all boxes in B, and then take r as half of that maximum. Because the sphere must contain any box from B, so the radius must be sufficient for the largest possible space diagonal.

So, first, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

So, to restate: maximize sqrt(l² + w² + h²) subject to 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Alternatively, since sqrt is a monotonic function, I can instead maximize l² + w² + h².

So, the problem reduces to maximizing l² + w² + h² given 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution.

Alternatively, I can consider that for fixed surface area and volume, the box which is a cube would have minimal space diagonal. But wait, we are supposed to find the maximum space diagonal, so perhaps the box is as "stretched" as possible, making one side very long and others short, but still maintaining the surface area and volume.

Alternatively, maybe using the method of symmetric functions. Let me denote the variables x = l, y = w, z = h.

We have:

2(xy + xz + yz) = 54 => xy + xz + yz = 27

and

xyz = 23

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

We know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S². Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible S, given P = 27 and Q =23.

So, maybe I can use the inequality that relates S, P, and Q. I remember that for positive real numbers, the AM ≥ GM, but not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers for constrained optimization.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z²

Subject to constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27

h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz -27) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, take partial derivatives and set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x: 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y: 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z: 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And we have the constraints:

xy + yz + xz =27

xyz=23

So, that's a system of equations. Let me write them out:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)
4. xy + yz + xz =27
5. xyz=23

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or assume some variables are equal.

Suppose that two variables are equal, say, x = y. Then, perhaps that will simplify things.

Let me assume x = y.

Then, the equations become:

From equation 1 and 2, since x = y, they should be equal.

Equation 1: 2x = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
Equation 2: same as equation 1.

Equation 3: 2z = λ(2x) + μ(x²)

So, with x = y, let's rewrite the constraints.

Constraint 4: x² + 2xz =27

Constraint 5: x² z =23

So, from constraint 5: z = 23/(x²)

Substitute into constraint 4: x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) =27

Simplify:

x² + (46)/x =27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x

So, x³ -27x +46=0

Hmm, let's solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0

Try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

x=2:8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x -2)(x² +2x -23)=0

The quadratic equation: x² +2x -23=0 → x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ±2sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2sqrt(6). Let me compute that numerically: sqrt(6)≈2.449, so 2*2.449≈4.898, so x≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

Similarly, the other root is negative, so we can ignore it.

So, possible roots at x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, in the case where x = y, we have two possibilities: x =2 or x≈3.898.

Let me check for x=2.

Then, z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, l = w =2, h=5.75.

Check surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)=2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5)=2(27)=54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So, that's a valid box.

Similarly, for x≈3.898, z=23/(x²). Let me compute x²: (3.898)^2≈15.193, so z≈23/15.193≈1.514.

So, l=w≈3.898, h≈1.514.

Check surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)=2( (3.898)^2 + 2*(3.898)*(1.514) )

Compute (3.898)^2≈15.193, 2*(3.898)*(1.514)≈2*5.902≈11.804. So, total inside the brackets: 15.193 +11.804≈26.997≈27. Correct.

Volume: (3.898)^2 *1.514≈15.193*1.514≈23. Correct.

So, both possibilities are valid.

Now, compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

Case 1: x = y =2, z=5.75.

x² + y² + z² =4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625. So, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625.

Case 2: x≈3.898, y=x≈3.898, z≈1.514.

x² ≈15.193, so 15.193 +15.193 + (1.514)^2≈30.386 +2.292≈32.678. So, r²=32.678/4≈8.1695.

Wait, but we are to find the maximum of r², so which case gives the larger r²? In Case 1, it's approximately 41.0625, which is larger than Case 2's 32.678. So, case 1 would require a larger radius.

But wait, is x=2 and z=5.75 the maximum? Or is there another box where the space diagonal is even larger?

Wait, maybe the maximum occurs when one of the sides is as large as possible. So, in the case where two sides are equal, we only get two possibilities, but perhaps the maximum occurs when the box is not symmetric.

So, perhaps assuming x=y gives us a local maximum or minimum, but perhaps the actual maximum occurs when all three variables are different.

Hmm, so maybe I need to consider the case where x≠y≠z.

This complicates things because the system of equations becomes more difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up the problem in terms of symmetric polynomials and see if I can find an expression.

So, we have S = x + y + z, P=27, Q=23.

We know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z² is to maximize S².

Thus, to maximize S², given that P=27 and Q=23.

We can think of S as the sum, given P and Q.

I think there's an inequality that relates S, P, and Q for positive real numbers. Perhaps using the AM-GM inequality or other inequalities.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y.

Wait, let's try that.

We have the system:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz=27

xyz=23

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe we can subtract equation (1) and (2) to eliminate some variables.

Subtract (1)-(2):

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ z(y - x)

Factor out (y - x):

2(x - y) = (λ + μ z)(y - x)

Which can be written as:

2(x - y) = -(λ + μ z)(x - y)

Bring all terms to one side:

[2 + λ + μ z](x - y) = 0

So, either x = y, or 2 + λ + μ z =0.

Similarly, subtracting (2)-(3):

2y - 2z = λ(x + z - x - y) + μ(xz - xy)

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)

Factor out (z - y):

2(y - z) = (λ + μ x)(z - y)

Which can be written as:

2(y - z) = -(λ + μ x)(y - z)

Bring all terms to one side:

[2 + λ + μ x](y - z) =0

So, either y = z, or 2 + λ + μ x=0.

Similarly, subtracting (1)-(3):

2x - 2z = λ(y + z - x - y) + μ(yz - xy)

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(z - x) + μ y(z - x)

Factor out (z - x):

2(x - z) = (λ + μ y)(z - x)

Which can be written as:

2(x - z) = -(λ + μ y)(x - z)

Bring all terms to one side:

[2 + λ + μ y](x - z)=0

So, either x = z, or 2 + λ + μ y=0.

So, in the case where all variables are distinct (x ≠ y ≠ z), we must have:

2 + λ + μ z=0,

2 + λ + μ x=0,

2 + λ + μ y=0.

So, from the first two, 2 + λ + μ z=2 + λ + μ x ⇒ μ z=μ x.

If μ ≠0, then z =x. Similarly, from other equations, z = y.

Therefore, if μ ≠0, then x = y = z, meaning the box is a cube.

But wait, in our problem, the volume is 23. If the box is a cube, then x=y=z= cube root of 23≈2.84. Let's check the surface area.

Surface area of a cube is 6x². So 6*(cube root 23)^2. Let's compute cube root 23≈2.84, so (2.84)^2≈8.07, 6*8.07≈48.42, which is less than 54. So, the cube doesn't satisfy the surface area constraint. Therefore, the case where x = y = z is not a solution here.

Therefore, if μ ≠0, it leads to a contradiction because the cube doesn't satisfy the surface area. Therefore, the only possibility is that μ=0, leading to the earlier cases where x=y, etc.

Wait, but if μ=0, then from the subtracted equations, 2 + λ =0, so λ= -2.

But let's see. If μ=0, then the original equations become:

2x = λ(y + z)

2y = λ(x + z)

2z = λ(x + y)

So, we have:

From first equation: λ = 2x/(y + z)

From second equation: λ=2y/(x + z)

So, 2x/(y + z) = 2y/(x + z)

Simplify:

x/(y + z) = y/(x + z)

Cross-multiplying:

x(x + z) = y(y + z)

x² + xz = y² + yz

x² - y² + xz - yz =0

(x - y)(x + y) + z(x - y)=0

Factor out (x - y):

(x - y)(x + y + z)=0

So, either x=y or x + y + z=0. Since x, y, z are positive, x + y + z ≠0. Therefore, x=y.

Similarly, from the other equations, we can get x=y=z or x=y, but as we saw earlier, x=y=z is not a solution, so we must have x=y, and from another equation, say, equation 3:

2z = λ(2x)

But λ=2x/(y + z)=2x/(x + z) [since x=y]

So, 2z = [2x/(x + z)]*(2x)

Simplify:

2z = (4x²)/(x + z)

Multiply both sides by (x + z):

2z(x + z) =4x²

2xz + 2z² =4x²

Divide both sides by 2:

xz + z² =2x²

Bring all terms to one side:

z² +xz -2x²=0

This is a quadratic in z:

z² +x z -2x²=0

Solutions:

z = [-x ± sqrt(x² +8x²)]/2 = [-x ±3x]/2

Since z>0, take positive solution:

z= [(-x +3x)]/2=(2x)/2=x

So, z=x. Therefore, in this case, x=y=z, which again leads us to the cube case, which doesn't satisfy the surface area. Therefore, the only solution is when x=y=z, which isn't valid, so our only valid solutions are when two variables are equal, x=y, but not all three.

So, going back, when we assumed x=y
