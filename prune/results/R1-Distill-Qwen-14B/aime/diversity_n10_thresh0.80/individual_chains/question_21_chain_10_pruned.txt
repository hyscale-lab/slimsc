Okay, so I have this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

First, an integer b is at least 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So that makes sense. 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers n that satisfy the b-eautiful condition.

Let me break this down. First, I should probably express n in base b. If n has exactly two digits in base b, that means that in base 10, n is equal to a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c have to be less than b. 

So, n = a * b + c, where a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. 

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, if I set up the equation:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of a and c. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as a quadratic in one of the variables.

Let me think about variables. Since a and c are digits in base b, we can consider a and c as integers with 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, for each base b, we can iterate through possible a and c to find all pairs (a,c) such that a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Alternatively, maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Let me try to express the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me subtract a*b and c from both sides:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps it's better to treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me rearrange:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

So, this is a quadratic in a. For each c, we can solve for a.

The quadratic equation is:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

The solutions to this quadratic are:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt( (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c^2 - c) ) ] / 2

Simplify the discriminant:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4(c^2 - c)

Let me expand this:

D = 4c² - 4b c + b² - 4c² + 4c

Simplify terms:

4c² -4c² cancels out. So:

D = -4b c + b² +4c

So, D = b² -4b c +4c

Hmm, so the discriminant is D = b² -4b c +4c.

Since a must be an integer (a digit in base b), the discriminant must be a perfect square. Otherwise, a would be irrational, which isn't allowed.

So, for each base b, and for each c (from 0 to b-1), we can calculate D and see if it's a perfect square. If it is, then we can solve for a and check if a is an integer within the valid range (1 to b-1).

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe another approach could be better.

Alternatively, let's consider that n is equal to a*b + c, and sqrt(n) = a + c. So, n must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (a + c is an integer). Therefore, n is a perfect square.

So, let me denote k = a + c, so k is an integer, and n = k².

But also, n = a*b + c.

So, putting them together:

k² = a*b + c

But since c = k - a, we can substitute:

k² = a*b + (k - a)

Simplify:

k² = a*b + k - a

Rearranging:

k² - k = a*(b -1)

So,

a = (k² -k)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k² -k) must be divisible by (b -1), and the resulting a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

So, for each base b, we can find the values of k such that (k² -k) is divisible by (b -1), and a = (k² -k)/(b -1) is an integer between 1 and b-1.

Also, since c = k - a, we need c to be non-negative and less than b. So, c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, let's write down the conditions:

1. k² = a*b + c
2. c = k - a
3. a = (k² -k)/(b -1)
4. 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1
5. 0 ≤ c = k - a ≤ b-1
6. k must be a positive integer because it's a sum of digits a and c, which are non-negative.

So,
