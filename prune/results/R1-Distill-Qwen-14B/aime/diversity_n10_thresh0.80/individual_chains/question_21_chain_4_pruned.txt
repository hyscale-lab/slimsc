Okay, so I have this problem to solve where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, let me break this down. If a number n has exactly two digits in base b, that means it can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b.

Furthermore, the sum of the digits a and c must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, we can write this as:
a + c = sqrt(n)
But n is also equal to a * b + c. So substituting, we get:
a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of a and c. But since a and c are digits in base b, their possible values are limited. a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can range from 0 to b-1.

I need to find, for each base b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation:
(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

And then find the smallest b where the number of such pairs exceeds 10.

Let me try to manipulate the equation to see if I can express it differently. Starting from:
(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Let me expand the left side:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Bring all terms to the left:
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Maybe factor some terms. Let's see, perhaps group terms with a and c.

Looking at this equation, maybe I can treat it as a quadratic in a. Let's rearrange:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Yes, that's a quadratic equation in a. For each c, we can solve for a. But since a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps I can find constraints on c and a.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express b in terms of a and c.

From the original equation:
(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Let me solve for b:

a * b = (a + c)^2 - c

So,

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Simplify the numerator:

= [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c] / a

Let me split the terms:

= (a^2)/a + (2ac)/a + (c^2 - c)/a

= a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Hmm, since b must be an integer, and a is a positive integer, the term (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer as well.

So, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

That is, a must divide (c^2 - c).

So, a | (c^2 - c). Since a >=1 and c is between 0 and b-1, which is >=1.

Wait, c can be zero? Let me check.

In the two-digit number, the second digit c can be zero. So c can be 0, but then a can't be zero. So when c is zero, let's see what happens.

If c = 0, then the equation becomes:

(a + 0)^2 = a * b + 0
a^2 = a * b
So, a = b. But a must be less than b because it's a digit in base b. So when c=0, a = b, which is not allowed because a must be less than b. Therefore, c cannot be zero. So c must be at least 1.

So, c ranges from 1 to b-1, and a ranges from 1 to b-1.

Now, back to the equation:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. So, a divides (c^2 - c) = c(c - 1). So, a is a divisor of c(c - 1).

But since a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 1 and b-1, perhaps we can find possible a for each c.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by considering that for each b, we can iterate through possible a and c values and check if the equation holds.

But since we're looking for the minimal b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions in terms of b.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent the equation as:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Let me denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n). Then n = s^2. So n must be a perfect square.

So, n is a perfect square, and as a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits (a >=1, c >=1), and a + c = s.

So, another way to look at it is that n = s^2 = a * b + c, and s = a + c.

Therefore, s^2 = a * b + c
But since c = s - a, substituting:

s^2 = a * b + (s - a)
s^2 = a * b + s - a
s^2 - s = a * (b - 1)

So,

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 <= a <= b - 1, and c = s - a must satisfy 1 <= c <= b - 1.

So, for each base b, the number of possible s is the number of integers s such that:

1. s^2 - s is divisible by (b - 1)
2. a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1) is an integer between 1 and b - 1
3. c = s - a is an integer between 1 and b - 1

So, for each b, we can find all s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if a and c are within their respective ranges.

Alternatively, since a must be positive and <= b-1, and c must be positive and <= b-1, s must be at least a + 1 (since c = s - a >=1).

But perhaps another approach is to note that (s^2 - s) must be a multiple of (b - 1). So
