Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner if he has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so it's a combinatorial game. The key here is to determine the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position n is a losing position, then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this using dynamic programming. I'll define an array where each index represents the number of tokens, and the value at that index is True if it's a winning position, False otherwise.

The base case is n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, when n=0, the previous player has won. But wait, in our case, the player who takes the last token wins, so n=0 would mean the previous player took the last token and won. So, the current player has no moves and thus loses. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, maybe I should re-express this: Let's think in terms of Grundy numbers or something similar, but perhaps it's easier to model the positions step by step.

Let me create a table for small n and see the pattern.

n | Winning? (B for Bob can win, A for Alice can win)
0 | Losing (no tokens, so previous player won)
1 | Alice can take 1 and win. So, Winning for Alice.
2 | Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then can take 1 and win. Wait, no. If n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob wins. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but n=2, she can't. So, from n=2, Alice can only take 1, leading to Bob taking the last one. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Wait, no, because if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes 1 and wins. So Alice wants to avoid that. Alternatively, if Alice could take 4, but she can't. So from n=2, Alice can't force a win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again.

Wait, when n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 token. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Alternatively, Alice can't take 4 because n=2 <4. So Alice's only move leads to Bob winning. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 tokens. From n=2, we just determined that it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, Bob would be facing a losing position, meaning Alice can force Bob into a losing position, so n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, but let's check: When n=3, Alice can take 1, leaving 2. Then Bob is at n=2, which is a losing position, so Bob can't win. So Alice can win by taking 1. So n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 tokens. Then Bob can take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 1, which Bob can take and win. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If Alice takes 1 from 5, leaving 4, then Bob takes 4 and wins. If Alice takes 4, leaving 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So yes, Alice can't force a win from n=5. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.

Wait, but wait another possibility: perhaps I'm not considering all options. For example, when n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4. But from n=4, Bob can take 4 and win. So that's bad for Alice. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 1, which Bob takes and wins. So yes, both options lead to Bob winning. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.

n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5. From n=5, we just saw that it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So Bob would be facing a losing position, meaning Alice can force a win by taking 1. So n=6 is a winning position.

Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 2. From n=2, we saw that it's a losing position, so Bob would be in a losing position. So if Alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2, Bob is forced to take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who can take it and win. Wait, no, because n=2 is a losing position for Bob, so Bob can't win from there, meaning Alice can take 4 and leave Bob at a losing position. So n=6 is a winning position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So, for n=6, Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (a losing position for Bob), so n=6 is a winning position.

n=7: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 6, which is a winning position for Bob. Or she can take 4, leaving 3, which is a winning position for Bob. Wait, but that's not good. Wait, no: if Alice leaves Bob at a winning position, then Bob can win. So if both options leave Bob at a winning position, then n=7 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, let's check: n=7.

If Alice takes 1, n becomes 6, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can win from there. If Alice takes 4, n becomes 3, which is a winning position for Bob. So no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So n=7 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

n=8: Let's see.

If Alice takes 1, n becomes 7, which is a losing position for Bob. That's good for Alice. So Alice can take 1, leaving Bob at a losing position. So n=8 is a winning position for Alice.

Alternatively, she could take 4, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob. So she wouldn't choose that option. So she would take 1, leaving 7, a losing position for Bob. So n=8 is a winning position.

n=9: Alice can take 1, leaving 8 (winning for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 5 (losing for Bob). So if she takes 4, Bob is left with n=5, which is a losing position. So Alice can force Bob into a losing position, so n=9 is a winning position.

Wait, but n=5 is a losing position. So if Alice takes 4 from 9, leaving 5, Bob is in a losing position. So Alice can win from n=9.

n=10: Let's see.

Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (winning for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 6 (winning for Bob). So both options leave Bob in a winning position, so n=10 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine. If Alice is at n=10, she can take 1, leaving 9. From n=9, Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 6. From n=6, Bob can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. So regardless of Alice's move, Bob can respond to leave Alice at a losing position. So n=10 is a losing position for Alice.

Hmm, so let me list out the positions I've determined so far:

n | Winning (W) or Losing (L)
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L

Wait, so the pattern seems to be: L at n=0,2,5,7,10... Let's see the differences between these losing positions.

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to 10: +3

So the pattern is adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. So the losing positions are at n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, etc.

So the losing positions seem to occur every 5, but with a cycle? Let me see.

Wait, the losing positions are at 0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,19, etc. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to model this as a periodic pattern.

Looking at the positions:

n | W/L
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
11| W
12| L
13| W
14| W
15| L
16| W
17| L
18| W
19| W
20| L
...

So the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc. Let's see the pattern. Let's see the differences:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to5: +3

5 to7: +2

7 to10: +3

10 to12: +2

12 to15:+3

15 to17:+2

17 to20:+3

So the pattern is alternating between adding 2 and 3. So the losing positions are generated by starting at 0, then adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.

So the losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers that can be expressed as 5k, 5k+2, 5k+5? Or perhaps more accurately, every 5 numbers, but the losing positions are at positions 2 and 5 mod 5.

Wait, 0 mod5=0, 2 mod5=2,5 mod5=0,7 mod5=2,10 mod5=0,12 mod5=2,15 mod5=0, etc.

Wait, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0 → losing

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → losing

n=5: 0 → losing

n=7: 2 → losing

n=10:0 → losing

n=12:2 → losing

Yes, that seems consistent.

So the losing positions are n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait, let's check n=15:15 mod5=0 → losing

n=17:17 mod5=2 → losing

n=20:20 mod5=0 → losing

n=22:22 mod5=2 → losing

Yes, this seems to hold.

So if the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then the number of losing positions ≤2024 is equal to the number of integers ≤2024 that are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let me double-check for higher n to ensure this pattern holds.

n=23: 23 mod5=3 → should be a winning position.

From n=23, Alice can take 1, leaving 22, which is a losing position. So Alice can win by taking 1.

n=24:24 mod5=4 → winning position.

n=25:25 mod5=0 → losing.

Yes, so the pattern holds. So the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So now, the problem is to count how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Let's compute the count for each case and sum them.

First, count numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024.

The smallest is 0, but since n is positive, the smallest is 5. So the numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum ≤2024.

The maximum multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Wait, but 5*404=2020, which is correct.

But wait, 5*404=2020, which is ≤2024, so yes.

Now for numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024.

The sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum ≤2024.

What's the maximum term? Let's compute.

The largest number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5 is 2024 if 2024 mod5=2024%5.

2024 divided by5 is 404*5=2020, with 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4. So the previous number ≡2 mod5 is 2024-3=2021?

Wait, 2020 is 0 mod5, so adding 2 gives 2022, which is 2022 mod5=2022-5*404=2022-2020=2, so 2022 is 2 mod5. And 2022+5=2027, which is beyond 2024. So the maximum term is 2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

The general term is 5k +2. Let's find the number of terms.

The first term is 2 (k=0: 5*0+2=2).

Last term is 2022=5k+2 →5k=2020 →k=404.

So number of terms is 404 +1=405.

Wait, because when k=0, it's the first term, so k runs from 0 to 404, which is 405 terms.

So total losing positions are 404 (for ≡0) +405 (for ≡2) =809.

Wait, but wait: for n=0, it's a losing position, but the problem says positive integers, so n starts at 1. So when counting n≡0 mod5, the first term is 5, not 0.

Wait, but in my earlier count, I considered 5,10,...,2020: which is 404 terms, correct.

For n≡2 mod5, the first term is 2, which is a positive integer. So in that case, the count is 405 terms, since it starts at k=0 (n=2) up to k=404 (n=2022).

So total losing positions for n≥1: 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let's double-check. Let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Total numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5*404=2020, which is ≤2024, and 5*405=2025>2024).

Numbers ≡2 mod5: floor((2024 -2)/5) +1= (2022)/5=404.4 →404 full steps, plus 1. So 405 numbers.

So total is 404+405=809.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.

But wait, let me verify with smaller n. For example, up to n=10.

n=1-10:

Losing positions are 2,5,7,10 →4 numbers.

According to the formula: floor(10/5)=2 (for ≡0:5,10)

Numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7 →2 numbers.

Wait, but 2+2=4, which matches the actual count. So the formula works.

Wait, another example: up to n=7.

Losing positions:2,5,7 →3 numbers.

Using the formula: floor(7/5)=1 (5)

Numbers ≡2:2,7 →2. So total 1+2=3, which matches.

So the formula seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 809.


To determine how many positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) allow Bob to guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.

By examining small values of \( n \), we observe a pattern in the losing positions. These positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). 

To count the number of such \( n \) up to 2024:
1. Numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5: The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. There are \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \) terms.
2. Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5: The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. There are \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \) terms.

Summing these gives \( 404 + 405 = 809 \) losing positions.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is:

\boxed{809}
