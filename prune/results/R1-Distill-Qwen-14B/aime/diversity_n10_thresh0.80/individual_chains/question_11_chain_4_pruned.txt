Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], and z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4 centered at the origin. So z can be represented as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. But maybe it's easier to write z as 4e^{iθ} because working with exponentials might simplify things, especially when dealing with inverses like 1/z.

Wait, if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So substituting that into the expression might make it easier to handle.

Let me write that out:

The expression becomes:
(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ})).

Simplify each part:

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression is:
4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote this as Re[...].

Let me compute each term's real part separately.

First, 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}. Let me represent 75 + 117i in polar form to make it easier to multiply by e^{iθ}.

The magnitude of 75 + 117i is sqrt(75^2 + 117^2). Let me compute that:

75^2 = 5625, 117^2 = 13689. So total is 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So sqrt(19314). Hmm, let me see: 139^2 is 19321, which is just a bit more than 19314. So sqrt(19314) is approximately 139, but let me see if it's exact. Wait, 139^2 is 19321, which is 7 more than 19314. So 19314 is 139^2 -7. So it's not a perfect square. Maybe I can factor it further? Let me see, 19314 divided by 6 is 3219, which is 3*1073. Wait, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can just keep it as sqrt(19314) for now.

The argument of 75 + 117i is φ = arctan(117/75). Let me compute 117/75 = 1.56. So arctan(1.56) is approximately 57 degrees or so. Let me compute it more accurately. Since tan(57°) is about 1.5399, which is close. Tan(57.5°) is about 1.583, which is a bit higher. So maybe around 57.3 degrees. Hmm, but perhaps I can represent it as φ = arctan(117/75).

So 75 + 117i = sqrt(19314) * e^{iφ}, where φ = arctan(117/75).

Similarly, 24 + 36i. Let me compute its magnitude: sqrt(24^2 + 36^2) = sqrt(576 + 1296) = sqrt(1872). Let me see, 43^2 is 1849, 44^2 is 1936, so sqrt(1872) is approx 43.27. Again, maybe factor 1872: 1872 = 16*117, which is 16*9*13 = 144*13, so sqrt(1872) = 12*sqrt(13). Oh, nice, so 12√13. So the magnitude is 12√13, and the argument is arctan(36/24) = arctan(3/2). Let me call this ψ = arctan(3/2).

So now, substituting back into the expression:

First term: 4 * sqrt(19314) * e^{iφ} * e^{iθ} = 4 sqrt(19314) e^{i(θ + φ)}.

Second term: 12√13 * e^{iψ} * e^{-iθ} = 12√13 e^{i(ψ - θ)}.

So the expression becomes:
4 sqrt(19314) e^{i(θ + φ)} + 12√13 e^{i(ψ - θ)}.

Now, the real part of this expression is:

Re[4 sqrt(19314) e^{i(θ + φ)}] + Re[12√13 e^{i(ψ - θ)}]

Which equals:

4 sqrt(19314) cos(θ + φ) + 12√13 cos(ψ - θ).

So the real part is a function of θ: let me denote it as f(θ) = A cos(θ + φ) + B cos(ψ - θ), where A = 4 sqrt(19314), B = 12√13.

But I need to find the maximum value of f(θ). So I can treat this as an optimization problem: find the maximum of A cos(θ + φ) + B cos(ψ - θ).

Hmm, maybe I can combine these terms into a single cosine function with some phase shift. Alternatively, I can use calculus to find the maximum. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

f(θ) = A cos(θ + φ) + B cos(ψ - θ) = A cos θ cos φ - A sin θ sin φ + B cos ψ cos θ + B sin ψ sin θ.

Wait, let me expand both terms:

cos(θ + φ) = cosθ cosφ - sinθ sinφ.

cos(ψ - θ) = cosψ cosθ + sinψ sinθ.

So f(θ) becomes:

A (cosθ cosφ - sinθ sinφ) + B (cosψ cosθ + sinψ sinθ)

= (A cosφ + B cosψ) cosθ + (-A sinφ + B sinψ) sinθ.

Let me denote:

C = A cosφ + B cosψ,

D = -A sinφ + B sinψ.

Then f(θ) = C cosθ + D sinθ.

Which is of the form C cosθ + D sinθ. The maximum value of such an expression is sqrt(C² + D²), so the maximum real part is sqrt(C² + D²).

So that's the approach. So I need to compute C and D, then compute sqrt(C² + D²).

Alright, now let's compute C and D.

First, let's compute A, B, φ, and ψ.

We had:

A = 4 sqrt(19314),

B = 12√13,

φ = arctan(117/75) = arctan(1.56),

ψ = arctan(36/24) = arctan(3/2) = arctan(1.5).

Let me compute cosφ and sinφ.

Since 75 + 117i has real part 75 and imaginary part 117, so cosφ = 75 / |75 + 117i| = 75 / sqrt(75² + 117²) = 75 / sqrt(19314).

Similarly, sinφ = 117 / sqrt(19314).

Similarly, for ψ, cosψ = 24 / sqrt(24² + 36²) = 24 / sqrt(1872) = 24 / (12√13) )= 2 / √13.

Wait, sqrt(1872) is 12√13 because 12^2 *13 = 144 *13 = 1872. So yeah, sqrt(1872) = 12√13. Therefore:

cosψ = 24 / (12√13) )= 2 / √13,

sinψ = 36 / (12√13) )= 3 / √13.

So, now let's compute C and D.

C = A cosφ + B cosψ,

D = -A sinφ + B sinψ.

Compute each term step by step.

First, A cosφ = 4 sqrt(19314) * (75 / sqrt(19314)) )= 4 *75 = 300.

Because sqrt(19314) cancels out.

Similarly, B cosψ = 12√13 * (2 / √13) )= 12 *2 =24.

So C = 300 +24=324.

Now D:

-A sinφ = -4 sqrt(19314) * (117 / sqrt(19314)) )= -4 * 117 = -468.

B sinψ =12√13 * (3 /√13 )= 12*3=36.

So D = -468 +36= -432.

So now, f(θ) = C cosθ + D sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

The maximum value of this is sqrt(C² + D²) = sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Compute that:

324²: let's compute 324*324.

324 is 18^2, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Wait, 18^2 is 324, so 324^2 is (324)^2.

Let me compute 300² =90000, 24²=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So (300+24)^2=300² + 2*300*24 +24²=90000 +14400 +576= 90000+14400=104400 +576=104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400²=160000, 32²=1024, 2*400*32=25600. So (400+32)^2=400² +2*400*32 +32²=160000 +25600 +1024=160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600).

Compute sqrt(291600).

Well, 500^2=250000, 540^2=291600. Because 54^2=2916, so 540^2=291600. So sqrt(291600)=540.

Thus, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the expression:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, substituted into the expression, broke it down into two terms, converted them into exponentials, then expressed the real parts.

Converted each complex number into polar form, calculated their magnitudes and arguments.

Then, combined the terms, expanded using cosine addition formulas, regrouped into C cosθ + D sinθ, found C and D correctly?

Wait, C was A cosφ + B
