Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. My goal is to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where N = Q*1000 + R.

Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what N looks like. Let's denote N as a four-digit number, so N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, and A is not zero.

The condition is that if any digit is replaced by 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies this condition. But checking each number one by one might take too long, so I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the properties that N must satisfy. Let's denote N as ABCD.

When changing each digit to 1, we get four numbers:

1. 1BCD: Let's call this N1.
2. A1CD: Let's call this N2.
3. AB1D: Let's call this N3.
4. ABC1: Let's call this N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 mod 7 = 0
N2 mod 7 = 0
N3 mod 7 = 0
N4 mod 7 = 0

Let me write expressions for each of these:

1. N1 = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
   So, (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

2. N2 = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
   So, (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

3. N3 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
   So, (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

4. N4 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1
   So, (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, now I have four congruence conditions. Let me compute each modulo 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 divided by 7.

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition:

1. N1: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 6 ≡ -1, so -1 + ... ≡ 0 → ... ≡ 1 mod 7)

2. N2: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod 7 (since 2 ≡ 2, so 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7 → which is same as 5 mod 7)

3. N3: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7 (since 3 ≡ 3, so 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod 7 → which is 4 mod 7)

4. N4: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7
   So, 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7 (since 1 ≡ 1, so 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ -1 mod 7 → 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7)

So now I have four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 (mod 7) --> Equation (1)
2. 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 (mod 7) --> Equation (2)
3. 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 (mod 7) --> Equation (3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 (mod 7) --> Equation (4)

Now, my variables are A, B, C, D, each digits from 0-9, with A ≥ 1.

I need to solve these four congruences.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

First, from Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7

Let me note that 6 ≡ -1 mod 7, and 2 remains as is, 3 remains as is.

So, Equation (4): (-A) + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

Equation (4): -A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7

Similarly, Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡ 5 mod 7

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ 1 mod 7

Perhaps I can subtract Equation (1) from Equations (2) and (3) to eliminate D.

Let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A + 3C + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7

Simplify:

6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Which is 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Similarly, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B + D) - (2B + 3C + D) ≡ 4 - 1 mod 7

Simplify:

6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7

So now, I have two new equations:

Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation (6): 6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod 7

Let me also consider Equation (4): -A + 2B + 3C ≡ 6 mod 7

So, now I have Equations (4), (5), (6).

Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Let me solve for B in terms of A.

6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7

Let me write it as:

-2B ≡ 4 - 6A mod 7

Multiply both sides by (-1/2) mod 7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4.

So, B ≡ (4 - 6A) * 4 mod 7

Compute: (4 -6A)*4 = 16 -24A ≡ 2 - 3A mod7 (since 16 mod7=2, 24 mod7=3)

So, B ≡ 2 - 3A mod7 --> Equation (5a)

Similarly, from Equation (6): 6A - 3C ≡ 3 mod7

Let me solve for C in terms of A.

6A - 3C ≡3 mod7

Rearranged: -3C ≡ 3 -6A mod7

Multiply both sides by (-1/3) mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse of 3 is 5.

C ≡ (3 -6A)*5 mod7

Compute: (3 -6A)*5 = 15 -30A ≡1 -2A mod7 (since 15 mod7=1, 30 mod7=2)

So, C ≡1 - 2A mod7 --> Equation (6a)

Now, from Equation (4): -A + 2B + 3C ≡6 mod7

We can substitute B and C from Equations (5a) and (6a):

B ≡2 -3A mod7

C ≡1 -2A mod7

Substitute into Equation (4):

- A + 2*(2 -3A) +3*(1 -2A) ≡6 mod7

Compute each term:

- A + (4 -6A) + (3 -6A) = -A +4 -6A +3 -6A = (-1 -6 -6)A + (4 +3)

= (-13A) +7

Simplify mod7:

-13A ≡ -13 mod7. Since 13 mod7=6, so -13 ≡ -6 ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, 7≡0 mod7.

So, we have 1*A + 0 ≡6 mod7

So, A ≡6 mod7.

Since A is a digit (1-9), A can be 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid as a digit. So, A=6.

Great! So, A=6.

Now, let's find B and C from Equations (5a) and (6a):

From (5a): B ≡2 -3A mod7

A=6, so 3*6=18≡4 mod7, so 2 -4 = -2 ≡5 mod7.

So, B ≡5 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), B can be 5 or 12, but 12 is invalid, so B=5.

From (6a): C ≡1 -2A mod7

A=6, 2*6=12≡5 mod7, so 1 -5 = -4 ≡3 mod7.

So, C≡3 mod7. Hence, C can be 3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so C=3.

So, now we have A=6, B=5, C=3.

Now, we need to find D.

Looking back to Equation (1): 2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

Plugging in B=5, C=3:

2*5 +3*3 +D ≡10 +9 + D ≡19 + D ≡(19 mod7=5) + D ≡5 + D ≡1 mod7.

So, 5 + D ≡1 mod7 → D ≡1 -5 = -4 ≡3 mod7.

So, D≡3 mod7. Since D is a digit (0-9), possible D=3 or 10, but 10 invalid, so D=3.

Wait, so let's check if that works.

So, N is 6 5 3 3 → 6533.

Wait, let me check if each of the four modified numbers is divisible by 7.

Let me compute N1, N2, N3, N4.

N1: 1BCD =1533. Let's see if 1533 is divisible by 7.

1533 ÷7: 7*219=1533? Let's check: 7*200=1400, 7*19=133 → 1400+133=1533. Yes, so yes, 1533 is divisible by 7.

N2: A1CD =6133. 6133 ÷7: 7*876=6132, so 6133-6132=1. So remainder 1, which means it's not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that means my calculations must have gone wrong somewhere because N2 is not divisible by 7, but according to my earlier equations, it should be.

Wait, let's double-check the steps.

I found A=6, B=5, C=3, D=3.

So N=6533.

Check N2: 6133.

6133 ÷7: Let me compute 7*876=6132, so 6133-6132=1. So remainder 1, not divisible by 7.

Hmm, that's an issue. So my earlier reasoning must have a mistake.

Wait, let me go back.

So, I had four equations:

1. 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7

2.6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

3.6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

4.6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

I solved Equations (5) and (6) to get A=6, B=5, C=3, D=3.

But when plugging back, N2 is 6133 which is not divisible by 7. So, perhaps there's a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Let me recheck the equations.

Equation (1): N1 =1BCD → 1000 +100B +10C + D → mod7: 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7. Correct.

Equation (2): N2 = A1CD → 1000A +100 +10C + D → mod7: 6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 → 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7. Correct.

Equation (3): N3 = AB1D → 1000A +100B +10 + D → mod7:6A +2B +3 + D ≡0 →6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7. Correct.

Equation (4): N4 = ABC1 →1000A +100B +10C +1 → mod7:6A +2B +3C +1≡0 →6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7. Correct.

So, equations are correct.

Then, when I subtracted equations, I got:

Equation (5): 6A -2B ≡4 mod7

Equation (6):6A -3C≡3 mod7

Equation (4): -A +2B +3C≡6 mod7

Then, substituting B and C in terms of A into Equation (4), I got A≡6 mod7, leading to A=6.

Substituting A=6 into Equations (5a) and (6a), I got B=5, C=3.

Then, using Equation (1), I found D=3.

But when testing N=6533, N2 is 6133, which is not divisible by 7.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Equation (4) after substitution.

Wait, let me go through the substitution again.

Equation (4): -A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

From Equations (5a) and (6a):

B =2 -3A mod7

C=1 -2A mod7

So,

Equation (4) becomes: -A +2*(2 -3A) +3*(1 -2A) ≡6 mod7

Compute step by step:

First, expand:

- A + 2*(2 -3A) = -A +4 -6A = (-7A) +4

Then, add 3*(1 -2A): 3*(1 -2A) =3 -6A

So, total:

(-7A +4) + (3 -6A) = (-13A) +7

Wait, -7A -6A = -13A; 4 +3 =7.

So, Equation (4): (-13A) +7 ≡6 mod7.

But -13A mod7: 13 mod7=6, so -13A ≡-6A mod7. So,

-6A +7 ≡6 mod7.

But 7 ≡0 mod7, so:

-6A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

6A ≡ -6 mod7 → 6A ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

Wait, so 6A ≡1 mod7.

We can solve for A:

6A ≡1 mod7 → Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, inverse is 6.

So, A ≡6*1 ≡6 mod7.

So, A=6, correct. So, earlier steps are correct.

Then, why is N2 not divisible by7? There must be an error in calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps when computing N2, I made a mistake.

Wait, N2 is A1CD, which in this case A=6, so N2=6133.

Wait, let's compute 6133 ÷7.

Compute 7 * 800 =5600, 6133-5600=533.

7*70=490, 533-490=43.

7*6=42, 43-42=1.

So, 6133=7*(800+70+6) +1=7*876 +1 → remainder 1. So, indeed, not divisible by7.

Hmm, but according to Equation (2), 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

With A=6, C=3, D=3:

6*6=36≡1 mod7,

3*3=9≡2 mod7,

D=3≡3 mod7.

So, 1 +2 +3 =6 mod7.

Wait, 6 ≡6 mod7, but Equation (2) requires it to be ≡5 mod7.

Wait, that's a problem. So, 6 ≡6 ≡5? No, 6≡6≡5 is not correct. So, that suggests that perhaps my earlier substitution was wrong.

Wait, but how did I get A=6? Because in Equation (4), after substitution, I had -6A ≡6 mod7 → 6A≡1 mod7, leading to A=6.

But if A=6, then 6A=36≡1 mod7. So, correct.

But then, when plugging into Equation (2): 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

With A=6, C=3, D=3:

6*6=36≡1,

3C=9≡2,

D=3≡3.

Total: 1+2+3=6≡6, which is not 5 mod7.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, that suggests that my substitutions led me to a wrong conclusion. Because Equation (2) is not satisfied.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let's go back to Equations (5
