Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-gon. 

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. I know that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting non-adjacent vertices. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

I think the key here is to figure out how to select four points (vertices) that form a rectangle. Since it's a regular dodecagon, it's symmetric, so maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use.

Wait, in a regular polygon, for a set of four points to form a rectangle, their positions must satisfy certain conditions. I remember that in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by selecting pairs of points that are diametrically opposite each other. But in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, the concept might be similar but more complex.

Let me think about the structure. A regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle. So, all the vertices lie on a circle. For four points to form a rectangle, the points must be such that their opposite sides are equal and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. In a circle, that would mean that the points are placed symmetrically with respect to the center.

So, perhaps I can approach this by considering the diameters of the circle. Each diameter can be a diagonal of the dodecagon, connecting two opposite vertices. If I can find two such diameters that are perpendicular to each other, their intersection at the center will form a rectangle. But wait, actually, no. If two diameters are perpendicular, they form four points which are the vertices of a rectangle. So, each pair of perpendicular diameters will give me a rectangle.

Wait, but how many such pairs of perpendicular diameters are there in a dodecagon? Let's think about that.

In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is separated by an angle of 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30. So, the angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees. If I pick a diameter, say connecting vertex 1 and vertex 7 (since they are opposite), then to find another diameter perpendicular to it, I need another diameter that's rotated by 90 degrees from this one.

So, the angle between the two diameters should be 90 degrees. Since each step between vertices is 30 degrees, a 90-degree rotation would be 3 steps. So, the second diameter would connect vertex 4 and vertex 10, perhaps? Let me check: from vertex 1, moving 3 steps brings me to vertex 4. So, the diameter from 4 to 10 would be perpendicular to the diameter from 1 to 7. Similarly, the diameter from 2 to 8 would also be perpendicular to 5 to 11, wait no, wait. Maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, each diameter is defined by two opposite vertices. So, in a dodecagon, the number of diameters is 6, since 12/2=6. Each diameter is separated by 30 degrees from the next. But to find how many pairs of diameters are perpendicular, I need to see how many pairs of diameters are separated by 90 degrees.

But since each diameter is 30 degrees apart, how many steps apart are they to get 90 degrees? 90/30=3. So, each diameter is 3 steps apart from another diameter to be perpendicular. So, for each diameter, there is exactly one other diameter that's perpendicular to it. Since each pair of perpendicular diameters can be considered as one rectangle.

Wait, but that might not be correct because each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular diameters. But let's see: if I have 6 diameters, each separated by 30 degrees, then each diameter will have exactly two diameters that are perpendicular to it because 90 degrees can be on either side. Wait, 90 degrees in one direction is 3 steps, and in the other direction, it's 9 steps, but since 12/2=6, 9 steps would be equivalent to -3 steps. So, each diameter has two perpendicular diameters: one 3 steps clockwise and another 3 steps counterclockwise.

Wait, that can't be because 3 steps in one direction and 9 steps in the other (which is the same as 3 steps in the opposite direction). So, for each diameter, there are two other diameters that are perpendicular to it. But wait, that would lead to each rectangle being counted multiple times.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of how many unique pairs of perpendicular diameters there are. Since each pair consists of two diameters, and each diameter can pair with two others, but each such pair is unique.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the number of rectangles as the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters. How many such pairs are there?

In a regular dodecagon, each diameter can be paired with two others that are perpendicular to it. So, for each of the 6 diameters, there are 2 perpendicular diameters. So, that would give 6*2=12. But since each pair is counted twice (once for each diameter in the pair), the total number of unique pairs is 12/2=6.

Wait, but that would give me 6 rectangles. But I know from the problem statement that there are at least three rectangles shown in the diagram, so 6 seems plausible. But maybe there are more rectangles because not all rectangles are necessarily formed by two diameters. Wait, maybe some rectangles are formed not by diameters but by other diagonals. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of axes in the dodecagon. Each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular diameters, which act as the diagonals of the rectangle. So, each rectangle corresponds to a unique pair of perpendicular diameters.

But then, in that case, the number of rectangles would be equal to the number of such pairs. So, if each pair of perpendicular diameters forms a unique rectangle, and there are 6 such pairs, then there would be 6 rectangles
