Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, but I'll try to break them down step by step.

First, let me write down the functions:

The function f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. Wait, that's the absolute value of (|x| - 1/2), right? So f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|, so g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

Now, the two equations given are:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs. So, an intersection occurs when for some (x, y), the first equation gives y in terms of x, and the second equation gives x in terms of y. So, essentially, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can analyze the functions step by step, starting from the innermost parts and working my way out.

Let me first understand what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 would have vertices at (0, -1/2), but since we take the absolute value again, f(x) will flip any negative parts back up. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape that's symmetric about the y-axis.

Let me find the key points. When |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, which happens when |x| ≥ 1/2, then f(x) = |x| - 1/2. But when |x| < 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function:

f(x) = {
    1/2 - |x| , when |x| ≤ 1/2,
    |x| - 1/2 , when |x| > 1/2
}

This creates a V-shaped graph with the vertex at (0, 1/2), and it slopes downward on either side until it reaches (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), then slopes upward beyond that.

Similarly, let's consider g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

Again, starting from |x|, subtracting 1/4, then taking absolute value.

So, when |x| ≥ 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4. When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.

So, the graph of g(x) will have a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/4), sloping downward until |x| = 1/4, then upward beyond that.

Okay, now that I have f and g, let's see how they interact with the sine and cosine functions in the equations.

First, in the equation y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), let's break it down.

Starting with sin(2πx). The function sin(2πx) has a period of 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here k=2π, so period is 2π/(2π) = 1. So sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, completing a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.

Then f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) = | | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. So, | | sin(2πx) | - 1/2 | is f applied to a value between 0 and 1.

Looking back at the definition of f(x), when x is between 0 and 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x. When x is between 1/2 and 1, f(x) = x - 1/2.

So f(sin(2πx)) will be 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| ≤ 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| > 1/2.

Therefore, f(sin(2πx)) will have a range of [0, 1/2], since:

- When |sin(2πx)| = 0, f(0) = 1/2.

- When |sin(2πx)| = 1/2, f(1/2) = 0.

- When |sin(2πx)| =1, f(1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Wait, no, when |sin(2πx)| =1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So, the output of f(sin(2πx)) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a period of 1.

Then, g is applied to this result. So g(f(sin(2πx))) = | | f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |.

But since f(sin(2πx)) is always non-negative (as it's an absolute value), we can drop the outer absolute value:

g(f(s)) = | f(s) - 1/4 |, where s = sin(2πx).

Since f(s) ranges from 0 to 1/2, the argument inside the absolute value can range from -1/4 to 1/4 minus 1/4? Wait, let me think.

Wait, f(s) is between 0 and 1/2. So f(s) - 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4.

Therefore, |f(s) - 1/4| = |(f(s) - 1/4)|.

So, when f(s) ≥ 1/4, this is f(s) - 1/4. When f(s) < 1/4, it's 1/4 - f(s).

So, g(f(s)) is a function that will take f(s) and create a V-shape around 1/4.

So, the output
