Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. Once I find that p, I then need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². 

So, the first step is to figure out what p is. Maybe I can start by testing small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Let me check each one.

Starting with p=2: Let's see if there exists an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3,... 

n=1: 1⁴=1, 1+1=2. 2 mod4=2≠0.
n=2: 16+1=17, 17 mod4=1≠0.
n=3: 81+1=82, 82 mod4= 82-20*4=82-80=2≠0.
n=4: 256+1=257, 257 mod4=1≠0.

So seems like for p=2, no n satisfies n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: Let's see if there exists n with n⁴ ≡-1 mod9. Let's compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9).

n=1:1⁴=1 mod9=1 →1≠8.
n=2:16 mod9=7 →7≠8.
n=3:81 mod9=0→0≠8.
n=4:256 mod9. Let's compute 256 divided by9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 →4≠8.
n=5:5⁴=625. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4→4≠8.
n=6:6⁴=1296 mod9=0→0≠8.
n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401/9=266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7→7≠8.
n=8:8⁴=4096 mod9. 8 mod9=8, 8²=64 mod9=1, so 8⁴=(8²)²=1²=1 mod9. So 1≠8.

So none of the n from 1 to8 give n⁴≡8 mod9 (since -1 mod9 is 8). So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod25 for some n. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to24.

But that's a lot. Maybe we can find a smarter way. Since 5 is prime, the multiplicative group mod5² is cyclic of order φ(25)=20. So the multiplicative group mod25 has order 20, so any element's order divides 20.

We need n⁴ ≡-1 mod25. So, if such an n exists, then n^8 ≡1 mod25. So the order of n must divide 8 and also divide 20. The gcd(8,20)=4. So the order of n must be 4 or a factor of 4. Wait, but n^4 ≡-1 mod25, so n^8=1, so the order is exactly 8? Wait, no, because (-1)^2=1, so if n^4=-1, then n^8=1. So the order of n is 8. But the multiplicative group mod25 has order 20, which is 2²*5. So 8 divides 20? Wait, 8 doesn't divide 20. 20 divided by8 is 2.5, which isn't integer. So that would mean that such an n does not exist? Because the order of n has to divide the group order, which is 20. But 8 doesn't divide 20, so no element of order8 exists. Therefore, there is no n with n^4 ≡-1 mod25. So p=5 is out.

So moving on to p=7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod49 for some n.

Similarly, the multiplicative group mod49 has order φ(49)=42. So group order is 42=2*3*7.

Looking for n such that n^4 ≡-1 mod49. Then n^8≡1 mod49. So the order of n divides 8 and also divides 42. The gcd(8,42)=2. So the order of n divides 2. But n^4 ≡-1 mod49, so n^4 is not 1. So the order can't be 1 or 2. Hmm, so contradiction. Therefore, no such n exists for p=7 either.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the group order is 42, and if n^8 ≡1, then the order of n divides 8 and 42, so divides gcd(8,42)=2. So order is 1 or 2. But if n^4 ≡-1, which is not 1, so the order can't be 1 or 2. Therefore, such an n doesn't exist. So p=7 is out.

Next prime is p=11. Let's try p=11. So check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod121 exists.

Group order is φ(121)=110. So 110=2*5*11.

We need n^4 ≡-1 mod121. Then n^8 ≡1 mod121. So the order of n divides 8 and 110. gcd(8,110)=2. So order divides 2. So again, order is 1 or 2. But n^4 ≡-1 mod121. So n^4 is not 1 mod121, so order is not 1. If order is 2, then n^2 ≡1 mod121, so n^4=(n^2)^2=1^2=1 mod121. But we have n^4≡-1, which is not possible. So no solution for p=11.

Hmm, so p=11 is out. Next prime p=13.

Check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod169 exists.

Group order φ(13²)=13*12=156.

Looking for n where n^4 ≡-1 mod169. Then n^8≡1 mod169. So the order of n divides 8 and 156. gcd
