Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest such number with this specific property. The property is that if any single digit in N is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Interesting.

I need to find N first, right? Because once I have N, dividing by 1000 will give Q (the thousands digit) and R (the last three digits). Then adding those together.

So the key is to find N, the largest four-digit number with that property. Let's think about what that property implies.

Let me denote the digits of N as a, b, c, d, where N is abcd in digits. So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The condition is that if I change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, changing d to 1 gives abc1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, four different numbers, each obtained by replacing a single digit with 1, must all be divisible by 7. Interesting.

Given that N is a four-digit number, the largest possible N is 9999. But does 9999 satisfy this condition? Let's check.

First, let's consider changing each digit to 1 and see if the result is divisible by 7.

Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1999. Is 1999 divisible by 7? Let's see, 7*285=1995, 1995 +4=1999, so 1999 divided by 7 is 285 with a remainder of 4. So 1999 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, 9999 doesn't satisfy the condition. So N can't be 9999.

So we need to find the largest four-digit number where changing any single digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let me think about how to approach this.

Let me consider each digit position:

1. Thousands place: Changing a to 1 gives 1bcd. So 1bcd must be divisible by 7.
2. Hundreds place: Changing b to 1 gives a1cd. So a1cd must be divisible by 7.
3. Tens place: Changing c to 1 gives ab1d. So ab1d must be divisible by 7.
4. Units place: Changing d to 1 gives abc1. So abc1 must be divisible by 7.

Therefore, all four of these numbers must be divisible by 7. So, we can set up equations for these conditions.

But perhaps it's easier to model this by considering the original number N modulo 7, and how changing a digit affects its divisibility.

Wait, let's think about this. When you change a digit, say the thousands digit, from a to 1, the new number is 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit from b to 1 gives 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d, etc.

Each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 mod 7. So, let's write this in mod 7 terms.

Let me denote the original number N as N = a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d.

When we change a to 1: N1 = 1*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly,

N2 = a*1000 + 1*100 + c*10 + d ≡0 mod7,

N3 = a*1000 + b*100 + 1*10 + d ≡0 mod7,

N4 = a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruences:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡0 mod7,

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡0 mod7,

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡0 mod7,

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

But the original number N is congruent to some value mod7, say r. So N ≡ r mod7.

But each of the four modified numbers is 0 mod7. So, perhaps we can find relations between N and each modified number.

Let me compute the difference between N and each modified number.

For example, N1 is changing a to 1, so N1 = 1000 + 100b +10c +d.

N is 1000a + 100b +10c +d.

Therefore, N1 = N - 1000(a -1).

Similarly, N1 ≡ N - 1000(a -1) ≡0 mod7.

But N1 ≡ 0 mod7, so N - 1000(a-1) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly,

N2 = N - 100(b -1),

N3 = N -10(c -1),

N4 = N - (d -1).

Each of these must be congruent to 0 mod7. So,

N - 1000(a -1) ≡0 mod7,

N - 100(b -1) ≡0 mod7,

N -10(c -1) ≡0 mod7,

N - (d -1) ≡0 mod7.

Therefore, we can write:

N ≡ 1000(a -1) mod7,

N ≡ 100(b -1) mod7,

N ≡10(c -1) mod7,

N ≡ (d -1) mod7.

But since all four of these are congruent to N mod7, they must all be the same.

So, 1000(a -1) ≡ 100(b -1) ≡10(c -1)≡ (d -1) mod7.

Hmm, that's a key insight. So, all four expressions are congruent mod7.

Let me compute 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

Calculating:

7*142 = 994, so 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 divided by7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1 mod7.

Therefore, the above congruences become:

6*(a -1) ≡ 2*(b -1) ≡3*(c -1)≡ (d -1) mod7.

Let me denote this common value as k mod7. So,

6(a -1) ≡k mod7,

2(b -1)≡k mod7,

3(c -1)≡k mod7,

(d -1)≡k mod7.

So, we can set up equations:

From first equation: 6(a -1) ≡k mod7 ⇒ a ≡ (k/6) +1 mod7. But division in mod7 needs to be done with the modular inverse. Since 6 and7 are coprime, the inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, because 6*6=36≡1 mod7. So, a ≡6k +1 mod7.

Similarly, second equation: 2(b-1)≡k ⇒ b ≡ (k/2) +1 mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So b≡4k +1 mod7.

Third equation: 3(c -1)≡k ⇒ c≡(k/3)+1 mod7. The inverse of 3 mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So c≡5k +1 mod7.

Fourth equation: d ≡k +1 mod7.

So, all digits a, b, c, d are related to k via these congruences.

But a, b, c, d are digits in N, which is a four-digit number, so each is between 0 and9, inclusive, except a which is between1 and9.

Wait, but N is a four-digit number, so a is from1 to9, and b, c, d from0 to9.

So, for each digit, we can find possible values based on k.

But k is an integer mod7, so k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, perhaps for each possible k (0-6), we can find possible a, b, c, d digits.

But since we're looking for the largest N, which is a four-digit number, we can try to find the maximum N by trying to maximize a, then b, then c, then d.

But let's see. Let me think about this.

We can express each digit in terms of k:

a ≡6k +1 mod7,

b≡4k +1 mod7,

c≡5k +1 mod7,

d≡k +1 mod7.

Each digit is in 0-9 (with a ≥1). So, for each k, we can compute a, b, c, d modulo7 and then find possible digits that satisfy these congruences.

Our aim is to find a, b, c, d such that when any digit is changed to1, the resulting number is divisible by7.

So, for a given k, we can find the possible digits.

But since we're looking for the maximum N, we can perhaps try k=0,1,...6 and see which gives the largest possible N.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since N is the largest possible four-digit number, let's try to take N as large as possible, starting from 9999 and going down, checking for the condition.

But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable if we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, given that the digits are related through k, perhaps we can find expressions for the digits and then find the maximum N.

Let me proceed with the equations.

So, for each digit:

a ≡6k +1 mod7,

b≡4k +1 mod7,

c≡5k +1 mod7,

d≡k +1 mod7.

Each digit must be between 0 and9 (a between1 and9).

So, for each k (0 to6), let's compute possible a, b, c, d.

Let me create a table for each k:

k | a mod7 | a possible values (1-9) | b mod7 | b possible (0-9) | c mod7 | c possible (0-9) | d mod7 | d possible (0-9)

Let's compute for each k:

k=0:

a ≡6*0 +1=1 mod7
