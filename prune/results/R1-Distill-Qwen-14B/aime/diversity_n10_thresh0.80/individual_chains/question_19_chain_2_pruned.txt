Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. We need to find AB · AC.

Hmm, right. Let's see. I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a b c)/(4 Δ), where Δ is the area. The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter by r = Δ/s, where s is (a+b+c)/2.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6. So, we have R = 13, r = 6.

Also, the condition given is IA perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I.

I think I should recall some properties or formulas involving the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumradius. Wait, I remember that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that.

Yes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that OI² = R(R - 2r). So, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, that's a good start. So, OI is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, we have IA perpendicular to OI. That makes triangle IOA a right-angled triangle at I.

So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So, by Pythagoras' theorem, OA² = IO² + IA². Since OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA².

Calculating that: 169 = 13 + IA². So, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Wait, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I think the formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex might be a bit tricky. Let me recall. I know that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and inradius.

Wait, maybe it's better to express IA in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me think. The inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter, but how does that relate to the distances from the incenter to the vertices?

I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by the formula:

IA = (r)/sin(A/2)

Let me verify that. Yes, in triangle geometry, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed IA = r / sin(A/2).

So, if IA = 2*sqrt(39), and we know r = 6, then:

2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 * 3? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 6 divided by (2*sqrt(39)) is (6)/(2√39) = 3/√39. Let me rationalize that: 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13.

So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Hmm, that's a useful piece of information. So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Let me compute cos(A/2
