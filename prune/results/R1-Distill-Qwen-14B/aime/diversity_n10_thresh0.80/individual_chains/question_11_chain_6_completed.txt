Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, we can write it in the form z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. But since |z| = 4, that means sqrt(a² + b²) = 4, so a² + b² = 16. That's a constraint I'll have to keep in mind.

But dealing with a and b might get messy, especially with the division involved. Maybe there's a better way. Oh, right! I remember that for complex numbers, if |z| = r, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by r². So, since |z| = 4, 1/z is equal to \overline{z}/(4²) = \overline{z}/16. That's helpful because it might let me rewrite the expression without a division.

So let's rewrite the given expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Using the fact that 1/z = \overline{z}/16, this becomes:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)(\overline{z}/16)

Simplify the second term:

(96 + 144i)/16 * \overline{z} = (6 + 9i) * \overline{z}

So the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z}

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, let's think about z and its conjugate. Remember that if z = a + bi, then \overline{z} = a - bi. So maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of a and b.

Let me denote z = a + bi, so \overline{z} = a - bi. Then the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (6 + 9i)(a - bi)

Let me compute each part separately.

First, expand (75 + 117i)(a + bi):

= 75a + 75bi + 117i a + 117i * bi
= 75a + 75bi + 117a i + 117b i²

But wait, i² is -1, so that term becomes -117b.

So combining like terms:

Real parts: 75a - 117b
Imaginary parts: 75b i + 117a i = (75b + 117a)i

So the first part is (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i.

Now, the second part: (6 + 9i)(a - bi):

= 6a - 6bi + 9i a -9i * bi
= 6a -6bi +9a i -9b i²

Again, i² is -1, so the last term becomes +9b.

So combining like terms:

Real parts: 6a + 9b
Imaginary parts: (-6b +9a)i

So the second part is (6a + 9b) + (-6b +9a)i.

Now, add both parts together:

Real parts: (75a - 117b) + (6a + 9b) = (75a + 6a) + (-117b +9b) = 81a - 108b

Imaginary parts: (75b + 117a) i + (-6b +9a)i = [75b + 117a -6b +9a] i = (117a +69b)i

So the entire expression simplifies to (81a -108b) + (117a +69b)i.

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So we're interested in maximizing the real part, which is 81a -108b, given that a² + b² = 16.

Hmm, okay, so we have to maximize 81a -108b subject to a² + b² = 16.

This is a constrained optimization problem. I remember that to maximize a linear expression under a spherical constraint, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or realize that the maximum occurs when the vector (a, b) is in the same direction as the gradient of the function we're maximizing.

Wait, the function to maximize is f(a, b) = 81a -108b. The gradient is (81, -108). The constraint is g(a, b) = a² + b² -16 =0. The maximum occurs where the gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g, so (81, -108) = λ(2a, 2b). So 81 = 2λa and -108 = 2λb.

So from these, 81 = 2λa and -108 = 2λb. Let me solve for a and b.

From the first equation: λ = 81/(2a)

From the second equation: λ = -108/(2b) = -54/b

So set them equal: 81/(2a) = -54/b

Cross multiply: 81b = -54*2a => 81b = -108a

Divide both sides by 27: 3b = -4a => b = (-4/3)a

So b is (-4/3)a.

Now, plug this into the constraint a² + b² = 16.

So a² + ( (-4/3 a) )² =16

Compute ( (-4/3 a) )²= (16/9)a²

So a² + (16/9)a² =16

Combine terms: (1 +16/9)a²=16 => (25/9)a²=16 => a² = (16)*(9/25) = (144)/25

So a = sqrt(144/25) = 12/5 or -12/5.

Therefore, a = 12/5 or -12/5.

But since we are looking to maximize f(a, b)=81a -108b, and b is (-4/3)a, let's see.

Case 1: a =12/5

Then b= (-4/3)*(12/5)= (-48)/15= -16/5

So f(a,b)=81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (2700)/5=540.

Case 2: a= -12/5

Then b= (-4/3)*(-12/5)=48/15=16/5

So f(a,b)=81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540.

Since we want the maximum, the first case gives 540, which is the maximum.

Wait, but is that the maximum? Let me think again. Because a² + b² =16, and we found the critical point at a=12/5, b=-16/5.

But let me verify if this is indeed a maximum.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

We can think of f(a, b) =81a -108b as the dot product of vectors (81, -108) and (a, b). The maximum value of this dot product, given that a² + b²=16, is the magnitude of (81, -108) times the magnitude of (a, b), which is sqrt(81² + (-108)^2) * sqrt(a² + b²).

So compute sqrt(81² + 108²) = sqrt(6561 + 11664) = sqrt(18225) = 135.

And since |z|=4, the magnitude sqrt(a² + b²)=4.

So the maximum value of the dot product is 135*4=540, which matches our previous result. That's reassuring.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression was (75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z. When I substituted z = a + bi, I carried out the expansion correctly, right?

Wait, let me double-check the expansion:

First term: (75 + 117i)(a + bi) =75a +75bi +117a i +117b i² =75a +75bi +117a i -117b.

So real part is 75a -117b, imaginary part is (75b +117a)i.

Second term: (6 +9i)(a -bi) =6a -6bi +9a i -9b i² =6a -6bi +9a i +9b.

Real part is 6a +9b, imaginary part is (-6b +9a)i.

Adding the real parts:75a -117b +6a +9b = 81a -108b.

Imaginary parts: (75b +117a) + (-6b +9a) = (75b -6b) + (117a +9a) =69b +126a. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.

Wait, in the original computation, when I added the imaginary parts:

First part imaginary: (75b +117a)i

Second part imaginary: (-6b +9a)i

So adding the coefficients:75b +117a -6b +9a = (75b -6b) + (117a +9a) =69b +126a.

Wait, earlier I had 117a +69b, which is different. So that was an error.

Wait, so in the initial calculation, I had:

Real parts:81a -108b

Imaginary parts:117a +69b.

But actually, it's 69b +126a.

Wait, so the real part is correct?

Wait, 75a -117b +6a +9b = (75a +6a) + (-117b +9b)=81a -108b. That's correct.

Imaginary parts:

75b +117a from the first term,

-6b +9a from the second term.

So total imaginary coefficient: (75b -6b) + (117a +9a)=69b +126a.

So the entire expression is (81a -108b) + (126a +69b)i.

So when I was maximizing 81a -108b, I think I was correct because the imaginary part is separate, but wait, no. Wait, no, the problem is just to find the maximum real part of the entire expression, regardless of the imaginary part. So to maximize Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 +144i)/z], which is 81a -108b, regardless of the imaginary part. So that part is okay.

But in my initial steps, when I set up the optimization, I used the correct expression for the real part, which is 81a -108b. So perhaps my earlier steps were correct.

Wait, but when I thought of the dot product, I considered the function f(a, b)=81a -108b, which is correct. So the maximum is indeed 135*4=540.

So, in that case, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if the point a=12/5, b=-16/5 indeed gives a real part of 540.

Compute 81a -108b:

81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5=2700/5=540. Yep, that's correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again about how I represented z. Because z is a complex number with |z|=4, which I represented as z = a + bi with a² + b²=16.

But in the expression, I used z and 1/z, which I represented in terms of a and b. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent z in polar form.

Let me try that approach.

Let me write z =4 e^{iθ}, since |z|=4. Then 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So, let's substitute into the expression:

(75 +117i) z + (96 +144i)/z = (75 +117i) *4 e^{iθ} + (96 +144i)*(1/4) e^{-iθ}

Simplify each term:

First term: 4*(75 +117i) e^{iθ} = [4*75 + 4*117i] e^{iθ} = [300 + 468i] e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 +144i)/4 e^{-iθ} = [24 +36i] e^{-iθ}

So, the entire expression is:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}

Let me express each complex number in terms of magnitude and angle.

First, find the polar form of 300 + 468i.

Compute magnitude: sqrt(300² +468²).

300²=90000, 468²=468*468. Let's compute that:

468*400=187200, 468*68=31704. So 187200 +31704=218904.

So sqrt(90000 +218904)=sqrt(308904).

Let me see if this is a perfect square. 556²= 556*556. 500²=250000, 56²=3136, 2*500*56=56000. So (500+56)^2=500² + 2*500*56 +56²=250000 +56000 +3136=309136. Hmm, which is larger than 308904. So 556²=309136, 555²= (556-1)^2=556² -2*556 +1=309136 -1112 +1=308025.

So sqrt(308904) is between 555 and 556.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to leave it as is for now. Alternatively, maybe we can factor it.

Wait, 300 = 12*25, 468=12*39. So 300 +468i=12*(25 +39i). So the magnitude is 12*sqrt(25² +39²)=12*sqrt(625 +1521)=12*sqrt(2146). Hmm, 2146 is not a perfect square, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, let me compute the angle.

Let me denote A =300 +468i, and B=24 +36i.

So the expression becomes A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

We can write this as A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ} = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute this expression in terms of cosθ and sinθ.

Express A and B in polar form.

A = |A| e^{iφ}, B = |B| e^{iψ}.

Then A e^{iθ} = |A| e^{i(θ + φ)}, and B e^{-iθ}= |B| e^{i(-θ + ψ)}.

So the sum is |A| e^{i(θ + φ)} + |B| e^{i(-θ + ψ)}.

But this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use Euler's formula:

A e^{iθ} = |A| (cos(θ + φ) + i sin(θ + φ)),

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} = |B| (cos(-θ + ψ) + i sin(-θ + ψ)).

But adding these together, we can write the real part as |A| cos(θ + φ) + |B| cos(-θ + ψ).

We need to find the maximum real part, which is |A| cos(θ + φ) + |B| cos(-θ + ψ).

Alternatively, maybe we can write the entire expression as:

Real part: Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}) = |A| cos(θ + φ) + |B| cos(-θ + ψ).

Now, to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ.

But this might get complicated, so perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, let me consider that the entire expression is a sum of two complex exponentials, and perhaps I can combine them into a single sinusoid.

Let me think about that. Let me denote E(θ) = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Let me write E(θ) in terms of cosine and sine:

E(θ) = A (cosθ + i sinθ) + B (cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)).

But cos(-θ)=cosθ, sin(-θ)=-sinθ.

So E(θ) = (A + B) cosθ + i(A - B) sinθ.

But we are only interested in the real part, which is Re(E(θ)) = (Re(A) + Re(B)) cosθ - (Im(A) - Im(B)) sinθ.

Wait, wait, let's compute it step by step.

Re(A) is 300, Im(A) is 468.

Re(B) is 24, Im(B) is 36.

So Re(E(θ)) = (300 +24) cosθ + (468 -36) sinθ.

Wait, because:

Wait, E(θ) = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

So Re(E(θ)) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ.

Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B) cos(-θ) - Im(B) sin(-θ).

But cos(-θ)=cosθ, sin(-θ)=-sinθ.

So Re(B e^{-iθ})= Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

Therefore, Re(E(θ)) = [Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ].

Combine terms:

cosθ (Re(A) + Re(B)) + sinθ ( -Im(A) + Im(B) )

Which is:

cosθ (300 +24) + sinθ ( -468 +36 )

= 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So Re(E(θ)) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So now, we need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

This is a standard problem of finding the maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine.

The maximum value is the amplitude, which is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Compute that:

324²=104,976

432²=186,624

Sum:104,976 +186,624=291,600

sqrt(291,600)=540.

So the maximum real part is 540, which matches our earlier result.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Express \(z\) in polar form**: Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

2. **Substitute into the expression**:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i)\frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}.
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   4(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i, \quad \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.
   \]
   Thus, the expression becomes:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
   \]

3. **Expand using Euler's formula**:
   \[
   (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta).
   \]
   Separate real and imaginary parts:
   \[
   \text{Real part} = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
   \]

4. **Find the maximum of the real part**: The maximum value of \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) is the amplitude, given by:
   \[
   \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540.
   \]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
