Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem defines points O, A, and B. O is at the origin (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, I can imagine a coordinate plane with O at the origin, A somewhere on the x-axis, and B somewhere on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points.

Next, there's this family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from some point P(p, 0) to some point Q(0, q), where p and q are positive real numbers because we're in the first quadrant.

Since each PQ has unit length, the distance between P and Q should be 1. Using the distance formula, the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is sqrt(p² + q²). So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which implies that p² + q² = 1.

So, all these segments PQ lie on the line connecting (p, 0) and (0, q) where p² + q² = 1. That makes sense.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB.

The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment of unit length, hence it's part of the family F.

So, AB is in F, and the point C is on AB, not on any other segment in F. So, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), the point C doesn't lie on PQ.

Our goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, how do we find point C? It must be the point on AB where, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, it's the point on AB that is only on AB among all possible PQ segments of unit length.

I think this has to do with the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to each member of a family of curves (or lines, in this case). So, the envelope of all these segments PQ would form a curve, and point C might lie on this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps point C is where the lines PQ are tangent to some curve, and C is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB.

Wait, maybe I should think about the equations of these segments PQ.

Each PQ segment connects (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as x/p + y/q = 1. Because it's intercept form of the line equation.

Since p² + q² = 1, we can represent this condition. So, for each such line, we have x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.

So, the family of lines is x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.

I need to find the envelope of this family of lines. Because the envelope would be the set of points where each point on the envelope is on at least one line from the family, and the envelope is tangent to each line.

Wait, but in our case, the point C is on AB and is not on any other segment PQ except AB itself. So, perhaps the envelope is such that it touches each line PQ at exactly one point, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, maybe the envelope is a curve that AB is tangent to, and C is the point of tangency.

So, perhaps I should find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1.

To find the envelope, I can use the
