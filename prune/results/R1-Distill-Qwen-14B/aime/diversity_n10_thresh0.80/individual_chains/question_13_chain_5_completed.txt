Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the problem is about Aya going for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stopping at a coffee shop. The key here is figuring out how long her walk takes when she walks at different speeds, including the time she spends in the coffee shop.

First, let me parse the problem. Aya walks 9 kilometers at a constant speed of 's' km/h, and this takes her 4 hours in total. This total time includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks faster, specifically at (s + 2) km/h, her walking time decreases, making the total time 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is, if she walks at (s + 1/2) km/h, how many minutes will her entire walk take, including the coffee shop time?

Hmm, so the main variables here are her walking speed 's' and the time 't' she spends in the coffee shop. I think I can set up equations based on the information provided.

Let me think about the first scenario: walking at speed 's' km/h. The time taken for the walk is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. But wait, time is in hours, and 't' is in minutes. I should probably convert them to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let's convert 't' from minutes to hours. So, 't' minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the total time is 4 hours, which equals the walking time plus the coffee shop time. The walking time when speed is 's' is distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. So, the equation becomes:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, for the second scenario, she walks at (s + 2) km/h. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours. Again, this total time is walking time plus coffee shop time.

The walking time here is 9/(s+2) hours. So, the equation is:

9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now, I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

My goal is to find 's' and 't'. Once I have those, I can calculate the time when her speed is (s + 1/2) km/h.

Let me write down the equations again:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

To solve these, I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate 't'. Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

= (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) 
= 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 9 * [2/(s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which simplifies to:

18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Hmm, so 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me write that as:

1.6 s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6 to make it easier:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Let me compute 18 divided by 1.6.

1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expanding this:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of s. Let's solve for s using the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D) = 7

Thus, s = [-2 ±7]/(2*1) = (5/2) or (-9/2)

Since speed can't be negative, s = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe Aya walks slowly. So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1.

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Substitute s = 2.5:

9/(2.5) + t/60 = 4

Compute 9 / 2.5: 9 divided by 2.5 is 3.6

So, 3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes

So, Aya spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the problem asks: if she walks at (s + 1/2) km/h, how many minutes will her walk take, including the coffee shop time.

First, compute s + 1/2.

s = 2.5, so 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.

So, she walks at 3 km/h.

The walking time is distance divided by speed: 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Then, add the coffee shop time of 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check the math. 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is indeed 204 minutes.

Alternatively, I can compute the total time in hours and then convert to minutes.

Walking time: 3 hours, coffee shop: 24 minutes = 0.4 hours.

Total time: 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours.

Convert to minutes: 3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes.

So, the total time is 204 minutes.

Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Found two equations based on the given times and speeds.
2. Subtracted the equations to eliminate 't' and solve for 's'.
3. Solved the quadratic equation to find s = 2.5 km/h.
4. Used equation 1 to find 't' which turned out to be 24 minutes.
5. Calculated the time when walking at 3 km/h, added coffee shop time, getting 204 minutes.

Everything seems to add up. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the answer should be 204 minutes.


Aya's walking speed is determined by setting up two equations based on her total time for different speeds, including the coffee shop time. Solving these equations yields her speed \( s = 2.5 \) km/h and coffee shop time \( t = 24 \) minutes. When she walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is 3 hours, and including the coffee shop time, the total time is 204 minutes.

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
