Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Finally, I have to put the answer in a box.

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Let me break this down. Maybe I should start by understanding which primes p satisfy that p² divides some n⁴ +1. Then, among those primes, pick the smallest one, and then find the minimal m for that prime.

I remember that for primes p, if p divides n² +1, then p is congruent to 1 mod 4, because primes dividing a sum of two squares must be 2 or 1 mod 4. But here, it's n⁴ +1. So, n⁴ +1 can be thought of as (n²)^2 +1. So, primes dividing this would have to be 2 or 1 mod 4 as well.

Wait, but we're looking for primes where p² divides n⁴ +1. So, not just p divides n⁴ +1, but p² does. That seems more restrictive. So, the smallest such prime p is likely not 2 because 2 is even, and n⁴ is even if n is even or odd? Wait, n⁴ is always non-negative, and 2² =4. Let's see: Let's test p=2 first.

If p=2, then p²=4. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for different n.

n can be 0,1,2,3 mod4.

n=0 mod4: n⁴=0 mod4, so n⁴ +1=1 mod4. Not divisible by4.

n=1 mod4: n⁴=1 mod4, n⁴ +1=2 mod4. Not divisible by4.

n=2 mod4: n⁴= (16) mod4=0, so +1=1 mod4. Not divisible.

n=3 mod4: n⁴=81 mod4=1, so +1=2 mod4. Not divisible.

Hmm, so for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 cannot be the prime we're looking for.

Next, let's check p=5. Wait, why 5? Because 5 is the next prime after 2, and 5 is 1 mod4, which is a candidate.

Wait, let me think
