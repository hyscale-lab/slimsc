Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300, and another equation involving their squares and products. Hmm, let me write down the problem again to make sure I have it right.

We have:
1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I need to find how many such triples (a, b, c) exist. Alright, let's start by analyzing the second equation. It looks complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a way to simplify it.

Looking at the equation:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Hmm, grouping terms might help. Let me group terms with similar variables:

= a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of the total sum.

Indeed:
b + c = 300 - a
a + c = 300 - b
a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the equation:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the equation becomes:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rewrite that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find a relationship between these terms.

I also know that a + b + c = 300, which might be helpful. Let me recall some identities that relate sums of variables to sums of their squares and cubes.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So maybe if I let S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ac, and S3 = abc, then I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S1 and S2.

Yes, a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2 = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

Similarly, for the cubes, I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, and S3. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3.

So substituting S1 = 300, we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.

Calculating 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3.

Now, going back to the equation we had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions from above:

300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2S2):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.
300*(-2S2) = -600S2.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 27,000,000 - 600S2.

Now subtract (27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3):

So,

[27,000,000 - 600S2] - [27,000,000 - 900S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600S2 -27,000,000 + 900S2 -3S3 = 6,000,000.

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 -27,000,000 = 0.

-600S2 + 900S2 = 300S2.

So, 300S2 -3S3 = 6,000,000.

Now, let me write that equation:

300S2 -3S3 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So,

S3 = 100S2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm. So we have expressions for S1, S2, S3. Remember that for three variables a, b, c, the elementary symmetric sums are S1, S2, S3, so the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, maybe we can find possible values of S2 and S3 such that a, b, c are integers.

But perhaps it's better to work with the equation S3 = 100S2 -2,000,000.

We know that S1 = 300, S2 is ab + bc + ac, and S3 = abc.

So, S3 = 100S2 -2,000,000.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm. Let me rearrange:

abc - 100ab -100bc -100ac = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe factor this:

Take abc - 100ab -100bc -100ac = -2,000,000.

We can factor each term:

ab(c - 100) -100c(a + b) = -2,000,000.

But since a + b = 300 - c, because a + b + c = 300.

So substituting a + b = 300 - c into the equation:

ab(c - 100) -100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

So,

ab(c - 100) -100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm. Let me write that as:

ab(c - 100) = 100c(300 - c) -2,000,000.

So,

ab = [100c(300 - c) -2,000,000] / (c - 100).

Let me compute the numerator:

100c(300 - c) = 100*(300c - c²) = 30,000c - 100c².

So numerator is (30,000c - 100c²) - 2,000,000 = -100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000.

So,

ab = (-100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000) / (c - 100).

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

First, denominator is c - 100.

Let me try to factor the numerator:

-100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000.

Factor out -100:

-100(c² - 300c + 20,000).

So,

ab = -100(c² - 300c + 20,000) / (c - 100).

Hmm. Let's perform polynomial division on the numerator c² - 300c + 20,000 divided by (c - 100).

Dividing c² -300c + 20,000 by c - 100.

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300   20000
          100   -20000
      1   -200      0

So, the division yields (c - 100)(c - 200). Therefore,

c² -300c + 20,000 = (c - 100)(c - 200).

So, substituting back:

ab = -100*(c - 100)(c - 200)/(c - 100).

We can cancel (c - 100) from numerator and denominator, provided c ≠ 100. Wait, but if c = 100, then denominator is zero, so earlier step would not hold. So, we'd have to consider c = 100 as a special case.

But assuming c ≠ 100, then:

ab = -100*(c - 200).

So,

ab = -100c + 20,000.

But ab is the product of two nonnegative integers a and b. So ab must be nonnegative.

So,

-100c + 20,000 ≥ 0.

Solving for c:

-100c + 20,000 ≥ 0
-100c ≥ -20,000
Multiply both sides by (-1), flipping inequality:

100c ≤ 20,000
c ≤ 200.

So c must be ≤ 200 for ab to be nonnegative.

But a + b + c = 300, so a + b = 300 - c.

Since a and b are nonnegative integers, so 300 - c must be ≥ 0, so c ≤ 300.

So from above, in the case where c ≠ 100, we have c ≤ 200.

But c can be 100, which would make denominator zero, so let me check that case.

Case 1: c ≠ 100.

Then, ab = -100c + 20,000.

Since a + b = 300 - c, and ab is known in terms of c, perhaps we can set up a quadratic equation.

Let me denote a + b = s = 300 - c, and ab = p = -100c + 20,000.

So the quadratic equation for a and b is x² - s x + p = 0.

Which becomes x² - (300 - c)x + (-100c + 20,000) = 0.

For a and b to be integers, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square.

Discriminant D = [300 - c]^2 - 4*(-100c + 20,000).

Compute D:

= (300 - c)^2 + 400c - 80,000.

Expand (300 - c)^2:

= 90,000 - 600c + c².

So,

D = 90,000 - 600c + c² + 400c - 80,000
= (90,000 - 80,000) + (-600c + 400c) + c²
= 10,000 - 200c + c².

So D = c² - 200c + 10,000.

We need D to be a perfect square. Let me denote D = k², where k is a nonnegative integer.

So,

c² - 200c + 10,000 = k².

Let me rearrange:

c² - 200c + 10,000 - k² = 0.

Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in c, but maybe I can complete the square.

c² - 200c = (c - 100)^2 - 10,000.

So,

(c - 100)^2 - 10,000 + 10,000 - k² = 0
(c - 100)^2 - k² = 0.

So,

(c - 100)^2 = k².

Taking square roots,

c - 100 = ±k.

So,

c = 100 ± k.

But since c is an integer between 0 and 300, inclusive, and k is nonnegative.

But from earlier, in Case 1, c ≠ 100, so k cannot be zero, because c = 100 ± 0 would lead to c = 100, which would be the case we're excluding here.

Wait, but when c = 100, we would have the denominator zero earlier, so perhaps that case needs separate consideration.

Wait, but from the discriminant equation, when c = 100, what happens?

Let me check:

When c = 100, ab = -100*100 + 20,000 = -10,000 + 20,000 = 10,000.

And a + b = 300 - 100 = 200.

So, a + b = 200, ab = 10,000.

So, the quadratic becomes x² - 200x + 10,000 = 0.

Discriminant D = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.

So, the equation has a repeated root x = 100.

So, a = b = 100.

So, the triple would be (100, 100, 100). Wait, but c is 100 in this case, so all three variables are 100.

Wait, but then a + b + c = 300, which is correct.

But let me check the second condition:

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100²*100 = 1,000,000, and there are 6 terms, so 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. So it satisfies.

So, the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But back to the discriminant equation. So, we have for c ≠ 100, D must be a perfect square, leading to c = 100 ± k, where k is a positive integer.

So, c can be 100 + k or 100 - k.

But c must be between 0 and 300.

So, 100 + k ≤ 300 → k ≤ 200.

And 100 - k ≥ 0 → k ≤ 100.

So, for c = 100 + k, k can be from 1 to 200 (but since c must be ≤ 300, but 100 + 200 = 300, which is acceptable). For c = 100 - k, k can be from 1 to 100.

But wait, let's see. For each k, c can be 100 + k or 100 - k.

But let's think about how this affects a and b.

Since a + b = 300 - c, and ab = -100c + 20,000.

From c = 100 + k:

Then a + b = 300 - (100 + k) = 200 - k.

And ab = -100*(100 + k) + 20,000 = -10,000 - 100k + 20,000 = 10,0
