Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. But how does that help me find rectangles?

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. Since a rectangle requires four right angles, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned in such a way that the angles are 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the central angles between vertices can be multiples of 30 degrees because 360 degrees divided by 12 is 30. So, maybe the key is to find pairs of vertices that are spaced in such a way that the sides form right angles.

Wait, let me think about the diagonals. In a regular polygon, the diagonals can be classified by how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, the possible diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 vertices. But skipping 6 vertices would be the same as going the other way, right? So maybe we have diagonals of different lengths.

But how does this relate to rectangles? Well, in a regular dodecagon, if I can find two pairs of parallel sides that are perpendicular to each other, they can form a rectangle. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are either sides of the dodecagon or certain diagonals.

Let me try to visualize a regular dodecagon. If I label the vertices from 0 to 11 in a clockwise direction, then each vertex is 30 degrees apart from the next. So, for example, vertex 0 is connected to vertex 1, which is 30 degrees around the circle, and so on.

To form a rectangle, I need four points such that the lines connecting them form right angles. So, if I pick two points that are separated by a certain number of steps, their connecting line would be a side or a diagonal. Then, to form a rectangle, I need another pair of points that are similarly separated and perpendicular.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. Each vertex can be represented as a point on a unit circle, with coordinates based on their angles. So, vertex k would have coordinates (cos(30k°), sin(30k°)). The vectors between these points can then be used to determine if they're perpendicular.

But perhaps there's a simpler combinatorial approach. Since a rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides, maybe I can find all possible pairs of sides (or diagonals) that are parallel and then see which pairs are perpendicular.

In a regular dodecagon, there are multiple sets of parallel sides and diagonals. For example, the sides themselves are all parallel in groups of three because 12 divided by 3 is 4. Wait, no, actually, in a regular dodecagon, each side is separated by 30 degrees, so sides that are separated by 6 steps (i.e., 180 degrees apart) are parallel. So, each side has another side directly opposite to it that's parallel.

Similarly, diagonals can be parallel. For example, a diagonal that skips one vertex (let's call this a 'short diagonal') would be parallel to others that skip the same number of vertices. So, in a regular dodecagon, each diagonal that skips k vertices (where k ranges from 1 to 5) has a certain number of parallel diagonals.

So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to each other. Each pair will form opposite sides of the rectangle.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible pairs of such lines (sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular and then counting the number of rectangles formed by these pairs.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, identify all possible lines (sides and diagonals) in the dodecagon and group them by their direction. Each direction corresponds to a certain step k (number of vertices skipped). For example, k=1 corresponds to sides, k=2 corresponds to the first type of diagonal, and so on up to k=6. But since k=6 would be the diameter, connecting opposite vertices, and each diameter is unique because there are 12 vertices, so each diameter connects two vertices, and there are 6 such diameters.

Wait, but in our case, the problem says each side lies on either a side or a diagonal. So, the sides of the rectangle can be either edges (k=1) or diagon
