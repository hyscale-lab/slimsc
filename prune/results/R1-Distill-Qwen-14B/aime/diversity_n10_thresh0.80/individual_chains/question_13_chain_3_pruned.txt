Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

So, every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Then, they ask me to find the time it takes when she walks at a slightly increased speed, including that coffee shop time again. 

Let me break down the information:

First scenario:
- Walking speed: s km/h
- Total time taken: 4 hours
- This includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Second scenario:
- Walking speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time taken: 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours total. So that's 2 hours and 24 minutes.

So in both cases, the total time is the time spent walking plus the time spent in the coffee shop. 

I think the key here is that the distance is the same, 9 km, so the time she spends walking can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.

But in each case, the total time is the time walking plus t minutes. But in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, and in the second, it's 2 hours and 24 minutes. Wait, but t is in minutes in both cases, right? So I need to convert everything into the same units to make it easier.

Let me convert all times into hours or all into minutes. Maybe hours would be better because the speeds are given in km per hour.

So first scenario:
Time walking = 9 km / s km/h = 9/s hours.
Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours = time_walking + t/60 hours. Because t is in minutes, so I need to convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

So equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Second scenario:
Speed is s + 2 km/h. So time walking is 9/(s + 2) hours.
Total time including coffee shop is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can solve these two equations with two variables, s and t.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. 

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify: 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So 9(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's equal to (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2))) = 2/(s(s + 2))

So back to the equation:

9*(2/(s(s + 2))) = 1.6

Simplify: 18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Then, s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 / 1.6: 18 divided by 1.6. Let me calculate that. 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, so 18 - 17.6 is 0.4, so 11 + 0.4/1.6 = 11 + 0.25 = 11.25.

Wait, wait. Let me do it properly: 18 / 1.6.

18 divided by 1.6 is the same as (18 * 10) / (1.6 * 10) = 180 / 16 = 45/4 = 11.25.

So s(s + 2) = 11.25

So the equation is s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring all terms to one side: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solving for s using quadratic formula.

s = [-2 Â± sqrt(
