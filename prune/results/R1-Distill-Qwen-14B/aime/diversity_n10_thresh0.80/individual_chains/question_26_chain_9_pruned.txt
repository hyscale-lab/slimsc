Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. The triangle has sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects the circumcircle again at point P. I need to find AP as a reduced fraction and then sum the numerator and denominator.

Alright, let's start by drawing a diagram in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC. That might come in handy.

First, I should probably find some key elements of triangle ABC, like its circumradius or maybe some angles. Since the sides are 5,9,10, maybe I can compute the semi-perimeter and area using Heron's formula to get some useful information.

The semi-perimeter, s, is (5+9+10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12. Then the area using Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] which is sqrt[12(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504]. Let me compute 504: 504=16*31.5, wait, actually 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, so that's not right. Wait, 504= 7*72=7*9*8=7*9*8. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(7*9*8)=3*sqrt(56)=3*sqrt(4*14)=6*sqrt(14). So the area is 6*sqrt(14).

Alternatively, maybe using the formula that relates the sides of the triangle to the circumradius: R = (a b c)/(4 area). So R = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)). Let me compute that.

5*9*10=450. 4*6*sqrt(14)=24*sqrt(14). So R=450/(24*sqrt(14))= (450/24)/sqrt(14). Simplify 450/24: both divided by 6, 75/4. So R= (75/4)/sqrt(14). Maybe rationalize the denominator: (75/4)*sqrt(14)/14=75 sqrt(14)/(56). So R=75√14/56.

Hmm, maybe that's useful later.

Now, tangents from D to ω at B and C. So D lies on the external homothety axis? Or perhaps it's the exsimilicenter. Alternatively, since DB and DC are tangents, then D is the ex-pole with respect to BC, but I'm not too sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps using power of point D with respect to ω. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is DB^2 = DC^2. But also, the power of D is equal to DB^2 = DC^2 = DA * DP, since D lies on AD, which intersects ω at A and P. So DA * DP = DB^2. That seems important.

So if I can find DA, then I can relate DA and DP.

Wait, but I don't know DA yet. So perhaps I can find DA somehow.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates to the triangle to make it
