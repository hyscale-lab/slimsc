Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand this.

First, I know that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions, each path consists of a series of right and up moves. For an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a permutation of 8 rights and 8 ups.

But the problem adds a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times. That means the path can't just go all the way right then all the way up—that would be only one direction change. Wait, no, changing direction is when you switch from moving in one direction to the other. So each time you switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. 

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if a path changes direction four times, that means there are five runs in total. For example, right, up, right, up, right—this would be four direction changes and five runs.

Each run alternates between right and up moves. So, if there are five runs, starting with right, the sequence would be: right run, up run, right run, up run, right run. Similarly, if starting with up, it would be up run, right run, up run, right run, up run. So, depending on the starting direction, the number of runs of each type changes.

But wait, since the grid is square (8x8), the number of right steps and up steps must each be 8. So, the total number of right runs plus up runs must account for all 8 rights and 8 ups.

Wait, no. Actually, each run is a consecutive number of right or up steps. The sum of all right steps is 8, and the sum of all up steps is 8. So, for each case, starting with right or starting with up, the number of runs of each direction should be such that their total steps sum to 8.

Let me consider two cases: paths that start with a right move and paths that start with an up move. Because the grid is square, these cases should be symmetric, so maybe I can compute one and double it, but I'm not sure yet.

Let's first think about paths that start with a right move. Since they change direction four times, there are five runs. The sequence would be: right, up, right, up, right. So, three runs of right and two runs of up. Because starting with right, the runs alternate, and with five runs, right has one more run than up.

Similarly, if a path starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three runs of up and two runs of right.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just about changing direction four times, regardless of starting direction. So both cases (starting with right or up) must be considered, and then we can add them together.

But let
