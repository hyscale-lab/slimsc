Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. So, we have S = 54 and V = 23.

The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2.

Therefore, r² would be (d²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize d², which is l² + w² + h², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Hmm, so I need to minimize l² + w² + h² subject to 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

This sounds like a problem where I can use Lagrange multipliers or maybe the method of substitution to reduce the variables. Maybe using AM-QM inequality or something?

Wait, but since we have two constraints, maybe it's better to use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

Let me recall: with Lagrange multipliers, if I have a function to minimize f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h², subject to two constraints g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) - 54 = 0 and h(l, w, h) = lwh - 23 = 0.

I think I can set up the Lagrangian as:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) - 54) - μ(lwh - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Calculating the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ(2w + 2h) - μ(wh) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂w = 2w - λ(2l + 2h) - μ(lh) = 0

∂L/∂h = 2h - λ(2l + 2w) - μ(lw) = 0

And the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54

lwh = 23

Hmm, this gives me a system of equations. Let me write them down more clearly.

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0
2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0
3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0
4. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
5. lwh = 23

This looks complicated. Maybe we can find some symmetry here. If the box is a cube, then l = w = h. Let's see if that's possible.

If l = w = h, then surface area would be 6 l² = 54 → l² = 9 → l = 3. Then volume would be 27, but our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not possible here.

So, the box isn't a cube. Maybe the minimal sphere occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible? Or maybe when two variables are equal?

Let me assume that two variables are equal. Let's say l = w. Then, perhaps, the equations will simplify.

Let l = w. Then, let's denote l = w = x, and h = y.

So, our constraints become:

Surface area: 2(x² + 2xy) = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xy = 27

Volume: x² y = 23 ⇒ y = 23/(x²)

Let me substitute y into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + (46)/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 = 0

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 = 0

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → Yes! x=2 is a root.

So, I can factor (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23)=0

So, x=2 or x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x is positive (length), we have x=2 or x=-1 +2√6. Wait, x must be positive, so let's compute -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈ 3.898, which is positive. So, possible x=2 or x≈3.898.

But let's see which one works.

If x=2, then y =23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, box dimensions would be 2,2,5.75.

But then, let's compute the space diagonal squared: 2² +2² +5.75² =4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625

Alternatively, if x= -1 +2√6, then y=23/(x²). Let's compute x:

x= -1 +2√6 ≈-1 +4.898≈3.898

x²≈ (3.898)^2≈15.19, so y≈23/15.19≈1.514.

Then, space diagonal squared: x² +x² +y²≈15.19 +15.19 + (1.514)^2≈30.38 + 2.292≈32.672

Wait, that's much smaller. So, the space diagonal squared is 32.672 when we take x≈3.898. But wait, that seems contradictory because x is larger, but y is smaller, so maybe the sum is smaller.

But wait, my approximations might not be precise. Let me try to compute it exactly.

So, if x is a root of x³ -27x +46=0, and we have x=2, but the other roots are x=(-1 ± 2√6). So taking the positive root, x= -1 +2√6.

Then, l = w = x = -1 +2√6.

Then, h = y =23/(x²).

Compute x²: (-1 +2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, h=23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

h=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify numerator: 23*(25 +4√6) =575 +92√6.

Denominator:529=23².

So, h=(575 +92√6)/529= (575/529) + (92√6)/529= simplify:

575 ÷ 23=25, 529 ÷23=23. So, 575=25*23, 92=4*23, 529=23².

So, h= (25*23 +4*23√6)/23²= [23(25 +4√6)]/23²=(25 +4√6)/23.

Thus, h=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, now, computing l² + w² + h²:

Since l=w=x= -1 +2√6, which we already calculated x²=25 -4√6.

So, l² +w² +h²= 2*(25 -4√6) + [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]^2.

Compute that:

First, 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Now, compute [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529.

Wait, (25 +4√6)^2=25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 +200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, divided by 23²=529:

(721 +200√6)/529.

So, now, l² +w² +h²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 to over 529: 50=50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

Add them together:

(26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529 = (26450 +721) + (-4232√6 +200√6) all over 529.

Compute 26450 +721=27171.

Compute -4232√6 +200√6= (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6.

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus, l² +w² +h²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a computational error. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute the numerator step by step.

First, 50 -8√6 is equal to (50*529 -8√6 *529)/529.

Wait, but when I have 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529, it's better to express everything over 529.

So,

50 = 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

The other term is (721 +200√6)/529.

So, adding all together:

26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529

Combine the constants: 26450 +721= 27171.

Combine the √6 terms: (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6.

So, numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

Thus, l² +w² +h²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor numerator?

Let me see if 27171 and 4032 have any common factors.

27171: Let's see 27171 ÷3: 2+7+1+7+1=18, which is divisible by 3, so 27171 ÷3=9057.

Similarly, 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, numerator: 3*(9057 -1344√6)

Denominator:529=23².

But I don't think this helps much. Maybe it's better to just compute this as is.

But wait, perhaps I made an error earlier in the approach. Because when I assumed l=w, I might have gotten a local minimum, but maybe the actual minimum occurs when all three variables are different. So, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers without assuming l=w is the way to go, even though it's more complicated.

Let me try that.

We had the equations from the partial derivatives:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh = 0

2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh = 0

3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw = 0

Hmm. Let me see if I can relate these equations.

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

(2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh) - (2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh) =0

Which is 2(l -w) -2λ(w + h - l - h) - μ(wh - lh) =0

Simplify:

2(l -w) -2λ(w - l) - μ h (w - l) =0

Factor out (l - w):

[2 + 2λ + μ h ] (l - w) =0

So, either l = w, or 2 + 2λ + μ h =0.

Similarly, if we subtract equation 1 and equation 3:

(2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh) - (2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw) =0

Which is 2(l - h) -2λ(w + h - l - w) - μ wh - (-μ lw) =0

Simplify:

2(l - h) -2λ(h - l) - μ wh + μ lw =0

Factor (l - h):

[2 + 2λ + μ(w - h)] (l - h)=0

So, either l = h or 2 +2λ + μ(w - h)=0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 and equation3:

[2 + 2λ + μ(l - w)] (w - h)=0

So, either w =h, or 2 + 2λ + μ(l -w)=0.

So, from these, either all variables are equal, but we saw that a cube isn't possible here because volume would have to be 27, but it's 23.

Alternatively, if l ≠ w, then 2 +2λ + μ h=0, and similar conditions.

Wait, but if we have l ≠ w, then 2 +2λ + μ h=0.

But then, if l ≠ w, and also l ≠ h, and w ≠ h, then all those expressions have to be zero, which would require the coefficients to be zero.

Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe it's better to assume that two variables are equal, as before, and see if that gives the minimal value.

Earlier, when assuming l=w, I found x=2 and x=-1 +2√6, and in the second case, got a much smaller space diagonal squared.

Wait, but when x=2, the space diagonal squared is 41.0625, which is about 41.06, while in the other case, it's approximately 32.67.

But wait, 32.67 is smaller, so maybe that's the minimal value. So, perhaps the minimal sphere radius squared is (25 +4√6)/23 squared, but wait no, wait.

Wait, no, l² +w² +h² is the sum we're trying to minimize, which in the case where l=w= -1 +2√6, and h=(25 +4√
