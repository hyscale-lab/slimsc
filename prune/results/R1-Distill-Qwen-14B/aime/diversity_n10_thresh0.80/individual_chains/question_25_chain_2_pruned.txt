Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

There are 900 residents total. Each resident owns at least one thing, but I guess not necessarily all four. Wait, no, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts. Oh, so everyone has at least that. Oh, so candy hearts are universal. Interesting.

So, breaking down the numbers:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- All 900 own a bag of candy hearts.

Additionally, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things. And 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of people who own all four.

Hmm. So, this seems like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that for multiple sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle can help find the total number of elements, considering all possible overlaps.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in this problem, we know the total number of residents is 900, and everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So, the union of all four sets is 900.

But the problem gives us numbers for exactly two and exactly three, which complicates things a bit. Maybe it's better to approach this using the concept of the principle of inclusion-exclusion but considering the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and all four.

I think the formula for the total number of elements is also equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of the sizes of all possible two-set intersections plus the sum of all possible three-set intersections minus the four-set intersection. But I might be mixing something up.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula where the total number is the sum of each individual set minus twice the number of people with exactly two, minus three times those with exactly three, minus four times those with all four. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Wait, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of the counts of exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

I remember that the inclusion-exclusion formula can be expressed in terms of these exact counts. Let me try to recall that.

The total number of elements is equal to the sum of the sizes of all single sets (A, B, C, D) minus the sum of all pairwise intersections, plus the sum of all triple intersections, minus the four-way intersection. But how does that
