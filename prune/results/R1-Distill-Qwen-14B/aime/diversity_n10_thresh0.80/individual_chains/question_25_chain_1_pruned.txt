Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. There are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. That's interesting because it means everyone has at least one item. But wait, they can own other things too: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and the candy hearts.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And all 900 own candy hearts.

Additionally, it's stated that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four—so the ones who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Alright, this seems like a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that principle is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think.

The formula for four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in this problem, every resident owns at least the candy hearts. So the set of all residents is the same as the union of all these four sets because the candy hearts are universal. Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is equal to 900.

Hmm, so let me denote each set as follows:
- A: owns a diamond ring
- B: owns a golf club
- C: owns a garden spade
- D: owns candy hearts (which is everyone)

Wait, but since D is everyone, any intersection involving D is the same as the other set. Like, A ∩ D is just A, since everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns D (candy hearts). Similarly, any two-way intersection with D is just the other set. So perhaps that simplifies things.

But maybe instead of thinking in terms of D, I can reframe the problem. Since everyone owns D, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who own all four items, which is the same as those who own A, B, C, and D. But since D is universal, it's just the number of people who own A, B, and C.

Wait, no. Because D is already included in everyone. So actually, the number of people who own all four is just the number who own A, B, and C. Because they all have D as well. So perhaps I should focus on the overlaps between A, B, and C.

But wait, the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two things, and 23
