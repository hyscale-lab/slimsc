Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the problem again carefully.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down piece by piece.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not present in the list itself. Interesting.
- **Sum**: All the numbers add up to 30.

So, the list is composed of positive integers, which means each number is at least 1.

Let me think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, at least twice, right? Because if it only appeared once, it wouldn't be a mode. But since it's unique, it needs to appear more times than any other number.

So, let's denote the number of times 9 appears as k. Then, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the median is m, m is not in the list, but it's an integer.

Wait, but the median could be an integer without being in the list. For example, if the list has an even number of elements, the median could be the average of two numbers, which might not be an integer, but in this case, the median is a positive integer, so in the case of an even number of elements, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer, which implies that the two middle numbers are either both even or both odd.

But wait, the problem states that the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. So, in the case of an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is an integer. But in that case, the middle number must not be present in the list. Wait, but if the list is arranged in order, the middle number is part of the list, right? So, that can't happen. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's odd, the median is one of the numbers in the list, which contradicts the condition that it's not in the list. Therefore, the number of elements must be even.

So, the list has an even number of elements, say 2n. Then, the median is the average of the n-th and (n+1)-th elements. Since the median is an integer not
