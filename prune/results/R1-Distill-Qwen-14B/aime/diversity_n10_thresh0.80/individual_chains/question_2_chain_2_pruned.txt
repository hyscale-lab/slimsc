Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand the problem first.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis a bit higher, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with length 1. And all these PQ segments are in the first quadrant, meaning their coordinates are positive.

So, for example, if I take a point P at (x, 0) on the x-axis, then Q would have to be at (0, y) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. The distance formula tells us that sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 1, so x^2 + y^2 = 1. Therefore, for any such PQ in F, the coordinates (x, 0) and (0, y) must satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 1.

So all these PQ segments are essentially lines from the x-axis to the y-axis, each of length 1. So, for each x between 0 and 1, there's a corresponding y such that x^2 + y^2 =1, and the segment PQ connects (x,0) to (0,y).

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, which is the segment connecting A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So AB is one of these segments PQ, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), so the distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is a segment of length 1, so AB is in F.

So the family F includes all such unit length segments from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant, and among all these, AB is one of them.

But the problem says there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is a point on AB such that for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ.

We need to find OC^2, where O is the origin, and then express it as a fraction p/q, and find p + q.

Alright, so how do I approach this?

First, let me parametrize the segment AB.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the line AB can be parametrized as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So when t=0, we are at A (1/2, 0), and when t=1, we are at B (0, sqrt(3)/2).

So any point C on AB can be represented as (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Our goal is to find t such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, given a point C on AB, we need to ensure that there is no other PQ in F (i.e., another unit segment from x-axis to y-axis) that passes through C.

Alternatively, we can think of it as for the point C, the only line from the x-axis to y-axis of length 1 that passes through C is AB itself.

So, in other words, C lies on AB, and for any other points P' on x-axis and Q' on y-axis (different from P and Q of AB), the segment P'Q' does not pass through C.

We need to find the specific C where this is true.

Hmm, so perhaps another way to think about this is to consider the envelope of all the segments in F. The envelope would be the set of points that are on at least one segment of F. So the envelope would be a curve, and points inside the curve would not be on any segments except perhaps AB.

Wait, but in this case, AB is part of F, so it's one of the segments. So AB is a straight line from A to B, and the rest of the segments in F are other unit-length segments from x-axis to y-axis.

So the envelope of F is the set of all points that lie on at least one PQ in F. So if we can find the envelope, then the point C must lie on AB but not on the envelope of F except at AB.

Wait, but AB is part of the envelope, so maybe the envelope is a curve that AB is part of? Or perhaps AB is the only straight line segment in F.

Wait, no. All segments in F are straight lines, so the envelope would be the boundary of the region covered by all these segments.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that it's the only point on AB that's not in the interior of the envelope.

Wait, perhaps I should parametrise any segment PQ in F.

Let me think. Any segment PQ in F connects a point P = (x, 0) to Q = (0, y), where x^2 + y^2 =1.

So the equation of PQ can be written as (x-intercept form). The line through P(x, 0) and Q(0, y) is:

(y-intercept is y, x-intercept is x), so the equation is (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1.

So the equation is (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1, where x^2 + y^2 =1.

So for any x in (0,1), y = sqrt(1 - x^2), so the equation becomes (X/x) + (Y/sqrt(1 - x^2)) = 1.

So any point (X, Y) on such a segment satisfies this equation for some x in (0,1).

Now, the point C is on AB, so let's find the coordinates of C in terms of t as before: (1/2 - (1/2)t, (sqrt(3)/2)t). Let's denote this as (X, Y) = ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3) t)/2 ).

We need to ensure that this point (X, Y) does not lie on any other line PQ in F except AB.

So, substituting X and Y into the equation of PQ:

(X/x) + (Y/y) = 1.

Which is:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / x + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / y = 1.

But in F, for each PQ, we have x^2 + y^2 = 1.

So for another segment PQ (different from AB), this equation must not hold.

So, to find C, we need that for all x in (0,1) except x = 1/2, the equation

( (1 - t)/2 ) / x + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1

has no solution.

Alternatively, if we can find t such that this equation only holds when x = 1/2 (which corresponds to AB), then C is the point we're looking for.

So, our goal is to find t such that the equation:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / x + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - x^2) = 1

has exactly one solution x = 1/2.

Wait, but in reality, for each t, how many solutions x are there?

We might need to solve for x given t and see if the equation has only one solution (at x=1/2) or multiple.

But perhaps, it's more straightforward to consider the equation as a function of x and set it to 1, and find t such that the equation has only x=1/2 as a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of parametric equations.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that for a point C on AB, the lines PQ passing through C must satisfy the equation:

(X/x) + (Y/y) = 1, where X and Y are the coordinates of C, and x^2 + y^2 =1.

So, for a given C, we can write this as:

(X/x) + (Y/y) = 1,

with x^2 + y^2 =1.

We can solve for y in terms of x, substitute into the equation, and see if there are multiple solutions for x.

But since C is on AB, except for AB itself, we don't want any other PQ to pass through C.

So, perhaps, the system:

(X/x) + (Y/y) =1,

x^2 + y^2 =1,

has exactly one solution (x, y) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, we need to ensure that for C = (X, Y), the system only has the solution x =1/2, y= sqrt(3)/2.

So, let's substitute Y and X.

Let X = (1 - t)/2,

Y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.

So, substituting into (X/x) + (Y/y) =1,

we get:

[ (1 - t)/2 ] / x + [ (sqrt(3) t)/2 ] / y =1,

and x^2 + y^2 =1.

We can write this as:

( (1 - t)/ (2x) ) + ( sqrt(3) t / (2y) ) =1.

Let me denote this equation as:

(1 - t)/(2x) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2y) =1.

Multiply both sides by 2xy to eliminate denominators:

(1 - t) y + sqrt(3) t x = 2xy.

We can write this as:

(1 - t) y + sqrt(3) t x - 2xy =0.

Now, let's express y in terms of x from the constraint x^2 + y^2 =1.

So, y = sqrt(1 - x^2).

But wait, this introduces a square root, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can treat this as a quadratic equation.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(1 - t) y + sqrt(3) t x - 2 x y =0.

Grouping terms with y:

y [ (1 - t) - 2x ] + sqrt(3) t x =0.

So,

y [ (1 - t - 2x) ] + sqrt(3) t x =0.

But y is sqrt(1 - x^2), so substituting:

sqrt(1 - x^2) [ (1 - t - 2x) ] + sqrt(3) t x =0.

This looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Let me move one term to the other side:

sqrt(1 - x^2) (1 - t - 2x) = - sqrt(3) t x.

Squaring both sides:

(1 - x^2)(1 - t - 2x)^2 = 3 t^2 x^2.

Expanding the left-hand side:

(1 - x^2)( (1 - t)^2 - 4x(1 - t) + 4x^2 ).

So, expanding (1 - t - 2x)^2:

= (1 - t)^2 - 4x(1 - t
