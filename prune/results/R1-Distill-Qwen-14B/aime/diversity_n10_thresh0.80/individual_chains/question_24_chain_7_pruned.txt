Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have a list of positive integers with certain properties. The goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me go through this step by step.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. The list has the following properties:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same frequency as 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down piece by piece.

Starting with the mode: The unique mode is 9. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as k. So, k must be greater than the count of any other number in the list. Since it's the unique mode, no other number can have a count equal to or greater than k.

Next, the sum of all items is 30. So, if I have k 9s, their total contribution to the sum is 9 * k. The remaining sum must come from the other numbers in the list, which are not 9. Let me denote the sum of these other numbers as S, so S + 9k = 30.

The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. Wait, that's interesting. So the median is an integer, but it's not one of the numbers in the list. That suggests that the median is somewhere in the middle when the list is ordered, but it's not actually present as an element. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one, but in this case, it's not present. So perhaps the list has an even number of elements? Because when the number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the median has to be a positive integer and not in the list. So let's think about that.

Wait, for example, if the list has 2n elements, the median would be the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements. If that average is an integer and not present in the list, then the two middle numbers must add up to an even number (so their average is integer), and that average is not in the list.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which must be an integer not in the list. But that's impossible because the middle element is part of the list. So the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's odd, the median is an element, which contradicts the condition. So the list must have an even number of elements. Let me note that down.

So, the number of elements, let's denote it as m, must be even. So m is even. Let's
