Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set 𝒜. Each box in 𝒜 has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r² as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is determined by the space diagonal of the box. The sphere's diameter has to be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box, so the radius is half of that diagonal. So, my goal is to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all such boxes and then take half of that for the radius. But wait, actually, I think the sphere has to contain all such boxes, so the radius must be large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal. So, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the box given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. So, the volume is xyz = 23, and the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. Simplifying that, the surface area expression gives xy + yz + xz = 27.

The space diagonal of the box is √(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to find the maximum possible value of √(x² + y² + z²) given that xyz = 23 and xy + yz + xz = 27.

Wait, but isn't the space diagonal maximized when x, y, z are as varied as possible? Or is there an optimal point? Maybe I should express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I recall that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know xy + yz + xz = 27, that becomes x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54.

But I don't know x + y + z. Hmm, maybe I can relate it to the volume and surface area somehow.

Alternatively, I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints. Let's try that.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to two constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.
2. h(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0.

Since we have two constraints, we'll need to introduce two Lagrange multipliers, say λ and μ.

The Lagrangian function is:
L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xyz - 23) - μ(xy + yz + xz - 27).

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero.

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(yz) - μ(y + z) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(xz) - μ(x + z) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(xy) - μ(x + y) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(yz) + μ(y + z)
2. 2y = λ(xz) + μ(x + z)
3. 2z = λ(xy) + μ(x + y)
4. xyz = 23
5. xy + yz + xz = 27

This looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can subtract some equations to simplify.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

2y - 2x = λ(xz - yz) + μ(x + z - y - z)
Simplify: 2(y - x) = λ z (x - y) + μ (x - y)
Factor out (x - y): [2(y - x)] = (x - y)( - λ z - μ )

Divide both sides by (x - y) if x ≠ y. So:

-2 = -λ z - μ
Which gives: 2 = λ z + μ.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

2z - 2y = λ(xy - xz) + μ(x + y - x - z)
Simplify: 2(z - y) = λ x (y - z) + μ(y - z)
Factor out (y - z): [2(z - y)] = (y - z)( - λ x - μ )

Divide both sides by (y - z) if y ≠ z:

-2 = -λ x - μ
Which gives: 2 = λ x + μ.

So now we have:

From equation 1 - 2: 2 = λ z + μ
From equation 2 - 3: 2 = λ x + μ

So, λ z + μ = λ x + μ => λ z = λ x.

Assuming λ ≠ 0, then z = x.

Similarly, subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

2z - 2x = λ(xy - yz) + μ(x + y - y - z)
Simplify: 2(z - x) = λ y (x - z) + μ(x - z)
Factor out (x - z): [2(z - x)] = (x - z)( - λ y - μ )

Divide both sides by (x - z) => x ≠ z:

-2 = - λ y - μ => 2 = λ y + μ

So, now we have:

From above, z = x, and equations:

2 = λ z + μ (equation A)
2 = λ x + μ (equation B)
And 2 = λ y + μ (equation C)

So, from A and B, since z = x, they are the same equation. So, equations A and C give:

2 = λ x + μ
2 = λ y + μ

Subtracting these, 0 = λ (x - y). So, either λ = 0 or x = y.

If λ = 0, then from equation A: 2 = μ. Then from equation 1: 2x = 0 + 2(y + z). But z = x, so 2x = 2(y + x) => 2x = 2y + 2x => 0 = 2y => y = 0. But that can't be, since volume is 23, which would be zero. So, λ ≠ 0.

Therefore, x = y.

So, now we have x = y = z? Wait, no, we only have x = y, and z = x, so x = y = z. So, the box is a cube.

Wait, but if it's a cube, then all sides are equal. Let me check if that satisfies the given surface area and volume.

If x = y = z = a, then surface area is 6a² = 54 => a² = 9 => a = 3. Then volume is a³ = 27. But the volume given is 23, which isn't 27. So that's a problem. So, the box can't be a cube because the volume would be 27, which doesn't match the given 23.

Hmm, so maybe my earlier conclusion that x = y = z is incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, from the earlier equations, subtracting equations led to x = y and z = x, so x = y = z. But that leads to a cube which doesn't satisfy the volume. So, perhaps my approach is wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, but not all three. Let me consider symmetry.

Suppose two variables are equal, say x = y. Then, let's let x = y, so we have two variables x and z.

Then, the surface area is 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 => x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume is x * x * z = x² z = 23.

So, we have x² z = 23 and x² + 2xz = 27.

Let me denote x² as a and xz as b. Then, we have:

a z = 23 and a + 2b = 27.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, from x² z = 23, z = 23 / x².

Substitute into surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27 => x² + (46 / x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x => x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x - 2) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2).

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2.

Add to next coefficient: 0 + 2 = 2.

Multiply by 2: 4.

Add to next coefficient: -27 +4 = -23.

Multiply by 2: -46.

Add to last coefficient: 46 + (-46) =0. So, no remainder.

Thus, cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

So, the roots are x=2 and x² +2x -23=0.

Solving x² +2x -23=0: x = [-2 ±√(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ±√96]/2 = [-2 ±4√6]/2 = -1 ±2√6.

Since x is a length, positive, so x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

But x=2 is also a possible solution. Let's check if x=2 is a valid solution.

If x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

Then, surface area: x² + 2xz = 4 + 2*(2)*(5.75) =4 + 23=27. Correct.

So, x=2 is a valid solution, as is x=-1 +2√6.

So, now, for each x, we can compute the space diagonal squared, which is x² + x² + z²=2x² + z².

Wait, since x=y, so the space diagonal is √(x² + x² + z²)=√(2x² + z²). So, squared is 2x² + z².

Let me compute this for x=2:

z=5.75=23/4.

So, 2*(2)^2 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128/16) + (529/16)=657/16. So, 657/16.

For x= -1 +2√6, let's compute z=23/(x^2). x= -1 +2√6.

Compute x^2: (-1 +2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6). Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25+4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25+4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute 2x² + z².

We have x²=25 -4√6, so 2x²=50 -8√6.

z²=(25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2.

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2=625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, z²=(721 +200√6)/529.

Thus, 2x² + z²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 -8√6 to over 529 denominator:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, 2x² + z²= (26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6)/529

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4032√6)

So, 2x² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, let me compute the exact values:

26450 +721=27171.

-4232√6 +200√6= (-4232 +200)√6= (-4032)√6.

So, 27171 -4032√6.

So, 2x² + z²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Compare this to when x=2, which was 657/16 ≈41.0625.

Compute 27171/529 ≈51.31, and 4032√6≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈≈4032*2=8064, 4032*0.449≈≈1811. So, 8064+1811≈9875. So, 27171 -9875≈17296.

So, 17296/529≈17296 ÷529≈32.73.

Wait, that seems much less than 657/16≈41.06. So, 32.73 is less than 41.06, meaning that when x=2, the space diagonal squared is larger. So, the maximum seems to occur at x=2, y=2, z=23/4=5.75.

So, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius squared is (diagonal/2)^2= (sqrt(657/16))/2)^2= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Wait, wait a minute, let me correct that. The space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). The radius is half of that, so the radius squared is (sqrt(657/16)/2)^2= (sqrt(657)/4)^2=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). The radius is half of that, so r = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. So, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, in the case of x=2, y=2, z=5.75, x² + y² + z²=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 + 33.0625=41.0625=657/16. So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

But wait, 657 and 64: are they coprime? Let's see. 657 ÷3=219, 64 isn't divisible by 3. 657 ÷ 2=328.5, so no. 657 ÷3=219, which is 3×73. 64 is 2⁶. So, 657=3²×73. 64 is 2⁶. They share no common factors. So, 657/64 is reduced.

Wait, but earlier I thought another case with x=-1+2√6 might have a larger space diagonal, but when calculating, it turned out smaller. So, is 657/64 the maximum value? Are there other possibilities?

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, but the third is different, but perhaps another scenario where the box is not symmetric in two variables. Hmm, but since in the Lagrangian method, we arrived at x=y=z, which leads to a cube, but that cube doesn't satisfy the given volume. So, that suggests that the maximum occurs at x=y=2, z=23/4.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the maximum occurs when one of the variables is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible. Let's see.

Suppose, for example, that x approaches 0, then y and z would have to adjust to keep the volume 23. But if x approaches 0, then the surface area would be dominated by 2(yz + x(y+z)) ≈ 2yz. So, 2yz ≈54 => yz≈27. But volume is x*y*z≈0, which is not 23. So, that's not possible. So, x can't be too small.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z². With the constraints of fixed volume and surface area. So, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers differently or find another way.

Wait, another approach: express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

We have:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz).

We know that xy + yz + xz =27, so:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

We also know that xyz=23.

So, perhaps we can express x + y + z in terms of xyz and the other constraints. Hmm, but I don't see a direct way.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality or other inequalities.

Wait, I remember that for positive real numbers, the following inequality holds: x² + y² + z² ≥ ( (x + y + z)^2 )/3.

But not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the problem as optimizing x² + y² + z² given xyz=23 and xy + yz + xz=27.

Let me consider using the method of symmetric variables. Let me set u = x + y + z, v = xy + yz + xz=27, w=xyz=23.

We need to find x² + y² + z²= u² - 2v = u² -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize u², so we need to maximize u.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of u=x+y+z given that v=27 and w=23.

Is there a way to find the maximum of u given v and w?

I recall that for three variables with fixed v and w, the maximum u occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is determined. So, perhaps the maximum u is achieved when x=y, as in our earlier case.

Wait, so if x=y, then as we did earlier, u=2x + z, and with x² z=23, and x² + 2xz=27.

Earlier, we found that when x=2, z=23/4, so u=2*2 +23/4=4 +5.75=9.75=39/4.

Alternatively, when x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, then z=(25 +4√6)/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, u=2x +z≈2*3.898 +1.513≈7.796 +1.513≈9.309, which is less than 9.75.

So, the maximum u is 39/4, achieved when x=y=2, z=23/4.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²= u² -54= (39/4)^2 -54= (1521/16) -54= (1521 - 864)/16=657/16.

So, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²)=sqrt(657/16). The radius is half of that, so r= sqrt(657/16)/2= sqrt(657)/(4*sqrt(16))=sqrt(657)/8. Wait, no, sqrt(16)=4, so sqrt(657)/8 is r. So, r²=(657)/(64).

So, r²=657/64, which is 657 over 64.

Check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2^6, 657 divided by 3 is 219, which is 3×73. 73 is prime. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So, 657/64 is reduced.

Thus, p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case x= -1 +2√6, I found that x² + y² + z²≈32.73, which is less than 41.0625. So, it seems that 657/16 is the maximum.

So, yeah, the answer should be 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{721}


Given a set \(\mathcal{B}\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The value of \(r^2\) is expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to find \(p + q\).

First, we denote the dimensions of the box as \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The volume constraint is \(xyz = 23\) and the surface area constraint is \(2(xy + yz + xz) = 54\), which simplifies to \(xy + yz + xz = 27\).

The space diagonal of the box is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\). To find the radius of the smallest sphere, we need to maximize this space diagonal. The radius \(r\) is half of this diagonal, so we need to maximize \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\).

Using the identity \((x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz)\), we can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) as \((x + y + z)^2 - 54\). We need to maximize this expression.

By considering the constraints and using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we find that the maximum occurs when two dimensions are equal, say \(x = y\). This leads to solving the cubic equation \(x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0\), which gives a valid solution at \(x = 2\). Substituting \(x = 2\), we find \(z = \frac{23}{4}\).

Calculating the space diagonal squared, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(2^2) + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 8 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{128}{16} + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
\]

The radius \(r\) is half of the space diagonal, so:
\[
r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} = \frac{657}{64}
\]

Since 657 and 64 are coprime, we have \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\). Thus, \(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\).

\[
\boxed{721}
\]
