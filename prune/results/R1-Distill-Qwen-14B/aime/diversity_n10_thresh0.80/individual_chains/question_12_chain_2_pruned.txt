Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have a 2x3 grid, and I have to place digits in each cell. The condition is that when I read the grid left to right, forming two numbers, their sum should be 999. Also, when I read the grid top to bottom, forming three numbers, their sum should be 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the first row has three cells, and the second row has three cells. Let me denote the grid as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the numbers formed by reading left to right would be the top row as "abc" and the bottom row as "def". Their sum should be 999. 

Wait, no. Wait, the numbers formed by reading left to right. So, for a 2x3 grid, each row becomes a three-digit number. So, the top number is ABC and the bottom number is DEF, and ABC + DEF = 999. 

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, we have three numbers. Since it's two rows, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column would be AD, the second column BE, and the third column CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

So, the grid is:

A B C
D E F

And the conditions are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit, meaning they can be from 0 to 9. But wait, since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, A and D cannot be zero because that would make them two-digit numbers. So, A and D must be at least 1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If A is zero, then ABC would be a two-digit number, right? So, ABC has to be a three-digit number, so A can't be zero. Similarly, D is the first digit of DEF, so D can't be zero either.

So, A and D are from 1 to 9, while B, C, E, F can be from 0 to 9.

So, let's model this.

First, the sum ABC + DEF = 999.

Let me write ABC and DEF in terms of their digits:

ABC = 100*A + 10*B + C
DEF = 100*D + 10*E + F

So, ABC + DEF = 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Similarly, for the vertical sum, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Breaking that down:

AD is a two-digit number: 10*A + D
BE is 10*B + E
CF is 10*C + F

So, (10*A + D) + (10*B + E) + (10*C + F) = 99

Simplify this:

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1. 100*(A + D) + 10*(B + E) + (C + F) = 999
2. 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

Let me denote some variables to simplify:

Let S1 = A + D
Let S2 = B + E
Let S3 = C + F

Then, equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

Equation 2: 

10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99

But note that A + B + C is the sum of the top digits, and D + E + F is the sum of the bottom digits. But since S1 = A + D, S2 = B + E, S3 = C + F, then:

A + D = S1
B + E = S2
C + F = S3

So, A + B + C = (A + B + C) = (A) + (B) + (C). But S1 = A + D, so A = S1 - D. Similarly, B = S2 - E, and C = S3 - F. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Wait, let
