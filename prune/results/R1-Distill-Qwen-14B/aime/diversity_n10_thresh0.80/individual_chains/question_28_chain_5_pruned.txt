Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths and find the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, let me first write down the given information.

We have tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, all opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron or something? I'm not entirely sure, but symmetry might help here.

The problem asks for the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. Since the distances are equal, I is the incenter, which is the point equidistant from all four faces. That distance is what we need to find.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find V and S.

First, let me find the volume V. Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron. I think in such cases, there's a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths. Let me recall.

Alternatively, I can try to compute the volume by using coordinates. Maybe placing the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that calculations are easier.

Let me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices.

Let me set point A at (0,0,0). Then, maybe point B can be at (a,0,0), point C at (0,b,0), and point D at (0,0,c). Wait, but with the given edge lengths, maybe this won't work because the opposite edges are equal. Let me think.

Wait, in a tetrahedron with AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC, it's sometimes called a disphenoid. I think in this case, the volume can be calculated using a formula.

Yes, for a disphenoid, the volume is given by:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, that might be more reliable. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:

288 V² = | 0   1    1    1    1  |
          | 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
          | 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
          | 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
          | 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, the determinant of this 5x5 matrix divided by 288 gives V squared.

But that seems complicated. Maybe I can plug in the values.

Wait, let's list all the edge lengths:

AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41

AC = sqrt(80), AC² = 80

AD = sqrt(89), AD² = 89

BC = sqrt(89), BC² = 89

BD = sqrt(80), BD² = 80

CD = sqrt(41), CD² = 41

So, the edge lengths squared are:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89,

BC² = 89, BD² = 80, CD² = 41.

So, now I can plug these into the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The determinant will be:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   41   80   89 |
| 1  41    0   89   80 |
| 1  80   89    0   41 |
| 1  89   80   41    0 |

Calculating this determinant is going to be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.

Let me denote the determinant as D. So,

D = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
    | 1  0   41   80   89 |
    | 1 41    0   89   80 |
    | 1 80   89    0   41 |
    | 1 89   80   41    0 |

But calculating a 5x5 determinant directly is quite involved. Maybe I can use some properties or row operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice some symmetry in the matrix to make it easier.

Looking at rows 2,3,4,5: they seem to have some symmetry.

Row 2: 1, 0,41,80,89

Row 3: 1,41, 0,89,80

Row 4: 1,80,89,0,41

Row 5: 1,89,80,41,0

It looks like each row is a permutation of the others, which suggests that the determinant might have some symmetric properties, but I'm not sure how to exploit that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, which has some properties that might make the volume calculation easier.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

Wait, no, not exactly. Let me recall. Maybe it's similar to Heron's formula.

Alternatively, for a disphenoid, the formula for volume is:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

But I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, let me check.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, are the faces congruent here? Let's check.

The edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC, but does that imply that the faces are congruent?

Each face is a triangle with sides composed of edges from the tetrahedron.

For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC.

Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD.

Wait, let's compute the lengths for each face.

Face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)

Face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(
