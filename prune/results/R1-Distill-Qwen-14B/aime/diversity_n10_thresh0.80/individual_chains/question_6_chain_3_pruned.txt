Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). The functions f and g are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated with all the nested absolute values and trigonometric functions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I should understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Both are absolute value functions inside another absolute value, so they might have a V-shape or something more complex.

Let me start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we take the absolute value again, it's going to flip any negative parts to positive. So, when |x| - 1/2 is negative, which happens when |x| < 1/2, the outer absolute value will make it positive. So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph that's W-shaped overall because of the double absolute values.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Same idea. The inner |x| is shifted down by 1/4, and the outer absolute value will reflect any negative parts. So, it's another W-shaped graph but with a different shift.

I should probably sketch these functions or at least figure out their key points. Let's do that.

For f(x):
- When x is 0, f(0) = ||0| - 1/2| = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- When |x| = 1/2, f(x) becomes ||1/2| - 1/2| = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. So, there are minima at x = ±1/2.
- When |x| is 1, f(1) = ||1| - 1/2| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- As |x| increases beyond 1/2, the function starts increasing again. So, it has a W-shape with minima at ±1/2 and peaks at 1/2 when x is 0, ±1, etc.

For g(x):
- At x = 0, g(0) = ||0| -1/4| = 1/4.
- When |x| = 1/4, g(x) = ||1/4| -1/4| = 0. So, minima at x = ±1/4.
- At x = 1/2, g(1/2) = ||1/2| -1/4| = |1/2 -1/4| = 1/4.
- So, it's a W-shape with minima at ±1/4, and peaks at 1/4 when |x| is 1/2, 3/4, etc.

Now, moving on to the functions y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). These are composite functions, so I need to think about how the inner functions behave.

Let me first consider y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). The inner function is sin(2πx), which has a period of 1 because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so 2π/(2π) = 1. So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave oscillating between -1 and 1, with period 1.

Then f is applied to sin(2πx), so f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's analyze this function.

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 will be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2| will be between 0 and 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) ranges between 0 and 1/2. Then, we apply g to this result. So, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. Since f(sin(...)) is already non-negative, the absolute value can be removed. So, it's |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

But wait, f(sin(2πx)) can be as low as 0 and as high as 1/2. So, when f(...) is less than 1/4, subtracting 1/4 gives a negative number, whose absolute value is 1/4 - f(...). When f(...) is greater than or equal to 1/4, it's f(...) - 1/4.

So, g(f(sin(2πx))) is a piecewise function based on the value of f(sin(2πx)).

Similarly, for x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), the inner function is cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3 because the period of cos(ky) is 2π/k, so 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, with period 2/3.

Let's process this similarly. f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, same as f(sin(2πx)). So, same as before, it ranges between 0 and 1/2.

Then, g(f(cos(3πy))) = |f(cos(3πy)) - 1/4|, same as the other function.

So, both functions y = 4 * [some function of x] and x = 4 * [some function of y] are built upon similar structures, but with different trigonometric functions and different periods.

Now, since both functions are transformations of these sine and cosine waves, they're going to be periodic. So, perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing their periods and the nature of their transformations.

But maybe it's better to figure out what 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) look like.

Let me first find the range of 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, and then g(...) is |f(...) - 1/4|, so g(...) can range between 0 and 1/4. Then, multiplying by 4, 4 g(...) ranges between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), it also ranges between 0 and 1.

So, both y and x are between 0 and 1. That suggests that the graphs are confined within the square [0,1] x [0,1], perhaps?

Wait, but y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function where for each x, y is determined. So, it's a curve in the plane. Similarly, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) is a curve where for each y, x is determined, so it's a relation that can be thought of as a function y = something, but perhaps it's more complex.

Wait, actually, solving for y in x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) would give y in terms of x, but it's not straightforward because cos(3πy) is inside, making it a transcendental equation. So, maybe it's better to consider both curves and see where they intersect.

Alternatively, perhaps find the number of solutions (x,y) such that both equations hold: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So, substituting one into the other might help, but it's not obvious.

Alternatively, since both functions are periodic, perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing over a specific interval, considering the periods.

Let me think about the periods of the functions. The function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) has a period of 1 because sin(2πx) has period 1. So, every 1 unit along the x-axis, the function repeats.

The function x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) involves cos(3πy), which has a period of 2/3. So, the function x depends on y with a period of 2/3. So, every 2/3 units along the y-axis, the function repeats.

But since both functions are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, perhaps their composition in the plane leads to a grid of intersections repeating every certain interval.

Alternatively, since both functions map x and y into [0,1], maybe the entire system can be considered within the unit square, and the number of intersections can be found by analyzing the behavior within [0,1]x[0,1].

Wait, but the functions are not necessarily invertible, so it's possible that each x in [0,1] can correspond to multiple y's and vice versa. So, perhaps the number of intersections is determined by how these functions cross each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize one variable and see how the functions behave.

Let me first try to understand y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. So, h(x) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with period 1.

Then, g(h(x)) = |h(x) - 1/4|. So, when h(x) is less than 1/4, g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x); when h(x) is greater than or equal to 1/4, g(h(x)) = h(x) - 1/4.

So, the function g(h(x)) is a V-shape centered at h(x) = 1/4, which is 0 at h(x) = 1/4, going up on both sides.

Thus, 4 g(h(x)) will be 4*(1/4 - h(x)) = 1 - 4h(x) when h(x) < 1/4, and 4*(h(x) -1/4) = 4h(x) -1 when h(x) >=1/4.

So, 4 g(h(x)) is a piecewise linear function that goes from 1 at h(x)=0, down to 0 at h(x)=1/4, then up again to 1 at h(x)=1/2.

So, 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) is a function that oscillates between 0 and 1, with a period of 1 in x. Similarly, for each x, y is determined.

Now, the function x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) is similar, but with cos(3πy) instead of sin(2πx). Let me denote k(y) = f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| -1/2|, which is also between 0 and 1/2.

Then, g(k(y)) = |k(y) -1/4|
