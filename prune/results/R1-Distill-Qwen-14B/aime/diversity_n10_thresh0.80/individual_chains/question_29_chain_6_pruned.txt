Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. There are two rectangles: ABCD and EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think that means these four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which suggests that those four points form a cyclic quadrilateral.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. That probably means that E is somewhere on the line extending from D to C, and F is also on that same line. Wait, or maybe the order is D-E-C-F? Or D-F-E-C? Hmm, I'm not sure yet. Let me think.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, when I draw the two rectangles, the points A, D, H, G should all lie on a single circle, meaning they form a cyclic quadrilateral. That gives me some properties to use, like the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees, or perhaps something about power of a point.

Let me note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16, so AD = 16 (since ABCD is a rectangle)
- AB = 107, so CD = 107
- FG = 17, so EH = 17 (since EFGH is a rectangle)
- EF = 184, so GH = 184

I need to find CE. CE is the distance between points C and E. Since C and E are both points on the line D-E-C-F, CE is just a segment along that line.

Wait, but if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E is somewhere between D and C, or maybe C is between E and D? Hmm. Let me think.

In rectangle ABCD, point D is one of the corners. Let's fix the positions of the rectangles to get a better idea.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C can be at (107, 0) because CD = 107. Point B would be at (0, 16), and point A would be at (107, 16) because AB = 107 and BC = 16.

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle ABCD, the points are arranged such that AB is adjacent to BC. So, if D is at (0,0), then since AD is 16, point A would be at (0,16). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107,16), and point C would be at (107, 0). Wait, that makes more sense because ABCD would have sides AB = 107, BC = 16, CD = 107, and DA = 16.

So, points assigned as:
- D: (0,0)
- A: (0,16)
- B: (107,16)
- C
