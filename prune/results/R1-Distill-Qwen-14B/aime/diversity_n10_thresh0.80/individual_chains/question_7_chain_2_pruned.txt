Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon being colored and rotated. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 sides and 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, and each color is equally likely. So, for each vertex, the probability of it being red is 1/2, and the same for blue.

The question is about the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Hmm, that's a bit abstract. Let me try to rephrase it.

Imagine the octagon is fixed in a certain position, and each vertex is colored red or blue randomly. Now, if we rotate the octagon by some number of positions (like rotating it 45 degrees, which is 1 position), the colors of the vertices will shift accordingly. The problem is asking for the probability that there's some rotation (including the identity rotation, which does nothing) where all the blue vertices in the original coloring end up on positions that were red before the rotation.

Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The rotation is applied to the octagon, and then after the rotation, all the blue vertices should be in positions that were originally red. So, it's like we're moving the octagon, and now the blue points move to where the red points were. So, the rotated octagon's blue vertices must exactly coincide with the original red vertices.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. The original blue vertices, after rotation, are now at positions where the original octagon had red vertices. I think that's the correct interpretation.

So, to put it formally, suppose the original coloring has a set B of blue vertices. We need to find a rotation σ such that when we apply σ to the octagon, the image of B under σ is exactly the set of red vertices in the original coloring. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations correspond to cyclic shifts.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices, so the possible rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which correspond to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions respectively. So, there are 8 possible rotations.

So, the
