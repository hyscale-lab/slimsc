Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The list of positive integers has three main properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

Alright, let's break this down. Let me start by recalling some definitions.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If there's an odd number of items, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, so it must be the average of two numbers that are equal because if they weren't, the median would be a non-integer or wouldn't have to be an integer.

Wait, no. If the median is an integer but not present in the list, that implies that when the list is ordered, the two middle numbers average to an integer, but that integer isn't in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is a positive integer but not present in the list? Wait, no, 9 is the mode, so it must be present in the list. Hmm, that's a conflict, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe the list has an even number of elements. Let me think. Suppose there are 2k numbers. Then the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th numbers. For the median to be an integer not in the list, these two numbers must be such that their average is an integer, but that integer isn't present in the list. But since the mode is 9, 9 must be in the list. So let me think about what kind of numbers could be the two middle numbers.

Let's make a plan. Let's denote the number of elements in the list as n. I don't know n yet, but perhaps I can figure it out.

Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So the count of 9s must be higher than any other number's count.

Let me think about the possible number of elements, n. Let's consider that the median is not present in the list. So, for example, if n is odd, say 5, the median is the 3rd element. But if that's not present, that can't be because the third element is part of the list. So n must be even, I think.

Wait, no. If n is odd, the median is a specific element in the list. So if the median is not present, that can't happen. So n must be even, so that the median is the average of two middle elements, which are themselves present, but their average is not in the list.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so 9 must be in the list. So if the two middle numbers are, say, 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is in the list. So that would not satisfy the condition, because the median is 9, which is in the list. So perhaps the two middle numbers are something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the two middle numbers are both 8.5, but that's not possible because the list contains positive integers. So, no. Alternatively, perhaps the two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer not in the list. But 9 is in the list, so that can't be. Wait, but the median is a positive integer not present in the list, but 9 is present as the mode. So maybe the median is a different integer, not 9.

Wait, that's possible. Let's think. For example, the two middle numbers could be 7 and 9. Then the median would be 8, which is an integer, and if 8 isn't in the list, that works. But wait, 9 is in the list, so the median is 8, which is not present. So that could work.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, then the median is 8, and if 8 is not in the list, that's okay. But then 9 is present, and since 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number.

So let me try to structure this step by step.

First, let's assume the list has an even number of elements, say 2k elements. So the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

Since the median is an integer not in the list, the average must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must sum to an even number. Also, their sum must be 2 times the median, which is an integer.

Let me think about possible medians. Let's consider that the median is m, which is an integer not present in the list. So m must be between the two middle numbers, and not in the list.

Let me try small n to see possibilities. Let me think about possible n.

Since the sum is 30, which is not too large, n can't be very big. Let's try n=6, which is even, so the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.

Let me try to construct a list.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables.

Let me denote the list in non-decreasing order: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an.

We have sum(ai) = 30.

Mode is 9, which occurs more frequently than any other number.

Median is m, which is an integer not in the list.

Let me think of n=6. Then the median is (a3 + a4)/2 = m, where m is integer, not in the list.

Since 9 is the mode, it must occur at least twice, probably more.

Let me try to construct such a list.

I need to have 9 appearing more times than any other number.

Let's say 9 appears 3 times, as in the list: [x, y, 9, 9, 9, z].

Wait, but that would have n=6. Let me see.

Wait, wait, in that case, the list would be ordered, so the two middle elements are the 3rd and 4th, which are both 9. So the median would be (9 + 9)/2 = 9, which is in the list. That's a problem because the median can't be in the list. So that's not acceptable.

So that approach won't work. So perhaps 9 appears in such a way that it's not in the middle, but elsewhere.

Wait, maybe 9 appears in the first few or the last few elements.

Wait, but if n=6, and the two middle elements are, say, 8 and 10, then the median is 9, which is in the list. That's bad. So perhaps I need the two middle elements to be numbers that average to something else.

Wait, maybe the two middle elements are 8 and 8, so the median is 8, which is in the list. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, 8 and 9, which would make the median 8.5, which is not an integer, so that's not acceptable because the median has to be an integer.

Wait, so maybe the two middle elements are both 7 and 9, making the median 8, which is an integer and not present in the list. Let me try that.

So for n=6, the list would have elements like [a, b, 7, 9, c, d], but wait, that's not necessarily in order. Hmm, perhaps I should arrange the list in non-decreasing order.

Wait, let me think again. For n=6, the median is (a3 + a4)/2. Suppose a3=7 and a4=9, then the median is 8, which is an integer and not in the list. That's acceptable.

Now, the list has 6 elements, so the sum is 30.

We need to have 9 as the unique mode, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.

In this case, 9 appears at least twice, but let's see. Wait, in the list, if a4 is 9, perhaps 9 appears more times elsewhere.

Wait, but if a3=7 and a4=9, then the list up to a4 is 7 and 9. To make 9 the mode, 9 must occur more times than any other number.

So perhaps 9 appears three times in the list.

Let me try to construct such a list.

Let me try a possible list: [7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9]. Wait, that's 6 elements. The sum is 7*3 +9*3=21+27=48, which is way over 30. So that's too big.

Hmm, so maybe I can't have too many 9s.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose n=6, and 9 appears twice. Then the other numbers can't appear more than once, because 9 is the unique mode.

So, let's try to make a list where 9 appears twice, and others appear once or twice, but not more than two times.

Wait, but 9 needs to be the unique mode, so if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. So all other numbers must appear once.

Wait, but in that case, the list would have 2 9s and 4 other distinct numbers. Let me see.

Wait, but if n=6, and 9 appears twice, the sum is 30.

So 2*9=18, so the remaining four numbers sum to 12.

But let's arrange the list in non-decreasing order, and have the two middle numbers as 7 and 9, so that the median is 8, which is not in the list.

Wait, let me try that.

So list: [a, b, 7, 9, c, d], where a ≤ b ≤ 7 ≤ 9 ≤ c ≤ d.

Wait, but that's not correct because the fourth element is 9, so the first three elements are a, b, 7, and the last two are c, d, with c ≥9 and d ≥c.

Wait, but 9 is at position 4, so the first three elements are less than or equal to 7, and the last two are greater than or equal to 9.

So, let's try to make 9 appear twice, so the list would have 9 at position 4 and perhaps another 9 at position 5 or 6.

Wait, but if I have 9 at position 4, and another 9 at position 5, then the median would be (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list, which is good.

So the list would be: a, b, 7, 9, 9, d.

Now, 9 appears twice, so the other numbers (a, b, 7, d) must each appear once.

Wait, but a and b have to be ≤7, and d≥9.

So, let's assign some values.

Sum of the list: a + b +7 +9 +9 +d =30 → a + b +d=30-7-9-9=5.

So a + b +d=5.

But a, b are positive integers, and d is a positive integer ≥9.

So d ≥9, but a + b +d=5. So a + b=5 -d.

But since d≥9, 5 -d would be negative, which is impossible because a and b are positive integers, so their sum can't be negative.

So this is impossible. Therefore, this configuration doesn't work.

Hmm, so maybe n=6 is not possible. Let's try n=8.

Wait, n=8 would mean the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements.

So let's see. Let's try to have the 4th and 5th elements such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Suppose the 4th and 5th elements are 8 and 8, but then their average is 8, which is in the list, which is bad.

Alternatively, 7 and 9, which average to 8, which is not in the list.

So let me try that.

So the list would be: [a, b, c, 7, 9, f, g, h], but wait, no, in order, the 4th and 5th elements are 7 and 9, so the list up to the 5th element would be [...,7,9,...].

Wait, but in that case, the two middle elements are 7 and 9, so the median is 8, which is not present in the list.

So let's try to construct a list where 4th element is 7 and 5th is 9, so median is 8, which is not present.

Now, the list has 8 elements, so the two middle elements are 4th and 5th.

Let me arrange the list as [a, b, c, 7, 9, f, g, h], where a ≤ b ≤ c ≤7, 9 ≤ f ≤g ≤h.

Now, the sum of all elements is 30.

We need 9 to be the unique mode, appearing more times than any other number.

So, 9 must appear at least twice, and no other number can appear more than once, perhaps.

Wait, but maybe 9 appears twice, so let's see.

But wait, in this list, 7 is at position 4, and 9 is at position 5, so to have 9 as the mode, it must appear more than any other number.

So perhaps 9 appears three times, and others appear once or twice.

Wait, let me try 9 appearing three times.

So, in the list, the 5th element is 9, and perhaps the 6th and 7th elements are 9 as well.

So the list would be: [a, b, c, 7, 9, 9, 9, h], with h ≥9.

Now, the sum is a + b + c +7 +9 +9 +9 +h =30 → a + b + c + h = 30 - (7+9*3) =30 - (7+27)=30-34= -4. That's impossible because all are positive integers. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, so perhaps 9 appears only twice.

So in that case, the list would be [a, b, c, 7, 9, f, g, h], with f, g, h ≥9, and 9 appears only at position 5.

Wait, but then the count of 9 is 1, which wouldn't make it the mode unless all others appear once. But maybe other numbers can appear twice.

Wait, no, because 9 must be the unique mode, so if any other number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times.

So perhaps 9 appears twice, and others appear once.

So let's try that.

So the list would be [a, b, c, 7, 9, f, g, h], with 9 appearing only at position 5 and perhaps another occurrence elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the 6th element is 9. So the list would be [a, b, c, 7, 9, 9, g, h], with g and h ≥9.

Now, 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number.

So the sum is a + b + c +7 +9 +9 + g +h=30 → a + b + c + g + h=30 - (7+9+9) =30-25=5.

Now, a, b, c are positive integers ≤7, and g, h are ≥9.

So a + b + c ≤7+7+7=21, but in this case, a + b + c + g + h=5.

But g and h are at least 9 each, so g + h ≥18.

So a + b + c +18 ≤5 → a + b + c ≤-13, which is impossible because a, b, c are positive integers. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe I should try a different n.

Let me try n=5, but wait, as I thought earlier, for n=5, the median is the 3rd element, which is in the list, so that can't be because the median must not be in the list. So n=5 is invalid.

What about n=7?

Wait, n=7 is odd, so the median is the 4th element, which is in the list, so that's bad. So n must be even. Let's try n=8 again, but perhaps a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe n=4.

n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. Let's see.

If the median is an integer not present in the list, then the two middle numbers must average to that integer, which is not in the list.

So let's say the two middle numbers are 8 and 8, so the median is 8, which is in the list. Bad.

Alternatively, 7 and 9, median is 8, which is not in the list.

So the list would be arranged as [a, b, 7, 9, c, d], but wait, n=4, so the list would have elements [a, b, 7, 9], ordered, with a ≤ b ≤7 ≤9.

Wait, but wait, n=4, so the two middle elements are the 2nd and 3rd, which are b and 7.

So the median is (b +7)/2 = m, an integer not present in the list.

So, (b +7) must be even, so b must be odd if 7 is odd. Because 7 is odd, adding two odds gives even.

So let's say b is an odd number less than or equal to 7.

Possible b values:1,3,5,7.

So let me try each case.

Case 1: b=7.

Then median is (7+7)/2=7, which is in the list. Bad.

Case 2: b=5.

Median is (5+7)/2=6, which is an integer. Now, is 6 in the list? The list is [a,5,7,9]. So a must be ≤5. If a is 5, then 5 appears twice, and 9 appears once. But 5 would be a mode, same as 9, but the mode is unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. So 9 must appear at least twice. But in this case, 9 appears once, so that's not possible.

Wait, so if 9 must appear more times than any other number, in n=4, the list must have 9 appearing at least twice. So let's try that.

So the list would be [a, 9, 9, d], with a ≤9, d≥9.

Wait, but then the two middle elements are 9 and 9, so the median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Bad.

So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the list is [a, b, 7,9], with 9 appearing once.

But then the mode can't be 9 unless it appears more than others. So 9 must appear more than any other number. So maybe 9 appears twice, and the other numbers appear once.

So the list would be [a,9,7,9], but wait, that's not in order. Let me arrange it: [a,7,9,9], with a ≤7.

So the two middle elements are 7 and9, so the median is (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not in the list.

Now, the list is [a,7,9,9], and the sum is a +7 +9 +9 =30 → a=30-25=5.

So a=5. Now, the list is [5,7,9,9].

Check mode: 9 appears twice, 5 and7 appear once. So mode is 9, which is correct.

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. So that's good.

Sum is 5+7+9+9=30, correct.

So this seems to fit all conditions.

Now, the sum of squares would be 5² +7² +9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81.

Wait, let me calculate that.

25 +49=74; 74 +81=155; 155 +81=236.

So the sum of squares is 236.

Wait, but let me make sure this is the only possible configuration.

Is there another possible list with n=4?

What if the list is [6,7,9,8], but wait, that's not in order. Wait, no, the list must be ordered.

Wait, but in the example I found, the sum is 30, and all conditions are met. So perhaps that's the only possible list.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there other possible lists?

Suppose n=4, list is [a,7,9,9], a=5 as above.

Alternatively, could a be 6? Let's check.

If a=6, then the list is [6,7,9,9], sum is 6+7+9+9=31, which is over 30. So no.

a=4: 4+7+9+9=29, under 30. Not acceptable.

a=5 is the only possibility.

So the list is [5,7,9,9], sum is 30, mode is 9, median is 8 (not in list), so that works.

Alternatively, could there be a list with n=6 that works?

Wait, earlier when I tried n=6, it didn't work because the sum was too low. Let me try again.

Suppose n=6, list is [a, b, 7,9,9, d], ordered.

So the two middle elements are 7 and9, median is 8, which is not in the list.

Now, 9 must be the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number.

So let's say 9 appears twice.

So the list is [a, b, 7,9,9, d], sum is a +b +7 +9 +9 +d=30 → a + b +d=5.

But a and b are ≤7, and d≥9.

So a + b +d=5, but d≥9, so a + b=5 -d ≤-4, which is impossible because a and b are positive integers. So n=6 doesn't seem to work.

Alternatively, perhaps 9 appears three times in n=6.

So list would be [a, b, 7,9,9,9], sum is a +b +7 +9*3= a +b +7 +27= a +b +34=30 → a +b= -4, which is impossible.

So n=6 doesn't work.

What about n=8? Let me try that again.

n=8, list has 8 elements.

We need the two middle elements (4th and 5th) to average to an integer not present.

Suppose 4th is 7, 5th is 9, so median is 8, not in the list.

Now, 9 must be the mode, so it appears more times than any other number.

Let me try a list where 9 appears three times.

So the list would be: [a, b, c,7,9,9, f, g], with f and g ≥9.

Sum is a +b +c +7 +9 +9 +f +g=30 → a +b +c +f +g=30 - (7+9+9)=30-25=5.

But a, b, c ≤7, and f, g ≥9. So f +g ≥18, so a +b +c +18 ≤5 → a +b +c ≤-13, which is impossible.

So that's not possible. What if 9 appears twice?

Then the list would be [a, b, c,7,9, f, g, h], with 9 appearing at positions 5 and maybe another spot.

Wait, but if 9 appears only twice, then other numbers can't appear more than once, because 9 is the unique mode.

So let's try that.

List: [a, b, c,7,9, f, g, h], with 9 at position5, and f, g, h ≥9.

Sum: a +b +c +7 +9 +f +g +h=30 → a +b +c +f +g +h=24.

Since f, g, h ≥9, let's assign the minimum possible to them: f=9, g=9, h=9. Then f +g +h=27, which would require a +b +c=24 -27= -3. Impossible.

So that can't work.

Alternatively, maybe 9 appears three times, but that led to a problem as well. So perhaps n=8 is also not possible.

Wait, perhaps the list has more 9s and smaller numbers elsewhere.

Wait, let me try assigning 9s in other positions.

Wait, maybe the list is [9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9], but that would make the two middle elements both 9, so the median is 9, which is in the list, which is bad.

Alternatively, perhaps the list is [a, b, c,7,9,9,9, d], with d≥9.

Sum would be a +b +c +7 +9 +9 +9 +d=30 → a +b +c +d=30 - (7+27)= -4, which is impossible.

So n=8 doesn't seem to work.

Hmm, perhaps the only possible n is 4, giving the list [5,7,9,9], which meets all conditions.

Let me confirm:

- Sum:5+7+9+9=30. Correct.
- Mode:9 appears twice, others appear once. Correct.
- Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So this seems to satisfy all conditions.

Therefore, the sum of the squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25 +49 +81 +81=236.


To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.

### Step-by-Step Construction:

1. **Determine the Number of Elements (n):**
   - Since the median is not present in the list, the list must have an even number of elements to ensure the median is the average of two middle numbers, which can be an integer not in the list.

2. **Test Possible Values for n:**
   - **n=4:** The median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. If the two middle elements are 7 and 9, the median is 8, which is not in the list. This configuration works.

3. **Construct the List:**
   - The list must have 9 as the unique mode. Therefore, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. Let's try having 9 appear twice.
   - The list is constructed as `[5, 7, 9, 9]`, which sums to 30.

4. **Verify the Conditions:**
   - **Sum:** \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\) ✓
   - **Mode:** 9 appears twice, more than any other number. ✓
   - **Median:** The median is \((7 + 9)/2 = 8\), which is not in the list. ✓

5. **Calculate the Sum of Squares:**
   - \(5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236\)

### Final Answer:
The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{236}\).
