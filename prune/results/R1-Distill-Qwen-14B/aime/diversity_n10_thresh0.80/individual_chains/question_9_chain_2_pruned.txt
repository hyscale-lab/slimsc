Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:

log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted to exponential form to make them easier to handle. So let's start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

Using the logarithm property that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a), I can rewrite this as log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x times log_x(y) equals 10. Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x, which can also be written as (ln y)/(ln x) if I switch to natural logarithms. But maybe it's better to keep it in logarithmic form for now.

Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable, say, a. So, a = log_x(y), which means x^a = y. That could be helpful because it relates y directly to x. 

So, substituting back into the first equation, x * a = 10. Therefore, a = 10/x. But since a is log_x(y), that means log_x(y) = 10/x. 

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, applying the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let me denote log_y(x) as another variable, say, b. So, b = log_y(x), which implies y^b = x.

But wait, I already have y in terms of x from the first part. Since y = x^a, which we know a is 10/x. So, y = x^{10/x}. Hmm, that might be useful.

Also, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, since log_x(y) is a, then log_y(x) is 1/a. Therefore, the second equation becomes 4y * (1/a) = 10.

Substituting a = 10/x into this, we get 4y * (x/10) = 10. Simplifying, that's (4y x)/10 = 10. Multiply both sides by 10: 4y x = 100. Then divide both sides by 4: y x = 25. Oh, wait, so that would mean xy = 25. Is that the answer? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors.

Wait, let's double-check that. So, from the first equation, we have y = x^{10/x}. From the second equation, after substitution, we found that xy = 25. So, is that correct? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I should find x and y individually to make sure everything adds up. Let's try that.

We have y = x^{10/x}. Let me plug this into the second equation's expression. The second equation after substitution gave us yx = 25, so y = 25/x. Therefore, we can set 25/x equal to x^{10/x}.

So, 25/x = x^{10/x}. That's an equation in terms of x. Let me write that down:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but perhaps taking the natural logarithm of both sides might help. Let's do that.

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x}).

Using logarithm properties, that's ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

So, rearrange the equation:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10 ln x)/x.

Let me denote ln(x) as t to make it a bit simpler. So, let t = ln x. Then, the equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = (10 t)/e^t.

Wait, no, wait. Because x is e^t, right? Because t = ln x, so x = e^t. So, 1/x is e^{-t}.

Wait, let me correct that. The equation is:

ln(25) - t = (10 t) / e^{t}.

Because (10/x) is 10 e^{-t}, and ln(x) is t. So, (10 ln x)/x becomes (10 t) e^{-t}.

So, the equation is:

ln(25) - t = 10 t e^{-t}.

Hmm, this equation looks a bit tricky. Maybe I can rearrange terms.

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}.

Factor out t:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t}).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe trying specific values for t to see if it satisfies the equation? Because solving this algebraically might be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make this easier. Let me think.

Wait, I know that 25 is 5 squared, so ln(25) is 2 ln(5). Let me write that:

2 ln(5) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t}).

Hmm, perhaps I can guess a value for t that makes this equation true. Let me try t = ln(5). Let's substitute t = ln(5):

Left-hand side: 2 ln(5).

Right-hand side: ln(5) * (1 + 10 e^{-ln(5)}).

Compute e^{-ln(5)}: that's 1/(e^{ln(5)}) = 1/5.

So, 1 + 10*(1/5) = 1 + 2 = 3.

So, right-hand side is ln(5)*3.

Left-hand side is 2 ln(5). So, 2 ln(5) vs 3 ln(5). These are not equal. So, t = ln(5) is not the solution.

How about t = 2 ln(5)? Let's try that.

Compute right-hand side: 2 ln(5) * (1 + 10 e^{-2 ln(5)}).

e^{-2 ln(5)} = (e^{ln(5)})^{-2} = 5^{-2} = 1/25.

So, 1 + 10*(1/25) = 1 + 2/5 = 7/5.

So, right-hand side is 2 ln(5) * (7/5) = (14/5) ln(5).

Left-hand side is 2 ln(5). So, 14/5 is 2.8, which is greater than 2. Not equal. So, t = 2 ln(5) is not the solution.

Hmm, maybe trying t = ln(25). Let's see:

Right-hand side: ln(25) * (1 + 10 e^{-ln(25)}).

e^{-ln(25)} is 1/25.

So, 1 + 10
