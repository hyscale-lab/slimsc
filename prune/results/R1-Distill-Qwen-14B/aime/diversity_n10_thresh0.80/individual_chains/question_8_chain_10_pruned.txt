Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation, and we're dealing with nonnegative integers, so the solutions are the number of ways to distribute 300 indistinct items into three variables. But the second equation is more complicated. Let me think about how to simplify that.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to rearrange it.

Wait, I can factor terms by grouping. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the whole expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). That should help substitute these into the equation.

So substituting, the equation becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me write that out:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can factor this further or find a way to relate it to a + b + c. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of symmetric functions or some known identity.

Alternatively, I might consider that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so it's possible that some of them might be equal, or maybe some are zero. Let me think about possible cases.

Case 1: One of the variables is zero. Let's say c = 0. Then, the equations become a + b = 300 and a²b + b²a = 6,000,000.

Wait, if c=0, then the second equation becomes a²b + b²a, which is ab(a + b). Since a + b = 300, this becomes ab * 300 = 6,000,000.

So 300ab = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So in this case, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. We can solve for a and b by solving the quadratic equation.

Let me set a + b = 300, ab = 20,000.

Then, the quadratic equation is x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Let me compute the discriminant: D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

So sqrt(D) = 100.

So the solutions are x = [300 ± 100]/2 → x = 200 or x = 100.

So the solutions are a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200. Since c=0, the triples would be (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), and also considering permutations where any of a, b, or c is zero.

Wait, no: if I set c=0, and then get (200,100,0), another permutation would be (200,0,100) but wait, in this case, if c=0, then the only other non-zero variables are a and b. So if I set a=0, similarly, I can get other solutions.

Wait, let me check.

If a=0 instead, then the equations become b + c = 300 and 0 + 0 + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Wait, no, substituting a=0, the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + 0 + c²b = bc(b + c). Since b + c = 300, this becomes bc*300 = 6,000,000 → bc = 20,000.

So same as before, b + c = 300, bc=20,000. So, same solutions: b=200, c=100 or b=100, c=200. So the triples would be (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly, if b=0, we get (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So for the case where one variable is zero, we have 6 permutations? Wait, no, wait. Let me count.

Wait, each of the three variables can be zero, and for each, we have two solutions (since a and b are interchangeable in each case). So 3 variables * 2 solutions each = 6 triples where one variable is zero.

So that's 6 triples so far.

Case 2: None of the variables are zero. So a, b, c ≥ 1.
