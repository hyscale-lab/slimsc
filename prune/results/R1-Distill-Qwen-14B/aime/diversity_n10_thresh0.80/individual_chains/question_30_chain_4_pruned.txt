Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials and cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use that somehow.

First, let me write down what I know. ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's a root and not equal to 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) where k ranges over the integers from 1 to n-1 that are coprime to n. Since 13 is prime, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. So, Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1).

Now, the product given is over k from 0 to 12, but ω^0 is 1, so when k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. The rest of the terms from k=1 to 12 will be products of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, maybe I can factor out something or find a pattern here. Let's look at the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote x = ω^k. Then, the term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So, we're looking at the product of (x² - 2x + 2) as x ranges over all 13th roots of unity except x=1.

Wait, but x is ω^k, which are all the roots of x^13 = 1. So, the product over k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2) where x are the 13th roots of unity except x=1.

Alternatively, since for each x=ω^k, we can consider the product over all x^13 = 1, except x=1. But x=1 is already handled by the first term, which was 1, so the total product is 1 times the product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, but 2 - 2x + x² can also be written as x² - 2x + 2. Alternatively, maybe factor it as (x - a)(x - b) for some a and b. Let me see the discriminant: the quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2 = 0 has discrimin
