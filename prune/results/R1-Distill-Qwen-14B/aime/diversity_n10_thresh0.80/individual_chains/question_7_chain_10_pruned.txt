Okay, so I came across this math problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is independently colored with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that you can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what it means to rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices align with the original red ones. Essentially, this is asking if there's a rotation (which for an octagon would be by a multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8 = 45) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red.

So, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue with a 50% chance each. Let's denote the colors as R and B for simplicity.

We need to find the probability that such a rotation exists. Let me think about how to model this.

First, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, for the numerator, we need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition that there exists a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees) such that after applying that rotation, all blue vertices are now on red positions.

Wait, perhaps another way to look at it is: for a given coloring, is there a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices? Or maybe the other way around? Let me see.

Wait, the problem says, "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotating, each blue vertex is now where a red was before. That means the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices.

So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Alternatively, the set of red vertices must be a rotation of the set of blue vertices.

But wait, in a regular octagon, the set of red and blue vertices are complementary. Since each
