Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which would be ((12-2)*180)/12 = (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about finding rectangles. So, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals aren't aligned in the same way as in a square or rectangle. So, I need to figure out how the sides and diagonals can form rectangles.

Wait, but the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon can intersect at various points, forming vertices of other polygons, including rectangles. So, the vertices of the rectangles must lie on the vertices of the dodecagon, right? Because the problem says each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal, which suggests that the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon.

So, each rectangle is determined by four vertices of the dodecagon, and the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, adjacent vertices form the side length, then skipping one vertex gives a longer diagonal, etc.

I remember that in regular polygons, the number of sides determines the number of possible diagonals and their lengths. For a dodecagon, there are different types of diagonals based on how many vertices they skip. So, for a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2. For n=12, that's 12*(12-3)/2 = 12*9/2=54 diagonals. But that's just the count; each diagonal has a specific length.

Wait, but for this problem, I think I need to find all possible rectangles. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the coordinates of the dodecagon's vertices. If I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, maybe with one vertex at (1,0) and the center at the origin, then I can assign coordinates to each vertex and then check which sets of four points form rectangles.

Let me consider placing the dodecagon on a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since it's regular, the angle between each vertex is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°,
