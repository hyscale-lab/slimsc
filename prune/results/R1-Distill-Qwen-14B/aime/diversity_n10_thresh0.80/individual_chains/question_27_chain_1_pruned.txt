Okay, so I've got this problem here about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. The torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center. So, the main circle has radius 3, and the center is 6 units from the axis of revolution. That makes sense.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I should recall the properties of a torus. The standard torus can be defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

So, the torus is T = (R=6, r=3). Now, when this torus is placed inside the sphere S of radius 11, it's tangent internally. That means the sphere and torus touch along a circle where their surfaces meet. Similarly, when the torus is placed outside the sphere, they touch externally along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the radii of these tangent circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference. But how?

Let me think about the geometry involved. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point relative to the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere's center is different.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus as a surface in 3D space. The torus can be parameterized using two angles, but maybe it's easier to think about the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle.

Wait, the generating circle has a center that's 6 units from the axis. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) must be such that the torus just touches the sphere internally.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching it externally. So, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to consider the centers. Let me try to imagine the torus and the sphere.

Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance R = 6 from the axis.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center
