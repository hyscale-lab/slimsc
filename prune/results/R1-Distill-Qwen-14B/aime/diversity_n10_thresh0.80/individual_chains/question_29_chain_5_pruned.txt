Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which is interesting. We're given some side lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. Let me imagine rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD and BC are both 16. Now, rectangle EFGH: EF is 184, so GH is also 184. FG is 17, so EH is 17 as well.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, these four points lie on a straight line. Let me try to arrange the rectangles accordingly. Let's say ABCD is a rectangle with points labeled clockwise as A, B, C, D. Then EFGH is another rectangle, maybe placed such that side EF is adjacent to BC? Hmm, but the points D, E, C, F are on a line. So, D is a corner of ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. Similarly, C is a corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH. Wait, so D, E, C, F are all on a straight line in that order?

Wait, no, the order isn't specified. Maybe it's D-E-C-F or some other order. Hmm. But since both D and C are corners of ABCD, and E and F are corners of EFGH, which is another rectangle. I think the line goes through D, E, C, F in that order. So, the line starts at D, goes through E, then C, then F. So, D-E-C-F are colinear points on a straight line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's an important clue. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Maybe we can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me try to note down the given lengths. For rectangle ABCD: AB = 107, BC = 16. So, ABCD has sides 107 and 16. Therefore, the sides AD and BC are 16, and AB and CD are 107.

For rectangle EFGH: EF = 184, FG = 17. So, EF and GH are 184, FG and EH are 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are colinear, the line passes through these four points. Let me denote this line as line l. So, points D, E, C, F are on line l.

Now, in rectangle ABCD, point D is connected to C via side DC, which is 107 units long. In rectangle EFGH, point E is connected to F via side EF, which is 184 units long.

But since D, E, C, F are colinear, the distance from D to F must be the sum of DE, EC, and CF. Wait, but DE, EC, CF, etc., but perhaps I should assign variables to certain lengths.

Let me denote the coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then point C will be at (107, 0) because DC is 107. Point B will be at (107, 16), and point A will be at (0, 16).

Now, line l passes through D (0,0), E, C (107, 0), and F. So, the line l is the x-axis here, since D is at (0,0), C is at (107, 0). So, points E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis.

Wait, but E is a corner of rectangle EFGH. Since E is on the x-axis, and EFGH is a rectangle, then points F, G, and H must be arranged such that EFGH is a rectangle. So, from E, moving to F, then up to G, then to H, then back to E.

Given that FG is 17, and EF is 184. So, EF = 184 units, which is the length of the base of rectangle EFGH. FG is 17, which is the height. So, rectangle EFGH has sides
