Okay, so I've got this problem here about points O, A, and B on a coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0). And B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is on the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length (so each PQ is 1 unit long) lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, for each segment PQ in F, P is somewhere on the positive x-axis, Q is somewhere on the positive y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is exactly 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, not being A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is on the x-axis, B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B should be 1. Let me check that.

Distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed a member of the family F.

So, the set F consists of all such segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ = 1. Among all these segments, AB is one. Now, we have to find a unique point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, C is only on AB, not on any other PQ in F.

And then, we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, I think we need to find the equation for segment AB. Since we have points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parameterized or expressed in slope-intercept form.

Slope of AB: (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), for x between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, actually, points on AB would have x from 0 to 1/2, because A is at x=1/2, and B is at x=0.

So, C is a point on AB, with coordinates (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t is between 0 and 1/2.

But since C is not A or B, t is between 0 and 1/2, but not equal to 0 or 1/2.

Now, the key is that C doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, point C is not on PQ.

So, for any other P on x-axis and Q on y-axis with PQ=1, C is not on PQ.

So, we have to find the point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB.

Hmm, so perhaps C is the point where AB is the only PQ in F that passes through it, all other PQs miss it.

So, we need to find the point C on AB such that there's no other segment PQ in F (other than AB) that also contains C.

That is, C is the unique point on AB that is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, how do we find such a point?

Perhaps, for point C on AB, if we can find another segment PQ in F that passes through C, then C is not the unique point we're looking for. So, the point C we need is such that no other PQ in F passes through it.

So, perhaps, such a point C is where the envelope of all such segments PQ is tangent to AB. Because the envelope would represent the boundary where the segments just touch the curve, so beyond that, the segments start missing the region.

Wait, so maybe AB is one of these segments, but all other segments in F lie either above or below the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the set of all such segments PQ forms an envelope, which is a curve, and the point C is the intersection of AB with this envelope.

So, perhaps, we can find the envelope of the family of lines PQ in F and find its intersection with AB. That point would be the unique point C that lies only on AB and no other PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a parabola or some other curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how to compute envelopes. Let me recall: the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

So, in our case, the family F is all the lines PQ, each of unit length, connecting the x-axis to y-axis. So, these are straight lines, each with a different slope.

Let me parameterize the family F. Let's say that for a point P on the x-axis, its coordinate is (p, 0), and point Q is on the y-axis at (0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, each segment PQ can be represented by the equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, where p>0, q>0, and p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, the family of lines is given by (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.

Now, to find the envelope of this family, we can use the method for finding envelopes of a family of curves.

The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.

In this case, the parameter can be considered as p, and q is dependent on p via p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, let's write the equation of the line as F(x,y,p) = x/p + y/q -1 = 0.

Then, the condition for the envelope is F(x,y,p) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp: derivative of x/p is -x/p^2, derivative of y/q: since q = sqrt(1 - p^2), so derivative of y/q with respect to p is y*(-1/(2q^2))*(-2p) = y*p/(q^2). So, dF/dp = -x/p^2 + y*p/q^2 = 0.

But since q^2 =1 - p^2, we have:

-x/p^2 + y*p/(1 - p^2) = 0.

So, -x/p^2 = - y p / (1 - p^2).

Multiply both sides by p^2(1 - p^2):

-x(1 - p^2) + y p^3 = 0.

So, -x + x p^2 + y p^3 =0.

But from the original curve equation, x/p + y/q =1.

Since q^2=1-p^2, q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, y = q(1 - x/p).

Wait, let me express y in terms of p.

From F(x,y,p)=0: x/p + y/q =1 => y = q(1 - x/p).

So, y = sqrt(1 - p^2)(1 - x/p).

Now, substituting into the envelope condition:

-x + x p^2 + y p^3 =0.

But y = sqrt(1 - p^2)(1 - x/p).

Substituting:

-x + x p^2 + [sqrt(1 - p^2)(1 - x/p)] * p^3 =0.

Let me expand that:

-x + x p^2 + p^3 sqrt(1 - p^2) (1 - x/p) =0.
