Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out how to approach solving it step by step. The problem goes like this:

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, let me parse the problem. We have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. It's inscribed in a circle, meaning the circumcircle of triangle ABC is ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so point D is the intersection of the two tangents. Then, drawing line AD, which intersects the circle ω again at point P. Our goal is to find AP.

I remember that tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy.

Let me think about the properties involved here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, maybe there's something about the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of point D should be equal to DB squared and DC squared since they are tangents. So, Power of D: DB² = DC² = DB * DC, but since DB=DC, that's just DB².

Another thought: since AD intersects the circle again at P, perhaps I can use the Power of a Point theorem for point A with respect to ω. Wait, but A is on ω, so the power of A would be zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts, but that might be too advanced for now. Let me see if I can find similar triangles or use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Wait, tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothetic center of the circle ω with respect to points B and C. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

I think I should start by finding some key lengths and angles. Maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC to find some angles, which might help in computing lengths later.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me assign the sides as follows: side opposite A is BC=9, opposite B is AC=10, opposite C is AB=5. Wait, in standard notation, side a is BC, side b is AC, side c is AB.

Wait, standard notation is that side a is opposite angle A, which is BC. So, side a = 9, side b = AC = 10, side c = AB=5.

So, let me compute the semi-perimeter (s) of triangle ABC:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) of triangle ABC is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

So, Δ = sqrt[12(12 - 9)(12 - 10)(12 -5)] = sqrt[12 * 3 * 2 *7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, let me compute that again. 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) is (sqrt(63))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). So, the area is 4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) )= 12*sqrt(7/2). Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator, sqrt(7/2) = sqrt(14)/2, so area is 12*(sqrt(14)/2) = 6*sqrt(14). So, Δ = 6√14.

Wait, let me double-check Heron's formula: sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5], but 504 = 16 * 31.5. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 16 * 31 is 496, 16 * 31.5 is 504. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = sqrt(63)/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2). So, 4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)) )= 12*sqrt(7)/(sqrt(2)). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

12*sqrt(14
