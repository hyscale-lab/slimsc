Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That must mean they're concyclic, so those four points lie on the same circle.

The given dimensions are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG = EH = 17, and EF = GH = 184.

Wait, but EFGH is the other rectangle. So EF is 184, which is one side, and FG is 17, the other side. So the sides of rectangle EFGH are 184 and 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So if I imagine the line where they lie, D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are adjacent corners of EFGH. So perhaps the line is along DC, but since E and F are part of another rectangle, maybe it's a longer line that connects both.

Wait, but D and C are adjacent in ABCD, so DC is a side of length 107, because AB is 107 and ABCD is a rectangle, so AB and CD are both 107.

Wait, no, actually, ABCD is a rectangle. So AB is one side, BC is another. So AB = 107, BC = 16, so the rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16. So ABCD's sides are AB=107, BC=16, CD=107, DA=16.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184, FG=17, so the sides are 184 and 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So perhaps the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F? Or maybe in another order. Hmm.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me place rectangle ABCD with points labeled clockwise: A, B, C, D. So ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107, BC = 16. So if I imagine A at the origin (0,0), then B would be at (107, 0), C at (107, 16), and D at (0, 16). So DC is the side from (107,16) to (0,16), which is the top side.

Wait, but the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So the line DC is the top side of rectangle ABCD, from (0,16) to (107,16). Now, E and F are on this same line. Hmm.

Wait, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me think about how EFGH is placed. Since E and F are part of this rectangle, and they lie on the line DC along with D and C. So E and F must be points on DC, perhaps extending beyond D or C.

Wait, but D is at (0,16), and C is at (107,16). So if E and F are on this line, they could be either between D and C or extending to the left of D or to the right of C.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle. So EF is one side, FG
