Alright, let me try to figure out this math problem. So, the problem says there's a list of positive integers with three specific properties, and I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me break down each property and see how they can help me determine the list.

First, the sum of all items is 30. That means if I add up every number in the list, it should total 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently, so 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list, and no other number can have the same frequency as 9. Thirdly, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, that's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, but here it's an integer that's not present.

Okay, let's start by understanding the mode. Since the mode is 9, it has to appear more times than any other number. Let's assume the list has 'n' numbers. The number 9 appears 'k' times, and every other number appears less than 'k' times. So, the first step is to figure out how many times 9 must appear to be the unique mode.

Now, the sum of the list is 30. Let's denote the number of 9s as 'k'. Each 9 contributes 9 to the sum, so 9k is part of the total sum. The remaining sum is 30 - 9k, which must be distributed among the other numbers in the list. Each of these other numbers must be positive integers, so each is at least 1.

Next, the median. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the number of elements 'n' is odd, the median is the middle element. If 'n' is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but it's given that the median is an integer not in the list. Wait, so if the median is an integer, that implies that for even 'n', the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer. So, the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. But since the median isn't in the list, those two middle numbers can't be the same as the median. So, perhaps the median is the average of two different numbers, both not equal to the median.

Wait, but if the median is an integer, and it's not present in the list, that suggests that for an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must sum to an even number (so their average is integer) and that their average is not present in the list. Alternatively, if 'n' is odd, the middle number is the median, which must not be present. So, in that case, the middle number is 9? Wait, no, because 9 is the mode, but the median can be something else. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me try to outline the possibilities for the median. Since the median is an integer not in the list, let's think about possible medians for different lengths of the list.

Let me assume first that the list has an odd number of elements. Let's say n is 2m+1. Then the median is the (m+1)th element. Since the median is not in the list, the (m+1)th element must be a number that's not present in the list. But wait, since the list is ordered, the (m+1)th element is part of the list, right? So that can't be. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is a member of the list, which contradicts the condition that the median is a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, n must be even. Because for even n, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be an integer not present in the list.

So, n is even. Let's denote n as 2m. Then the median is the average of the mth and (m+1)th elements. Since the median is an integer, the sum of the mth and (m+1)th elements must be even. Also, the median is not present in the list, so the average of the two middle numbers is not equal to either of them.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are different, their average could be an integer not present in the list. For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is not in the list. So, in that case, the median is 9, which is the mode. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the median is 9, which is the mode, that would mean 9
