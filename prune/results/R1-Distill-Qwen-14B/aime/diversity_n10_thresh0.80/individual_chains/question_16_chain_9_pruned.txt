Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n making n⁴ + 1 divisible by p squared. Then, find the smallest m that does the same for that p.

First, I think I should figure out what p is. Because if I can find p, then I can work on finding m.

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, which means there exists some n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But here, we need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², which is a stronger condition.

Wait, but maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if any of them satisfy this condition. Let's list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Let me check each prime p and see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Starting with p=2. Let's see:

Check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4. Since modulo 4, let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1 and 2.

n=1: 1⁴=1, 1 mod 4 is 1. 1 ≡ -1 mod 4 would mean 1 ≡ 3 mod 4, which is false.

n=2: 2⁴=16, 16 mod 4 is 0. 0 ≡ -1 mod 4? That would mean 0 ≡ 3 mod 4, which is false.

So, p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3.

Check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

Compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9=1. 1 ≡ -1 mod9? 1≡8 mod9? No.

n=2: 2⁴=16 mod9=7. 7≡-1 mod9? 7≡8? No.

n=3: 3⁴=81 mod9=0. 0≡-1 mod9? No.

n=4: 4⁴=256. 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4. 4≡-1 mod9? 4≡8? No.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625 mod9: 9*69=621, so 625-621=4. Same as above, 4≡-1? No.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod9=0. 0≡-1? No.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. 7≡-1? 7≡8? No.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 9*455=4095, so 4096-4095=1. 1≡-1? No.

So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime is 5.

Check p=5. Look for n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24.

But that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way.

I remember that if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5, then n must satisfy n² ≡ ±2 mod5. Because (n²)² ≡ -1 mod5, so n² must be a square root of -1 mod5.

Wait, does -1 have square roots mod5? Let's see. The quadratic residues mod5 are 0,1,4. So -1 mod5 is 4. Does 4 have a square root mod5? Yes, because 2²=4 and 3²=9≡4 mod5. So the square roots of 4 mod5 are 2 and 3.

So n² ≡ 2 or 3 mod5?

Wait, wait, wait. No, n² ≡ ±2 mod5?

Wait, no. Wait, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod5, which is 4 mod5. So n⁴ ≡4 mod5. So let me find n where n⁴ ≡4 mod5.

Compute n⁴ mod5 for n=1,2,3,4.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod5=1.

n=2: 16 mod5=1.

n=3: 81 mod5=1.

n=4: 256 mod5=1.

Wait, that's odd. So n⁴ mod5 is always 1, except when n≡0 mod5, it's 0.

So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 would mean n⁴≡4 mod5, but n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod5. Hence, no solution exists for p=5. So p=5 doesn't work.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2⁴ is 16, which is 1 mod5. 3⁴ is 81, which is 1 mod5. 4⁴ is (2²)^4=2^8=256, which is 1 mod5. So yeah, n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod5. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 would require 1≡4 mod5, which is false. So p=5 doesn't work.

Moving on to p=7.

Check if there's an n with n⁴ ≡-1 mod49.

First, check modulo 7: If n⁴ ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7.

Compute n⁴ mod7 for n=1 to 6.

n=1: 1.

n=2: 16 mod7=2.

n=3: 81 mod7= 81-7*11=81-77=4.

n=4: 256 mod7. 7*36=252, 256-252=4. So 4.

n=5: 625 mod7. 7*89=623, 625-623=2.

n=6: 1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, 1296-1295=1.

So n⁴ mod7: 1,2,4,4,2,1 for n=1-6. So -1 mod7 is 6, which isn't achieved. Therefore, no solution for p=7.

Wait, so p=7 doesn't work either.

Next prime is 11.

Check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod121.

Again, first check modulo 11.

n⁴ ≡-1 mod11.

Compute n⁴ mod11 for n=1-10.

n=1:1.

n=2:16 mod11=5.

n=3:81 mod11=4.

n=4:256 mod11. 11*23=253, 256-253=3.

n=5:625 mod11. 11*56=616, 625-616=9.

n=6:1296 mod11. 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9.

n=7:2401 mod11. 11*218=2398, 2401-2398=3.

n=8:4096 mod11. 11*372=4092, 4096-4092=4.

n=9:6561 mod11. 11*596=6556, 6561-6556=5.

n=10:10000 mod11. 11*909=9999, 10000-9999=1.

So n⁴ mod11 gives: 1,5,4,3,9,9,3,4,5,1. So -1 mod11 is 10. Doesn't appear. So p=11 doesn't work.

Next prime is 13.

Check modulo13.

n⁴ ≡-1 mod13. -1 mod13 is 12.

Compute n⁴ mod13 for n=1-12.

n=1:1.

n=2:16 mod13=3.

n=3:81 mod13= 81-6*13=81-78=3.

n=4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9.

n=5:625 mod13. 13*48=624, 625-624=1.

n=6:1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

n=7:2401 mod13. Let me compute 7²=49, 49 mod13=10. So 7⁴=(7²)²=10²=100 mod13=9.

n=8:8²=64 mod13=12. So 8⁴=(8²)²=12²=144 mod13=1.

n=9:9²=81 mod13=3, so 9⁴=3²=9.

n=10:10²=100 mod13=9, 10⁴=9²=81 mod13=3.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each step.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute n⁴ mod13.

n=1:1.

n=2:2⁴=16 mod13=3.

n=3:3⁴=81 mod13=3.

n=4:4⁴=256 mod13=256 - 19*13=256-247=9.

n=5:5⁴=625 mod13=625 - 48*13=625-624=1.

n=6:6⁴=1296 mod13: 1296 - 99*13=1296-1287=9.

n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401 /13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9.

n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 mod13: 13*315=4095, 4096-4095=1.

n=9:9⁴=6561. 6561 mod13: Let's compute 9²=81 mod13=3, so 9⁴=3²=9.

n=10:10⁴=10000 mod13. 10²=100 mod13=9, so 10⁴=9²=81 mod13=3.

n=11:11²=121 mod13=4, so 11⁴=4²=16 mod13=3.

n=12:12²=144 mod13=1, so 12⁴=1²=1.

So n⁴ mod13: 1,3,3,9,1,9,9,1,9,3,3,1.

Looking for 12 mod13. Doesn't appear. So p=13 doesn't work.

Hmm, this is getting time-consuming. Maybe I should think of a better approach.

I remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue
