Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me see what information I have. The triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of the circumcenter and incenter. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's equidistant from all three vertices, which is the circumradius, 13 in this case. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all three sides, with that distance being the inradius, which is 6.

It's also given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry? Or perhaps there's a relation involving distances or trigonometric identities.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

\(OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)}\)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Plugging in the given values:

\(OI = \sqrt{13(13 - 2*6)} = \sqrt{13*(13 -12)} = \sqrt{13*1} = \sqrt{13}\)

So OI is √13.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle formed by points I, O, and A is a right-angled triangle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:

\(OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2\)

I know OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So,

\(13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2\)

Calculating that:

169 = 13 + IA^2

So IA^2 = 169 -13 = 156

Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Hmm, sqrt(156) can be simplified. Let me see, 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39.

Okay, so IA is 2√39. I need to connect this to the sides of the triangle, specifically AB and AC. Maybe I can find a relation that involves IA and the sides AB and AC.

I recall that the length of the inradius can be expressed in terms of the area and the semi-perimeter. The formula is:

\( r = \frac{A}{s} \)

Where A is the area, and s is the semi-perimeter. Given that r is 6, so:

\( 6 = \frac{A}{s} \) => A = 6s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius as well. The formula is:

\( A = \frac{a b c}{4 R} \)

Where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and R is 13. So,

A = (a b c) / (4*13) = (a b c)/52.

But I also know A = 6s. So,

6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 6s *52 => a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, I don't know if that's directly helpful, but let's keep that in mind.

I also remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula:

\( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \)

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, I think that's correct. The inradius is r, and the distance from the incenter to vertex A is related to the ex-radius or something. Let me confirm.

Wait, actually, the formula is:

\( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \)

Where s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC. So, in this case, IA is 2√39, so:

\( (2√39)^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \)

Calculating:

156 = 6^2 + (s - a)^2

156 = 36 + (s - a)^2

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 -36 = 120

Therefore, s - a = sqrt(120). Simplify sqrt(120): sqrt(4*30) = 2*sqrt(30). So,

s - a = 2√30.

Wait, but s is the semi-perimeter, so (a + b + c)/2 = s. So, s - a = (b + c - a)/2. So,

(b + c - a)/2 = 2√30 => b + c - a = 4√30.

Hmm, okay. So I have an equation relating sides a, b, c.

I also know that in the triangle, a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. So, the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is opposite angle A, which is BC, b is opposite angle B, which is AC, and c is opposite angle C, which is AB.

So, in that case, the equation is:

b + c - a = 4√30.

So, equation (1): b + c - a = 4√30.

Also, from the area expressions, I have A = 6s and A = (a b c)/52. So, 6s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.

But s is (a + b + c)/2. So, a b c = 312*(a + b + c)/2 = 156*(a + b + c).

Hmm, equation (2): a b c = 156*(a + b + c).

I also know that in any triangle, the area can be expressed as r*s, which is 6s, as earlier.

Additionally, there's the formula for the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A) = b/(2 sin B) = c/(2 sin C). So, since R is 13, we have:

a = 2 R sin A = 26 sin A,

b = 26 sin B,

c = 26 sin C.

So, all sides can be expressed in terms of the sines of their opposite angles.

Hmm, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is π, so A + B + C = π.

But I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful. Let me think of other relations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumradius, but I already used that to find OI.

Wait, another thought: in triangle ABC, the distance from incenter I to vertex A is IA = 2√39, which I have found. So, maybe I can relate IA to other elements of the triangle.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me try to recall the formula.

I think it's something like IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me derive it. In triangle AII_A, where I_A is the excenter opposite A, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we have:

OA = 13, OI = √13, IA = 2√39.

Wait, but triangle AIO is right-angled at I, so:

OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2.

Which we already did, so that gives us nothing new. But perhaps we can find angles in this triangle.

Wait, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, perhaps we can find the angles at O and A.

Using trigonometry, perhaps.

In triangle AIO, cos(theta) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Let's see, the angle at O would be between OA and OI.

So, in triangle AIO, the angle at O is adjacent side OI = √13, hypotenuse OA =13. So,

cos(theta) = OI / OA = √13 / 13 = 1/√13.

So, theta = arccos(1/√13). That's the angle at O.

Similarly, the angle at A in triangle AIO would be between OA and IA.

The adjacent side there is IA = 2√39, but wait, triangle AIO sides are OI=√13, IA=2√39, OA=13.

Wait, maybe it's better to use
