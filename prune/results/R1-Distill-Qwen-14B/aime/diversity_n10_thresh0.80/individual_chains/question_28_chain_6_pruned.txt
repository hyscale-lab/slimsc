Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron, ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm, so the point I is equidistant from all four faces. That point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So, my plan is to first find the volume V of the tetrahedron, then find the total surface area S, and then compute r = 3V / S.

But to find V, I need more information about the tetrahedron. Since the edge lengths are given, maybe it's a regular tetrahedron? Wait, no, because the edges are given in pairs, not all equal. So it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron, maybe isohedral? Or maybe it's a tetrahedron whose opposite edges are equal, which might make it a "kite tetrahedron" or something.

Wait, in any case, to find the volume, perhaps I can compute it using the coordinates of the vertices. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the points in 3D space and calculate the volume using the scalar triple product.

Yes, that's a good approach. So I need to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let me try to place the tetrahedron in 3D space in a symmetric way. Let's assume that points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the edges AB and CD are equal, AC and BD are equal, and AD and BC are equal. So perhaps I can place the points in a way that reflects this symmetry.

Let me consider placing point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This kind of symmetric placement might make the edge lengths symmetric as given.

Wait, this might help. Let me try to compute the distances between these points.

Compute AB: distance between A(x,y,z) and B(-x,-y,z). So AB^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2 = 4x² + 4y². Given AB = sqrt(41), so AB² =41=4x² +4y².

Similarly, compute
