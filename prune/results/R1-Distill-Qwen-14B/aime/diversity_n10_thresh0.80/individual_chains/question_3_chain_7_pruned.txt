Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, I need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize.

First, let's understand the total number of possible ways for 4 numbers to be chosen from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me calculate that. C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible 4-number combinations.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers, so her combination is one specific set of 4 numbers. Let's denote her chosen numbers as J = {a, b, c, d}, which is a specific 4-element subset of S.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that the randomly chosen 4 numbers are exactly J. That's 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, let's find the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, the event of winning a prize includes two cases: exactly two of her numbers are chosen, exactly three are chosen, or all four are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to calculate the complement: the probability of not winning a prize is the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(B) = Probability of winning a prize = 1 - Probability of not winning a prize.

Let me compute the number of ways where zero of her numbers are chosen. That means all four chosen numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, that's C(6,4) = 15.

Similarly, the number of ways where exactly one of her numbers is chosen: choose 1 from her 4 numbers, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of ways where she doesn't win a prize is 15 (zero matches) + 80 (one match) = 95.

Thus, the number of ways where she wins a prize (at least two matches) is total possible combinations minus 95, which is 210 - 95 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115.

Now, the number of favorable outcomes for event A ∩ B is just the number of ways she can win the grand prize, which is 1 (since only her exact set of four numbers would satisfy both winning the grand prize and winning a prize). Wait, actually, in this case, event A is a subset of event B because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize. So, A ∩ B is just A, which has probability 1/210.

Wait, but when we're talking about the count, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1 (only one specific combination), so the number for A ∩ B is also 1.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1) / (115) = 1/115.

Wait, but let me double-check. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B), right? Because A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is equal to P(A), which is 1/210. P(B) is 115/210.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/
