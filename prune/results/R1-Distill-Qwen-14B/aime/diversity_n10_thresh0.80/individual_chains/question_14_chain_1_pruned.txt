Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. I need to find the greatest such N.

Let me think about how changing each digit affects the number's divisibility by 7. Maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) and figure out what each digit must be so that replacing it with 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, changing each digit to 1 one at a time, we get four new numbers:

1. A1CD
2. AB1D
3. ABC1
4. Changing the thousands digit: 1BCD (but wait, if A is 1, the number is 1BCD, but since N is a four-digit number, A can't be 0. So when we change A to 1, we have to make sure that if A was originally something else, making it 1 still keeps it a four-digit number, which it will since 1BCD is four digits even if A was 9 before. But wait, actually, this might not matter as 1 is less than A if A was 9, but in this case, we have to consider all possibilities.)

So, each of these four numbers (A1CD, AB1D, ABC1, 1BCD) must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, replacing that digit with 1 gives a multiple of 7.

I need to find ABCD such that:

1. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7

Since we want the greatest such N, we should aim for the largest possible A, then B, then C, then D.

Maybe I can start by considering the thousands digit. If we change A to 1, what does that mean? So, 1BCD must be divisible by 7. Since we're trying to maximize N, A is likely to be 9. But wait, if we change A to 1, then 1BCD must be divisible by 7. Let's see:

Suppose A is 9. Then 1BCD must be divisible by 7. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7. Similarly, if A is 9, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which should be a multiple of 7.

Alternatively, maybe A is smaller. Hmm, perhaps not. Let's think step by step.

Let me consider each condition one by one.

First, let's think about the thousands digit. The number when changing A to 1 is 1BCD. Let me represent this as 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Since this must be divisible by 7, this gives:

1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, when changing the hundreds digit B to 1, the number becomes A1CD, which is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. That must be divisible by 7:

1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

When changing the tens digit C to 1, the number becomes AB1D, which is 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. So,

1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

When changing the units digit D to 1, the number becomes ABC1, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. So,

1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

And finally, the original number ABCD must satisfy all four conditions.

Wait, but actually, ABCD itself can be any number, but changing any digit to 1 must make it divisible by 7. So, ABCD itself might not be divisible by 7, but all four modified numbers are.

So, I have four congruence conditions:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me compute each of these modulo 7 to simplify them.

First, 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 ÷ 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So let's rewrite each condition:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So now, I have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (2)

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (3)

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. → Equation (4)

Now, I need to solve these four equations with A, B, C, D as digits (0-9, with A≠0).

This seems complicated, but maybe I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me try subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6A + 2 + 3C + D -6 -2B -3C - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

6A -2B -4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A -2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

Let me write this as:

6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7. → Let's call this Equation (5).

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6A + 2 + 3C + D -6A -2B -3 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

(-2B + 3C -1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, -2B + 3C ≡ 1 mod 7.

Let me write this as:

3C - 2B ≡ 1 mod 7. → Equation (6).

Now, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6A + 2B + 3 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6A + 2B + 3C +1 -6A -2B -3 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

3C - D -2 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7. → Equation (7).

Similarly, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B + 3C +1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify:

6A + 2B + 3C +1 -6 -2B -3C - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Simplify terms:

6A -5 - D ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, 6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7. → Equation (8).

Now, let's summarize the equations we have:

Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

Equation (6): 3C - 2B ≡ 1 mod 7.

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Equation (8): 6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7.

So, let's see if we can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (5): 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

We can write 6A ≡ 2B +4 mod 7.

Similarly, since 6 ≡ 6 mod7, and 2 is 2 mod7.

We can divide both sides by 2, but wait, 2 and 7 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse mod7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides by 4:

(6A)*4 ≡ (2B +4)*4 mod7.

Which is 24A ≡ 8B +16 mod7.

24 mod7 is 3 (since 7*3=21, 24-21=3).

8 mod7 is 1, 16 mod7 is 2 (since 7*2=14, 16-14=2).

So, 3A ≡ B + 2 mod7.

Thus, Equation (5a): 3A ≡ B +2 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation (6): 3C - 2B ≡1 mod7.

Let me see if I can express B in terms of A.

From Equation (5a): B ≡ 3A -2 mod7.

So, B = 3A -2 +7k, where k is some integer (0 or 1, since B is a digit from 0-9).

But since B is a digit, 0 ≤ B ≤9, so 3A -2 must be within 0 to 9, or 3A -2 can be negative, but B can't be negative, so perhaps we can handle that with the modulus.

Wait, but mod7, so let's see:

From Equation (5a): B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So, B can be written as B = 3A -2 +7m, where m is an integer such that B remains between 0 and9.

Similarly, now, in Equation (6): 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute B from Equation (5a):

3C -2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

3C -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

So, 3C -6A ≡ -3 mod7.

Which is 3C -6A ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

We can factor this as 3(C - 2A) ≡4 mod7.

Hmm, but 3 and 7 are coprime, so multiply both sides by 5 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7):

(3(C -2A))*5 ≡4*5 mod7.

Which gives (C -2A) ≡20 mod7.

20 mod7 is 6, since 7*2=14, 20-14=6.

So, C -2A ≡6 mod7.

Thus, C ≡2A +6 mod7.

Since C is a digit (0-9), C can be expressed as C=2A +6 +7n, where n is an integer such that C remains between 0 and9.

Similarly, let's look at Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

And Equation (8):6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Let me solve Equation (8) for D:

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, D=6A -5 +7p, where p is an integer such that D is between 0 and9.

Now, let's substitute C into Equation (7):

3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Substituting C=2A +6 +7n:

3*(2A +6 +7n) - D ≡2 mod7.

Which is 6A +18 +21n - D ≡2 mod7.

But 6A - D is from Equation (8): 6A - D ≡5 mod7, so 6A - D=5 +7p.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me express D from Equation (8):

D=6A -5 mod7.

So, 6A -5 ≡ D mod7.

Thus, 3C - D ≡3C - (6A -5) ≡3C -6A +5 ≡2 mod7.

So, 3C -6A +5 ≡2 mod7.

Which simplifies to 3C -6A ≡-3 mod7 → 3C -6A ≡4 mod7.

But from earlier, we had 3C -6A ≡4 mod7 from Equation (6) substitution.

So, that's consistent. So, no new info here.

So, moving on.

We have:

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

C ≡2A +6 mod7.

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, now, let's express B, C, D in terms of A.

Let me write:

B = (3A -2) mod7.

But since B is a digit (0-9), possible values of B are (3A -2) +7k, where k is 0 or 1, such that B remains between 0 and9.

Similarly, C = (2A +6) mod7.

So, C can be (2A +6) +7m, where m is 0 or1, to keep C <=9.

D = (6A -5) mod7.

So, D can be (6A -5) +7p, where p is 0,1, or 2, to keep D between 0 and9.

Now, since we want the greatest possible four-digit number, we should maximize A first. So, let's try A=9 and see if we can get valid digits for B, C, D.

Case 1: A=9.

Compute B:

B ≡3*9 -2 mod7 → 27 -2=25 →25 mod7 is 4 (since 7*3=21, 25-21=4). So, B≡4 mod7.

So, B can be 4 or 4+7=11, but since B is a digit, B=4 or 11. But 11 is not a digit, so B=4.

Next, C ≡2*9 +6 mod7 →18 +6=24→24 mod7 is 3 (7*3=21, 24-21=3). So, C=3 or 3+7=10. But C must be a digit, so C=3.

D ≡6*9 -5 mod7→54-5=49→49 mod7=0. So, D=0 or 0+7=7, or 0+14=14 (invalid). So, D can be 0 or7.

Now, let's check if these satisfy the original four conditions.

So, A=9, B=4, C=3, D is either 0 or7.

Let me test D=7 first because we want the largest possible N, so D=7 is better.

So, N would be 9437.

Now, let's check if changing each digit
