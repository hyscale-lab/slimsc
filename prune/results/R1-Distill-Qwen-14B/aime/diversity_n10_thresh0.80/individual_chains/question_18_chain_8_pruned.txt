Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) with each side of the rectangle lying on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. Now, the problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of these rectangles are either edges of the dodecagon or the diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

I remember that in regular polygons, diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 vertices. Since it's a 12-gon, skipping 6 vertices would take you to the opposite vertex, which would be the longest diagonal, effectively the diameter of the circumscribed circle.

But wait, for a rectangle to form, the sides must be pairs of parallel lines. In a regular dodecagon, sides are all parallel to each other in certain directions, and so are the diagonals. So, the key is to find pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. The other two sides would then be formed by lines that connect these pairs, again either sides or diagonals.

So, the approach might be to count all possible pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon and then determine how they can intersect to form rectangles. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the vertices and how they can be connected to form rectangles.

Let me think about the vertices. A regular dodecagon has 12 vertices. Let's label them V0, V1, V2, ..., V11 in order around the polygon. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle.

In order to form a rectangle, I need to select four vertices such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle. But in a regular dodecagon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of vertices that are symmetric
