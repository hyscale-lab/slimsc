Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. I'm given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the ex-pole or the external homothety center? Wait, tangents from D to ω touch at B and C, so D lies on the external tangent line.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the external homothety center, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key property is that DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, so DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Now, since AD intersects ω again at P, I need to find AP. So maybe I can use power of a point or something related to intersecting chords. Let's think about power of point D with respect to ω.

Power of D: since DB and DC are tangents, the power of D is DB² = DC². Also, AD * DP = DB². Hmm, that seems useful. So if I can find DB, then I can express AD * DP in terms of DB², but I don't know AD or DP yet.

Wait, but I know the lengths of the sides of triangle ABC. Maybe I can find some properties related to triangle ABC, like its circumradius, which might help in computing DB.

Let me recall the formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC: R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So first, let's compute the area of triangle ABC. The sides are 5, 9, 10. Let's use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s is (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504]. Let's simplify that. 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, but wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't helpful. Let me factor 504: 504 = 8 * 63 =
