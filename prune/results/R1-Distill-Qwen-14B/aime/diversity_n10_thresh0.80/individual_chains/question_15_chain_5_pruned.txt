Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, with a length of 16. Each step must be along the grid lines, so either right or up. The catch is that the path must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that's interesting.

First, I remember that in a grid path problem, the number of paths without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient. For an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The number of such paths is C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem adds a constraint about changing direction exactly four times. So I can't just use the standard combination formula here.

Changing direction exactly four times... Let me think. Each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So a path with four direction changes would have five segments of consecutive steps in the same direction. Wait, is that right? Let me see. If you start moving right, then change direction to up, and so on. Each change adds a new segment. So four changes would create five segments. But wait, the starting direction is either right or up. Let me clarify that.

Actually, the first step can be either right or up. So depending on that, the number of direction changes would vary. For example, if the first segment is all rights, then the next is all ups, etc. So if the number of direction changes is four, then there are five segments in total. Each segment alternates direction.

But wait, the problem is on an 8x8 grid, meaning you have to make 8 right moves and 8 up moves. So each path has exactly 16 steps, 8 rights and 8 ups. The direction changes determine how these steps are grouped into consecutive segments.

So, for a path that changes direction exactly four times, it must consist of five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of either right or up steps. Since it starts with either right or up, the segments will alternate.

But wait, can it start with right or up? Let me think. The starting direction can be either, so we might have to consider both cases. But maybe the count will be symmetric, so we can compute it for one starting direction and then double it, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, no. Because if the starting direction is right, the segments will be right, up, right, up, etc., ending with either right or up depending on the number of segments. Similarly, starting with up, the segments alternate.

But since we have five segments, which is odd, the starting and ending directions will be the same. Because five is odd, so the first and fifth segments will be the same direction. Let's see: starting right, segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So the path ends with a right segment. But in our grid, the final step must be moving to the upper right corner, which requires that the last step is either right or up, but the path as a whole must cover exactly 8 rights and 8 ups.

Wait, but if the path starts with right and has five segments, the number of right segments would be three (positions 1,3,5) and up segments two (positions 2,4). Alternatively, if it starts with up, it would have three up segments and two right segments. But wait, since the path has to have 8 rights and 8 ups, the number of right segments and up segments must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, suppose the starting direction is right. So the segments are R, U, R, U, R. There are three R segments and two U segments. The sum of all R steps must be 8, and the sum of all U steps must be 8. Similarly, if starting with U, the path would be U, R, U, R, U, with three U segments and two R segments.

So, let's formalize this. Let me denote the starting direction as R or U. For each case, we have 5 segments, with either 3 R segments and 2 U segments (if starting with R) or 3 U segments and 2 R segments (if starting with U).

The key idea is that each of these segments must consist of at least 1 step, because you can't have a segment of zero length. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a direction change.

So, for starting with R, we have three R segments, each at least 1 step, and two U segments, each at least 1 step. The total R steps must sum to 8, and the total U steps must sum to 8.

This is a classic stars and bars problem. The number of ways to distribute 8 R steps into 3 segments, each at least 1, is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, distributing 8 U steps into 2 segments, each at least 1, is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So for starting with R, the number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for starting with U, we have three U segments and two R segments. The number of ways would be the same: 21 ways to distribute U steps and 7 ways to distribute R steps, so 21 *7 =147.

So total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Is this correct? Let me double-check.

Each path must change direction exactly four times. So each path has five segments. The starting direction can be R or U.

If starting with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R.

Each R segment must have at least 1 step, and each U segment must have at least 1 step.

So for R segments, we have 3 segments: let me denote their lengths as r1, r2, r3, each ≥1, and r1 + r2 + r3 =8.

Similarly, for U segments, u1, u2, each ≥1, and u1 +u2 =8.

Number of solutions is C(7,2) for R and C(7,1) for U, so 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, we have three U segments and two R segments.

So, u1 +u2 +u3=8, each ≥1: C(7,2)=21.

And r1 +r2=8, each ≥1: C(7,1)=7.

So 21*7=147.

Total paths: 147 +147=294.

Hmm, so that's 294.

But wait, are there any other cases? Or is this comprehensive?

Wait, another way to think about it: the number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of rights or ups.

Each run must be at least length 1.

The number of such paths can be calculated using the formula for the number of compositions.

The number of compositions of 8 into k parts is C(8-1,k-1).

So, for starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs.

Number of ways: C(7,2) for R and C(7,1) for U.

Multiply them, as the distributions are independent.

Similarly for starting with U.

So, yes, 294 is the total.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the standard approach for number of paths with given number of direction changes is C(n-1, k) * C(m-1, l)... but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of it as arranging the runs.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of monotonic paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(n, k+1) where n is the number of something? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another way: the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches from right to up or up to right. Each time it switches, it's a direction change.

So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus 1.

Wait, if we have five runs, then the number of direction changes is four.

Since the starting direction is either R or U, and the runs alternate.

So, the number of ways to have five runs is 2 * (number of ways to distribute R steps into 3 runs and U steps into 2 runs).

Which is 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1))= 2*(21*7)=294.

So, that seems correct.

But let me think of a small grid to test this.

For example, consider a 1x1 grid, moving from (0,0) to (1,1). The possible paths are right
