Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis, but not as far as (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis at some point P(p, 0) and ending on the y-axis at Q(0, q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

We need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any of these segments PQ except for AB itself. Then, we have to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

First, let's visualize AB. Points A and B are both in the first quadrant, so AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, using point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1. Then, when t=0, we're at A (1/2, 0), and when t=1, we're at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, parametric equations:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, point C is ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, our goal is to find such a point C that isn't on any segment PQ in F except for AB itself. That is, for any other segment PQ in F, point C should not lie on PQ.

So, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, except for AB, it must be that for all other PQ in F, the point C isn't on PQ. Alternatively, C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

Wait, but AB is itself a segment in F? Let's check. AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the length of AB to see if it's 1.

Distance AB: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is indeed a segment in F. So, C is on AB, which is one of the segments in F, but shouldn't be on any other.

So, we need to find a point C on AB such that there is no other segment PQ in F where C is on PQ.

So, we can think of this as: for point C on AB, we need that there's no other PQ in F (other than AB) that passes through C.

So, we need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Hmm, another way to think about this: if we consider all PQ segments in F, each PQ is a line from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1 (since the length is 1). So, each such segment lies on the line x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, for each (p, q) with p^2 + q^2 =1, the line x/p + y/q =1 is a segment PQ in F.

Now, point C lies on AB, so its coordinates are ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t in (0,1). So, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, except for AB, the line PQ must not pass through C unless PQ is AB itself.

So, let's find the conditions under which the line x/p + y/q =1 passes through point C, and then ensure that this only happens when (p, q) corresponds to AB.

So, substituting C's coordinates into the equation x/p + y/q =1:

( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q =1.

But since for each PQ, p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, for point C, this equation must not hold for any p and q except when PQ is AB.

Wait, but any point C on AB lies on AB's segment, which is one of the F segments. So, we need that for all other (p, q) with p^2 + q^2=1, the equation above is not satisfied.

But how do we find such a C?

Alternatively, perhaps C is such that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of all other PQ segments in F. That is, AB is tangent to the envelope, so C is the point of tangency.

Wait, that might be a possible approach. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then C is the unique point where AB touches the envelope, and thus, for all other PQ segments, C is not on them.

So, perhaps we should find the envelope of the family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2=1.

What's the envelope of this family?

The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

To find the envelope, we can use the method where we solve
