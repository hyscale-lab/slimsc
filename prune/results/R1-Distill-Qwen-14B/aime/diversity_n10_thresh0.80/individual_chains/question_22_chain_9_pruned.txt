Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal. That makes me think it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all sides equal, but in this case, it says it's equilateral, so wait, does that mean all sides are equal? Yes, equilateral usually means all sides are equal, but in a hexagon, it can be non-regular if the angles are different. But in this case, since all opposite sides are parallel, it's probably a special kind of hexagon.

Wait, the problem says it's a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. So each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel. So it's like a 3D shape but on 2D. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but extended in some way.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, 300. So AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, and when extended, they form a triangle. Let me think, how do these extensions form a triangle? I suppose if we extend AB beyond B and A, CD beyond D and C, and EF beyond F and E, these extended lines will meet at some points forming a larger triangle.

Wait, that might not be precise. Let me try to draw this mentally. If you have a convex hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA as sides. Since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA? Wait, no, the pairs of opposite sides would be AB opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Wait, maybe I got the pairs wrong. Wait, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be two sides that are three apart. So AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA. Yeah, that seems right.

But in the problem, the triangle is formed by extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Hmm, so the sides AB, CD, EF are extended beyond their respective vertices until they meet to form a triangle. So, for example, extending AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. These lines will intersect each other, forming a triangle.

The lengths of this triangle are given as 200, 240, 300. Let's denote the triangle as XYZ, where X is the intersection of AB and CD's extensions, Y is the intersection of CD and EF's extensions, and Z is the intersection of EF and AB's extensions. So the sides of triangle XYZ are XY=200, YZ=240, and ZX=300.

I need to find the side length of the hexagon, which is AB=BC=CD=DE=EF=FA, since it's equilateral.

Since the hexagon is convex and all opposite sides are parallel, it must be a special case of a hexagon that can be inscribed in a triangle, perhaps similar to how a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle. Wait, no, but in this case, maybe it's affine-regular or something.

Wait, maybe I should think about similar triangles. Because when the sides of the hexagon are extended, the resulting triangle is larger, and the hexagon itself is a sort of truncated version of this triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a concept similar to the triangle midline theorem, where the hexagon's sides are midlines of the triangle, but in this case, the hexagon is equilateral and the triangle is not necessarily regular.

Wait, but here's another thought: If all opposite sides are parallel, then the hexagon can be considered as a
