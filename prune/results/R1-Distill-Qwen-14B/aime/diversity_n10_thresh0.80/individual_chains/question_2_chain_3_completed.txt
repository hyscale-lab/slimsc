Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a triangle, I think. The problem mentions the family of segments PQ which are of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each PQ, P is somewhere on the x-axis, Q is somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, all these segments are in the first quadrant, connecting points on the axes, and each has length 1.

Now, the family F consists of all such PQ segments. The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is a point on AB, but not on any other PQ in F. And we're supposed to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then find p + q.

First, let me visualize this. We have the coordinate plane, first quadrant. Points O, A, and B form a triangle, probably a 30-60-90 triangle because the coordinates of A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), which are reminiscent of the unit circle points at 60 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively. Wait, actually, if you think of OA as 1/2, OB as sqrt(3)/2, then OA^2 + OB^2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so OA and OB are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse 1. So, the triangle OAB is a right triangle with right angle at O.

Wait, no, hold on. If O is (0,0), A is (1/2, 0), and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), then the triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA = 1/2 and OB = sqrt(3)/2. The hypotenuse AB would then have length sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is of unit length.

Wait, so AB is a segment of unit length, just like all the PQ segments in F. So, AB is actually a member of F. So, the family F includes AB as one of the segments.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that isn't on any other segment from F. So, all other points on AB except C are on some other PQ segments in F, but C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

So, how do I approach this? Let's think.

First, I need to parametrize the segments PQ in F. Since each PQ has unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, we can represent each such segment.

Let me denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers. Since PQ is a segment of unit length, the distance between P and Q must be 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, for every pair (p, q) such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, we have a segment PQ from (p,0) to (0,q).

Now, the family F consists of all such segments.

We need to find point C on AB such that C is not on any PQ in F except for AB itself. So, for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, how can I find such a point C?

Hmm. Maybe I can model the equation of a segment PQ in F and then find the conditions where C is not on any of these PQ except AB.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the envelope of all these segments PQ, and see where AB intersects this envelope. Or maybe find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which would make it the unique point C that's only on AB and not on any other PQ.

Wait, that might be a good approach. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. If the family of segments PQ form a kind of envelope, then the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope, making it the only point on AB that touches the envelope. Thus, C would not lie on any other PQ.

So, perhaps I should find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

But how do I find the envelope of these line segments PQ? Each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Alternatively, each line PQ can be represented as a linear equation. Let me find the equation of the line PQ for a given p and q.

The line PQ connects (p, 0) to (0, q). The slope of this line is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). But since p and q are positive (they're in the first quadrant), we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, the equation of the line PQ can be written as y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

But perhaps it's better to parameterize the line in terms of a single parameter. Let's let t be a parameter such that p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), since p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), with theta in [0, pi/2].

Then, the equation of PQ is y = (-sin(theta)/cos(theta))x + sin(theta), which simplifies to y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta).

So, each line in F can be written as y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta), where theta is between 0 and pi/2.

Now, the envelope of this family of lines is found by solving the system:

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta),
0 = d/d theta [ -tan(theta) x + sin(theta) ]

The second equation is the derivative of the first with respect to theta, set to zero.

Let me compute that derivative.

First, express y as:

y(theta) = - (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) x + sin(theta)

So, dy/d theta = - [ (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)) / cos^2(theta) ] x + cos(theta)

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me compute it step by step.

dy/d theta = derivative of (-sin(theta)/cos(theta)) x + derivative of sin(theta)
= [ (cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)) / cos^2(theta) ) ] x + cos(theta)
Wait, no. Wait, derivative of (-sin(theta)/cos(theta)) is:

Let me compute derivative of (-sin(theta)/cos(theta)).

Let me denote f(theta) = -sin(theta)/cos(theta) = -tan(theta). So, f(theta) = -tan(theta). Then, derivative is -sec^2(theta).

So, dy/d theta = -sec^2(theta) x + cos(theta).

So, the derivative is:

dy/d theta = -x * (1 + tan^2(theta)) + cos(theta).

Wait, because sec^2(theta) = 1 + tan^2(theta), so dy/d theta = -x * (1 + tan^2(theta)) + cos(theta).

So, the envelope is found by solving:

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta),
-x (1 + tan^2(theta)) + cos(theta) = 0.

So, let's write the second equation:

- x (1 + tan^2(theta)) + cos(theta) = 0

We can write 1 + tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta) = 1 / cos^2(theta). So,

- x (1 / cos^2(theta)) + cos(theta) = 0

Multiply both sides by cos^2(theta) to eliminate the denominator:

- x + cos^3(theta) = 0

So, x = cos^3(theta)

Hmm, so from this, x = cos^3(theta). Let's substitute this back into the equation for y.

y = -tan(theta) x + sin(theta)

Replace x with cos^3(theta):

y = -tan(theta) * cos^3(theta) + sin(theta)

Simplify tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta):

y = - (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) * cos^3(theta) + sin(theta)
= - sin(theta) cos^2(theta) + sin(theta)
= sin(theta) (1 - cos^2(theta))
= sin(theta) * sin^2(theta)
= sin^3(theta)

So, the envelope is parametrized by:

x = cos^3(theta)
y = sin^3(theta)

This is the astroid curve. The envelope of all the segments PQ is an astroid.

So, the astroid is given parametrically by (cos^3(theta), sin^3(theta)).

Now, the point C is on AB, which is the segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, let's find the parametric equation of AB.

Since AB is a straight line between (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2), we can parametrize it as:

x = 1/2 - (1/2) * t
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) * t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, we can write it in terms of a parameter s:

x = (1/2)(1 - s)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) s

for s from 0 to 1.

So, any point on AB can be represented as ( (1 - s)/2 , (sqrt(3) s)/2 )

Now, we need to find the point C on AB that also lies on the astroid, except for the uniqueness condition. But wait, the astroid is the envelope of all PQ segments, so the astroid is the curve that is tangent to each PQ.

Since AB is one of the PQ segments (since AB is of unit length), the astroid is tangent to AB at some point, which is point C.

Thus, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, we need to find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

But wait, AB itself is a member of F, so the astroid is the envelope of F. So, the astroid touches each PQ in F at exactly one point. Since AB is in F, the astroid is tangent to AB at point C, which is the only point on AB that's on the astroid. All other points on AB are not on the astroid, meaning they lie on other PQ segments in F. Therefore, point C is the unique point on AB that is on the astroid and is only on AB and no other PQ.

So, to find C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

Alternatively, since we have the parametric equations for the astroid and for AB, we can find their intersection and impose the condition that they are tangent, so their derivatives at that point are equal.

Alternatively, since AB is a straight line, we can find where this line intersects the astroid, and ensure that they are tangent, which would give us the unique point C.

So, first, let's find the equation of AB.

Points A and B are (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. To find c, plug in point A: (1/2, 0).

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2.

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the astroid is defined parametrically as x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta). Let's write the equation of the astroid in Cartesian coordinates.

We have x = cos^3(theta) => cos(theta) = x^(1/3)
Similarly, y = sin^3(theta) => sin(theta) = y^(1/3)

We know that cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1, so:

(x^(1/3))^2 + (y^(1/3))^2 = 1
x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

So, the astroid is given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, we need to find the point C where the line AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, let's find the intersection points between AB and the astroid.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substitute this into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid by ensuring that there's exactly one solution to this equation. Alternatively, since the astroid is the envelope, AB is tangent at exactly one point, which is C.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the point C by solving the system where the line AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, to find the condition for tangency, the line AB must intersect the astroid at exactly one point, and their derivatives at that point must be equal.

But since the astroid is defined implicitly, maybe it's easier to parameterize it and find where the line intersects and the derivative matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the astroid and substitute into the line equation, then find where the system has a double root, meaning tangency.

Wait, perhaps using parametric derivatives would be better.

The astroid is x = cos^3(theta), y = sin^3(theta).

So, the derivative dy/dx for the astroid can be found by:

dy/dx = (dy/d theta) / (dx/d theta)

Compute dy/d theta and dx/d theta:

dx/d theta = 3 cos^2(theta) (-sin(theta)) = -3 cos^2(theta) sin(theta)
dy/d theta = 3 sin^2(theta) cos(theta)

So, dy/dx = [3 sin^2(theta) cos(theta)] / [ -3 cos^2(theta) sin(theta) ) ] = [sin(theta)/cos(theta)] * (-1) = -tan(theta)

So, the slope of the astroid at any point theta is -tan(theta).

Now, the line AB has a slope of -sqrt(3). So, for the astroid to be tangent to AB at point C, the slope of the astroid at C must be equal to the slope of AB.

Thus, -tan(theta) = -sqrt(3) => tan(theta) = sqrt(3) => theta = pi/3 (60 degrees).

So, theta is pi/3. So, the point C on the astroid is:

x = cos^3(pi/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8
y = sin^3(pi/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8

Wait, but let me compute that:

cos(pi/3) = 1/2, so cos^3(pi/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

sin(pi/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so sin^3(pi/3) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

But wait, we also have the line AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let's verify if this point lies on AB.

Plug x = 1/8 into AB's equation:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2
= (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8)
= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate of C. So, yes, point C is on AB and on the astroid, and the slope condition is satisfied.

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to compute OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C.

So,

OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2
= 1/64 + (9 * 3)/64
= 1/64 + 27/64
= 28/64
= 7/16.

So, OC^2 is 7/16, which is 7 over 16. So, p = 7, q = 16, and p + q = 23.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check that. Because when I computed the point C, I assumed that the astroid is the envelope and that AB is tangent to it at C. But wait, AB is itself a member of F, so the astroid is the envelope of F, and each PQ in F is tangent to the astroid at one point. So, AB is one such PQ, and it's tangent to the astroid at point C. So, point C is the only point on AB that is on the astroid, and hence, the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F besides AB itself. Therefore, point C is unique in that sense.

Wait, but when I calculated OC^2, I got 7/16, which seems to be correct.

Let me re-calculate OC^2:

x = 1/8, so x^2 = 1/64.

y = 3 sqrt(3)/8, so y^2 = (9 * 3)/64 = 27/64.

Adding them gives (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Yes, that's correct.

So, OC^2 is 7/16, so p = 7, q = 16, and p + q = 23.

Wait, but I want to make sure that point C is indeed the unique point on AB not lying on any other PQ in F. Since the astroid is the envelope of all PQs, and each PQ is tangent to the astroid. So, AB is one of those PQs, and it's tangent to the astroid at C. Therefore, any other point on AB would lie inside the astroid, but since all other PQs are tangent to the astroid elsewhere, those points would lie on other PQs. Therefore, C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F, which is AB itself. So, C is indeed the unique point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB.

Therefore, my conclusion is that OC^2 is 7/16, so the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.


To solve the problem, we first note that the points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \) form a right triangle with hypotenuse \( AB \) of unit length. The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis. 

Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) can be parameterized as \( P(p, 0) \) and \( Q(0, q) \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \). The equation of the line \( \overline{PQ} \) is \( y = -\frac{q}{p}x + q \). By expressing \( p \) and \( q \) in terms of an angle \( \theta \), we find that the envelope of these lines forms an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

The line \( AB \) has the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). To find the unique point \( C \) where \( AB \) is tangent to the astroid, we compute the parametric equations of the astroid and its derivative. Setting the slope of the astroid equal to the slope of \( AB \), we find \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \). Substituting this into the astroid's parametric equations, we find \( C \) at \( \left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \).

Finally, we calculate \( OC^2 \) as:
\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), giving \( p + q = 23 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
