Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let's unpack what a b-eautiful number is. 

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

So, I need to find the minimal base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let me try to model this mathematically.

First, let's represent the two-digit number in base b. If a number n has exactly two digits in base b, it can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, this is:

a + c = √(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c

Let's rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or rearrange terms. Let's see:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps I can find integer solutions a and c for each base b.

Let me think about how to approach this. For a given base b, I can iterate over possible c values (from 0 to b-1) and solve for a. If the quadratic equation in a yields an integer solution within the valid range, then (a, c) is a valid pair, and n = a*b + c is b-eautiful.

So, the strategy could be:
1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, check for how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation.
2. The first b where the number of such pairs exceeds 10 is our answer.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b, I need to find the smallest b where this count is more than 10. So, I can increment b from 2 upwards and compute the number of valid (a, c) pairs for each until I find the first b with more than 10.

But doing this manually for each b might be time-consuming, so maybe I can find a pattern or a formula.

Let's rewrite the quadratic equation:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

For each c, this is a quadratic in a. The solutions are:

a = [-(2c - b) ± sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c^2 - c))]/2

Simplify the discriminant:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c^2 - c)
= 4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c
= (-4b c) + b^2 +4c

So,

a = [b - 2c ± sqrt(b^2 -4b c +4c)] / 2

Hmm, since a must be a positive integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square, and the entire expression must result in an integer a between 1 and b-1.

This seems a bit complex. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me denote s = a + c. Then, the condition is s = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a*b + c). So,

s^2 = a*b + c

But s = a + c, so substituting:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Which is the same equation as before.

Expanding:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a b + c

Rearranged:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can express this equation as:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + c(c - 1) = 0

Alternatively, maybe I can consider c as a function of a or vice versa. Let me try to express c in terms of a.

From s = a + c, and s^2 = a b + c, substituting s:

(a + c)^2 = a b + c

Let me expand the left side:

a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 = a b + c

Rearranged:

a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor terms with c:

a^2 - a b + c(2a + c - 1) = 0

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this equation differently.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

a^2 - a b + 2 a c + c^2 - c = 0

Which is:

a(a - b + 2c) + c(c - 1) = 0

Hmm, not seeing a clear path. Maybe, instead, for each b, I can iterate over possible c values and solve for a, checking if a is an integer within the required range.

Let me outline the steps for a particular base b:

1. For each c in 0 to b-1:
   a. The equation becomes a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0
   b. Solve for a using quadratic formula.
   c. Check if discriminant is a perfect square and a is an integer in [1, b-1].

But this seems tedious. Maybe I can find a relationship between a and c.

Let me denote c as k, so for each k from 0 to b-1, I can find a in terms of k.

Let me rearrange the equation:

a^2 + (2k - b)a + (k^2 - k) = 0

This quadratic in a can be solved as:

a = [ (b - 2k) ± sqrt( (2k - b)^2 - 4*(k^2 - k) ) ] / 2

Simplify the discriminant:

D = (2k - b)^2 - 4(k^2 -k)
= 4k^2 -4b k + b^2 -4k^2 +4k
= b^2 -4b k +4k

So, D = b^2 -4b k +4k

Hmm, for a to be integer, D must be a perfect square. Let me denote D = m^2, where m is an integer.

So:

b^2 -4b k +4k = m^2

This is a diophantine equation in variables b, k, m.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange it:

b^2 -4b k +4k - m^2 = 0

Alternatively, think of it as:

b^2 -4k b + (4k - m^2) = 0

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's think of D as:

D = b^2 -4b k +4k = m^2

Let me factor this as:

D = b^2 -4k(b -1) = m^2

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor:

b^2 -4k b +4k = m^2

Let me see, perhaps group terms:

b^2 -4k b = m^2 -4k

Hmm, not helpful. Maybe complete the square for b:

b^2 -4k b = (b - 2k)^2 -4k^2

So,

(b - 2k)^2 -4k^2 +4k = m^2

Which is:

(b - 2k)^2 = m^2 +4k^2 -4k

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps write:

(b - 2k)^2 = m^2 + 4k(k - 1)

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps think of D = (b - 2k)^2 - (2k)^2 +4k.

Wait, let's see:

D = b^2 -4b k +4k = (b^2 -4b k +4k^2) -4k^2 +4k = (b -2k)^2 -4k(k -1)

So,

D = (b -2k)^2 -4k(k -1)

Hmm, but D must be a perfect square, say m^2.

Thus,

(b -2k)^2 -4k(k -1) = m^2

Which can be written as:

(b -2k)^2 - m^2 =4k(k -1)

Factor the left side as
