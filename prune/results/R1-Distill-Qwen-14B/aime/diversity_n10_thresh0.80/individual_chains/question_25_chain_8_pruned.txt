Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because it involves sets and maybe some inclusion-exclusion principles. Hmm, I remember something about Venn diagrams and overlapping sets from my math class. Let me think.

Alright, the problem states that there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, there are four items in total that they can own: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and the candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, the candy hearts are a separate thing. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts, and possibly some combination of the other three items.

Wait, no, actually, I should read the problem again. It says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the candy hearts are universal; everyone has them. Then, the other three items—diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades—are the ones that some residents own in addition.

So, the four "things" are four items, with candy hearts being one that everyone has. Hmm, but when it talks about exactly two or exactly three, does that include the candy hearts? Or is it just the other three? Wait, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think "these things" refers to the four items, including the candy hearts. Because it says "these things" after mentioning all four.

Wait, but the problem says "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." So, these things are the four: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, the only way someone can have exactly two is if they have the candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, someone with exactly three would have the candy hearts plus two others, and someone with all four has all three plus the candy hearts.

Wait, but how does that affect the counts? Let me think.

Let me denote the total number of residents as U = 900.

Let me define the sets:

- D = set of residents who own a diamond ring. |D| = 195.
- G = set of residents who own golf clubs. |G| = 367.
- S = set who own garden spades. |S| = 562.
- C = set who own candy hearts. |C| = 900, since everyone has it.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is universal, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

The problem also tells us that the number of residents owning exactly two of these four things is 437, and exactly three is 234. So, we have exactly two and exactly three counts. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.

Wait, but in this case, since C is universal, maybe it's easier to model the problem in terms of the other three sets. Because C is included in everyone, so any intersection involving C is just the intersection of the other sets. Hmm, maybe that complicates things, but perhaps it can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the ownership of the other three items (D, G, S) along with C. But since C is universal, maybe I can treat the problem as considering sets D, G, S within the universal set U, and the counts given include C as well.

Wait, but let's think about it: each resident has at least C, so the counts can be broken down as follows:

- The number of people who own exactly two things: this would be people who own C plus exactly one other item. Because if they own exactly two, and C is one, the other
