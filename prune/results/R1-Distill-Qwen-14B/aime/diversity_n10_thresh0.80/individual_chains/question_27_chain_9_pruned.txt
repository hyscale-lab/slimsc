Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to picture it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, if I imagine spinning that circle around the axis, it creates this donut shape.

Now, there's also a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent to it along a circle, and it can also rest outside and be tangent along another circle. The problem asks for the difference between the radii of these two circles, r_i - r_o, and then express that difference as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find r_i and r_o first. Let me think about how to approach this.

I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, their tangent planes at the point of tangency are the same. But in this case, they're tangent along a circle, so it's a circle of tangency. I'm guessing this has something to do with the geometry of the torus and sphere.

Let me recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this problem, the torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the minor radius r is 3, and the major radius R is 6.

So, for the torus T, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, when the torus rests inside the sphere S of radius 11, the torus is tangent to S along a circle. Similarly, when it rests outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles.

Let me think about the internal tangent first. So, T is inside S and tangent along a circle. The sphere is centered somewhere, but the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be a circle where both surfaces meet.

I should probably model this in 3D coordinates. Let's assume the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T, when resting inside S, would have its center at some point. Wait, actually, the torus is symmetric, so maybe it's centered at the origin as well.

Wait, no. Because when you revolve a circle around an axis, the center of that circle moves along the axis. So, for the torus, the axis is a line, and the circle is rotating around it. So, the major radius is 6, so the center of the generating circle is moving along a circle of radius 6 around the axis.

But to model this, perhaps I should consider the parametric equations for the torus.

The parametric equations for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r are:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

where θ and φ are angles varying from 0 to 2π.

But I'm not sure if this will help directly. Maybe I should think about the distance from the origin to a point on the torus.

When the torus is inside the sphere, all points on the torus must be within the sphere. The point where they are tangent will have the same distance from the origin as the sphere's radius, which is 11.

Wait, but the sphere is 11, so the maximum distance from the origin on the sphere is 11. For the torus, the maximum distance from the origin would be when the point on the torus is farthest along the axis of rotation. Similarly, the minimum distance would be when it's closest.

Wait, no. The torus is a surface, so the distance from the origin to points on the torus will vary. The points of tangency would be where the sphere and torus touch, so their normals are aligned.

But perhaps an easier approach is to consider the distance from the origin to the center of the tube of the torus, and then relate that to the sphere's radius.

Wait, for the internal tangent, the torus is inside the sphere. The closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the axis of the torus, right? Because the torus is a surface of revolution, the axis of rotation is where the center of the generating circle lies.

Wait, let me clarify. The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the major radius is 6, minor radius 3.

So, the center of the generating circle is moving along a circle of radius 6 around the axis. Let me assume the axis is the z-axis for simplicity. Then, the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) when θ = 0, for example.

Wait, no. If the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, then the center of the generating circle moves along the z-axis. Wait, no, that's not right. If the axis is in the plane of the generating circle, then perhaps the axis is the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I need a better coordinate system.

Let me think again. The torus is generated by revolving a circle in the plane around an axis in the same plane, at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle.

So, imagine the generating circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (6, 0, 0). The axis of revolution is the y-axis, perhaps? Or is it the x-axis? Wait, the axis is in the plane of the circle, and is 6 units from the center. So, the circle is in, say, the x-y plane, centered at (0,0,0), and the axis is the line x = 6, y = 0, z = 0. So, the axis is parallel to the z-axis but offset in the x-direction.

Therefore, when we revolve the generating circle (radius 3) around this axis, we get a torus. The major radius R is 6, and minor radius r is 3.

So, any point on the torus can be described as ( (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, 3 sin θ ), where θ is the angle around the generating circle and φ is the angle around the axis.

Wait, no, actually, in the standard parametrization, θ is the angle around the generating circle, and φ is the angle around the axis. So, the parametrization is:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

But in our case, R is 6, r is 3, so:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

So, that's the
