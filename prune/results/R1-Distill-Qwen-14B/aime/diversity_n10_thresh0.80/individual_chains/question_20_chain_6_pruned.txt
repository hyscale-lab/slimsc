Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of them in the 25 unit cells of the grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. Now, the important conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, if we try to place any more chips on the grid, it would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, our task is to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me think. So each row must be all white or all black, and same for each column. But wait, if a row is all white, then every cell in that row must be white, and similarly for black. But then, what about the columns? Each column must also be all one color. So if a column is all white, then every cell in that column must be white.

Wait, that seems restrictive. Because if a row is all white, then every column that intersects with that row must also be all white. Similarly for black.

Wait, let me think with a smaller grid. Suppose we have a 2x2 grid. How would that work?

In a 2x2 grid, for each row and column to be uniform in color, let's see:

Case 1: All rows and columns are white. So all cells are white. 

Case 2: Row 1 is white, row 2 is black. But then, column 1 has one white and one black, which violates the condition that all chips in the same column must be the same color. So that's not allowed.

Wait, so if any row is white, then all columns that intersect that row must be white. Similarly for black.

Wait, so if a row is white, then every column that intersects it must be entirely white, because each column must be uniform. So if any cell in a column is white, the entire column must be white. Similarly, if any cell in a column is black, the entire column must be black.

So, the rows and columns can't have a mix of colors. Because if a row is white, then every column that it intersects must also be white. Similarly, if a row is black, every column it intersects must be black. So, if I have a grid where some rows are white and some are black, then all the columns that intersect those rows must be of the same color, but that's impossible because a column might intersect both white and black rows, which would require it to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Wait, that suggests that all the rows must be of the same color, and all the columns must be of the same color. But that can't be right because then the entire grid is either all white or all black. But that would only give two possibilities, which seems too restrictive.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, and all chips in the same column have the same color. But it's possible to have some rows white and some black, as long as the columns are consistent.

Wait, no, because if a column has a white chip in one row, then the entire column must be white. So, if a column has any white chips, all the cells in that column must be white. Similarly for black. So, if a column is white, then all the rows that intersect it must also have white in that column, which affects the rows.

Wait, perhaps the grid must be such that the rows and columns form a consistent color pattern. Maybe it's like a bipartition of the grid into white and black regions where each white region is a rectangle that spans entire rows and columns, and same for black.

Wait, maybe the grid can be divided into rectangles where each rectangle is entirely white or entirely black, and those rectangles must cover the entire grid without overlapping. So, each cell is in exactly one rectangle, either white or black.

Hmm, but how? Let me consider a 2x2 grid again. Suppose I have two white
