Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem, I think. 

Alright, let me list out the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's 900 for the candy hearts.

Wait, no, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So the candy hearts are like a universal set here. So when considering all four items, the candy hearts are included for everyone. So actually, when we're talking about owning all four, that's the overlap we're trying to find.

But wait, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So we have some overlaps, but not everyone owns all four.

Let me think about how inclusion-exclusion works. Normally, for four sets, the inclusion-exclusion formula would be:

Total = A + B + C + D - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple-wise intersections) - (all four together)

But wait, in this case, we don't have all four sets given. Wait, actually, we have four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Oh, wait, but the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so D (candy hearts) is 900.

But perhaps it's better to model the problem with four sets: A (diamond), B (golf), C (spade), and H (hearts). But H is 900, which is the total population. So any intersection involving H is just the other set. For example, A ∩ H is just A, because everyone who owns A also owns H. Similarly, A ∩ B ∩ H is just A ∩ B, and so on.

Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as H is the universal set, and the other three are subsets. So, each resident owns H, so in the problem, when it talks about owning other things, it's talking about owning subsets of H.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is considering four things, but one of them (H) is universal. So when the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, it's including H. Similarly, 234 own exactly three.

Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So H is part of all ownership counts. So when someone owns exactly two of the things, it's any two, including H or not including H. But wait, no, because H is a must. So actually, does that mean that all ownerships include H? Because the problem says each resident owns H. So when someone owns a diamond ring, they also own H. So the ownerships of other items are subsets of H.

Wait, but the problem says "the last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}." So the problem is about four items: diamond,
