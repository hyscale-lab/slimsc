Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I remember that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So any path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), totaling 16 steps. 

Normally, the number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Well, each time the direction changes, the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, a path that starts by moving right, then up, then right again would have two direction changes.

Let me model this. Each path is a sequence of R's and U's. A direction change occurs whenever the next move is different from the previous one. So, for a path with exactly four direction changes, that would imply that the number of runs of consecutive R's or U's is five. Because each direction change adds a new run.

Wait, hold on. If a path changes direction four times, how many runs does it have? Let me see: starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R. That's four direction changes and five runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, then R, then U, then R, then U, that's four direction changes and five runs. So yes, four direction changes correspond to five runs.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of R's and U's with exactly five runs, each run being a consecutive sequence of either R's or U's.

Now, the key is to figure out how many such sequences there are. Since the grid is 8x8, the total number of R's and U's is 8 each. So, the sum of the lengths of all the R runs must be 8, and the same for U runs.

Since there are five runs, and the path starts with either R or U. Let's consider both cases
