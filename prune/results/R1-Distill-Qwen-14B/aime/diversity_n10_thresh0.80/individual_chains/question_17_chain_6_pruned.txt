Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r squared, which will be a fraction p/q. Finally, I need to find p + q where p and q are coprime. 

Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. So, the set B consists of all rectangular boxes (so, rectangular prisms) with surface area 54 and volume 23. Each of these boxes is to be contained within a sphere, and we want the smallest possible sphere that can contain any such box. The radius of this sphere is r, and we need to find r squared.

Wait, so the box has to fit inside the sphere. That means that the sphere's diameter has to be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, right? So, if the sphere has a diameter equal to the space diagonal, then the box will just fit inside the sphere. So, the radius of the sphere will be half of the space diagonal.

So, if I denote the edges of the box as a, b, c, then the space diagonal d is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is d/2, so r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r² is (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing (a² + b² + c²) since 4 is a constant denominator. So, we need to find the minimal value of a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Alright, so we have two constraints: surface area and volume. Let's write down the equations for these.

The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by:
S = 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54.

The volume V is given by:
V = abc = 23.

We need to minimize the function f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c² subject to the constraints:
1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
2. abc = 23

This looks like a problem of optimization with constraints. So, maybe I can use methods like Lagrange multipliers. But since it's a problem involving symmetric functions, perhaps there's a way to express a² + b² + c² in terms of the given constraints.

Wait, another approach could be to use inequalities to relate a² + b² + c² to the surface area and volume. Let's think about that.

I remember that for positive real numbers a, b, c, the following inequality holds: a² + b² + c² ≥ (ab + bc + ac). This is because (a - b)² + (b - c)² + (c - a)² ≥ 0, which simplifies to 2(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac) ≥ 0, so a² + b² + c² ≥ ab + bc + ac.

In our case, ab + bc + ac is known because the surface area is 54. Since 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, then ab + bc + ac = 27. So, a² + b² + c² ≥ 27. But wait, is this the minimal value? Because if a = b = c, then it's possible that a² + b² + c² = 3a², and ab + bc + ac = 3a², so in that case, a² + b² + c² would equal ab + bc + ac. But in our case, the volume is 23, which might not correspond to a cube. So, perhaps the minimal value of a² + b² + c² is greater than 27?

Wait, but if a, b, c aren't equal, then a² + b² + c² would be greater than 27. So, maybe the minimal value is 27? But is that possible? Because if the box is a cube, then volume would be a³, but 23 isn't a perfect cube.

Hmm, let me think. If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² and the volume would be a³. So, in that case, 6a² = 54 → a² = 9 → a = 3, so volume would be 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube; it's a rectangular prism with edges not equal. Therefore, the minimal value of a² + b² + c² is more than 27.

So, perhaps I need to use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal value of a² + b² + c² subject to the given constraints.

Let me set up the Lagrangian. Let’s denote the function to minimize as f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

The constraints are:
g(a, b, c) = 2(ab + bc + ac) - 54 = 0
h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, we can set up the Lagrangian with two multipliers:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(2(ab + bc + ac) - 54) - μ(abc - 23)

We need to take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, set them equal to zero, and solve.

So, compute ∂L/∂a, ∂L/∂b, ∂L/∂c, and set each to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂a:
2a - λ(2b + 2c) - μ(bc) = 0
Similarly, ∂L/∂b:
2b - λ(2a + 2c) - μ(ac) = 0
∂L/∂c:
2c - λ(2a + 2b) - μ(ab) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2a - 2λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0
2. 2b - 2λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0
3. 2c - 2λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0
4. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
5. abc = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can assume symmetry. Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then maybe the equations will simplify.

Let’s assume a = b. Let’s see if that leads us somewhere.

If a = b, then let's denote a = b = x, and c will be another variable.

So, substituting a = b = x, then:

From the volume constraint: x² c = 23 → c = 23 / x².

From the surface area:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(x² + x c + x c) = 2(x² + 2x c) = 54.

Substituting c = 23 / x²:

2(x² + 2x*(23 / x²)) = 54
Simplify:

2(x² + 46 / x) = 54
Divide both sides by 2:

x² + 46 / x = 27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x
Bring all terms to one side:

x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 - 27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2):

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1, 0, -27, 46

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2=2. Add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2: 2*2=4. Add to next coefficient: -27 +4= -23.

Multiply by 2: -23*2= -46. Add to last coefficient: 46 + (-46)=0.

So, the polynomial factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

Set equal to zero:

x = 2, or x² + 2x -23 =0.

Solving x² + 2x -23 =0, using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, as it's a length, so x = 2 or x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, possible x values are 2 and approximately 3.898.

So, the roots are x=2, x≈3.898. Let's see which one makes sense.

If x=2, then c=23/(2)^2=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would have dimensions 2, 2, 5.75.

If x≈3.898, then c=23/(3.898)^2≈23/(15.195)≈1.514.

So, dimensions would be approximately 3.898, 3.898, 1.514.

But wait, let's compute a² + b² + c² for both cases.

First case: a=b=2, c=5.75.

a² + b² + c² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625.

Second case: a≈3.898, b≈3.898, c≈1.514.

Compute a² + b² + c² ≈ (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2 ≈ 15.195 +15.195 +2.291 ≈ 32
