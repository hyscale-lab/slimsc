Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 give Bob a winning strategy, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a classic game theory problem, probably involving finding the winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I should model this as a series of positions where each position is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base case is when there are 0 tokens left. But wait, if there are 0 tokens, that means the previous player took the last token and won. So, the player who is about to move when there are 0 tokens has already lost, right? So, 0 is a losing position.

Let me try to list out the positions from 0 upwards and mark them as W or L.

n=0: L (losing position)
n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, W.
n=2: Player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take that 1 and win. Wait, so if I take 1, opponent can win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So, I can only take 1. So opponent gets n=1, which is a W for them. That means n=2 is a losing position for me. So n=2: L.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's structure this.

For each n, determine if the current player can force a win.

n=0: L (no move can be made, so the player loses)
n=1: Can take 1, leaving n=0 for the opponent. Since n=0 is L, the opponent loses. So current player wins. So n=1: W.
n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). Or take 4, which isn't possible. So, any move leaves opponent in a W position. Therefore, n=2: L.
n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent). So opponent is in L, meaning current player can win. So n=3: W.
n=4: Current player can take 1, leaving n=3 (W for opponent) or take 4, leaving n=0 (L for opponent). So, taking 4 is better, leaving opponent with L. So current player can win. Therefore, n=4: W.
n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, both options lead to opponent in W. So n=5: L.

Wait, wait, let me check that again.

n=5:
Option 1: take 1, leaving n=4. n=4 is W, so opponent can win. So that's bad.
Option 2: take 4, leaving n=1. n=1 is W, opponent can win. So both options lead to opponent winning. So n=5: L.

Okay, n=5 is L.

n=6:
Take 1, leaving n=5 (L). So opponent is in L, so current player can win. So n=6: W.

n=7:
Take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). Both options leave opponent in W. So n=7: L.

Wait, no, if n=7, taking 1 leads to n=6 (W), which is opponent can win. Taking 4 leads to n=3 (W), same result. So, n=7: L.

n=8:
Take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So opponent is in L, current player
