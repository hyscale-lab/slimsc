Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The given sides are AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. I need to find AP as a fraction m/n and then compute m + n. Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle from a common external point, those two tangent segments are equal in length. So, the tangent from D to B and the tangent from D to C should be equal. That makes triangle DBC an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet. Let me note that.

Next, I think about the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB², since DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, it's also equal to DC², but since DB=DC, that's consistent. So, the power of D is DB² = DC². 

Power of a point formula states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length, and also equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from the point to the intersection points of any secant line. In this case, AD is a secant that passes through the circle, intersecting it at A and P. So, the power of D should also be equal to DA * DP. 

So, putting that together: DB² = DA * DP. That seems useful because if I can find DB, and I can express DA in terms of AP, perhaps I can solve for AP. Let me write that down:

DB² = DA * DP.

But DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since P is on AD, we can say that AP = AD - DP. Wait, no. If P is between A and D, then AP = AD - DP. Alternatively, if P is beyond A, then AP would be AD + DP. But in this case, since AD intersects the circle again at P, P must lie on the extension of AD beyond A, right? Because A is already on the circle, so the other intersection P would be on the other side. Hmm, wait a second. Wait, no. Because AD is a secant, so it starts at A, goes through the circle, and then meets D outside. So, actually, the points are A, then P, then D. So, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the order is A---P---D. So, AD = AP + PD. Therefore, from the power of point, DB² = AP * AD.

Wait, no, the power of point D is DB² = DA * DP. Because DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is the segment from D to P. Wait, but if P is between A and D, then DA = DP + PA. So,
