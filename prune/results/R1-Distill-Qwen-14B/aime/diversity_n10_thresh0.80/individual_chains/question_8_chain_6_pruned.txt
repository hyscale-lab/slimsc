Okay, I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It tells me that the sum of the three variables is 300. The second equation is a bit more complicated. Let me write it out again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this somehow or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Let me try to factor the second expression. Looking at a²b + a²c, I can factor out a² to get a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be factored as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b becomes c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So that simplifies the equation a bit. Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

Adding them together:

(300a² - a³) + (300b² - b³) + (300c² - c³) = 6,000,000.

Combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have an expression involving a², b², c², a³, b³, c³. I wonder if I can find a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c.

I remember that for symmetric expressions, sometimes it's helpful to consider variables like symmetric sums or using known identities. Let me think about the possible identities that could relate these terms.

One identity I recall is that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). Maybe this can be useful. Let me note that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac)

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Let me see if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)². I know that:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So,

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Let me substitute that back into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute 300*90,000 first. 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000. Then 300 * (-2(ab + bc + ac)) is -600(ab + bc + ac).

So the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me move constants to one side:

-600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000
-600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000

Multiply both sides by (-1):

600(ab + bc + ac) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me see if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of something else. Wait, earlier I had the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac)

Substituting a + b + c = 300 and a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac), then:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + 300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac) - ab - bc - ac)
= 3abc + 300*(90,000 - 3(ab + bc + ac))

So, substituting back into the equation:

[3abc + 300*(90,000 - 3(ab + bc + ac))] + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Let me expand this:

3abc + 300*90,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Compute 300*90,000: that's 27,000,000.

So:

3abc + 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ac) + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms for ab + bc + ac:

-900(ab + bc + ac) + 600(ab + bc + ac) = (-300)(ab + bc + ac)

So:

3abc + 27,000,000 - 300(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000.

Bring the 27,000,000 to the other side:

3abc - 300(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000
3abc - 300(ab + bc + ac) = -6,000,000.

Hmm, let's factor out 3:

3[abc - 100(ab + bc + ac)] = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, this is an interesting equation. Let me write it as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

I wonder if I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of variables. Let me factor 100 on the right side:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Wait, maybe I can factor out 100:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange it:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try to factor it differently.

Let me consider dividing both sides by abc, assuming none of a, b, c are zero. Wait, but they could be zero, so that might not be safe. Alternatively, maybe I can factor 100:

Wait, 100(ab + bc + ac) = ab*100 + bc*100 + ac*100.

Hmm, I don't see an immediate factoring. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ac + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor by grouping. Let's see:

Group abc -100ab and -100bc -100ac + 2,000,000.

Wait:

abc -100ab = ab(c - 100)

-100bc -100ac = -100c(a + b) = -100c(300 - c) because a + b = 300 - c.

Hmm, so:

ab(c - 100) -100c(300 - c) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps let me factor out c from some terms:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ac = c(ab - 100a -
