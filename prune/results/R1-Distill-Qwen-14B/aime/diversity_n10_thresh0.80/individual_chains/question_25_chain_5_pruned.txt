Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, let me list out all the information given:

- Total residents: 900
- Number of residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195
- Number owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So all 900 own H, meaning H has a count of 900.
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.
- We need to find how many own all four things.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and Venn diagrams. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's recall that.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets would be something like:

Total = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (sum of triple intersections) - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ H|

Wait, but that's for the union. But in this problem, we're given some numbers about exactly two and exactly three. Maybe I should think about how these numbers fit into the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Let me define some terms:

Let a = number of people owning exactly 0 things. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, a must be 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So H is 900. So everyone owns H, so everyone owns at least one thing. So a is 0.

But wait, the question is about four things: D, G, S, and H. But H is owned by everyone, so actually, everyone owns at least H, but some might own only H. But the problem says that 437 own exactly two things, 234 own exactly three, and we need to find those who own all four.

Wait, so let's think about the possible overlaps. The possible cases are:

- Exactly one thing: but since everyone owns H, if someone owns exactly one, it's H only. But the problem doesn't specify how many own exactly one. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we are to find those who own all four.

So the total number of residents is the sum of those owning exactly one, two, three, and four things. But we don't know exactly one, but maybe we can find it.

Wait, but H is owned by everyone, so perhaps we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this using a Venn diagram with four circles, but that's complicated. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets, but considering the counts for exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote:

- Exactly two: 437
- Exactly three: 234
- All four: x (this is what we need to find)
- Exactly one: y

So total = y + 437
