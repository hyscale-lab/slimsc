Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties related to circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is given as 13, so I know that the distance from the circumcenter O to each vertex (A, B, C) is 13. The inradius r is 6, so the incenter I is at a distance of 6 from each side of the triangle.

Wait, the problem also states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I think I should try to draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me sketch triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to model this situation. Let me assign coordinates to some points.

Maybe I can place the incenter I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), point O must lie somewhere along the line perpendicular to IA at I. Let's say IA is along the x-axis for simplicity, so O would lie somewhere along the y-axis.

Wait, no, if IA is along the x-axis, then OI is perpendicular to IA, so OI would be along the y-axis. So, if I is at (0,0), then O would be at (0, k) for some k. But O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = 13. Hmm, okay.

Let me denote the coordinates: I is at (0,0), O is at (0, k). Then, since OA = 13, the distance from O to A is 13. Let me let point A be at (a, 0) because IA is along the x-axis. So, point A is (a, 0), and O is (0, k). Then, the distance OA is sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2] = sqrt(a² + k²) = 13. So, a² + k² = 169.

Also, since I is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6. But I is at (0,0), so maybe I can find the coordinates of other points or use some formulas related to the inradius and circumradius.

I remember the formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that formula again. Is that correct?

Wait, I think that formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me verify. Yes, I recall that in any triangle
