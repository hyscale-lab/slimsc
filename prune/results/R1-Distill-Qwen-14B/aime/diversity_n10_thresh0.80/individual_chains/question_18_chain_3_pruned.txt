Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a dodecagon has 12 sides, right? So it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices. But wait, rectangles require four right angles, so the sides need to be parallel. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip.

Let me think. In a regular n-gon, the number of sides is n, and the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they connect. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices (since you can't connect to itself or its two adjacent vertices). So, the diagonals can be categorized by the step between the vertices. For example, a step of 1 would just be the sides, step of 2 would be the first diagonal, step of 3, and so on up to step of 5 because beyond that, it's symmetric.

Wait, actually, for a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2, but that counts all diagonals regardless of their length. For a dodecagon, that would be 12*(12-3)/2 = 54 diagonals. But in terms of distinct lengths, since it's regular, some diagonals are congruent. So, for a dodecagon, the possible diagonals would have lengths based on the step between 1 and 5, because beyond step 6, it's the same as stepping backwards. For example, stepping 7 is the same as stepping 5 in the opposite direction, so they have the same length.

But wait, each rectangle is determined by selecting two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides are parallel if they are separated by the same step. So, for a rectangle, I think I need to select two different step sizes, say step a and step b, such that the sides formed by these steps are perpendicular. 

Wait, how do I ensure that the sides are perpendicular? In a regular polygon, the angle between two sides separated by step k can be calculated. Maybe the key is to find steps a and b such that the angle between them is 90 degrees. Since a regular dodecagon has internal angles of 150 degrees, but when you connect vertices, the central angles will be multiples of 30 degrees because 360/12 = 30. So, each central angle between adjacent vertices is 30 degrees.

So, for two chords (sides or diagonals) to be perpendicular, the angle between them at the center of the polygon should be 90 degrees. Since each step corresponds to 30 degrees, two steps would need to add up to 3, because 3 steps * 30 degrees = 90 degrees. Alternatively, the difference could be 3 steps, but I think addition is the right approach here.

Wait, let me clarify. The angle between two chords can be calculated based on the number of steps between their endpoints. If I have one chord with step a and another with step b, the angle between them would be (a - b)*30 degrees. But for them to be perpendicular, this angle should be 90 degrees. So, (a - b)*30 = 90, which implies a - b = 3 or b - a = 3. Alternatively, maybe it's about the sum of steps? Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the dodecagon on a coordinate system. Since it's regular, I can place it on a unit circle with each vertex at an angle of 30 degrees apart. Then, the coordinates of each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ = 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.

So, if two sides are to be perpendicular, their vectors should be perpendicular. The vector from the center to a vertex is (cos θ, sin θ). So, if we have two vectors v1 = (cos θ1, sin θ1) and v2 = (cos θ2, sin θ2), they are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. So, cos θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ1 sin θ2 = 0. That simplifies to cos(θ1 - θ2) = 0. Because cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.

So, cos(θ1 - θ2) = 0 implies θ1 - θ2 = 90° or 270°, which is equivalent to θ1 - θ2 = ±90° modulo 360°. Since each step is 30°, the difference between θ1 and θ2 should be 3 steps (3*30=90) or equivalent. So, the two chords should be separated by 3 steps. Wait, but in terms of their positions.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Each side or diagonal can be considered as a vector. For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, if I have two vectors u and v, then u · v = 0. The vectors can be represented as from the center to the vertices, but actually, the sides and diagonals are chords of the circle. So, the vector
