Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. That should mean the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent along a circle, and it can also rest outside and be tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i when inside and r_o when outside, and then find the difference r_i - r_o, which will be a fraction m/n. Then, I have to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me think about the geometry here. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus touches the sphere at some circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch at another circle.

I should probably model the torus and the sphere mathematically. Let me recall the equations for a torus and a sphere.

The equation for a torus in 3D can be given in terms of coordinates. If the torus has major radius R and minor radius r, then in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, θ, z), the equation is sqrt((R - ρ)^2 + z^2) = r. Alternatively, in Cartesian coordinates, it's (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2.

The sphere with radius 11 has the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. That means there's a circle where both surfaces meet and share a common tangent plane. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is tangent to the torus along another circle.

I think I need to find the points where the two surfaces are tangent. For that, the gradients (normals) of the two surfaces should be the same at the points of tangency.

Let me denote the torus as T and the sphere as S.

For the internal tangent case, the sphere is larger, so the torus is inside the sphere. So, the points of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus, I guess.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since both the torus and the sphere are surfaces of revolution, the points of tangency should lie along a circle that's also a circle of revolution. So, the circle of tangency should lie on a plane that's perpendicular to the axis of the torus.

So, let me consider the cross-sectional view. Imagine looking along the axis of the torus. The torus would look like a circle of radius 3, centered at a distance of 6 from the origin. The sphere, when cut by this plane, would be a circle of radius 11.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than the torus's major radius (6). So, the sphere will enclose the torus.

When the torus is inside, the closest point from the sphere's center to the torus's center is 6 (the major radius), but the sphere has radius 11. So, the distance between centers is 11 - 6 = 5? Wait, no, because the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside. So, the sphere's center is at the origin (assuming the torus is centered at the origin), and the torus's center is also at the origin. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Actually, the torus is centered at the origin, and the sphere is also centered at the origin. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, which is much larger. So, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, touching it along a circle.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is entirely inside the torus, touching along another circle.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the torus is inside the sphere, it's not entirely inside. The torus has a hole in the middle. So, the sphere is outside the torus, but the torus is inside the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the torus as a surface, so when it's resting on the inside
