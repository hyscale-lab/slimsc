Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to visualize what's going on.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, point A is on the x-axis, halfway between O and (1,0), and point B is on the y-axis, somewhere above (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. Then, the segment AB connects these two points. I should probably sketch this to get a better idea.

Next, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is like a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the length of PQ is 1, which gives us the equation sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these unit segments, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the distance between A and B. The distance formula is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)² + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)²] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is a unit segment, so AB is in F.

But we're looking for a point C on AB that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C doesn't lie on them. So, C is somehow special on AB—it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other PQ in F.

Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so how do I approach this?

First, let's parametrize point C on AB. Since AB is a line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write any point C on AB as a linear combination. Let me use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, we're at A, and t=1, we're at B.

So, the coordinates of C can be expressed as:
x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t

Because as t increases from 0 to 1, x decreases from 1/2 to 0, and y increases from 0 to sqrt(3)/2.

So, C = ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2)

Now, the point C must not lie on any other PQ in F except AB. So, to ensure this, for all other segments PQ in F, C shouldn't lie on PQ. So, if I can find the condition such that C is only on AB and no other PQ in F, that should give me the unique point C.

Alternatively, for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, the line PQ, for any other P and Q (other than A and B), shouldn't pass through C. So, if I can find such a point C on AB where this is true, that's our point.

Wait, but how do I ensure that? Maybe there's a way to find the envelope of all these PQ segments and see where AB intersects this envelope? Or perhaps use some optimization or geometric condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the family F of all unit segments from x-axis to y-axis. So, each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1. So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, for any PQ in F, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

Now, point C is on AB, so let's write the parametric equation for AB. As above, C is ((1-t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2). So, substituting x = (1-t)/
