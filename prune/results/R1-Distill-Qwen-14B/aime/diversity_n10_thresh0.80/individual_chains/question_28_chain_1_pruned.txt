Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from a point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces, which is the same for all faces. This distance is supposed to be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think I need to use the formula that relates the volume of the tetrahedron to its surface area and inradius. The formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the volume is equal to (1/3) times the surface area times the inradius. Because each face contributes a kind of 'pyramid' volume with the inradius as the height.

So, V = (1/3) * S * r, where V is the volume, S is the total surface area, and r is the inradius. So, if I can find the volume and the total surface area, I can solve for r.

Alright, so the first step is to find the volume of the tetrahedron. But how? The edges seem a bit complicated, but maybe there's a way to compute the volume using the given edge lengths.

Wait, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. So it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe I can use some properties of such tetrahedrons.

I recall that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that the case here?

Wait, in this case, the edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, but the lengths are not the same. So each pair of opposite edges has the same length, but different for each pair. So maybe the faces are congruent in pairs. Let me check.

Each pair of opposite faces should have the same area because each face is a triangle with sides from the given edge lengths. Let's see, for example, face ABC and face CDA. In face ABC, the edges are AB, BC, and AC. Similarly, in face CDA, the edges are CD, DA, and AC. Since AB=CD (√41), BC=AD (√89), and AC is common, so yes, triangles ABC and CDA have the same side lengths. So their areas are equal
