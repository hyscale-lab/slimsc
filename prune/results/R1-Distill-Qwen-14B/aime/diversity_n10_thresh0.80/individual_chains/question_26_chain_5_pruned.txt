Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n. 

Alright, first, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the exsymmedian point or something like that? I think D is the ex-pole or maybe related to the symmedian. Hmm.

Wait, actually, the point where the two tangents meet is called the exsymmedian point? Or is it the symmedian? No, wait. The tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, so D is the ex-pole of BC. Alternatively, D is the external homothety center in some context. Maybe I should recall that the tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length, so DB = DC.

So, DB = DC. That might come in handy. Also, since AD intersects ω again at P, AP is a chord of the circle, and we need to find its length.

I think the key here might be to use power of a point. D is outside the circle, and it's the intersection of two tangents, so the power of point D with respect to ω should be DB² = DC². Also, since AD passes through ω, the power of D with respect to ω can be expressed as DP * DA = DB².

Wait, let me write that down. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² because DB and DC are tangent segments. Also, since AD intersects ω at P and A, the power of D is DP * DA = DB².

So, DP * DA = DB². Therefore, we can write AP in terms of DP and DA. Let me denote AP as x. Then, since AP is the segment from A to P, and DA is from D to A, so DP = DA - AP if P is between D and A. Wait, no. Actually, since P is on ω and A is also on ω, the chord AD passes through A and then P, so the order is D---A---P. So DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. So DA = DP + PA? Wait, no, hold on. If D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, then the line DA starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle at P. Wait, that can't be. Because AD is a secant. So A is outside the circle? No, wait, A is on the circle because the triangle ABC is ins
