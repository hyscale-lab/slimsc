Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

The triangle ABC has sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. The tangents to the circumcircle ω at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. I need to find the length of AP.

Hmm, okay, let's note down the given information:

- Triangle ABC with AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.
- ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC.
- Tangents at B and C meet at D.
- Line AD intersects ω again at P.
- Find AP, expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

First, I need to recall some properties of tangents to a circle. The two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB = DC.

Also, point D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to the circle ω. Maybe properties related to poles and polars could be useful here, but I'm not too sure yet.

Alternatively, I remember that the polar of D with respect to ω is the line BC, since D lies on the tangents at B and C. So, that might come into play.

Another approach: Maybe using power of a point. Since D lies on the tangents at B and C, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Also, for point D, the power with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA, since AD is a secant that passes through P.

Wait, that's a key relation. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², and since AD is a secant, power of D also equals DP * DA. Therefore, DB² = DP * DA. So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA.

But I don't know DB yet. So, maybe I can compute DB first?

But to compute DB, perhaps I can use some triangle properties. Let me think about triangle ABC. Since we have all three sides, maybe I can compute some angles or the circumradius to find DB.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for the points by placing the triangle in a coordinate system. Let me try that.

Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0) because AC = 10, and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can compute the coordinates of B using the distances given.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10.

So, point A is at (10, 0), point C is at (0,0). Let me find the coordinates of point B.

Let me denote B as (x, y). Then, distance from B to C is
