Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's see if I can figure it out.

First, let me visualize the hexagon. Since it's equilateral, all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which probably gives it some symmetry. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in certain directions? Not entirely sure yet.

The triangle mentioned is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how that triangle would look. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, those three lines should meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, maybe this triangle is similar to the inner triangle of the hexagon or something?

Wait, since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it might form a sort of truncated triangle. Like, if I have a big triangle and then cut off smaller triangles from each corner to make a hexagon. That might make sense because each side of the hexagon would be equal, and opposite sides would be parallel.

If that's the case, the big triangle (the one formed by extending the sides) would have sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon would be formed by cutting off smaller triangles from each corner. Each side of the hexagon would be equal, so perhaps each of those cut-off triangles is similar to the big triangle? That could make sense because the sides are all equal.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. So, each of those smaller triangles I cut off would have sides proportional to s. Maybe the ratio of the small triangle's side to the big triangle's side is the same, and this ratio would relate to how much I've cut off.

Wait, but the triangle formed by the extensions isn't necessarily similar to the original big triangle. Hmm, maybe I should consider the concept of similar triangles here. If I can find a ratio between the big triangle and some smaller triangles within or around the hexagon, I can relate the side lengths.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the hexagon as being part of a larger triangle, with the hexagon sides parallel to the sides of the triangle. So the hexagon is similar to the big triangle but scaled down by some factor.

Let me try to model this. Suppose the big triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me compute the ratios of these sides. 200:240:300 simplifies to 5:6:7.5, but maybe I should keep them as they are or find if they form a right triangle? Let me check: 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² = 90000. So not a right triangle. Hmm, okay.

Wait, maybe Heron's formula could help.
