Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The hyperbola equation is given as x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.

First, I need to recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular but they are perpendicular in a square. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

So the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin, and they are perpendicular. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so each diagonal is split into two equal parts by their intersection at the origin.

So points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola. Let me think about the coordinates of these points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, points A and C are on one diagonal, and points B and D are on the other. Let me denote the coordinates:

Let’s say point A is (a, b), then point C would be (-a, -b), because the diagonal AC passes through the origin and is symmetric. Similarly, points B and D will be on the other diagonal, which is perpendicular to AC. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slope of AC times the slope of BD should be -1.

So if AC has slope m, then BD has slope -1/m. Let me find the slope of AC. AC connects (a, b) and (-a, -b), so its slope is (b - (-b))/(a - (-a)) = (2b)/(2a) = b/a. Therefore, the slope of BD must be -a/b since it's perpendicular.

So points B and D must lie on a line with slope -a/b passing through the origin. Let me denote B as (c, d), then D would be (-c, -d). So the line BD has slope d/(-c) = -d/c. Since BD is perpendicular to AC, which has slope b/a, their product should be -1:

(b/a) * (-d/c) = -1

So, (b/a) * (-d/c) = -1 → (b d)/(a c) = 1 → b d = a c.

Alternatively, since the slope of BD is
