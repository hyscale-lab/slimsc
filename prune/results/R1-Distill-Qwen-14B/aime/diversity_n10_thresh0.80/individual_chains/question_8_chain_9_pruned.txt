Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let's see. The first equation is straightforward—it's a linear equation. The second one looks more complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.

I notice that the second equation is symmetric in a, b, and c. That suggests that maybe I can express it in terms of symmetric sums or something. Let me write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Hmm, I can factor this expression. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But wait, since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the second equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that might be easier to handle. Let's denote this as equation (1):

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.  --- (1)

Now, I also know that a + b + c = 300. Let me call this equation (2):

a + b + c = 300.  --- (2)

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both (1) and (2).

Hmm, maybe I can find a relationship between these equations. Let's think about expanding equation (1):

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, for b and c.

So equation (1) becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange this:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I remember that:

(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc).
So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Given that a + b + c = 300, then a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = ab + ac + bc. Then, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2S.

Similarly, I think there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of symmetric sums. Let me recall:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So, that would be:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S + 3abc.

Calculating 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000, so 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc.

Now, going back to equation (1):

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting the expressions we have:

300*(90,000 - 2S) - [27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, expand 300*(90,000 - 2S):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300 * (-2S) = -600S.

So, the first part is 27,000,000 - 600S.

Now, subtract the second part:

[27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc].

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. It's 300*(90,000 - 2S) minus (a³ + b³ + c³), which is 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc. So,

27,000,000 - 600S - [27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600S - 27,000,000 + 900S - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600S + 900S = 300S.

So, 300S - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

So now, we have:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's a more manageable equation.

Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Or,

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I can factor or find a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let's see. Let me factor out ab from the first two terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) + 2,000,000 =
