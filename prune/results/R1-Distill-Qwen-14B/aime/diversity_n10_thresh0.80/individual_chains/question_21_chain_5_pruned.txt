Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me break down the problem. 

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are the digits. Importantly, d1 can't be zero because it's a two-digit number, so d1 must be at least 1. Also, since we're dealing with digits in base b, d1 and d0 must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b-1 and 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b-1. 

So, any two-digit number in base b can be written as n = d1 * b + d0. Now, the condition for b-eautifulness is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Therefore, we can write:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

To find b-eautiful numbers, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, maybe it's better to reorganize it in terms of b. Let's see:

d1*b = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0

Then, solving for b:

b = (d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0) / d1

Simplify that:

b = d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1

Since b has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2, the expression (d0^2 - d0)/d1 must be an integer. Also, both d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, for each b, d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1. But when we're considering different b's, these digits vary accordingly. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to fix d1 and d0, compute b from the equation, and then check if the computed b is a valid base (i.e., that d1 and d0 are both less than b). 

But that might complicate things because for each pair (d1, d0), we compute b, and then check if d1 < b and d0 < b. Hmm, perhaps, but since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, I can express the problem as:

For given d1 and d0, compute b as (d1 + d0)^2 - d0 divided by d1, and then check if d1 and d0 are both less than b.

Wait, let's see:

From earlier, we had:

b = (d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0) / d1

Which can be rewritten as:

b = d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1

So, for b to be an integer, (d0^2 - d0) must be divisible by d1.

So, (d0^2 - d0) mod d1 must be zero.

Alternatively, d1 divides (d0^2 - d0). Let me write that as:

d1 | (d0^2 - d0)

Which is equivalent to d1 | d0(d0 - 1)

So, d1 divides the product of d0 and d0 -1.

Given that d1 and d0 are digits, and d1 is at least 1, I can think of d1 as a divisor of d0*(d0 -1). So, for each d0 from 0 to b-1, d1 must be a divisor of d0*(d0 -1).

But since d1 is at least 1, and d0 is at least 0, let's see for each possible d0 from 0 to some upper limit, what d1's are possible.

Wait, but this seems a bit too abstract. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me think in terms of n, expressed as n = d1*b + d0, where d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) is an integer because d1 and d0 are integers, their sum is an integer, so n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and when written in base b, it has two digits whose sum is its square root.

Let me denote s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s^2 = d1*b + d0.

So, s^2 = d1*b + d0.

But d0 is a digit in base b, so d0 < b. Similarly, d1 < b.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, we have n >= b (since the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b in decimal) and n < b^2.

Wait, but n = s^2, so s^2 must be between b and b^2 -1.

So, b <= s^2 < b^2.

Which implies that s^2 >= b and s^2 < b^2.

Taking square roots: sqrt(b) <= s < b.

But since s is an integer (sum of two digits), s must be at least 1, but sqrt(b) must be less than s.

Wait, but s is an integer, so s >= ceil(sqrt(b)).

Hmm. So for each b, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1, since s must be less than b.

Wait, let's see: s^2 must be less than b^2, so s must be less than b. Therefore, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

But let's take an example. For base 13, s would be sqrt(81) = 9, which is less than 13. So, in general, s can be from 1 up to b-1, but with the constraint that s^2 >= b, so s >= sqrt(b). Since s must be integer, s >= floor(sqrt(b)) + 1 if sqrt(b) is not integer.

Wait, no. Let me think again. s must satisfy s^2 >= b. So, s >= sqrt(b). Since s is integer, s must be >= ceiling(sqrt(b)).

For example, if b=10, sqrt(b) is about 3.16, so s must be >=4. But in the example given, 81 is 13-eautiful, so s=9, which is sqrt(81). So, yeah, s can be up to b -1.

So, for each base b, the possible s values are integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

Given that, for each b, I can iterate over s from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b -1, and for each s, check if there exists digits d1 and d0 such that d1 + d0 = s and d1*b + d0 = s^2.

So, for each s, the equation becomes:

d1*b + d0 = s^2

and

d1 + d0 = s.

We can solve for d0 from the second equation: d0 = s - d1.

Substitute into the first equation:

d1*b + (s - d1) = s^2

Simplify:

d1*b + s - d1 = s^2

Factor d1:

d1*(b - 1) + s = s^2

Then,

d1*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

But d1 must be a positive integer (since it's a digit, 1 <= d1 <= b-1), and d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 <= d0 <= b -1.

So, for each b, and for each s in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1], I can compute d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b -1). If this is an integer, and d1 is within the range [1, b-1], and d0 = s - d1 is also within [0, b-1], then (d1, d0) is a valid pair, and n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, the approach is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, determine how many b-eautiful numbers exist.

2. The count is the number of s in [ceiling(sqrt(b)), b -1] for which d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is an integer, 1 <= d1 <= b-1, and 0 <= d0 = s - d1 <= b-1.

3. We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

This seems manageable, but perhaps computationally intensive. Since I'm doing this manually, I need a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and when divided, the result d1 is in [1, b-1], and d0 = s - d1 is in [0, b-1].

So, for a given b, let's denote k = b -1. Then, for each s, we need (s^2 - s) mod k == 0, and d1 = (s^2 - s)/k must satisfy 1<=d1<=k, and d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 <= d0 <= k.

So, for each k = b -1, s must satisfy:

s^2 - s ≡ 0 mod k

Which can be written as s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod k.

Therefore, for each k, s must be such that s ≡ 0 or 1 mod factors of k.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of k. For each k (since k = b -1, and b starts at 2, k starts at 1), s must be such that k divides s(s - 1).

So, for each k, find s in [ceil(sqrt(k + 1)), k] such that k divides s(s - 1).

Therefore, the number of such s's would be the number of solutions for s in that range where s ≡ 0 or 1 mod the prime factors of k.

But this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to find for each k, the number of s where s(s - 1) is divisible by k.

Alternatively, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that s ≡ 0 or 1 modulo some divisor of k.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to find, for each k, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k + 1)), k] where s(s -1) is divisible by k.

Since s and s -1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, in order for their product to be divisible by k, k must divide the product of two coprime numbers. Therefore, the prime factors of k must be entirely contained in either s or s -1.

Which implies that k must be such that either:

- s is a multiple of some divisor d of k, where d and (k/d) are coprime, and s -1 is a multiple of (k/d), or

- s -1 is a multiple of some divisor d of k, where d and (k/d) are coprime, and s is a multiple of (k/d).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.

Alternatively, for each k, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of k where s ≡ 0 mod a and s ≡ 1 mod b, with a*b = k and gcd(a, b) = 1. Because s and s-1 are coprime, their gcd is 1, so if k factors
