Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I need to visualize or maybe sketch a rough diagram. But since I don't have Asymptote here, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, the triangle isn't a right-angled one because 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which isn't equal to 10²=100. So, it's an acute or obtuse triangle? Let's see; using the Law of Cosines on the largest side, which is AC=10. Wait, no, BC=9 is the largest side. Wait, no, AC=10 is larger than BC=9. So, the largest side is AC. So, let's find the angle opposite to AC, which is angle B.

Using the Law of Cosines:
AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle B)
10² = 5² + 9² - 2*5*9*cos B
100 = 25 + 81 - 90 cos B
100 = 106 - 90 cos B
So, 100 - 106 = -90 cos B
-6 = -90 cos B
cos B = 6/90 = 1/15
So angle B is arccos(1/15), which is acute since cos is positive. So triangle ABC is acute-angled.

Okay, so triangle ABC is acute, inscribed in circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole? Or the external homothety center? Hmm, tangents from D to ω touch at B and C, so D lies on the external tangent line at B and C. That makes D lie on the symmedian? Or maybe the A-exsymmedian? Not sure yet.

I think I can recall that the point where the two tangents meet is called the ex-pole. Moreover, in triangle ABC, the point D is such that DB and DC are tangents to the circumcircle. So, D is the ex-pole of BC.

Also, from D, drawing DA which intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, where P is diametrically opposite to the intersection point? Not necessarily, because AD could intersect the circle at A and P, so P is the second intersection.

I need to find the length AP. Hmm, perhaps power of a point could help here. Also, properties related to harmonic division or inversion.

Let me think about the Power of a Point theorem. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², since DB and DC are both tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC. Therefore, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the triangle has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, triangle ABC is fixed, but point D is determined by the tangents at B and C.

Another thought: perhaps using harmonic division or pole-polar concepts. Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry could work here. Let me try to assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let me put point A at (10,0) since AC=10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, we can find the coordinates of B.

So, coordinates: A(10,0), C(0,0). Let B be at (x,y). Then, distance from B to C is 9: √(x² + y²) = 9 → x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is 5: √((x - 10)² + y²) =5 → (x-10)² + y² =25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x-10)² + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -81 → (x² -20x +100) + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x = 39/5. Then, from x² + y² =81:

(39/5)^2 + y² =81 → (1521/25) + y² = 81 → y² =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 → y=√(504/25) = (√504)/5 = (sqrt(504))/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Let me factor 504:

504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 7 * 9 = 8*7*9 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(4*126) = 2*sqrt(126) = 2*sqrt(9*14) = 2*3*sqrt(14)=6√14. So y=6√14 /5.

So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So coordinates are A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to ω. So, I need the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

First, let me find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. The circumcircle can be determined by three points. Since I have the coordinates of A, B, and C, I can find the equation of the circumcircle.

Points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0). Let me denote the circumcircle equation as (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.

Since C(0,0) lies on the circle: (0 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 → h² + k² = r².

Point A(10,0) lies on the circle: (10 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r² → (10 - h)^2 + k² = r².

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (10 - h)^2 + k² - (h² + k²) = r² - r² → (100 -20h + h²) - h² = 0 → 100 -20h =0 → h=5.

So the center has x-coordinate h=5. Now, let's plug back h=5 into the first equation: 5² +k² = r² → 25 +k² =r².

Now, plug in point B(39/5, 6√14/5) into the circle equation:

(39/5 -5)^2 + (6√14/5 -k)^2 = r².

Compute 39/5 -5: 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

So first term is (14/5)^2 = 196/25.

Second term: (6√14/5 -k)^2.

So, equation:

196/25 + (6√14/5 -k)^2 = r².

But we know r²=25 + k².

So,

196/25 + (6√14/5 -k)^2 =25 + k².

Let me expand (6√14/5 -k)^2:

= (6√14/5)^2 - 2*(6√14/5)*k +k²
= (36*14)/25 - (12√14 /5)k +k²
= 504/25 - (12√14 /5)k +k².

So plug into the equation:

196/25 +504/25 - (12√14 /5)k +k² =25 +k².

Simplify:

(196 +504)/25 - (12√14 /5)k +k² =25 +k².

700/25 =28.

So,

28 - (12√14 /5)k +k² =25 +k².

Subtract k² from both sides:

28 - (12√14 /5)k =25.

Subtract 25:

3 - (12√14 /5)k =0 → (12√14 /5)k =3 → k= (3 *5)/(12√14)= (15)/(12√14)= (5)/(4√14).

Rationalize denominator:

k=5/(4√14) * (√14/√14)=5√14/(4*14)=5√14/56.

So, the center of the circle is at (5, 5√14/56). Let me write that as (h,k)=(5, 5√14/56).

Now, the radius squared is r²=25 +k²=25 + (25*14)/(56²). Wait, let me compute k²:

k=5√14/(56), so k²=25*14/(56²)=350/(3136)=175/1568=25/224.

So, r²=25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224+1)/224=25*225/224=5625/224.

So, the equation of the circumcircle is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

Now, the tangent at point B(39/5,6√14/5) to this circle. The equation of the tangent can be found using the formula for a tangent to a circle at a given point.

The general equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = r². Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle itself. To find the tangent, I can use the fact that the tangent at (x1,y1) is (x1 -h)(x -h) + (y1 -k)(y -k)=r². Wait, no, that's the same as the circle equation. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Another method is to find the equation of the tangent line at B. Since we know the center O(5,5√14/56), the radius OB is perpendicular to the tangent at B. So, the slope of OB is (6√14/5 -5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Compute numerator: 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6*56√14 -5*5√14)/280 = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = 311√14/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5= (39 -25)/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5)= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1555 and 3920: let's see, 5*311=1555; 3920=56*70=56*7*10=8*7*7*10.

Wait, perhaps no common factors. So, slope of OB is 1555√14 /3920.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of that, since the tangent is perpendicular to OB.

So, slope of tangent at B is -3920/(1555√14).

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 3920 ÷5=784; 1555 ÷5=311.

So, slope is -784/(311√14). We can rationalize this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

slope = -784√14 / (311*14) = -784√14/(4354) = -56√14/311.

Wait, 784 ÷14=56, and 4354 ÷14=311.

Yes, so slope is -56√14/311.

So, equation of tangent at B is:

y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C(0,0). Let's compute that.

The center is O(5,5√14/56). The line OC has slope (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5√14/56)/5= √14/56.

So, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify: -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the tangent at C is the line with slope -4√14 passing through (0,0). So, its equation is y= -4√14 x.

So, now we have two tangent lines: at B with equation y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5), and at C, y = -4√14 x.

We need to find their intersection point D.

So, let's write the equations:

1. y = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

2. y = -4√14 x.

Set them equal:

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Let me divide both sides by √14 to simplify:

-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 = -56(x -39/5) + (6/5)*311.

Compute each term:

Left side: -1244x.

Right side: -56x + (56*39)/5 + (6*311)/5.

Compute 56*39: 56*40=2240 -56=2184.

So, right side is -56x + 2184/5 + (1866)/5.

Combine the constants: (2184 +1866)/5 = (4050)/5=810.

So, right side is -56x +810.

Thus, equation becomes:

-1244x = -56x +810.

Bring terms together:

-1244x +56x =810 → -1188x=810 → x=810 / (-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 810 ÷9=90; 1188 ÷9=132.

So, x= -90/132. Simplify further by dividing by 6: -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute x into equation 2 (y= -4√14 x):

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with the circumcircle ω again. So, A is at (10,0), D is at (-15/22,30√14/11). Let me find the parametric equation of AD.

Let me parameterize AD. Let me denote A as (10,0) and D as (-15/22,30√14/11). So, the vector from A to D is (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (-235/22,30√14/11).

So, parametric equations for AD can be written as:

x =10 + t*(-235/22), y= 0 + t*(30√14/11), where t ranges from 0 to 1 for the segment AD, but since we need the intersection with the circumcircle, t could be beyond 1.

So, x=10 - (235/22) t, y= (30√14/11) t.

We can plug these into the equation of ω to find the points of intersection.

The equation of ω is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

Substitute x and y:

(10 - (235/22)t -5)^2 + ((30√14/11)t -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

Simplify:

First term: (5 - (235/22)t)^2.

Second term: (30√14/11 t -5√14/56)^2.

Let me compute each term.

First term:

5 - (235/22)t = (110 -235 t)/22.

So squared: (110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2.

Second term:

Factor out √14:

√14(30/11 t -5/56).

So, squared: 14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

So, second term is 14*( (30/11 t -5/56) )^2.

Putting it all together:

[(110 -235t)^2]/(22)^2 + 14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2 =5625/224.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (110 -235t)^2:

=110² - 2*110*235 t + (235t)^2.

=12100 - 51700 t +55225 t².

Divide by 22²=484:

(12100 -51700t +55225t²)/484.

Second term: 14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

First compute the inside:

30/11 t -5/56.

Let me write with a common denominator:

30/11 t = (30*56 t)/(11*56)=1680 t/616.

5/56= (5*11)/(56*11)=55/616.

So, 30/11 t -5/56 = (1680 t -55)/616.

So, squared: (1680 t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Multiply by 14: 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Simplify:

14 and 616: 616=14*44, so 616²=14² *44².

So,

14*(1680t -55)^2 / (14² *44²) = (1680t -55)^2 / (14 *44²).

Compute 44²=1936; 14*1936=27104.

So, second term becomes (1680t -55)^2 /27104.

Now, putting it all together:

(12100 -51700t +55225t²)/484 + (1680t -55)^2 /27104 =5625/224.

This looks complicated, but perhaps I can find a common denominator or find t such that this equation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the value of t where AD meets the circumcircle again. Since A is already on the circle, when t=0, we get point
