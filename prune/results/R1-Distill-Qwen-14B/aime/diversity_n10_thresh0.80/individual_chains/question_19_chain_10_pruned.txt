Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it and figure out what I need to do.

We have triangle ABC. It has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let's recall some properties about triangles, circumcenters, incenters, and perpendicularity.

First, the circumradius (R) is given as 13. That's the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius (r) is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and it's equidistant from all sides. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and it's equidistant from all vertices.

We're told that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in other words, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I.

I think it might help to draw a diagram. Although I can't draw here, visualizing it might help.

So, in triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, I is the inradius, and IA is perpendicular to OI.

I remember that in some triangles, like in right-angled triangles, the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. But I'm not sure if ABC is a right-angled triangle here. Let me not assume that.

Let me recall some formulas that relate R, r, and other elements of the triangle.

One formula I remember is that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, I think that's a standard formula. So, if that's the case, then OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Plugging in the values, R is 13, r is 6.

So OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13). Interesting.

But wait, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I.

So, in triangle IOA, we can use Pythagoras' theorem. IA² + OI² = OA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA =13.

So, IA² + OI² = OA² => IA² + 13 = 13² => IA² +13=169 => IA²=156 => IA= sqrt(156). Let me compute sqrt(156):

156 = 4*39=4*3*13. So sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39). So IA=2√39.

But wait, IA is the length from inradius to vertex A. Hmm, I thought
