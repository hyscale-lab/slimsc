Hmm, okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. So, she walks 9 km each morning, and then she takes a coffee break. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Then it asks me to find the time it takes when she walks at a different speed, again including the coffee shop time.

Let me break down the given information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours. This includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, total time from start to finish is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee break.

2. When she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this is the total time including the coffee shop time of 't' minutes.

The question is asking: If Aya walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the coffee shop time.

So, I need to find the total time when her walking speed is s + 0.5 km/h. To find that, I probably need to first find the values of 's' and 't' from the given information.

Let me think about how to model this. Since she walks 9 kilometers, the time she spends walking alone can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

But in both cases, the total time includes the coffee shop time 't'. So, in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which includes walking time plus 't' minutes. Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes walking time plus 't' minutes.

Wait, but the problem says that when she walks at 's' km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, that 4 hours includes both the time she spends walking and the time she spends in the coffee shop. Similarly, the second scenario is 2 hours and 24 minutes total.

So, perhaps we can write two equations based on this.

First, let's convert all time units to hours since the speed is in km/h.

In the first case:
Total time = walking time + coffee shop time
4 hours = (9 / s) hours + (t / 60) hours

In the second case:
Total time = walking time + coffee shop time
2 hours 24 minutes = (9 / (s + 2)) hours + (t / 60) hours

But 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So, we can write these two equations:

1. 4 = (9/s) + (t/60)
2. 2.4 = (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables, 's' and 't'. We can solve this system.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 4 = (9/s) + (t/60)
Equation 2: 2.4 = (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60)

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 't'.

So, equation 1 minus equation 2 gives:

4 - 2.4 = [9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60]

Simplify left side: 1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

So, 1.6 = 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [(s + 2) - s]/[s(s + 2)] = 2/(s(s + 2))

So, 1.6 = 9*(2/(s(s + 2)))

Simplify:

1.6 = 18/(s(s + 2))

We can write this as 18/(s^2 + 2s) = 1.6

Let me solve for s.

Multiply both sides by (s^2 + 2s):

18 = 1.6*(s^2 + 2s)

Convert 1.6 to a fraction to make it easier. 1.6 is 8/5.

So, 18 = (8/5)*(s^2 + 2s)

Multiply both sides by 5:

90 = 8*(s^2 + 2s)

Divide both sides by 2:

45 = 4*(s^2 + 2s)

Wait, no: 90/8 is 11.25. Wait, perhaps I should compute 8*(s^2 + 2s) = 90.

So,

8s^2 + 16s = 90

Let me bring all terms to one side:

8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0

Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for 's'.

Using the quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) = 28

So,

s = [-8 ± 28]/(2*4) = (-8 ±28)/8

We have two solutions:

1. (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

2. (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

Since speed cannot be negative, we take s = 2.5 km/h.

Okay, so s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the equations. Let's use equation 1.

4 = (9/s) + t/60

Plug s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours

So,

4 = 3.6 + (t/60)

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

0.4 = t/60

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks: When Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how many minutes does the walk take her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

First, let's compute her new speed: s + 0.5 = 2.5 +
