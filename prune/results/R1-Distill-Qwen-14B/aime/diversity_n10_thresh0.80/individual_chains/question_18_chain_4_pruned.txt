Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives 150 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

So, the problem is about counting rectangles. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. In the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides or diagonals must form these right angles. So, I need to figure out how to select four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many sides they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal can connect to the next vertex (which is just a side), then skip one, two, etc., up to five vertices because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.

But wait, no, in a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like 12, the maximum number of vertices a diagonal can skip without being a side is (n/2 - 1). So for 12, that would be 5. So, diagonals can connect to the adjacent vertex (side), then skip 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.

But wait, for a dodecagon, a diagonal that skips 6 vertices would actually be a diameter, right? Because 12 divided by 2 is 6, so those are diameters. So maybe I should consider those as a separate category.

Hmm, so perhaps the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. So, sides skip 0 vertices (they connect adjacent vertices), diagonals can skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 vertices. So, 6 types of line segments in total.

But for forming rectangles, I think we need two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are equally spaced, so the sides of a rectangle would have to be aligned in such a way that their slopes correspond to certain symmetries.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. Each side or diagonal can be represented as a vector in the complex plane, where each vertex is a 30-degree increment (since 360/12 = 30 degrees). So, the vectors would have angles that are multiples of 30 degrees.

For two vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, if I have two vectors with angles θ and φ, then cos(θ - φ) must be zero. That happens when θ - φ is
