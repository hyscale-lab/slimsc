Okay, so I have this problem to solve. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, let me start by understanding what's being asked. I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. After finding p, I then need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, let's break down the problem. So, I'm looking for primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means that in the field modulo p², the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 has a solution.

I remember that for primes p, the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic if p is an odd prime. For p=2, it's a bit different. So, perhaps I should check small primes one by one and see if such an n exists.

Let me try small primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4.

Wait, n can be 0,1,2,3 mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4.

0⁴=0, 1⁴=1, 2⁴=16≡0 mod4, 3⁴=81≡1 mod4.

So, n⁴ mod4 is either 0 or 1. So, n⁴ +1 mod4 is 1 or 2. So, n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod4. So, p=2 is not possible.

Next, p=3. Check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

So, compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 1 to 8 (since mod9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9. So 1 +1=2≠0 mod9.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7+1=8≠0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=4: 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0.

n=5: 625 mod9. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0.

n=6: 1296 mod9=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=7: 7⁴= (49)²=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1 → 1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So, no n satisfies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

Alternatively, perhaps compute for n from 1 to 12, since mod25 is symmetric around 13.

n=1: 1 mod25. 1+1=2≠0.

n=2: 16 mod25. 16+1=17≠0.

n=3: 81 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=4: 256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6). 6+1=7≠0.

n=5: 625 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25: 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25: 2400 is 25*96, so 2401 mod25=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075, 4096-4075=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=9: 9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 6560 is 25*262.4, wait 25*262=6550, 6561-6550=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=10: 10⁴=10000 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=11: 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25: 14625 is 25*585, 14641-14625=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 20700 is 25*828, 20736-20700=36. 36 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=13: Same as 12, since 13 ≡ -12 mod25, but 13⁴= ( (-12) )⁴=12⁴. So same as above, mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

Wait, maybe I should try more n's. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Euler's theorem. Since 25 is 5², Euler's totient function φ(25)=20. So, multiplicative order modulo 25 divides 20.

I need to find if x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25 has a solution.

Since -1 mod25 is 24. So, x⁴ ≡24 mod25.

In the multiplicative group mod25, which is cyclic of order 20, so elements have orders dividing 20. So, for x⁴=24, then 24 must be a fourth power in the group.

But 24 is -1 mod25. So, is -1 a fourth power mod25?

Alternatively, let me find the order of -1 in the multiplicative group. The order of -1 is 2 because (-1)^2=1. So, to have x⁴ = -1, the order of x must be such that 4 is a multiple of the order of -1. Hmm, perhaps not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a primitive root modulo 25 and express -1 as a power of that primitive root.

I know that 2 is a primitive root mod5, but is it mod25?

Let's check. The multiplicative order of 2 mod25.

Compute 2^φ(25)=2^20 ≡1 mod25.

What is the order? Let's see, 2^10 mod25.

2^10=1024; 1024 mod25: 25*40=1000, 1024-1000=24. So, 2^10 ≡24≡-1 mod25.

Then, 2^20=(2^10)^2 ≡ (-1)^2=1 mod25. So, the order of 2 mod25 is 20. So, yes, 2 is a primitive root modulo25.

So, express -1 as 2^k. Since 2^10 ≡-1 mod25, so k=10.

So, if x is a primitive root, then x^k ≡-1. So, for x=2, x^10≡-1.

So, if x is 2, then x^10≡-1.

So, to get x⁴≡-1, we need x^4 ≡2^10.

Which would imply that x≡2^(10/4)=2^(2.5). But exponents must be integers, so perhaps this approach isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps x=2^k. So, (2^k)^4=2^(4k)=2^10 mod25.

Therefore, 4k ≡10 mod20 (since the order is 20). So, 4k=10 mod20 → 2k=5 mod10.

But 2k=5 mod10 has no solution because 2k is even and 5 is odd. Therefore, 4k≡10 mod20 has no solution.

Wait, that would suggest that there's no solution x such that x⁴ ≡-1 mod25. But that can't be right because I thought p=5 would work. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's check if -1 is a quadratic residue modulo25.

Wait, but in this case, it's a fourth power. So, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps try n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25=2401 - 96*25=2401-2400=1. So, 1 mod25. So, 1+1=2≠0 mod25.

Wait, maybe n=2: n=2, 2^
