Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from one corner to the other, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the problem mentions paths of length 16.

Now, when they say the paths change direction exactly four times, I think that means the path alternates between moving right and up four times. Wait, no, maybe it's the number of turns. So, if a path is going right, then up, then right, then up, etc., each time it turns, it's a change in direction. So, for a path that goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, that would have two changes, right? Because it goes from right to up, then up to right, then right to up. Wait, no, that's three changes. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully.

In grid paths, each time you switch from moving horizontally (right) to vertically (up) or vice versa, that's a direction change. So, if a path has four direction changes, how many segments does it have? Each direction change adds a new segment. So, starting from the first segment, each change adds one. So, four changes would mean five segments. Because you start with one segment, then each change adds another.

So, for four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. Now, each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length.

In an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), the total right steps are 8 and the total up steps are 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the right segments is 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments is 8.

Now, if the path has five segments, some of them are right and some are up. Let's think about how many right and up segments there are.

If the path starts with a right segment, then alternates up, right, up, etc. So, for five segments, starting with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. Wait, that's four changes, right? Because each switch is a change. So, right to up is one change, up to right is two, right to up is three, and up to right is four changes. So, that gives a total of four changes, resulting in five segments.

Alternatively, if it starts with up, then the segments would be up, right, up, right, up. That's also four changes, five segments. So, the path can either start with right or up, and then alternate.

So, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether it starts with right or up.

Wait, let me think. For four direction changes, how many right and up segments are there?

If the path starts with right, then the number of right segments is (number of direction changes + 2)/2. Let's see: starting with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. So, 3 right and 2 up.

Similarly, if the path starts with up, then the segments would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three up segments and two right segments.

So, the total right steps can be divided into either three right segments or two right segments, depending on the starting direction.

Wait, but in our problem, the total right steps are 8. So, if we have three right segments, each must be at least 1 step, so the number of ways to partition 8 into three parts is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21 ways. Similarly, the up segments would be partitioned into two parts, each at least 1, so C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7 ways. So, for paths starting with right, the number of such paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, if the path starts with up, the right segments would be in two parts, so C(7,1) =7 ways, and the up segments would be in three parts, C(7,2)=21 ways. So, the number of paths starting with up is also 7 *21=147.

So, the total number of paths changing direction exactly four times is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but let me verify this logic. So, each time we have to partition the steps into a certain number of segments, each at least 1. The number of ways to partition n into k parts is C(n-1,k-1). That's correct.

So, for starting with right, right segments are 3, so C(7,2)=21. Up segments are 2, so C(7,1)=7. So, total for starting with right is 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with up, right segments are 2, so 7, and up segments are 3, 21. So, total is 7*21=147. So, adding both, 294.

Wait, but another way to think about this: the number of direction changes is four.
