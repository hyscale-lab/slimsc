Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to model this. It seems like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I've heard of concepts like winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the losing positions would be the ones where if it's your turn and the number of tokens is a losing position, you can't force a win. The goal is to find all n ≤ 2024 where Bob can force a win, which would mean that n is a losing position for Alice, as she goes first.

Wait, actually, no. If Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's play, that means that for those n, Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win. So I need to find all n where starting from n, the second player (Bob) can win.

So, let's try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation for the winning and losing positions.

Let me denote a position as a losing position if the current player cannot force a win. So, for each n, if all moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then n is a losing position.

Let me try to list the positions starting from n=0 upwards.

n=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over, so the player who just moved has won. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move.

But wait, in the problem statement, the player who removes the last token wins. So, if n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, can't take 4 tokens because n=2 <4. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So,
