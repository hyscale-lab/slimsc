Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize and understand the problem first. 

There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, and F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, it's called cyclic, so maybe that can help me somehow. 

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE. Hmm, okay. Let me try to draw this out in my mind. 

First, rectangles have all right angles, so each corner is 90 degrees. Let's label the rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D. So, AB is 107 units, which is the length, and BC is 16 units, so that's the width. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has EF as 184 and FG as 17. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width of the second rectangle.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they all lie on a straight line. Let me imagine that line. So, point D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F. So, the order must be D-E-C-F on a straight line. Or maybe another order? Wait, but D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, right? So, in rectangle ABCD, the corners are A-B-C-D, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, CD is equal to AB, which is 107. And BC is 16, so the rectangle ABCD is 107 units long and 16 units wide.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, it's a longer and narrower rectangle. Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, I'm thinking that D and C are on one end, and E and F on the other. Or maybe D is connected to E, which is connected to C, which is connected to F. So, the line goes D-E-C-F. Let me confirm that arrangement.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD is a diagonal, right? So, in rectangle ABCD, the diagonal AD connects A to D. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, the diagonal GH connects G to H. So, A, D, H, G lying on a circle suggests that these diagonals might be related in some way.

Wait, but if A, D, H, G are on a circle, then the quadrilateral ADGH is cyclic. That means that the opposite angles of ADGH sum up to 180 degrees. Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps yet. Maybe there's a way to relate the lengths through the circle.

Let me think about the positions of the rectangles. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps the rectangles are placed such that side DC of rectangle ABCD is aligned with side EF of rectangle EFGH but extended or something. Wait, no, because DC is 107, and EF is 184, which is longer. So maybe they are placed side by side or overlapping on that line.

Wait, but the points are D-E-C-F on a straight line. So, starting from D, then E, then C, then F. So, the distance from D to E, E to C, and C to F must add up to the total distance from D to F. But I don't know that yet.

Let me assign some variables to the lengths to make it clearer. Let me denote:

- DE = x
- EC = y (this is what we need to
