Okay, so I have this math problem here, and it's about sets and Venn diagrams, I think. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

There are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each resident owns some combination of four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Wait, actually, the candy hearts are something every resident owns. Oh, so everyone has at least a bag of candy hearts. That's an important point.

Now, the numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- 437 own exactly two of these things.
- 234 own exactly three of these things.

And we need to find how many own all four. Hmm. So, the four things are: diamond ring (let's call it D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But since every resident owns a candy heart, that means C is universal—everyone is in C. So, when considering the other three items, D, G, S, we can think of the problem in terms of these three sets within the universal set C.

Wait, actually, maybe not. Because when the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts," that means the total number is 900, each with at least C. So, the total universe is 900, and all sets we consider are subsets of this.

So, the problem becomes: find the number of people who own all four items (D, G, S, C). But since everyone owns C, that's equivalent to finding the number of people who own all three of D, G, S. Wait, because C is already included in everyone. So, the intersection of all four is the same as the intersection of D, G, S. Because if someone owns all three of D, G, S, they must also own C, since everyone owns C. Wait, no: actually, the intersection of D, G, S, C is the same as the intersection of D, G, S, because C is universal. So, the count of people owning all four is equal to the number of people owning D, G, S.

But let me think again. Since C is universal, any person who owns D, G, S automatically owns C. So, the number of people who own all four is exactly the number of people who own D ∩ G ∩ S.

So, the problem reduces to finding |D ∩ G ∩ S|, given the other numbers.

Wait, but how? Let's recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But in this problem, we aren't directly given |D ∪ G ∪ S|, but perhaps we can find it from other information.

Wait, the problem states that each resident owns at least C, which is always true, but they can
