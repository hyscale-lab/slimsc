Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. And when I read it top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. Hmm, let me try to visualize this grid.

So the grid is two rows and three columns. Let me label the cells for clarity. Let's say the top row has cells A, B, C and the bottom row has cells D, E, F. So the two numbers formed left to right would be ABC and DEF, right? And the three numbers formed top to bottom are AD, BE, CF.

Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. When reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number because it's a 2x3 grid. So column 1 is AD, column 2 is BE, and column 3 is CF. So the sum of AD + BE + CF should be 99.

And reading left to right, each row is a three-digit number. So the first row is ABC, the second row is DEF, and ABC + DEF = 999. Got it.

So, the constraints are:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Each of the cells A, B, C, D, E, F is a single digit (0-9), but I should note that in the example, A is 0, so leading zeros are allowed. So ABC and DEF can be numbers like 0BC or 0EF, which are essentially two-digit or one-digit numbers, but when added together, sum to 999.

Wait, but 999 is a three-digit number, so ABC and DEF must each be three-digit numbers. Wait, but wait, if ABC is 0BC, that's a two-digit number, right? But when added to DEF, which is also a three-digit number, how can their sum be 999? Because 0BC + DEF would be a three-digit number starting with DEF's first digit. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, for example, in the given example, ABC is 008, which is 8, and DEF is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999. So ABC can be a single-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number as long as when added to DEF, the sum is 999.

So ABC + DEF = 999, which is a three-digit number. So each of ABC and DEF can be one, two, or three-digit numbers, but their sum is fixed at 999.

Similarly, AD + BE + CF = 99. Each of AD, BE, CF is a two-digit number or a one-digit number if D, E, or F are zero. Wait, AD is a two-digit number because A is in the top and D is in the bottom. So AD is 10*A + D, right? Similarly, BE is 10*B + E, and CF is 10*C + F. So the sum is (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Alternatively, that's equal to 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99. Hmm, so that's one equation.

So, let me write down the equations.

First equation: (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Second equation: 10*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote S = A + B + C, and T = D + E + F. Then the second equation becomes 10S + T = 99. So from this, we can solve for S and T.

10S + T = 99.

Since S and T are sums of digits, each is between 0 and 27 (since 9*3=27). But 10S + T =99. Let's solve for S and T.

Let me see, 10S = 99 - T.

But T must be between 0 and 27, so 99 - T is between 72 and 99. Therefore, 10S must be in that range, so S must be between 7.2 and 9.9. But S is an integer, so S can be 8, 9,
