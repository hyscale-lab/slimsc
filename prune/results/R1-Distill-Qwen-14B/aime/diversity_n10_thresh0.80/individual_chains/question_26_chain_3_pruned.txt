Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to express AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to visualize the problem. The Asymptote code is given, but since I can't actually see the image, I'll imagine it based on the description. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. Points B and C have tangents to the circumcircle ω, which meet at D. Then AD is drawn, intersecting ω again at P. So, points A, B, C on the circle, tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects the circle at P.

I remember that for tangents from a common external point to a circle, the lengths are equal. So, DB and DC are equal because they are both tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

I need to find AP. Hmm. Since P is on the circumcircle and on AD, maybe I can use properties related to power of a point or something like that.

The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², and since D lies outside ω, the power is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant intersecting ω at A and P, so power of D is DP * DA = DB².

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate DP and DA.

Wait, but I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can compute it using triangle ABC's sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates of the points and compute everything analytically. That might be a bit more involved but perhaps more straightforward.

Let me think about coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC=10, I can place point A at (10, 0). Point B is somewhere in the plane; given that AB=5 and BC=9, I can find its coordinates.

Let me set up coordinate system:

- Let C = (0, 0)
- Let A = (10, 0)
- Let B = (x, y)

Now, AB = 5: distance from A (10,0) to B (x,y) is 5. So,

√[(x - 10)^2 + (y)^2] = 5
=> (x - 10)^2 + y^2 = 25 ...(1)

Also, BC = 9: distance from B (x,y) to C (0,0) is 9.

√[x^2 + y^2] = 9
=> x^2 + y^2 = 81 ...(2)

So, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

x^2 + y^2 - [(x - 10)^2 + y^2] = 81 - 25
x^2 - (x^2 - 20x + 100) = 56
x^2 - x^2 + 20x - 100 = 56
20x - 100 = 56
20x = 156
x = 156 / 20 = 39/5 = 7.8

So, x = 7.8, which is 39/5.

Now, plug x back into equation (2) to find y:

(39/5)^2 + y^2 = 81
(1521/25) + y^2 = 81
y^2 = 81 - (1521/25)
Convert 81 to 2025/25:

y^2 = 2025/25 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25
So, y = √(504/25) = (√504)/5

Simplify √504: 504 = 16 * 31.5 → Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 16 * 31.5 is 504, but 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't an integer. Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Hmm, maybe I should factorize 504.

504 = 16 * 31.5 no, 504 / 16 is 31.5. Wait, perhaps another way.

Wait, 504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 9 * 8 = 7 * 9 * 8 = 7 * 3^2 * 2^3. So, √504 = √(7 * 3^2 * 2^3) = 3 * 2 * √(2*7) )= 6√14. So, √504 = 6√14. Therefore, y = (6√14)/5.

So, point B is at (39/5, (6√14)/5).

Now, I need to find point D, the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

Wait, point C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is... Hmm, since point C is on the circle ω, the tangent at C would be perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the circumcenter. So, I need to find the circumcenter O first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equation of the tangent at B and the tangent at C, find their intersection point D, then compute AD and find its intersection with ω again at P.

So, steps:

1. Find circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

But to find the equation of ω, I need to find its center O and radius.

Circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC, and AC.

Let me find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and find their intersection.

First, find midpoints of AB and AC.

Midpoint of AB: A is (10,0), B is (39/5, 6√14/5).

Midpoint M1 = [(10 + 39/5)/2, (0 + 6√14/5)/2]

Convert 10 to 50/5: so (50/5 + 39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2 = 89/10

Similarly, the y-coordinate: (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5.

So, M1 is (89/10, 3√14/5).

The slope of AB is (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6√14/5) / (-11/5) = -6√14/11.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 11/(6√14).

So, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB: passing through M1 (89/10, 3√14/5), with slope 11/(6√14).

Similarly, find the perpendicular bisector of AC.

Midpoint of AC: A (10,0), C (0,0); midpoint M2 is (5, 0).

Slope of AC: (0 - 0)/(0 - 10) = 0. So, AC is a horizontal line. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, passing through M2 (5,0). So, equation is x = 5.

So, now we have two perpendicular bisectors: one is x=5, and the other is the line through M1 (89/10, 3√14/5) with slope 11/(6√14).

Find their intersection point, which is the circumcenter O.

So, substitute x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Let me write the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB. Using point-slope form:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10)

Substitute x=5:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10)

Compute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 - 89/10 = (-39)/10.

So,

y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))*(-39/10)

Simplify: (11/(6√14)) * (-39/10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14)

So,

y = (3√14)/5 - (143)/(20√14)

To combine the terms, let's rationalize the second term:

(143)/(20√14) = (143√14)/(20*14) = (143√14)/280.

Similarly, (3√14)/5 is equal to (3√14 * 56)/280 = (168√14)/280.

So,

y = (168√14)/280 - (143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems a bit small for the y-coordinate. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let's re-do the calculation step by step.

Compute (11/(6√14)) * (-39/10):

First, 11 * (-39) = -429.

Denominator: 6√14 * 10 = 60√14.

So, this is -429/(60√14).

We can simplify this:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -143/(20√14).

Then, rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

-143√14 / (20 * 14) = -143√14 / 280.

So, that's correct.

So, the first term is 3√14/5. Let's convert that to denominator 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14 / 280.

So, y = (168√14)/280 - (143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280.

Simplify 25/280: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5/56.

So, y = (5√14)/56.

So, O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems correct. So, O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Now, compute the radius R of ω. The distance from O to A is the radius.

Point A is (10,0). So,

R² = (10 - 5)^2 + (0 - 5√14/56)^2 = (5)^2 + ( -5√14/56 )^2 = 25 + (25*14)/(56^2).

Compute 25*14 = 350.

56^2 = 3136.

So, R² = 25 + 350/3136 = 25 + 350/(3136).

Simplify 350/3136: divide numerator and denominator by 14: 25/224.

So, R² = 25 + 25/224 = (25*224 + 25)/224 = 25*(224 + 1)/224 = 25*225/224 = (25*225)/224.

Wait, 224 is 32*7, 225 is 15². So, R = √(25*225/224) = (5*15)/√224 = 75/√224.

Simplify √224: √(16*14) = 4√14. So, R = 75/(4√14) = 75√14/(4*14) = 75√14/56.

Wait, that's interesting. So, R = 75√14/56.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for R²:

(10 -5)^2 = 25.

(0 - 5√14/56)^2 = (25*14)/(56^2) = 350/3136 = 25/224.

So, R² = 25 + 25/224 = 25*(1 + 1/224) = 25*(225/224) = 5625/224.

So, R = √(5625/224) = 75/√224 = 75√224 / 224.

Wait, wait. Let me compute √(5625/224):

√5625 = 75, √224 = √(16*14) = 4√14. So, √(5625/224) = 75/(4√14) = (75√14)/56.

Yes, so R = 75√14/56.

So, the circumradius is 75√14/56.

Now, I need to find the equation of the tangent at B to ω.

The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the slope of the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.

First, compute the slope of OB. Point O is at (5, 5√14/56), and point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

Compute the slope of OB:

Slope = (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6√14/5 - 5√14/56) ] / [ (39/5 - 5) ]

Compute numerator:

Convert to common denominator 56:

6√14/5 = (6√14 * 11.2)/56? Wait, or 6√14/5 = (6√14 * 56/5)/56. Wait, better to compute numerically.

Wait, 6√14/5 = (6√14)* (56/56) /5
