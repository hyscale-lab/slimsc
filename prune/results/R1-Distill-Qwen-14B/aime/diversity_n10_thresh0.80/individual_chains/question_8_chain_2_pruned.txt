Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It tells me that the sum of the three variables is 300. Since they're nonnegative integers, they can be zero as well. So, each of a, b, c is an integer greater than or equal to zero, and their sum is fixed.

The second equation is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor or rewrite this in a more manageable way. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, a²b and a²c both have a squared. Similarly, b²a and b²c have b squared, and so on.

Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try factoring a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, factoring b² from the next two terms gives b²(a + c), and factoring c² from the last two gives c²(a + b). So, putting it together:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems useful. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So now the equation is in terms of a, b, c, each multiplied by 300 minus themselves. Let's write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I can factor 300 from the quadratic terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

That might be helpful. Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ac, and S3 = abc. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the expression in terms of S1, S2, S3.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S1 and S2. Since (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac), so:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

So substituting back into the equation:

300(90,000 - 2S2) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Calculating 300*90,000: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

So, 27,000,000 - 600S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Rearranging this:

-600S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -21,000,000.

Multiply both sides by -1:

600S2 + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

Okay, so now I have an equation involving S2 and the sum of cubes. Let me denote T = a³ + b³ + c³.

So, 600S2 + T = 21,000,000. Let me write that as equation (1).

Now, I also know that for three variables, the sum of cubes can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, S3. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Using S1, S2, S3, that's:

T = S1³ - 3S1 S2 + 3S3.

Plugging in S1 = 300:

T = 300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3.

Calculating 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So, T = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3.

Now, substitute this into equation (1):

600 S2 + (27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3) = 21,000,000.

Simplify:

600 S2 + 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000.

Combine like terms:

(600 S2 - 900 S2) + 27,000,000 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000.

That's (-300 S2) + 27,000,000 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000.

Bring constants to the right-hand side:

-300 S2 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

-100 S2 + S3 = -2,000,000.

Multiply both sides by -1:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, S3 is expressed in terms of S2.

Now, let's recap:

We have S1 = 300.

We have S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

I also know that in symmetric sums, for three variables, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

So, the polynomial would be x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 0.

Let me write that as x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - 100 S2 + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor this equation?

Wait, maybe I can factor terms involving S2:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, think about possible integer roots given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the polynomial must have roots at a, b, c, which are integers. So, perhaps using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of the constant term.

Wait, but the constant term is (-1)*(- (100 S2 - 2,000,000)) = 100 S2 - 2,000,000. Hmm, but since S2 is variable, this might not be straightforward. Maybe another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the possible values of S2. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, the maximum value of S2 is when two variables are 150 and the third is 0, so S2_max = 150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0 = 22,500. Similarly, the minimum value of S2 is 0 when one variable is 300 and the others are 0. So, S2 ranges from 0 to 22,500.

But S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, S3 must also be a nonnegative integer. So, 100 S2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 => S2 ≥ 20,000.

But wait, S2 can't be more than 22,500, as I said earlier. So, S2 must be between 20,000 and 22,500, inclusive.

So, 20,000 ≤ S2 ≤ 22,500.

So, S2 can take integer values from 20,000 to 22,500, inclusive.

Let me compute the number of possible S2 values: 22,500 - 20,000 + 1 = 2,501.

But each S2 may not correspond to a valid triple (a, b, c). We need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = S2, and abc = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Wait, perhaps I can think about S2 and S3 in terms of variables.

Given S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000, and S1 = 300, S2 is known.

So, for each S2 from 20,000 to 22,500, I can compute S3, and then see if the equation x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0 has three nonnegative integer roots a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of variables in terms of two of them, say, a and b, then c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute into the equation for S2 and S3.

Wait, let me try that.

Let me express S2 = ab + bc + ac. Since c = 300 - a - b, then:

S2 = ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b).

Let me expand this:

S2 = ab + 300b - ab - b² + 300a - a² - ab.

Simplify term by term:

ab cancels with -ab, so:

S2 = 300b - b² + 300a - a² - ab.

Combine like terms:

S2 = (300a + 300b) - (a² + b² + ab).

Hmm, that's interesting.

Similarly, S3 = abc = ab(300 - a - b).

So, since S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000, then:

ab(300 - a - b) = 100*(300a + 300b - a² - b² - ab) - 2,000,000.

Let me compute the right-hand side:

100*(300a + 300b - a² - b² - ab) = 30,000a + 30,000b - 100a² - 100b² - 100ab.

Subtracting 2,000,000:

30,000a + 30,000b - 100a² - 100b² - 100ab - 2,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

ab(300 -
