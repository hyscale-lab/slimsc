Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me read it again:

We have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, so first, I should recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles only if it's a square. Wait, no, a rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, yes, that's right. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Wait, but in this problem, the diagonals intersect at the origin. So the origin is the point where the diagonals cross each other.

So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, right? Because the diagonals intersect at the origin.

Given that, the vertices of the rhombus are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the opposite vertex C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, the other two vertices B and D would be symmetric in some way.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, each diagonal is split into two equal parts by the origin.

So, the coordinates of A, B, C, D can be thought of as follows:

Let’s say that the diagonals are AC and BD. Then, since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so AC is perpendicular to BD.

Moreover, the rhombus is formed by the four points, so each vertex is on the hyperbola.

So, points A and C are opposite vertices of the rhombus, and points B and D are the other two opposite vertices.

Since the rhombus is determined by the diagonals AC and BD, which intersect at the origin, then points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, as are B and D.

Therefore, if point A is (x1, y1), then C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, point B is (x2, y2), so D is (-x2, -y2).

But wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not sides but lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in this case, the diagonals AC and BD cross at the origin.

So, I need to model this.

So, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Let me note that the hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening horizontally, since the positive term is with x².

So, the hyperbola equation is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Given that, points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and the figure ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, meaning the origin is the midpoint for both diagonals.

So, as I said earlier, A is (x1, y1), C is (-x1, -y1), B is (x2, y2), D is (-x2, -y2).

Moreover, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1.

So, the slope of AC is (y1 - (-y1))/(x1 - (-x1)) = (2y1)/(2x1) = y1/x1.

Similarly, the slope of BD is (y2 - (-y2))/(x2 - (-x2)) = (2y2)/(2x2) = y2/x2.

Since they are perpendicular, (y1/x1) * (y2/x2) = -1.

So, (y1 y2)/(x1 x2) = -1.

So, y1 y2 = -x1 x2.

That's one condition.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, etc.

But perhaps it's easier to work with vectors.

Let me think: The sides of the rhombus can be thought of as vectors.

So, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude, and the vectors should be such that the angle between them is determined by the hyperbola.

Wait, another approach: Since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, and their slopes are negative reciprocals because they are perpendicular.

So, let me parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola.

Let’s assume that point A is (x, y), so point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, point B is (u, v), so point D is (-u, -v).

Since the diagonals are AC and BD, which are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is -1.
