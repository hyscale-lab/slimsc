Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her entire walk takes 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, her walk time drops to 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking what the total time would be if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including t minutes.

Alright, let me note down the key points:

1. Distance walked: 9 km
2. Speed 1: s km/h, total time: 4 hours (which includes walking and coffee time t)
3. Speed 2: s + 2 km/h, total time: 2 hours 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours, or maybe I should convert it to minutes? Let me think.)

Wait, actually, probably better to work in the same units. Since one speed is given in km/h, and the time is given in hours and minutes, I might convert everything to hours or everything to minutes. Hmm.

Wait, 4 hours is straightforward, but 2 hours 24 minutes would be 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Alternatively, 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours 24 is 144 minutes. Hmm, maybe working in minutes is better because t is given in minutes. Let me try that approach.

So, let me define variables:

- Let t be the time spent in the coffee shop, in minutes.
- Let T1 be the total time when she walks at s km/h: 4 hours = 240 minutes.
- Let T2 be the total time when she walks at s+2 km/h: 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes.

Wait, but her walking time is part of the total time. So, the total time T1 includes both the time she spends walking and the coffee time t. Similarly, T2 includes walking time plus t.

So, let me denote:

At speed s km/h, the walking time is T1w = (9 / s) hours. But wait, T1 is 4 hours, which includes walking time and coffee time. So, T1 = walking time + t. But t is in minutes, so maybe I should convert everything to minutes.

Let me think again.

Distance = speed × time. So, time = distance / speed.

So, walking time at speed s km/h is (9 / s) hours. Convert that to minutes, it's (9 / s) * 60 minutes.

Similarly, walking time at speed s + 2 km/h is (9 / (s + 2)) hours, which is (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 minutes.

Now, the total time when walking at s km/h is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. That total time is equal to the walking time plus t. So,

(9 / s) * 60 + t = 240.  [Equation 1]

Similarly, when walking at s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes. So,

(9 / (s + 2)) * 60 + t = 144.  [Equation 2]

So, now I have two equations:

1. (540 / s) + t = 240
2. (540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So,

(540/s - 540/(s+2)) = 240 - 144
540/s - 540/(s+2) = 96

Let me compute that left side.

Factor out 540:

540 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 96

Compute the difference inside:

[ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

540 * [2 / (s(s + 2)))] = 96

Simplify:

(1080) / [s(s + 2)] = 96

Now, cross-multiplied:

1080 = 96 * s (s + 2)

Divide both sides by 24 to simplify:

1080 /24 = 4 * s(s + 2)

1080 ÷24 is 45. Wait, 24*45=1080. Yes.

So,

45 = 4 s(s + 2)

So,

4 s^2 + 8 s = 45

Bring 45 to left:

4 s^2 + 8 s -45 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of s.

Let me write it as:

4s² +8s -45 = 0

I can solve for s using the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

Discriminant D = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784)=28

So,

s = [ -8 ±28 ]/(2*4) = [20 or -36]/8

Since speed can't be negative, s = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5? Wait, 8*2.5 is 20, yes.

Wait, but 20/8 is 2.5, right. So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Hmm. Let me double-check that.

Because if s=2.5, then s + 2 =4.5 km/h.

So, walking time at s: 9 /2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. Then, adding t minutes. Wait, the total time when walking at s is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, walking time is 3.6 hours, which is 3*60 + 36 = 216 minutes. So, 216 + t =240, so t=24 minutes. That seems okay.

Similarly, at s+2=4.5 km/h, walking time is 9 /4.5=2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Then, total time is 120 +24=144 minutes, which is 2 hours 24 minutes. That matches the problem statement.

So, s=2.5 km/h, t=24 minutes.

Now, the question is, what's the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h?

s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 =3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 /3 =3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Adding the coffee time t=24 minutes, total time is 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes. So, the total time is 204 minutes.

Alternatively, 204 minutes is 3 hours and 24 minutes. But the question just asks for the number of minutes, so the answer is 204.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, so s=2.5 km/h, so s +1/2=3 km/h. So, time=9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Plus 24 minutes, so 204.

Yes, that seems right.

Let me recapitulate:

We had two equations based on the given total times.

Subtracting them gave us an equation to solve for s, which came out to 2.5 km/h.

From there, found t=24 minutes.

Then, with s + 1/2=3 km/h, calculated the walking time as 3 hours, added t=24 minutes, giving 204 minutes.

So, everything checks out. I think 204 is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given information and setting up equations based on the total time spent walking and in the coffee shop.

1. **Key Information:**
   - Distance walked: 9 km
   - At speed \( s \) km/h, total time = 4 hours (240 minutes)
   - At speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes)
   - Total time includes walking time and coffee time \( t \) (in minutes).

2. **Equations:**
   - Walking time at \( s \) km/h is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, which is \( \frac{540}{s} \) minutes.
   - Walking time at \( s + 2 \) km/h is \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours, which is \( \frac{540}{s + 2} \) minutes.
   - Total time equations:
     \[
     \frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{540}{s + 2} + t = 144 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]

3. **Subtracting Equations:**
   Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate \( t \):
   \[
   \frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 96
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1080}{s(s + 2)} = 96
   \]
   \[
   1080 = 96s(s + 2)
   \]
   \[
   4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
   \]

4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   Using the quadratic formula \( s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 4 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -45 \):
   \[
   s = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
   \]
   The positive solution is \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

5. **Finding \( t \):**
   Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   \frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240
   \]
   \[
   216 + t = 240
   \]
   \[
   t = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculating Time at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h:**
   New speed = \( 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h.
   Walking time = \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours = 180 minutes.
   Total time including coffee shop:
   \[
   180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Answer:** The total time is \boxed{204} minutes.
