Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about Aya's morning walk. She walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. We're given two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including some time spent in the coffee shop. Then, we're asked to find the total time when she walks at a different speed.

First, let me try to parse the problem carefully.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour. The total time for her walk is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals 4 hours.

In the second scenario, she walks at a speed of 's + 2' kilometers per hour. The total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. So, the time she spends walking plus 't' minutes equals 2 hours and 24 minutes.

We are supposed to find the total time when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

Alright, so the key here is to find out the values of 's' (her initial walking speed) and 't' (the time she spends in the coffee shop). Once we have those, we can calculate the time when her speed is 's + 1/2' km/h.

Let me note down the given information:

1. Distance walked each morning: 9 km.

2. First scenario:
   - Speed: s km/h
   - Total time including coffee shop: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 240 minutes.

3. Second scenario:
   - Speed: (s + 2) km/h
   - Total time including coffee shop: 2 hours 24 minutes = 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes
   - So, walking time + t = 144 minutes.

We need to find the total time when speed is (s + 1/2) km/h, which includes 't' minutes.

Let me structure this. Let's denote the walking time without coffee as 't_walk'. So, for the first scenario:

t_walk1 + t = 240 minutes.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

t_walk2 + t = 144 minutes.

But wait, actually, the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours including t minutes. So, perhaps the walking time is 4 hours minus t.

Similarly, in the second case, the walking time is 2h24m minus t.

Wait, but let's clarify: When she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes the coffee time. So, the walking time would be 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks at s + 2, the walking time is (2h24m) minus t.

But t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. So, perhaps we need to convert everything into the same units for consistency. Let me convert all time into hours or all into minutes.

Hmm, let's see. Probably, let's convert everything into hours because speed is in km/h.

So, 4 hours = 4 hours.

2 hours 24 minutes: 24 minutes is 24/60 hours = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours.

t is given in minutes in both cases. So, in the first case, t = 240 - t_walk1 minutes.

But t_walk1 is the walking time when she walks at speed s. Since time = distance / speed, t_walk1 = 9 / s hours.

Similarly, in the second case, t_walk2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

But the total time, including coffee, is 4 hours and 2.4 hours, respectively.

Wait, perhaps I should represent everything in hours to make it consistent.

Let me try that.

First scenario:

t_walk1 = 9 / s hours.

Total time = t_walk1 + t / 60 = 4 hours.

Because t is in minutes, so to convert to hours, divide by 60.

Similarly, second scenario:

t_walk2 = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Total time = t_walk2 + t / 60 = 2.4 hours.

So, we have two equations:

1. (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4
2. (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4

So now
