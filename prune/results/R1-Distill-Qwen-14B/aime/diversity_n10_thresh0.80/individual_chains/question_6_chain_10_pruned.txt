Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, these are absolute value functions with some transformations. Let me think about how these functions look.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner absolute value |x| reflects everything to the right side of the y-axis. Then subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, but since it's inside another absolute value, it will create a V-shape again. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|, so similar logic applies. The vertex of g(x) is at (0, 1/4).

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). These look complicated because they're compositions of functions and involve trigonometric functions. Let me try to understand each part.

First, let's consider the y function: 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me write this out step by step.

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 2π, but with 2π inside, the period becomes 1. So sin(2πx) has a period of 1, going up and down once between 0 and 1. It's a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1.

2. Then, apply f to this: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's analyze this. First, |sin(2πx)| will make the sine wave non-negative, so it will oscillate between 0 and 1. Then subtract 1/2 and take absolute value again. So, when |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) will be |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, it will be 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

3. Next, apply g to f(sin(2πx)): g(f(...)) = ||f(...) - 1/4|. So, take the result from step 2, subtract 1/4, and then take absolute value again. This will create another transformation where values below 1/4 are flipped up.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))).

Similarly, the x function is 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's break that down:

1. cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3 because the period of cos(ky) is 2π/k, so here it's 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So, cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 2/3.

2. Apply f: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. Similar to the sine case, this will create a V-shape where when |cos(3πy)| is above 1/2, it's |cos(3πy)| - 1/2; when below, it's 1/2 - |cos(3πy)|.

3. Apply g: g(f(...)) = ||f(...) - 1/4|. Again, as above.

4. Multiply by 4: 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))).

So now, the equations are:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

To find the number of intersections, I need to find the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations. Since these are implicit equations, it's not straightforward to solve algebraically, so I might need to analyze the behavior of these functions and see how they intersect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for y in terms of x and vice versa, and then see where they intersect.

Wait, but the equations are y = something involving x, and x = something involving y. So, it's like a system of equations:

Equation (1): y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

Equation (2): x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, to find the intersection points, I need to find all (x, y) that satisfy both equations.

This seems complicated because each equation involves the other variable. Maybe I can visualize the graphs or find the possible ranges.

First, let's analyze the possible ranges of these functions.

Let's look at the inner functions:

sin(2πx): ranges from -1 to 1.

cos(3πy): also ranges from -1 to 1.

Then, f(u) = ||u| - 1/2|. Let's compute f(u):

For u in [-1,1], |u| is in [0,1].

So, f(u) = | |u| - 1/2 |.

This function will have the following behavior:

- When |u| >= 1/2, f(u) = |u| - 1/2.

- When |u| < 1/2, f(u) = 1/2 - |u|.

So, f(u) will output values from 0 to 1/2.

Similarly, g(v) = ||v| - 1/4|. Let's see:

v is the output of f(u), which is from 0 to 1/2.

So, g(v) = | |v| - 1/4 |. Since v is non-negative, |v| is v.

So, g(v) = |v - 1/4|.

So, when v >= 1/4, g(v) = v - 1/4.

When v < 1/4, g(v) = 1/4 - v.

Therefore, g(v) takes values from 0 (at v=1/4) to 1/4 (at v=0 or v=1/2).

So, now, let's compute 4g(f(u)).

Since g(f(u)) ranges between 0 and 1/4, multiplying by 4, 4g(f(u)) ranges from 0 to 1.

So, both y and x in the equations are between 0 and 1.

So, the possible x and y values lie in [0,1].

Wait, but actually, let me check.

Wait, sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1, so x can be any real number, but since f and g are applied, maybe y is between 0 and 1. Similarly, cos(3πy) is periodic with period 2/3, but again, when passed through f and g, x is between 0 and 1. So, perhaps the graphs are both confined to the square [0,1] x [0,1].

But maybe not necessarily, but for the intersections, perhaps we can limit x and y to [0,1], but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the functions are periodic, so I can look for intersections within a certain interval and then multiply by
