Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from the lower left to the upper right, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, any path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), in some order.

The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for either direction. That would be C(16,8) or 16 choose 8, which is 12870. But this problem adds a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction exactly four times mean? Well, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if a path goes RRRUUURR... etc., each time it goes from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Let me think: if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments of each direction will it have? Hmm, each direction change splits the path into a new segment. So, starting with either R or U, each change adds a new segment.

Wait, starting and then changing direction four times would result in five segments. For example, if it starts with R, then changes to U, R, U, R, that's four changes and five segments. Similarly, starting with U and changing four times would also give five segments.

So, the path will consist of five segments, alternating between R and U. Depending on whether it starts with R or U, the segments will alternate accordingly.

Wait, but for an 8x8 grid, the total number of R steps is 8 and U steps is 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the R segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U segments must be 8.

Since there are five segments in total, and each segment is either R or U, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: The path
