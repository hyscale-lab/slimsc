Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. That means it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem mentions four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.

Given that, I can assume that points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the origin is the midpoint, the coordinates of C would be the negative of the coordinates of A, right? Similarly, D would be the negative of B.

But wait, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). 

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, both A and C must satisfy the hyperbola equation. So, substituting A into the equation: (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. Similarly for B: (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1. 

Now, the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Let me think about the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x)*(q/p) = -1. That gives yq = -xp. So, yq = -xp.

Hmm, but I don't have specific coordinates for A and B yet. Maybe I can find a relation between them.

Wait, the rhombus has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance from A to B should equal the distance from B to C, and so on.

But maybe it's easier to work with vectors or parametric equations here. Alternatively, maybe parameterizing the points on the hyperbola.

I remember that hyperbolas can be parameterized using hyperbolic
