Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. Since ω is a root, it satisfies ω^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, is that right? Yeah, for prime n, Φ_n(x) is x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1.

So, the problem is about evaluating the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Since ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1 when k=0. But ω ≠ 1, but in the product, k=0 gives ω^0 = 1, so that term is included.

I need to compute this product. Maybe I can find a clever way to express each term and then take the product. Let me look at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression or relate it to something I know. Let me think about ω^{2k}. Since ω^13 = 1, ω^{2k} is just another root of unity, specifically a 13th root as well. So, maybe I can write the term as something like (a - bω^k)^2 or similar.

Wait, let's compute (1 - ω^k)^2. That would be 1 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Oh, that's close to the term we have. Our term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, which is (1 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) + 1. Hmm, which is (1 - ω^k)^2 + 1. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} differently. Let me write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, perhaps factor this as a quadratic in ω^k.

Wait, if I let x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So that's x^2 - 2x + 2. Let me factor this quadratic. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, each term is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, that means each term in the product can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product P is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

But since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange this as [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]. So, P = P1 * P2, where P1 is the product over all 13th roots ω^k of (ω^k - (1 + i)), and similarly P2 is the product over all 13th roots ω^k of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, but that includes all roots. Wait, but actually, the cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = product_{k=1 to 12} (x - ω^k), since ω^0 = 1 is not included in the primitive roots. Hmm, right. So, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, as I thought earlier.

But in my case, the product P1 is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - a), where a is (1 + i) or (1 - i). So, that's the same as product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a).

But the product over all 13th roots of unity of (x - a) is x^13 - 1, right? Because each x - ω^k is a factor of x^13 - 1. Wait, no, x^13 - 1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, if I set x = a, then product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1.

Wait, yes! Because if I plug x = a into x^13 - 1, I get a^13 - 1, which is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k).

So, that means P1 = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = product_{k=0}^{12} ( - ( (1 + i) - ω^k )) = (-1)^13 * product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ) = - product_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ) = - [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ].

Similarly, P2 = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = - [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

So, putting this together, P = P1 * P2 = [ - ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ] = [ ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) ] * [ ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) ].

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

First, let me compute (1 + i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n e^{i n π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n e^{-i n π/4}.

So, let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i *13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i *13 * π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) e^{-i *13π/4}.

Now, 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, since 13/4 = 3 + 1/4. So, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i (3π + π/4)} = e^{i π/4} (since e^{i 3π} = e^{i π} = -1), but wait, e^{i 3π} is e^{i π} * e^{i 2π} = (-1)*1 = -1. Wait, no. 3π is π + 2π, so e^{i 3π} = e^{i π} = -1. So, e^{i (3π + π/4)} = e^{i π/4} * e^{i 3π} = e^{i π/4} * (-1) = - e^{i π/4}.

Similarly, e^{-i 13π/4} = e^{-i (3π + π/4)} = e^{-i 3π} * e^{-i π/4} = (-1) * e^{-i π/4}.

Wait, let me double-check that exponent:

13 * π/4 is equal to (3 * 4 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4. So, it's equivalent to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 more than 3π. So, in the complex plane, that's the same as π/4 but in the direction of 3π, which is pointing to the left.

But in terms of the unit circle, angles are modulo 2π, so 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4. Similarly, 5π/4 is in the third quadrant, which is 180 + 45 degrees. So, e^{i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

Wait, but 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, which is more than 2π, so subtracting 2π once gives 5π/4, which is correct.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{i 5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).

Compute this: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2, so 64 * (-2)/2 (1 + i) = 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64 (1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{-i 5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) ] = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ] = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).

Again, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 64*(-2)/2*(1 - i) = 64*(-1)*(1 - i) = -64*(1 - i).

So, putting it all together:

(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i)

(1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i)

So, now, let's compute P1 and P2.

P1 = (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, P2 = (1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.

So, P = P1 * P2 = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Compute this: (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 65^2 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the product of (a + b)(a - b) is a^2 - b^2. So, in this case, a = -65, b = 64i. So, P = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

Compute each term:

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.

So, P = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, the product is 8321. Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.

Wait, let me check that: 1000 * 8 = 8000. 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because this seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I didn't make a miscalculation.

First, the expression (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13: I used polar form, which is correct. The modulus is sqrt(2), argument π/4 and -π/4 respectively. Raising to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 is indeed 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2). The angles: 13 * π/4 is 5π/4 when reduced modulo 2π. So, the exponential forms are correct.

Then, calculating (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) e^{i 5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ] = 64 * ( -1 - i ). Similarly for (1 - i)^13. So that gives -64(1 + i) and -64(1 - i).

Subtracting 1 from each: (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly for the other term.

Then, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096*(-1)) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 * 1000 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but before I get too confident, let me think about whether I missed any steps. The product over all ω^k of (ω^k - a) = a^13 -1? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was equal to a^13 - 1, but actually, it's product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1). So, that part is correct.

So, everything seems to check out. Therefore, the remainder is 321 when divided by 1000.


The problem requires finding the remainder when the product 
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]
is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1.

First, we rewrite each term as \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Thus, the product becomes:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)).
\]
Using properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we know that the product of \((x - \omega^k)\) for all 13th roots of unity \(\omega^k\) is \(x^{13} - 1\). Setting \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\), we find:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1.
\]
Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) using polar forms, we find:
\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i) \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i).
\]
Thus,
\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i.
\]
Multiplying these results:
\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
\]
Finally, dividing 8321 by 1000 gives a remainder of 321.

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
