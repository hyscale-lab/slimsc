Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, rhombus diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they do bisect the vertex angles, and they intersect at right angles. Wait, yes, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, and since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can model the points A, B, C, D accordingly.

Let me think about how to parametrize points on a hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, parametric equations are usually x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Alternatively, sometimes hyperbolic functions are used: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Not sure which one to use here. Maybe the trigonometric one is easier for this problem.

But wait, since the hyperbola is symmetric, and the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin, the points A and C must be diametrically opposite, same with B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p,
