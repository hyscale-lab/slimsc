Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is linear, and the second one is quadratic in nature because of the squares involved. Maybe I can find a way to relate these equations or simplify them somehow.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a symmetric way to represent it.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out some terms. For example, in the second equation, terms like a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c would be b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b would be c²(a + b). So let's try that:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Now, since from the first equation we know that a + b + c = 300, then (b + c) is equal to 300 - a, (a + c) is 300 - b, and (a + b) is 300 - c. So substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

So, combining like terms, this becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now, I remember that there's an identity involving the sum of cubes. Let me recall: a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). Maybe that can help us here somehow.

But in our equation, we have a³ + b³ + c³, so perhaps if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)². Because I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, since a + b + c = 300, we have:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc. Then from the identity above, a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc = S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

So, substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

We can write that in terms of S, Q, and P.

First, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 600Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3P = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P. Let's compute 300³: 300*300 = 90,000, 90,000*300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

So putting these into the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Let's simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Simplify terms:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

0 + 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

So, 100Q - P = 2,000,000. Hmm. That's interesting. So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But since P = abc and Q = ab + bc + ac, and all variables are nonnegative integers, we need to find triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ac = Q, and abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Wait a minute. Let me think about this. If I can express Q and P in terms of each other, maybe that can help me find the values of a, b, c.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000. So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe we can factor this somehow or find constraints on a, b, c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider symmetric cases where two variables are equal or something like that. Maybe assuming a = b, or b = c, etc. Since the equations are symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps it's useful to consider cases where two variables are equal.

But let's see. Let me try to think if there's another approach. Maybe looking for integer solutions given that a + b + c = 300 and abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

But this still doesn't immediately ring a bell. Maybe it's helpful to consider that in terms of variables.

Wait, perhaps I can consider variables x = a, y = b, z = c, and then express the equations in terms of x, y, z.

But perhaps another approach is to recognize that the original second equation can be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Wait, let's compute that. (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + ac² + bc² + 3abc. So, if I subtract 3abc, I get (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + ac² + bc². Which is exactly our second equation. So, that's equal to 6,000,000.

So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:

300 * Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

Which is exactly the same equation we had earlier. So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, we're stuck with this relation between Q and P.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q and P must also be nonnegative integers. So, Q must be such that 100Q - 2,000,000 is nonnegative. So,

100Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0
100Q ≥ 2,000,000
Q ≥ 20,000.

So, Q must be at least 20,000. Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q can't be larger than a certain maximum value. Let's see, Q = ab +
