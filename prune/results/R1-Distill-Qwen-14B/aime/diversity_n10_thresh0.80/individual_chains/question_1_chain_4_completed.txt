Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4

Thus, b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + 1/12

To add these, find a common denominator, which is 24:
-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9 + 2)/24 = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24

So now, a = log₂ x = -7/24
b = log₂ y = -3/8
c = log₂ z = -5/12

Now, let's compute E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Plugging in the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Calculate each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6
3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8
2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, summing them up:

E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let's combine the fractions. First, find a common denominator for 6 and 8. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = (-28)/24
-9/8 = (-27)/24
-5/6 = (-20)/24

So, E = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 3.

-75 ÷ 3 = -25
24 ÷ 3 = 8

So, E = -25/8

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | = 25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors. So, m =25, n=8. Therefore, m + n = 33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Starting with the linear system:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2

Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3

Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

We solved for c first by substituting a from equation (1b) into equation (2b):

b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3

Simplify: b = b + 2c + (1/2 + 1/3) = b + 2c + 5/6

Subtract b: 0 = 2c + 5/6 => 2c = -5/6 => c = -5/12. Correct.

Then from equation (1b): a = b + (-5/12) +1/2 = b -5/12 +6/12 = b +1/12. So a = b +1/12. Correct.

Substituting into equation (3b): c = a + b +1/4

We know c = -5/12, so:

-5/12 = (b +1/12) + b +1/4

Simplify: -5/12 = 2b +1/12 +3/12 = 2b +4/12 = 2b +1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 -4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4 => b = -3/8. Correct.

Then a = b +1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12). Let's convert to 24ths: -9/24 + 2/24 = (-7)/24. Correct.

So E =4a +3b +2c =4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Calculate each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Adding them up:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Convert to 24ths:

(-28/24) + (-27/24) + (-20/24) = (-75)/24 = (-25)/8

Absolute value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8, m+n=33.

I think that's correct. No arithmetic errors noticed. So, the answer is 33.


The given system of equations involves logarithms, which can be converted to exponential form for easier manipulation. By defining variables in terms of logarithms, we transform the system into a linear system and solve for each variable. After finding the values, we compute the desired logarithmic expression and simplify it to find the absolute value, which is expressed as a fraction. The sum of the numerator and denominator gives the final answer.

The value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\frac{25}{8}$, so $m+n=25+8=33$.

$\boxed{33}$
