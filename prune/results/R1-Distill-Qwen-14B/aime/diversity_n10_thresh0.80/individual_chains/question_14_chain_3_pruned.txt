Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should start checking from 9999 downwards.

The key property here is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

So, N is ABCD. Now, if I replace A with 1, I get 1BCD. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, and replacing D with 1 gives ABC1.

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives me four conditions to satisfy.

So, my goal is to find the largest ABCD such that:

1. 1BCD is divisible by 7
2. A1CD is divisible by 7
3. AB1D is divisible by 7
4. ABC1 is divisible by 7

Since I need the greatest four-digit number, I should start from 9999 and go down, checking each number to see if it meets these four conditions. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can find constraints for each digit based on these conditions.

Let me consider each condition one by one.

1. Replacing A with 1: So, 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7. Let's express 1BCD as 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, the original number N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, since N is ABCD, when we replace A with 1, the thousands digit becomes 1, so 1BCD is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

And this must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, for the other replacements:

2. A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.

3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.

4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four expressions must be divisible by 7.

Let me write these congruences:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. ...(1)
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. ...(2)
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. ...(3)
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. ...(4)

Now, perhaps I can express each of these in terms of mod 7 and find relations between the digits.

Let me compute the coefficients modulo 7 because that might simplify things.

Compute 1000 mod 7: 1000 / 7 is 142*7=994, so 1000-994=6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, rewriting each condition:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ (6) + (2)B + (3)C + D ≡ 0 mod7. ...(1)
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ (6)A + (2) + (3)C + D ≡ 0 mod7. ...(2)
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ (6)A + (2)B + (3) + D ≡ 0 mod7. ...(3)
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ (6)A + (2)B + (3)C + (1) ≡ 0 mod7. ...(4)

So, now I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 ...(1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 ...(2)

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7 ...(3)

4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 ...(4)

Hmm, okay, so four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D, each digit from 0-9, with A ≠ 0.

But since I'm looking for the largest possible N, which is ABCD, I should aim for A=9, then B=9, etc., but need to satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a system of equations.

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A +2 +3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod7

Simplify:

6A +2 +3C + D -6 -2B -3C - D ≡ 0 mod7

Simplify terms:

6A -2B + (2 -6) + (3C -3C) + (D - D) ≡ 0 mod7

So,

6A -2B -4 ≡ 0 mod7

Or,

6A -2B ≡ 4 mod7

Divide both sides by 2:

3A - B ≡ 2 mod7. Let's call this equation (5).

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B +3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

6A +2B +3 + D -6 -2B -3C - D ≡0 mod7

Simplify:

6A + (2B-2B) + (3 -6) + (D - D) -3C ≡0 mod7

So,

6A -3 -3C ≡0 mod7

Which can be written as:

6
