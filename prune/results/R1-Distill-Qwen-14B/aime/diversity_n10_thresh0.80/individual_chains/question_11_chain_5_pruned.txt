Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I know that z is a complex number and its magnitude is 4. So, I can represent z as 4 times e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Because the magnitude is 4, right? So, z = 4e^{iθ}. Alternatively, I could represent it as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). That might be helpful later.

So, the expression we need to maximize the real part of is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me write that down:

E = (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|^2. Because for any complex number z, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2. So, since |z| = 4, |z|^2 is 16. Therefore, 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

So, substituting that in, E becomes:

E = (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i) * (\overline{z}/16).

Hmm, okay. Let me compute each part. Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, so \overline{z} is 4e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting z and \overline{z} into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(4e^{-iθ})/16.

Simplify each term. Let's compute each coefficient.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4 = 300 + 468i.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. So, the second term is (6 + 9i)*4e^{-iθ}.

Wait, no: Wait, (96 + 144i) multiplied by (4e^{-iθ}) / 16? Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, the second term is (96 + 144i)*(4e^{-iθ})/16. So that's (96 + 144i)* (4/16) e^{-iθ} = (96 + 144i)*(1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So, 96*(1/4) = 24, 144*(1/4) = 36. So, the second term becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, E is:

E = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of E. So, let's compute each term's real part.

First, (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} can be written as (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Let me compute that:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

But since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

So, grouping the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Similarly, the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

So, putting it all together, the real part of E is the sum of the real parts of both terms:

Real part of E = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Simplify this:

Combine like terms:

cosθ terms: 300 cosθ + 24 cosθ = 324 cosθ.

sinθ terms: (-468 sinθ) + 36 sinθ = (-432 sinθ).

So, Real part of E = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, that simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So, we have Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I need to find the maximum value of Re(E). So, this is a function of θ, and it's of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, except here it's A cosθ - B sinθ with A = 324 and B = 432.

The maximum of such an expression is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, because for any expression C cosθ + D sinθ, the maximum is sqrt{C^2 + D^2}. So, in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, to compute the maximum, it's sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324^2:

324 * 324: Let's see. 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, 160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, sum is 104,976 +186,624 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600). Let me see what that is.

Well, 540^2=291,600, because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000. So, 250,000 +40,000 + 1,600=291,600. So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

So, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, when I substituted z and 1/z, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, first term: (75 + 117i)*z, where z=4
