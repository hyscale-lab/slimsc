Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. I think B is at (0, approximately 0.866), since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Then there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, these are line segments from some point (p,0) on the x-axis to some point (0,q) on the y-axis, with the distance between them being 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, right? Because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2). So, for each segment PQ in F, we have p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F because its length is 1, right? Let me check: the distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is a member of F.

So, F includes all unit segments from (p,0) to (0,q) in the first quadrant, and AB is one such segment. Now, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and not on any other segment from F. Then, we have to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

So, the plan is probably parametrize AB, find C on AB, and then ensure that for this C, no other segment from F passes through it except AB.

First, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), AB can be represented parametrically. Let me find the equation of AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0): 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, I can write parametric equations. Let me let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 gives A and t=1 gives B. So, x(t) = (1/2)(1 - t), y(t) = (sqrt(3)/2)t. So, point C is on AB, so it can be expressed as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find point C on AB such that there's no other segment PQ in F that passes through C, except AB itself. So, for this point C, any other segment PQ in F (i.e., segments from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² =1) does not pass through C.

So, we need to find C such that the only solution to the equation of AB passing through C is AB itself, but no other PQ from F passes through C.

But how do we find such a point? Maybe the point C is such that it's the only intersection point of AB with some envelope of the family F. Alternatively, perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to some envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the point where AB is the only segment in F passing through C, meaning that for C, the equation of the line PQ (from (p,0) to (0,q)) passing through C has only AB as a solution.

Wait, but AB is one such line, and we need to ensure that no other line in F passes through C. So, for point C, the equation of PQ passing through C must have only AB as a solution. So, perhaps for C, the system of equations (from PQ passing through C) has a unique solution, which is the AB segment.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the lines PQ and find where they intersect AB, and then find C such that it's the only intersection point with AB.

Wait, no. Because AB is a member of F, so it's one of the PQ's, and no other PQ's should intersect AB at C.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of envelope. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, maybe the point C is where the envelope of F touches AB, making it the only point where AB is tangent to the envelope, hence only AB passes through C.

Alternatively, perhaps using parametric equations of the lines in F and finding their intersections with AB, then finding C as the point where only AB intersects.

Let me try another approach. Let me write the equation of a general PQ segment in F. Since P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), the line PQ can be expressed as x/p + y/q = 1. Since it's a unit segment, p² + q² =1.

Now, any point C on AB satisfies the equation of AB, which is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let’s denote point C as (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

We want to find x such that the line PQ passes through C and is in F (so p² + q² =1), but for this C, only AB satisfies the condition. Wait, but since AB is in F, perhaps for this C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 has only one solution (p, q) on the circle p² + q²=1.

Wait, perhaps for point C, the system:

x/p + y/q = 1,

p² + q² = 1.

has exactly one solution (p, q), which is the case for AB. Because AB is PQ with p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2, so p² + q² = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, which checks out.

So, for point C, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p² + q² =1. So, the system has exactly one solution, which would mean that the line is tangent to the unit circle. Because if a line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to p² + q²=1, then it touches the circle at exactly one point.

Wait, but x, y are fixed for point C. So, for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must be such that it's tangent to the unit circle p² + q²=1. Because then, this line would only touch the circle at one point, which would be the point (p, q) corresponding to AB.

Wait, so if I can find C on AB such that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p² + q²=1, then that's the point C we're looking for. Because for this point, only AB (the tangent line) would pass through it, and no other segments in F would pass through it.

So, the strategy is to find C on AB such that when we write the equation x/p + y/q =1, this line is tangent to the unit circle p² + q²=1.

Let me formalize this. The condition for the line x/p + y/q =1 to be tangent to the unit circle p² + q²=1 is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to 1. Wait, no, the distance from the center to the line would be |0 + 0 -1| / sqrt( (1/x)^2 + (1/y)^2 ) )? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the general formula for the distance from a point (a, b) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |A a + B b + C| / sqrt(A² + B²).

So, for the line x/p + y/q =1, we can rewrite it as x/p + y/q -1 =0. So, A=1/p, B=1/q, C=-1.

The distance from the origin (0,0) to this line is |0 + 0 -1| / sqrt( (1/p)^2 + (1/q)^2 ) ) = 1 / sqrt(1/p² + 1/q²).

Now, for the line to be tangent to the circle p² + q²=1, the distance from the center (0,0) to the line should be exactly equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. Wait, no, the circle is p² + q²=1, so the radius is 1. So, if the distance from the origin to the line is equal to the radius, then the line is tangent.

Wait, but wait: the distance from the origin to the line is 1 / sqrt( (1/p²) + (1/q²) ), and we want this to equal 1.

So,

1 / sqrt( (1/p²) + (1/q²) ) = 1

Which implies that sqrt( (1/p²) + (1/q²) ) = 1.

Squaring both sides,

(1/p²) + (1/q²) = 1.

But since p² + q²=1 (because PQ is a unit segment), let's see if these two equations can be combined.

Wait, we have p² + q²=1 and (1/p²) + (1/q²)=1.

Let me solve these two equations together.

Let me denote a = p² and b = q². So,

a + b = 1,

and

1/a + 1/b = 1.

So, substituting a + b =1 into the second equation:

1/a + 1/b = (a + b)/(a b) ) = 1/(a b) = 1.

So,

1/(a b) =1 => a b =1.

So, a + b =1 and a b =1.

Wait, but this is a system of equations in a and b. Let's write it as:

a + b =1,

a b =1.

This is a quadratic equation: t² - (a + b) t + a b = t² - t +1=0.

The discriminant is (1)^2 -4*1*1=1-4=-3 <0.

So, no real solutions. That implies that there's no real (p,q) where the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the circle p² + q²=1.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the line x/p + y/q=1 is not a tangent to the circle, but maybe I should be considering another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is such that the line x/p + y/q=1 passes through C and intersects the circle p² + q²=1 at exactly one point, which would be the case for tangency. So, perhaps I should approach this by substituting y from AB's equation into the line equation.

Let me try that.

So, for point C on AB, we have y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substitute y into the line equation x/p + y/q =1.

So,

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.

We can rearrange:

x (1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3)/(2 q)) =1.

Now, since the line passes through C, which is on AB, and we're considering the line x/p + y/q=1, which is PQ in F, the condition is that this equation holds for some p and q with p² + q²=1.

But for C to not lie on any other PQ in F, except AB, the equation above must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle. That is, the system:

x/p + y/q =1,

p² + q²=1,

has exactly one solution (p, q), which would be (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), corresponding to AB.

So, perhaps we can set up the condition that the system has exactly one solution, which would be when the line is tangent to the circle. But earlier, I saw that this leads to a contradiction, so maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a system of equations in p and q, and use the condition that it has exactly one solution, which would mean that the determinant of the system is zero, leading to some condition on x and y (or x, since y is expressed in terms of x from AB's equation).

Let me try that approach.

We have from the line equation:

x/p + y/q =1, which can be rewritten as x q + y p = p q.

But since p² + q²=1, perhaps we can express this in terms of p and q.

Wait, so we have:

x/p + y/q =1,

and

p² + q²=1.

Let me write this as:

x q + y p = p q,

from cross-multiplying.

But this might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can write this as a linear equation in p and q.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me treat p and q as variables, and x and y as constants (since C is a point on AB, so y is a function of x). So, the equation is:

x/p + y/q =1,

with p² + q²=1.

We can write this as:

x/p + y/q =1,

and

p² + q²=1.

We can try to solve for p and q in terms of x and y.

Let me denote u = 1/p and v = 1/q. Then the first equation becomes:

x u + y v =1,

and the second equation becomes:

(1/u²) + (1/v²) =1.

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express q in terms of p from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From x/p + y/q =1,

=> y/q =1 - x/p,

=> q = y / (1 - x/p).

But then substituting into p² + q²=1,

p² + [ y / (1 - x/p) ]² =1.

This seems messy, but perhaps we can multiply numerator and denominator by p.

So, q = y p / (p - x).

Then, substituting into p² + q²=1,

p² + [ y p / (p - x) ]² =1.

Let me write this as:

p² + y² p² / (p - x)^2 =1.

Multiply both sides by (p - x)^2:

p² (p - x)^2 + y² p² = (p - x)^2.

Hmm, but this seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to find where the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the circle p² + q²=1. The condition for tangency is that the gradients are parallel.

So, the gradient of the line x/p + y/q=1 with respect to p and q is ( -x/p², -y/q² ).

The gradient of the circle p² + q²=1 is (2p, 2q).

For the line to be tangent to the circle, these gradients must be scalar multiples. So,

( -x/p², -y/q² ) = λ (2p, 2q )

for some λ.

So,

-x/p² = 2p λ,

-y/q² = 2q λ.

Dividing the two equations,

( -x/p² ) / ( -y/q² ) = (2p λ ) / (2q λ )

Simplify,

(x/p²) / (y/q²) ) = p/q,

=> (x q²) / (y p²) ) = p/q,

=> x q^3 = y p^3.

So,

q^3 = (y/x) p^3.

Taking cube roots,

q = (y/x)^{1/3} p.

So, q = k p, where k = (y/x)^{1/3}.

Now, since p² + q²=1,

p² + (k p)^2 =1,

p² (1 + k²) =1,

p² = 1/(1 + k²),

so p = 1/sqrt(1 + k²).

Similarly, q = k p = k / sqrt(1 + k²).

Now, substituting back into the line equation x/p + y/q =1,

x p + y q = p q.

Wait, no, the line equation is x/p + y/q =1.

So,

x/p + y/q =1.

Substituting p and q in terms of k,

x [ sqrt(1 + k²) ] + y [ sqrt(1 + k²) / k ] =1.

Factor out sqrt(1 + k²),

sqrt(1 + k²) [ x + y/(k) ] =1.

But from earlier, we have q = k p, and k = (y/x)^{1/3}.

So, k = (y/x)^{1/3} => k^3 = y/x => y = x k^3.

So, let's substitute y = x k^3 into the equation:

sqrt(1 + k²) [ x + (x k^3)/k ] =1,

sqrt(1 + k²) [ x + x k^2 ] =1,

sqrt(1 + k²) * x (1 + k^2) =1,

x * sqrt(1 + k²) * (1 + k^2) =1,

x (1 + k^2)^{3/2} =1.

So,

x = 1 / (1 + k^2)^{3/2}.

But since y = x k^3,

y = k^3 / (1 + k^2)^{3/2}.

Now, we also know that point C lies on AB, which has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So,

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substituting the expressions for x and y,

k^3 / (1 + k^2)^{3/2} = -sqrt(3) [ 1 / (1 + k^2)^{3/2} ] + sqrt(3)/2.

Multiply both sides by (1 + k^2)^{3/2} to eliminate denominators,

k^3 = -sqrt(3) + (sqrt(3)/2) (1 + k^2)^{3/2}.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe let me set t = k^2, so that k = sqrt(t).

Then,

k^3 = t^{3/2},

(1 + k^2)^{3/2} = (1 + t)^{3/2}.

Substituting,

t^{3/2} = -sqrt(3) + (sqrt(3)/2) (1 + t)^{3/2}.

Let me rearrange,

t^{3/2} + sqrt(3) = (sqrt(3)/2) (1 + t)^{3/2}.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3)/2,

(2/sqrt(3)) t^{3/2} + 2 = (1 + t)^{3/2}.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but this might complicate things further. Let me denote u = sqrt(t), so t = u^2, and t^{3/2} = u^3.

Then,

(2/sqrt(3)) u^3 + 2 = (1 + u^2)^{3/2}.

Hmm, but even this substitution might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps I can let s = (1 + t)^{3/2}.

But maybe another approach: let me consider that the line is tangent to the circle, so the system of equations x/p + y/q =1 and p² + q²=1 has exactly one solution. So, substituting y from AB's equation into the line equation, and then solving for p and q, and then set the discriminant to zero to ensure only one solution.

Wait, perhaps I can approach this by considering that the line x/p + y/q=1 is tangent to the unit circle, which would mean that the system has exactly one solution (p, q). So, substituting y from AB's equation into the line equation, and then solving for p and q.

But earlier, when I tried this, I ended up with a system that had no real solutions, which suggests that perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the point C is such that the line PQ passes through C and that this line is the only one in F that does so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of parametrizing the lines PQ and finding their intersections with AB, then find C such that only AB passes through it.

So, AB is the line from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2).

Let me parametrize AB as I did before: for t from 0 to 1,

x(t) = (1/2)(1 - t),

y(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, for each C, we can write the equation of the line PQ passing through C and in F.

So, PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q²=1, and passing through C.

So, the equation is x/p + y/q =1.

Substituting x and y from point C,

( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q =1.

Multiply both sides by p q to eliminate denominators,

(1/2)(1 - t) q + (sqrt(3)/2) t p = p q.

We also have p² + q²=1.

Now, let me denote this as an equation in p and q:

(1/2)(1 - t) q + (sqrt(3)/2) t p = p q.

Let me rearrange terms,

p q - (1/2)(1 - t) q - (sqrt(3)/2) t p =0,

q (p - (1/2)(1 - t)) - (sqrt(3)/2) t p =0.

Hmm, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

From p² + q²=1,

q²=1 - p²,

so q= sqrt(1 - p²), but since we're in the first quadrant, q is positive.

Substituting into the equation:

(1/2)(1 - t) sqrt(1 - p²) + (sqrt(3)/2) t p = p sqrt(1 - p²).

This is getting complicated, but perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let me denote this equation as:

A + B = C,

where

A = (1/2)(1 - t) sqrt(1 - p²),

B = (sqrt(3)/2) t p,

C = p sqrt(1 - p²).

So,

A + B = C.

Squaring both sides,

(A + B)^2 = C^2,

A² + 2AB + B² = C².

Substituting,

[ (1/2)^2 (1 - t)^2 (1 - p^2) ] + 2*(1/2)(1 - t)*(sqrt(3)/2) t p * sqrt(1 - p^2) + [ (3/4) t^2 p^2 ] = [ p^2 (1 - p^2) ].

Simplify each term:

First term: (1/4)(1 - t)^2 (1 - p^2),

Second term: 2 * (1/2)(1 - t)*(sqrt(3)/2) t p * sqrt(1 - p^2) = (sqrt(3)/2) t (1 - t) p sqrt(1 - p^2),

Third term: (3/4) t^2 p^2.

Right-hand side: p^2 (1 - p^2).

So, putting it all together,

(1/4)(1 - t)^2 (1 - p^2) + (sqrt(3)/2) t (1 - t) p sqrt(1 - p^2) + (3/4) t^2 p^2 = p^2 (1 - p^2).

This looks very complicated, but perhaps if I can find t such that this equation has exactly one solution for p, that would correspond to the point C where only AB passes through it.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set this up as a quadratic equation in p² or something else, but it's getting too involved.

Wait, maybe I should consider that for the point C, there is only one line PQ (i.e., AB) that passes through it. So, for point C, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have exactly one solution (p, q) on the unit circle.

So, perhaps using the condition that the system has exactly one solution, which would require that the resultant of the system has a unique solution. Alternatively, perhaps using the condition that the line is tangent to the circle, which would mean that the system has exactly one solution.

Wait, but earlier that approach led to a contradiction, implying no solution, so perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, maybe instead of treating x and y as variables, I should substitute y in terms of x since C is on AB.

So, y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substituting into x/p + y/q=1,

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q =1.

Multiply both sides by pq:

x q + (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2) p = p q.

Rearranging,

x q + (-sqrt(3) x) p + (sqrt(3)/2) p = p q.

Bring all terms to one side,

x q - (-sqrt(3) x) p - (sqrt(3)/2) p - p q =0,

Wait, perhaps factoring terms,

Factor p and q,

p [ (-sqrt(3) x) + (sqrt(3)/2) - q ] + x q =0.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

x q + (-sqrt(3) x p) + (sqrt(3)/2 p) - p q =0.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this equation as:

x q + (-sqrt(3) x p) + (sqrt(3)/2 p) - p q =0,

which can be rearranged as:

q (x - p) + p (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor terms differently.

Let me group terms with q and terms with p:

q (x - p) + p ( -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.

Hmm, but I don't see an obvious way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for q in terms of p.

From x q + (-sqrt(3) x p) + (sqrt(3)/2 p ) = p q,

Bring terms involving q to one side,

x q - p q = sqrt(3) x p - (sqrt(3)/2) p,

q (x - p) = p (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2).

So,

q = [ p (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2) ] / (x - p).

Now, since p² + q²=1,

we substitute q from above into this equation.

So,

p² + [ p^2 (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] / (x - p)^2 =1.

Factor p²,

p² [ 1 + (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 / (x - p)^2 ] =1.

This is a complicated equation in p and x, but perhaps for a specific x, this equation will have exactly one solution for p, which would correspond to point C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set this up as a quadratic in p and then set the discriminant to zero to ensure only one solution.

Let me try that.

Let me denote:

Let me square the numerator and denominator,

(sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3 (x - 1/2)^2,

and (x - p)^2 is as is.

So,

p² [ 1 + (3 (x - 1/2)^2 ) / (x - p)^2 ] =1.

Multiply through by (x - p)^2,

p² (x - p)^2 [ 1 + 3 (x - 1/2)^2 / (x - p)^2 ] = (x - p)^2.

Wait, no, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying:

p² + [ p^2 (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] / (x - p)^2 =1.

Multiply both sides by (x - p)^2,

p² (x - p)^2 + p^2 (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (x - p)^2.

Let me factor p²,

p² [ (x - p)^2 + (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ] = (x - p)^2.

This seems a bit messy, but let me expand the terms inside the brackets.

Compute (x - p)^2 + (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2.

First, (x - p)^2 = x² - 2xp + p².

Second, (sqrt(3) x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3x² - 3x*(1/2)*2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3x² - 3x + 3/4.

Wait, let me compute that correctly:

(sqrt(3)x - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 (x - 1/2)^2 = 3 (x^2 - x + 1/4).

So,

= 3x^2 - 3x + 3/4.

So, the sum is:

(x² - 2xp + p²) + (3x² - 3x + 3/4) = 4x² - 2xp + p² -3x + 3/4.

So, the equation becomes:

p² (4x² - 2xp + p² -3x + 3/4) = (x - p)^2.

Expand the right side:

(x - p)^2 = x² - 2xp + p².

So, bringing everything to the left,

p² (4x² - 2xp + p² -3x + 3/4) - (x² - 2xp + p²) =0.

Expanding the left term,

4x² p² - 2x p^3 + p^4 -3x p² + (3/4) p² -x² + 2xp - p² =0.

Combine like terms:

Terms with p^4: p^4,

Terms with p^3: -2x p^3,

Terms with p^2: 4x² p² -3x p² + (3/4) p² - p²,

Terms with p: 2x p,

Constants: -x².

Simplify each:

p^4,

-2x p^3,

p^2 terms: (4x² -3x + 3/4 -1) p² = (4x² -3x - 1/4) p²,

p terms: 2x p,

constants: -x².

So, the equation is:

p^4 - 2x p^3 + (4x² -3x -1/4) p² + 2x p -x² =0.

This is a quartic equation in p, which is quite complicated. But since we are looking for points C on AB where only AB passes through, perhaps this equation has a double root at p=1/2 (since AB corresponds to p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2).

So, perhaps (p -1/2)^2 is a factor of the quartic.

Let me perform polynomial division to check if (p -1/2)^2 is a factor.

Let me denote the quartic as:

p^4 -2x p^3 + (4x² -3x -1/4)p² + 2x p -x².

Let me try to factor (p - 1/2)^2 = p² - p + 1/4.

Let me perform the division.

Divide the quartic by p² - p + 1/4.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution.

Let me substitute p =1/2 into the quartic and see if it's zero.

At p=1/2,

(1/2)^4 -2x (1/2)^3 + (4x² -3x -1/4)(1/2)^2 + 2x (1/2) -x².

Compute each term:

(1/16) - 2x*(1/8) + (4x² -3x -1/4)*(1/4) + x -x².

Simplify:

1/16 - x/4 + (4x² -3x -1/4)/4 + x -x².

= 1/16 - x/4 + x² - (3x)/4 - 1/16 + x -x².

Now, combine like terms:

1/16 - 1/16 = 0,

-x/4 -3x/4 +x = (-x/4 -3x/4 +4x/4) = 0,

x² -x² =0.

So, the quartic evaluates to zero at p=1/2, which means (p -1/2) is a factor.

Now, let's check if (p -1/2)^2 is a factor by taking the derivative of the quartic and evaluating at p=1/2.

The quartic is:

f(p) = p^4 -2x p^3 + (4x² -3x -1/4)p² + 2x p -x².

Compute f'(p):

f'(p) = 4p^3 -6x p^2 + 2(4x² -3x -1/4)p + 2x.

Evaluate at p=1/2,

f'(1/2) = 4*(1/2)^3 -6x*(1/2)^2 + 2*(4x² -3x -1/4)*(1/2) + 2x.

Compute each term:

4*(1/8) = 1/2,

-6x*(1/4) = - (3x/2),

2*(4x² -3x -1/4)*(1/2) = (4x² -3x -1/4),

+2x.

So,

f'(1/2) = 1/2 - 3x/2 + 4x² -3x -1/4 +2x.

Combine like terms:

Constants: 1/2 -1/4 = 1/4,

x terms: (-3x/2 -3x +2x) = (-3x/2 -x) = (-5x/2),

x² terms: 4x².

So,

f'(1/2) = 4x² - (5x/2) + 1/4.

For (p -1/2)^2 to be a factor, f'(1/2) must be zero.

So,

4x² - (5x/2) + 1/4 =0.

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators,

16x² -10x +1=0.

Solve for x,

x = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 64)] / 32,

= [10 ± sqrt(36)] /32,

= [10 ±6]/32.

So,

x=(10+6)/32=16/32=1/2,

x=(10-6)/32=4/32=1/8.

Now, x=1/2 corresponds to point A on AB, which we're supposed to exclude, as we're looking for a point C distinct from A and B.

The other solution is x=1/8.

So, at x=1/8, f'(1/2)=0, meaning that p=1/2 is a double root of the quartic equation. Therefore, the quartic can be written as (p -1/2)^2 times a quadratic.

So, the point C is at x=1/8 on AB.

Now, let's find y for this point.

Since C is on AB, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substituting x=1/8,

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2,

= (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8),

= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Now, compute OC², which is x² + y².

x² = (1/8)^2 =1/64,

y² = (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 =9*3 /64=27/64.

So,

OC²=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

Wait, 28 divided by 64 is 7/16. So, OC²=7/16.

So, p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Thus, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 1/8 squared is 1/64, correct. 3 sqrt(3)/8 squared is 9*3=27, over 64. So, 1+27=28, over 64, which simplifies to 7/16. So, OC²=7/16, and 7+16=23.

So, I think the answer is 23.


To solve the problem, we start by considering the points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \). The segment \( \overline{AB} \) is a member of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) of unit-length segments in the first quadrant. We need to find a unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \).

The equation of line \( AB \) is \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). We parametrize \( AB \) as \( C(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2}(1 - t), \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}t\right) \) for \( t \) in \([0, 1]\).

For \( C \) to not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \), the line \( \overline{PQ} \) passing through \( C \) must be tangent to the unit circle \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \) at exactly one point. This ensures that no other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) passes through \( C \).

Using the condition for tangency, we find that the point \( C \) must satisfy the quartic equation derived from the system of equations representing the line and the unit circle. By solving this quartic equation, we find that \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) is the valid solution corresponding to point \( C \).

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) into the equation of \( AB \), we find \( y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \). Thus, \( C \) is at \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we compute \( OC^2 \) as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), leading to \( p + q = 23 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
