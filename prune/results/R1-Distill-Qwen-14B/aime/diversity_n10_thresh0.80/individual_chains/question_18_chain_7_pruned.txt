Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.

First off, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, I think. But wait, maybe that's not immediately relevant. The key is that it's regular, so all the sides and angles are the same, making it symmetric.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. So, in a regular dodecagon, how can rectangles form? Well, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. Since the dodecagon is regular, I can imagine that the sides and diagonals have certain symmetries that might allow rectangles to form when connected appropriately.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a number of sides divisible by 4, like squares or octagons, rectangles can be formed by connecting certain diagonals. But dodecagon is 12-sided, which is also divisible by 4 (12 divided by 4 is 3), so maybe that structure can help.

Wait, but the dodecagon isn't a square, but it's a 12-sided figure. So, the sides and diagonals are at different angles. Hmm. Maybe I should think about how the sides and diagonals can form right angles. Because for a rectangle, all angles are right angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, with each vertex having coordinates based on the unit circle. That might make it easier to calculate vectors and see when two lines are perpendicular. But that could get complicated, but maybe it's necessary.

Let me try that approach. If I place the regular dodecagon on a unit circle, centered at the origin, each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. The angle between consecutive vertices would be 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, and so on, up to 330°.

Now, the sides of the dodecagon are the lines connecting consecutive vertices. The diagonals are the lines connecting non-consecutive vertices. Depending on how many vertices apart they are, the diagonals will have different lengths and angles.

So, for a rectangle, we need four lines (sides or diagonals) that form a closed figure with four right angles. Each pair of adjacent sides should be perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of vectors. If I have two vectors that are sides of the rectangle, their dot product should be zero for them to be perpendicular.

But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Another thought: in a regular polygon, the number of rectangles can be determined by the number of pairs of parallel sides or diagonals, and their perpendicular counterparts.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the concept of diameters in the dodecagon. A
