Okay, so I came across this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability, 50-50. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, a regular octagon has eight vertices. Each is colored red or blue independently with a 50% chance each. We need to find the probability that there's some rotation (like turning the octagon by some number of positions) which maps all the blue vertices to the positions that were originally red.

Wait, so when they say "rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices," does that mean that after rotation, the set of blue vertices coincides exactly with the set of red vertices before rotation? Or does it mean that each blue vertex moves to a position that was red? Hmm, I think it's the latter. That is, for each blue vertex, when we rotate the octagon, it moves to a position that was previously red.

Wait, but the octagon is being rotated, so the positions themselves are being cycled. So perhaps they mean that the entire set of blue vertices, after some rotation, aligns exactly with the set of red vertices. So that all blue ones move to the red positions. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the octagon is symmetric, so the set of red and blue vertices must form rotationally symmetric patterns. Hmm.

Let me think about how rotations work on an octagon. A regular octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, and so on up to 315°, which are multiples of 45°, so 8 possible rotations in total.

So, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists some rotation (other than 0°, maybe?) such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red.

Wait, but the original coloring is fixed. So, suppose the oct
