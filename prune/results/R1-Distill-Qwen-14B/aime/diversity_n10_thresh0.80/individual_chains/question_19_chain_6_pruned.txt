Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. It says, "Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC."

Hmm, so I need to find the product of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC. They've given me some conditions: IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. 

First, let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. IA is the segment from the incenter to vertex A, and it's perpendicular to OI, the line connecting the incenter and circumcenter. 

I think I remember that there's a formula relating the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) with other triangle parameters. Let me try to recall it. Oh right, the formula is OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me confirm that. 

So, OI² = R(R - 2r). Plugging in the given values, R is 13, r is 6. So OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). 

Now, they also tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I. That means in triangle IOA, we have a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA. Wait, OA is the radius of the circumcircle, which is R, so OA is 13. 

So, in triangle IOA, by Pythagoras theorem: (OI)² + (IA)² = (OA)². I know OI is sqrt(13), OA is 13. Let me plug those in. 

So, (sqrt(13))² + (IA)² = 13². That's 13 + (IA)² = 169. Then, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156. So IA is sqrt(156). Let me see if I can simplify that. sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39). 

Now, what else do I know about IA? IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I seem to remember that the length of the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. 

Wait, maybe there's a formula for the length of the angle bisector or something related. Alternatively, perhaps I can express IA in terms of the sides of the triangle. 

I think the formula for IA is IA = (r)/sin(A/2), where r is the inradius. Let me verify that. Hmm, yes, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex is given by IA = r / sin(A/2). 

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). We found IA to be 2*sqrt(39) and r is 6. So, 2*sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2). Let me write that equation: 

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13. 

Wait, let me compute that correctly. 

Wait, 6 divided by 2√39 is 3 / √39. Rationalizing the denominator: (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13. So, sin(A/2) = √39 / 13. 

So, sin(A/2) is √39 / 13. Hmm. I can maybe find cos(A/2) from this. Since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. 

Alternatively, since A is an angle in the triangle, A/2 is acute, so cos(A/2) is positive. So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. 

Now, I know that in a triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me think about that. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, AB is the side opposite angle C, and AC is the side opposite angle B. Wait, no. Maybe it's better to use the formula for the area. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula involving the inradius and the semiperimeter. 

Wait, another approach: I remember that in any triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the circumradius and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, the formula is AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B. So, AB·AC = 4R² sin B sin C. 

Hmm, interesting. So, AB·AC = 4R² sin B sin C. That might be useful. 

But then, I might need to find sin B and sin C. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate angles B and C to angle A, since I have information about angle A/2. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter. The area is r*s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area is (AB·AC·sin A)/2. 

Wait, let me write down the area in two ways. 

Area = r*s = 6*s. 

Also, Area = (AB * AC * sin A)/2. 

So, 6s = (AB * AC * sin A)/2. 

So, AB * AC = (12s)/(sin A). 

Hmm, so if I can find sin A and s, I can find AB * AC. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Because I know sin(A) = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2). 

So, sin A = 2*(√39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39 * 130)/169. Let me compute 39*130. 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total is 5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, let's see: 5070 factors. 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13². So sqrt(5070)=13*sqrt(30). 

So, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13. 

So, sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13. 

Now, going back to the area formula: 6s = (AB * AC * (2 sqrt(30)/13))/2. Simplify that: 6s = (AB * AC * sqrt(30))/13. 

So, AB * AC = (6s * 13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30). 

Hmm, but I don't know s yet. Maybe I can find s somehow. 

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumradius. We have OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) =13, as I found earlier. 

Also, I know that OI can also be expressed in terms of other triangle parameters. The formula for OI is sqrt(R(R - 2r)), which we already used. But maybe there's another formula involving the sides of the triangle. 

Wait, another formula for OI² is R² - 2Rr. Wait, but that's the same as OI² = R² - 2Rr. Wait, no, OI² = R² - 2Rr is another form. Wait, but earlier I used OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check. 

Wait, R(R - 2r) = R² - 2Rr, so yes, same thing. So OI² = R² - 2Rr. 

But maybe I can find other relations. Let me
