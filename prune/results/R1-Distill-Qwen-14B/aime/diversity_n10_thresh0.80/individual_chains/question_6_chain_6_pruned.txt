Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the functions involved. Both functions involve f and g, which are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, f and g are absolute value functions with some modifications. Let me sketch these functions quickly to visualize them.

Starting with f(x): it's the absolute value of |x| - 1/2. So, normally, |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 would shift the vertex down by 1/2, but since we're taking the absolute value again, it might create a W-shape. Let me think. When |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) would be |x| - 1/2. But when |x| is less than 1/2, |x| - 1/2 becomes negative, so the absolute value would flip it to 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V-shape that has vertices at x = ±1/2, y=0, and it peaks at x=0, y=1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Using the same logic, |x| - 1/4 becomes negative when |x| < 1/4, so g(x) would be 1/4 - |x| in that interval, and |x| - 1/4 otherwise. So g(x) is also a V-shape with vertices at x = ±1/4, y=0, and peaks at x=0, y=1/4.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, I need to figure out what these functions look like when plotted.

Let me first consider y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function normally has a period of 2π, but with 2πx inside, the period becomes 1. So sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of 1.

2. Then apply f to it: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. As I found earlier, f(x) is a V-shape with vertices at ±1/2, so applying it to sin(2πx) will transform the sine wave. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, f(sin(2πx)) will be as follows:
   - When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.
   - When |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

3. Next, apply g to f(sin(2πx)): g(f(...)) = ||f(...) - 1/4|. So, this will take the output of f and apply another absolute value transformation. The same as before: when the input is >= 1/4, it subtracts 1/4; otherwise, it subtracts the input from 1/4.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))). So, scaling the output of g by 4.

Putting this all together, y is a function that oscillates based on sin(2πx), transformed through f and g, and scaled up.

Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), the structure is the same, but with cos(3πy) instead of sin(2πx), and the equation is for x in terms of y.

I need to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs. So, essentially, I'm looking for all (x, y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). 

Since each equation defines a relationship between x and y, the intersections occur where both equations are satisfied simultaneously. So, substituting one into the other might help, but given the complexity, maybe analyzing the behavior of these functions over their domains is a better approach.

Let me first try to understand the ranges of these functions.

Starting with f(x): since |x| is between 0 and 1 for sin(2πx) and cos(3πy), because sine and cosine functions only output values in [-1, 1]. So, |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| are between 0 and 1.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will take |sin(2πx)|, subtract 1/2, and take absolute value. Let's compute the maximum and minimum values.

When |sin(2πx)| = 1, f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
When |sin(2πx)| = 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, no: f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So when x = 0, it's |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When x = 1, |1 - 1/2| = 1/2. Hmm, so does f(x) vary between 0 and 1/2?

Wait, no. Let's compute f(x) for x in [0,1], since |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So, f(x) = |x - 1/2| for x >= 1/2, and f(x) = 1/2 - x for x < 1/2. So, f(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2. When x = 1/2, f(x) = 0. At x=0 and x=1, f(x)=1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will produce values between 0 and 1/2. Similarly, when we apply g to this, which is ||y| - 1/4|, but wait, no: g is applied to the output of f. So, let me denote z = f(sin(2πx)), so z is between 0 and 1/2. Then, g(z) = | |z| - 1/4 |. But z is non-negative, so g(z) = | z - 1/4 |.

So, since z is between 0 and 1/2, when z < 1/4, g(z) = 1/4 - z. When z >= 1/4, g(z) = z - 1/4. So, the range of g(z) when z is in [0,1/2] is [0, 1/4]. Because when z=0, g(z)=1/4; when z=1/4, g(z)=0; when z=1/2, g(z)=1/4.

Therefore, 4g(z) would scale this range to [0, 1], because 4*(1/4) = 1. So, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will have values between 0 and 1. Similarly, for x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), the same applies: x will be between 0 and 1.

So, the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are both in the domain [0,1] for both x and y. That's a useful constraint.

Now, I need to find how many times these two curves intersect within the square [0,1]x[0,1].

Let me think about how to approach this. Since each function is periodic and involves nested absolute values, perhaps it's helpful to consider their periods and symmetry.

First, let's analyze y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). The inner function is sin(2πx), which has a period of 1. So, the entire function y is periodic with period 1 in x. Similarly, the other function x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) has cos(3πy) inside, which has a period of 2/3 in y. So, the function for x is periodic with period 2/3 in y.

But since both functions are confined to [0,1], perhaps I can analyze the behavior within this interval.

Let me consider plotting both functions or understanding their behavior in terms of their oscillations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the problem. Since we're dealing with y as a function of x and x as a function of y, we can try to find points (x, y) where both equations hold.

Wait, but solving these equations simultaneously might be tricky, especially with the nested functions. Maybe I can consider substitution.

Given that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))), perhaps I can substitute y from the first equation into the second equation.

So, x = 4g(f(cos(3π * y))) = 4g(f(cos(3π * (4g(f(sin(2πx))))))).

Hmm, that's a mouthful. It's a recursive equation where x is expressed in terms of y, which is expressed in terms of x. Not sure if that approach is feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the functions' behavior over their domains and see how many intersections are possible.

Let me first analyze y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) in more detail.

Breaking down y:

1. sin(2πx): oscillates between -1 and 1 with period 1.

2. f(sin(2πx)): as discussed, this transforms the sine wave into a V-shaped function that is 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2. So, f(sin(2πx)) varies between 0 and 1/2.

3. g(f(...)): Now, taking the output of f, which is between 0 and 1/2, and applying g. As we saw, g(z) = |
