Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think this is a classic combinatorial game theory problem. These types of problems often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, if I can figure out the losing positions, that's the key. Because if Bob is in a losing position, that means Alice can force a win. Wait, no, actually, in this case, we want positions where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves. So, Bob can only do that if the starting position is a losing position for Alice. Because if Alice is in a losing position, Bob can win.

Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, then Alice can't force a win, meaning Bob can. So, the positions where the first player (Alice) is in a losing position are the ones where Bob can win.

So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is a losing position for Alice. Each of these n corresponds to a situation where Bob can guarantee a win.

How do I model this? I think I can use dynamic programming or recursive analysis to determine for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's start by considering small n and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. Wait, no. If Alice takes 1, n=1 left, Bob takes it and wins. So, Alice would instead take 1 and win. Wait, no, if Alice takes 1, she leaves n=1 for Bob. But Bob can take that 1 and win, meaning Alice would lose. Wait, wait. Let me make this clear.

Wait, no, in the game, the player who takes the last token wins. So, for n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Or Alice can take 4, but she can't because n=2. So, she can only take 1. So, Bob wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1, she leaves n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice because whatever she does, Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position (L). So, Bob can win if n=2.

Wait, but wait. If Alice is at n=2, she can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. But n=1 is a winning position for Bob because he can take it and win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So, Bob can win at n=2.

n=3: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving n=2 for Bob. Since n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is, Bob is in an L position, meaning Alice can force Bob to lose. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob is left with n=2 (which is an L position for Bob), so Bob can't win. Therefore, Alice can win by taking 1. So, n=3 is a winning position (W).

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. If n=3, Alice can take 1, leaving n=2 for Bob. Since n=2 is a losing position for Bob, that means Alice can force Bob into a losing position, so n=3 is W.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win. So, n=4 is a W position.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving n=4 for Bob. n=4 is a W position for Bob because he can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, she can take 4, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, whatever Alice does, Bob can win. So, n=5 is an L position. So, Bob can win if n=5.

Wait, let me check again. For n=5, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4.

If she takes 1, then n=4 is left. Bob can take 4 and win. If she takes 4, n=1 is left, Bob takes 1 and wins. So, yes, both options lead to Bob winning. So, n=5 is L.

n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving n=5 for Bob. Since n=5 is L for Bob, meaning Bob can't win, which would mean Alice can win by taking 1. So, n=6 is W.

Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving n=2 for Bob. n=2 is L for Bob, so again, Alice can win. So, n=6 is W.

Wait, but in that case, n=6 is W because Alice can leave Bob in an L position. So, n=6 is W.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving n=6 for Bob, which is W. Or she can take 4, leaving n=3 for Bob, which is W. So, whatever she does, Bob can win. Thus, n=7 is L.

Wait, let's verify. If Alice takes 1, n=6 is left. Bob can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for Alice). So, n=6 is W, meaning Bob can win from there. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, n=6 is W for the player whose turn it is. So, if Alice leaves n=6 for Bob, then Bob is in a W position, which means Bob can win. So, that's bad for Alice.

Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving n=3 for Bob. n=3 is W for Bob, so Bob can win. So, both options leave Bob in a W position. So, n=7
