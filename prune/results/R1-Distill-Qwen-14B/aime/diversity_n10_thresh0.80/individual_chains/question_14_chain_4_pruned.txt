Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000, and then add them together to get the final answer.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. First, let's understand what the problem is asking. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. When any single digit of N is replaced by 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is abcd (where a, b, c, d are its digits), then changing a to 1 gives 1bcd, changing b to 1 gives a1cd, changing c to 1 gives ab1d, and changing d to 1 gives ab1d, and each of these should be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's denote N as a four-digit number represented as wxyz, where w, x, y, z are the digits. So N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z.

Now, when we change any single digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, let's write down what each of these changes would look like.

1. Changing the thousands digit (w) to 1: 1xyz. So, 1000*1 + 100x + 10y + z must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (x) to 1: w1yz. So, 1000w + 100*1 + 10y + z must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (y) to 1: wx1z. So, 1000w + 100x + 10*1 + z must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the units digit (z) to 1: wxy1. So, 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. Let's consider each condition one by one.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z.

So, the four modified numbers are:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100x + 10y + z
2. N2 = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z
3. N3 = 1000w + 100x + 10 + z
4. N4 = 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. That is, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's write these congruences:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000 + 100x + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000w + 100 + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000w + 100x + 10 + z ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Now, I can write each of these in terms of N:

Let me compute N modulo 7 for each case.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let me compute each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N.

For N1: It's 1000 + 100x + 10y + z = (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) - 1000w + 1000. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually N1 is 1 followed by x, y, z. So, N1 is 1000 + 100x + 10y + z.

Similarly, N2 is w*1000 + 100*1 + 10y + z = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z.

N3 is 1000w + 100x + 10*1 + z = 1000w + 100x +10 + z.

N4 is 1000w + 100x + 10y +1.

But I can express each of these in terms of N and some modification.

For example, N1 = 1000 + 100x + 10y + z = (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) - 1000w + 1000 = N - 1000w + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = 1000w + 100 + 10y + z = N - (100x + 10y + z) + 100 = N - (100x + 10y + z) + 100.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo 7 and set them equal to zero.

So, let's compute each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo 7.

First, let's compute the modulus of each of these numbers.

We know that 1000 ≡ 1000 mod 7. Let's compute 1000 divided by 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 ≡ 100 mod 7. 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ≡ 3 mod 7, since 10-7=3.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, now, let's compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo 7.

1. N1 = 1000 + 100x +10y + z.

Modulo 7, this is (6) + (2)x + (3)y + z ≡ 0 mod7.

So, 6 + 2x +3y + z ≡0 mod7.

2. N2 =1000w +100 +10y + z.

Modulo7: 6w + 2 +3y + z ≡0 mod7.

3. N3=1000w +100x +10 + z.

Mod7: 6w +2x +3 + z ≡0 mod7.

4. N4=1000w +100x +10y +1.

Mod7: 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2x +3y + z ≡0 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6w + 2 +3y + z ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6w +2x +3 + z ≡0 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation 4)

Hmm. So, four equations with variables w, x, y, z. Remember that w, x, y, z are digits, so they range from 0 to 9, except w which is from 1 to 9 (since it's a four-digit number).

Our goal is to find the largest possible four-digit number N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z that satisfies all four congruences.

So, perhaps we can express some variables in terms of others using these equations.

Let me try to subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4.

Equation4: 6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation1: 6 + 2x +3y + z ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting Equation1 from Equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6 + 2x +3y + z) ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify:

6w -6 +1 - z ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6(w -1) + (1 - z) ≡0 mod7.

So, 6(w -1) + (1 - z) ≡0 mod7.

Let me write this as 6(w -1) ≡ (z -1) mod7.

Similarly, perhaps I can subtract other equations.

Let me subtract Equation 2 from Equation4.

Equation4:6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0.

Equation2:6w +2 +3y +z ≡0.

Subtract Equation2 from Equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6w +2 +3y +z) ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify: 2x +1 -2 -z ≡0 mod7.

Which is 2x -1 -z ≡0 mod7.

So, 2x - z ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation5.

Similarly, subtract Equation3 from Equation4.

Equation4:6w +2x +3y +1 ≡0.

Equation3:6w +2x +3 + z ≡0.

Subtract Equation3 from Equation4:

(6w +2x +3y +1) - (6w +2x +3 + z) ≡0 -0 mod7.

Simplify: 3y +1 -3 -z ≡0 mod7.

Which is 3y -2 -z ≡0 mod7.

So, 3y - z ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation6.
