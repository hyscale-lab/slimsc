Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some logarithm properties. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the property I just remembered, this should mean that x^10 = y^x. Let me write that down: x^10 = y^x. Okay, that's one equation.

The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Similarly, this would mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. So that's the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Now I have two equations:
1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to solve for x and y. Since both x and y are greater than 1, they're positive real numbers, so I don't have to worry about undefined logarithms or anything like that.

Let me see if I can express both equations in terms of x and y, maybe take logarithms again to linearize the exponents.

Starting with the first equation: x^10 = y^x.

Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(x^10) = ln(y^x).

Using the power rule for logarithms, that's 10 ln x = x ln y.

So, equation (1) becomes: 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}.

Taking natural logs: ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}).

Which gives: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So equation (2) becomes: 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now I have two equations:
1. 10 ln x = x ln y  --> let's call this equation (A)
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x --> equation (B)

Hmm, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.

From equation (A), 10 ln x = x ln y. I can solve for ln y: ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

Similarly, from equation (B), 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let me substitute ln y from equation (A) into this.

So, substituting ln y = (10 ln x)/x into equation (B):

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side: (100 ln x) / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, okay, I can divide both sides by ln x, since ln x isn't zero (because x > 1, so ln x is positive).

So, (100 / x) = 4y.

Simplify: 100 / x = 4y --> divide both sides by 4: 25 / x = y.

So, y = 25 / x.

That's useful! So y is 25 divided by x. Now I can substitute this back into one of the equations to find x.

Let me use equation (A): 10 ln x = x ln y.

But y is 25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So equation (A) becomes:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x).

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln 25 = 0.

Factor x ln x from the first and third terms:

Wait, no, better to factor terms with ln x:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln 25 = 0.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25.

So, ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can express this equation in terms of exponentials.

Let me consider:

x^10 = y^x, which is from the original equation.

But since y = 25/x, let's substitute that in:

x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Let me write that as x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x).

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x.

Hmm, that's interesting. So x^{x + 10} = 25^x.

I can take the natural log of both sides:

(x + 10) ln x = x ln 25.

Which brings me back to the equation I had earlier: ln x (x + 10) = x ln 25.

Hmm, same as before. So I need to solve this equation for x.

Let me write it again:

(x + 10) ln x = x ln 25.

Let me rearrange terms to see if I can get an equation in terms of x.

Divide both sides by x:

(1 + 10/x) ln x = ln 25.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can make a substitution here. Let me set t = x. Then the equation becomes:

(t + 10) ln t = t ln 25.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, so it might not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can find a numerical solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can test for integer values of x that might satisfy this equation.

Let me try x = 5.

Plug in x=5:

(5 + 10) ln5 = 5 ln25.

Left side: 15 ln5 ≈ 15 * 1.6094 ≈ 24.141.

Right side: 5 ln25. Since 25 is 5^2, ln25=2 ln5. So 5 * 2 ln5 =10 ln5 ≈ 10 *1.6094≈16.094.

24.141 ≈ 16.094? No, not equal. So x=5 is not a solution.

Wait, but 25 is 5^2, so maybe x=5 is a possible value? Hmm, but it's not working.

Wait, let me see: Maybe x=25?

Plug x=25:

(25 + 10) ln25 =25 ln25.

Left side: 35 ln25 ≈35*3.2189≈112.6615.

Right side:25 ln25≈25 *3.2189≈80.4725.

Not equal. So x=25 is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps x=?

Wait, perhaps x is a power of 5? Let me think.

Wait, maybe we can find x such that (x +10) ln x =x ln25.

Let me write it as:

(x +10)/x = ln25 / ln x.

Which is (1 + 10/x) = ln25 / ln x.

Hmm, not sure. Maybe try x=10.

x=10:

(10 +10) ln10 =20 *2.3025≈46.05.

Right side:10 ln25≈10*3.2189≈32.189.

Not equal.

Hmm, maybe x=2?

Left: (2 +10) ln2=12 *0.6931≈8.317.

Right:2 ln25≈2*3.2189≈6.4378. Not equal.

x=3:

Left: 13 ln3≈13*1.0986≈14.2818.

Right:3 ln25≈3*3.2189≈9.6567. Not equal.

x=4:

Left:14 ln4≈14*1.3863≈19.4082.

Right:4 ln25≈4*3.2189≈12.8756. Not equal.

x=6:

Left:16 ln6≈16*1.7918≈28.6688.

Right:6 ln25≈6*3.2189≈19.3134. Not equal.

x=7:

Left:17 ln7≈17*1.9459≈33.0803.

Right:7 ln25≈7*3.2189≈22.5323. Not equal.

x=8:

Left:18 ln8≈18*2.0794≈37.4292.

Right:8 ln25≈8*3.2189≈25.7512. Not equal.

x=9:

Left:19 ln9≈19*2.1972≈41.7468.

Right:9 ln25≈9*3.2189≈28.9701. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe x is a fractional value? But x>1, so perhaps x=5/2=2.5?

Let me try x=2.5.

Left: (2.5 +10) ln2.5 =12.5 *0.9163≈11.4537.

Right:2.5 ln25≈2.5*3.2189≈8.04725. Not equal.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation in terms of exponents.

Wait, let's look back. I have:

(x +10) ln x = x ln25.

Let me divide both sides by x:

(1 + 10/x) ln x = ln25.

So, (1 + 10/x) ln x = ln25.

Wait, perhaps I can let t = x, so the equation is (1 + 10/t) ln t = ln25.

I'm not sure, but maybe trying to find a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that x is a power of 5, since 25 is 5^2.

Let me suppose x=5^k, where k is some real number.

Then, ln x = ln(5^k)=k ln5.

Similarly, let's substitute into the equation (x +10) ln x =x ln25.

So,

(5^k +10) *k ln5 =5^k * ln25.

But ln25 is 2 ln5. So,

(5^k +10) *k ln5 =5^k * 2 ln5.

We can divide both sides by ln5:

(5^k +10)k =2*5^k.

So,

k*5^k +10k =2*5^k.

Bring all terms to one side:

k*5^k +10k -2*5^k =0.

Factor out 5^k from the first and third terms:

5^k (k -2) +10k =0.

Hmm, so 5^k(k - 2) +10k =0.

Hmm, maybe factor out (k -2):

Wait, 5^k (k -2) + 10k =0.

Not sure if that helps. Maybe we can write it as:

5^k (k - 2) = -1
