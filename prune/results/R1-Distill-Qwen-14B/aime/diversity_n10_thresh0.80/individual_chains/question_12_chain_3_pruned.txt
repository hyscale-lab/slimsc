Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading the grid left to right equals 999. The second condition is that the sum of the three numbers formed by reading the grid top to bottom equals 99. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a single digit (0-9). Let me denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the grid has cells a, b, c in the first row and d, e, f in the second row. Now, when we read the grid left to right, we get two numbers: the first is the three-digit number 'abc' (which is 100a + 10b + c) and the second is the three-digit number 'def' (which is 100d + 10e + f). The sum of these two numbers should be 999.

Similarly, when we read the grid top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. The first column is 'ad' (10a + d), the second column is 'be' (10b + e), and the third column is 'cf' (10c + f). The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

So, summarizing the conditions:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

I think I can simplify these equations to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

I can group terms based on their place values:

(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999

Factor out the common factors:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999

Similarly, the second equation:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Grouping terms:

(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Factor out 10 from the first group:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Hmm, okay, so now I have two equations:

1. 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999
2. 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

Let me denote some variables to make this easier. Let's let:

S1 = a + d
S2 = b + e
S3 = c + f

So equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

And equation 2 can be related to these as well. Let's see:

From equation 2:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

But wait, a + d = S1, so d = S1 - a. Similarly, e = S2 - b and f = S3 - c.

So substituting d, e, f into equation 2:

10(a + b + c) + (S1 - a + S2 - b + S3 - c) = 99

Simplify:

10a + 10b + 10c + S1 - a + S2 - b + S3 - c = 99

Combine like terms:

(10a - a) + (10b - b) + (10c - c) + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99
9a + 9b + 9c + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99

Factor out the 9:

9(a + b + c) + (S1 + S2 + S3) = 99

Hmm. Now, I need to find relations between S1, S2, S3 and a, b, c.

Wait, from equation 1:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999

So, perhaps I can find S1, S2, S3 first.

Let me think about the possible values for S1, S2, S3. Since each of a, d are digits, their sum S1 = a + d can range from 0 (if a=d=0) up to 18 (if a=d=9). Similarly, S2 and S3 can each be between 0 and 18.

But given that 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999, which is a three-digit number, let's think about what S1, S2, S3 could be.

The number 999 is 9 hundreds, 9 tens, and 9 ones.

So, 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Which suggests that S1, S2, S3 must each be 9, because 100*9 + 10*9 +9 = 999.

Wait, but let me confirm that. 100*9 = 900, 10*9=90, 9=9. Sum is 900+90+9=999. Yes, that works. So S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, S1 = a + d = 9

S2 = b + e = 9
