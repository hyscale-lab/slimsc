Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's write down the given equations using logarithm properties. I know that log base a of b^c is equal to c times log base a of b. So, applying that to both equations.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. But wait, log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x, which I can rewrite using the change of base formula. Remember, log_x(y) is equal to ln(y)/ln(x). So substituting that in, the equation becomes x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10.

Let me write that as equation (1):
x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, using the power rule, that's equal to 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Again, log_y(x) is ln(x)/ln(y), so substituting that in, we get 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. Let's call this equation (2):
4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1) x * (ln y / ln x) = 10
2) 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

Hmm, looking at these, I notice that the terms ln y / ln x and ln x / ln y are reciprocals of each other. Let me denote A = ln y / ln x. Then equation (1) becomes x * A = 10, so x = 10 / A.

Equation (2) is 4y * (1/A) = 10. Because ln x / ln y is 1/(ln y / ln x) which is 1/A. So equation (2) simplifies to (4y)/A = 10. So that gives 4y = 10A, which means y = (10A)/4 = (5A)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Let's write that down:

x = 10 / A
y = (5A)/2

But I also know that A is ln y / ln x. So substituting the expressions for x and y in terms of A into this, I can create an equation just in terms of A. Let's do that.

A = ln y / ln x

Substituting:
y = (5A)/2
x = 10 / A

So,

A = ln[(5A)/2] / ln[10/A]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but perhaps I can simplify it. Let's write this out:

A = [ln(5A/2)] / [ln(10/A)]

Let me make this equation easier to handle. Let's denote t = A. So the equation is:

t = [ln(5t/2)] / [ln(10/t)]

I can rewrite this as:

t * ln(10/t) = ln(5t/2)

Now, let's expand the logarithms using logarithm properties.

First, ln(10/t) is ln(10) - ln(t). Similarly, ln(5t/2) is ln(5) + ln(t).

So substituting these in, the equation becomes:

t * [ln(10) - ln(t)] = ln(5) + ln(t)

Let me distribute the t on the left side:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) = ln(5) + ln(t)

Hmm, now collect like terms. Let's bring all terms to one side:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) = 0

Factor out ln(t) from the terms that have it:

t ln(10) - ln(t)(t + 1) - ln(5) = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

t ln(10) - ln(5) = ln(t) (t + 1)

So,

ln(t) = [t ln(10) - ln(5)] / (t + 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can take exponentials of both sides to eliminate the logarithm. Let's try that.

Let me denote the right-hand side as some function of t. Let me write:

ln(t) = [t ln(10) - ln(5)] / (t + 1)

Exponentiating both sides:

t = exp( [t ln(10) - ln(5)] / (t + 1) )

This is getting complicated, but maybe I can let u = t + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can denote k = t + 1, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can cross-multiply to see if I can find a way to solve for t.

Wait, let me think about this:

Let me write the equation again:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) = 0

I can factor out ln(t) from the last two terms:

t ln(10) - ln(t)(t + 1) - ln(5) = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange terms:

t ln(10) - ln(5) = ln(t)(t + 1)

So,

ln(t) = [t ln(10) - ln(5)] / (t + 1)

Let me denote the right side as f(t), so ln(t) = f(t). Hmm, maybe I can plot these functions or see if there's a nice solution.

Wait, perhaps trying small integer values for t could work. Let me think: perhaps t is a nice number like 1, 2, 3, etc.

If t = 1:

Left side: ln(1) = 0

Right side: [1 * ln(10) - ln(5)] / (1 + 1) = [ln(10) - ln(5)] / 2 = (ln(2)) / 2 ≈ 0.3466

Not equal, so t=1 isn't a solution.

t=2:

Left side: ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

Right side: [2 ln(10) - ln(5)] / (2 + 1) = [2*2.3026 - 1.6094]/3 ≈ [4.6052 -1.6094]/3 ≈ (2.9958)/3 ≈ 0.9986

Not equal, but closer.

t=3:

Left: ln(3) ≈1.0986

Right: [3 ln(10) - ln(5)] /4 ≈ [3*2.3026 -1.6094]/4≈ [6.9078 -1.6094]/4≈5.2984/4≈1.3246

Not equal.

t=0.5:

Left: ln(0.5)≈-0.6931

Right: [0.5 ln(10) - ln(5)] / (0.5+1)= [0.5*2.3026 -1.6094]/1.5 ≈[1.1513 -1.6094]/1.5≈(-0.4581)/1.5≈-0.3054

Not equal.

t=4:

Left: ln(4)=1.3863

Right: [4 ln(10)-ln(5)]/5≈[4*2.3026 -1.6094]/5≈[9.2104 -1.6094]/5≈7.601/5≈1.5202

Hmm, still not matching.

t=5:

Left: ln(5)=1.6094

Right: [5 ln(10)-ln(5)]/6≈[5*2.3026 -1.6094]/6≈[11.513 -1.6094]/6≈9.9036/6≈1.6506

Close, but not equal. Left is 1.6094, right is ≈1.6506.

t=6:

Left: ln(6)=1.7918

Right: [6 ln(10)-ln(5)]/7≈[6*2.3026 -1.6094]/7≈[13.8156 -1.6094]/7≈12.2062/7≈1.7437

Still not matching.

t=7:

Left: ln(7)=1.9459

Right: [7 ln(10)-ln(5)]/8≈[7*2.3026 -1.6094]/8≈[16.1182 -1.6094]/8≈14.5088/8≈1.8136

Hmm, getting closer.

t=8:

Left: ln(8)=2.0794

Right: [8 ln(10)-ln(5)]/9≈[8*2.3026 -1.6094]/9≈[18.4208 -1.6094]/9≈16.8114/9≈1.8679

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the solution is a non-integer. Maybe I can set up an equation and try to solve for t numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation in a better way. Let me try to write t as u, to make it:

ln(u) = [u ln(10) - ln(5)] / (u + 1)

Multiply both sides by (u + 1):

(u + 1) ln(u) = u ln(10) - ln(5)

Bring all terms to the left:

(u + 1) ln(u) - u ln(10) + ln(5) = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have an analytical solution. So, perhaps I need to use numerical methods to approximate u.

Alternatively, maybe I can let u = v, and rewrite the equation as:

(v + 1) ln(v) = v ln(10) - ln(5)

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider plotting both sides or using iterative methods.

Wait, let me try to rearrange terms:

(v + 1) ln(v) - v ln(10) + ln(5) = 0

Let me denote this as f(v) = (v + 1) ln(v) - v ln(10) + ln(5)

I can try to find the root of f(v) = 0 numerically.

Let me compute f(v) for various v:

Start with v=2:

f(2) = 3 ln(2) - 2 ln(10) + ln(5)

Compute each term:

ln(2)=0.6931, ln(10)=2.3026, ln(5)=1.6094

3*0.6931≈2.0794

2*2.3026≈4.6052

So:

f(2)=2.0794 -4.6052 +1.6094≈(2.0794 +1.6094) -4.6052≈3.6888 -4.6052≈-0.9164

Negative.

v=3:

f(3)=4 ln(3) -3 ln(10) + ln(5)

4*1.0986≈4.3944

3*2.3026≈6.9078

So:

4.3944 -6.9078 +1.6094≈(4.3944 +1.6094) -6.9078≈6.0038 -6.9078≈-0.904

Still negative.

v=4:

f(4)=5 ln(4) -4 ln(10) + ln(5)

5*1.3863≈6.9315

4*2.3026≈9.2104

So:

6.9315 -9.2104 +1.6094≈(6.9315 +1.6094) -9.2104≈8.5409 -9.2104≈-0.6695

Still negative.

v=5:

f(5)=6 ln(5) -5 ln(10) + ln(5)

6*1.6094≈9.6564

5*2.3026≈11.5
