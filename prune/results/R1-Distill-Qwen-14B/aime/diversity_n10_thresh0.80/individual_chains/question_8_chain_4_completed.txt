Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, c equals 6,000,000. Let me write down the problem again to make sure I have it right:

Find the number of triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are nonnegative integers satisfying:
1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So two equations with three variables. Since we're dealing with nonnegative integers, maybe I can find some symmetry or factor the second equation somehow.

Looking at the second equation, it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Let me see if I can factor or rearrange this:

The second equation is:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I notice that each term is symmetric in two variables. Let's try factoring:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Yes, that's correct. So, it becomes:
= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively.

So, let's let S = a + b + c = 300.

Then, (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

Substituting these into the second equation:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So now, the second equation becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So now we have:

a + b + c = 300
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or other expressions. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that this expression is equal to 300(a² + b² + c²) minus (a³ + b³ + c³). Because:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³

Similarly for the other terms. So adding them up:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me write that down:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S and other symmetric sums.

I know that S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote P = ab + bc + ca and Q = abc.

Also, we have that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

Similarly, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S P + 3Q.

So, let's substitute these into the equation.

First, compute a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2P = 90,000 - 2P.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q.

Compute 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000; 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Now, substituting into the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

= 300*(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term:

300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P

Then subtract (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q):

So, 27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P -3Q = 6,000,000

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) + (-3Q) = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

0 + 300P -3Q = 6,000,000

Simplify further:

300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

Q = 100P - 2,000,000

So, now, we have expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of P and Q, and we found that Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P and Q must also be integers, and Q must be nonnegative as well because it's the product of nonnegative integers.

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 ⇒ 100P ≥ 2,000,000 ⇒ P ≥ 20,000.

Therefore, P must be at least 20,000.

Moreover, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the maximum possible value of P can be found. For example, when two variables are 0 and one is 300, P would be 0, but in our case P is at least 20,000, so that's a lower bound.

But let's think about what constraints we have on P.

Since S = 300, the possible maximum value of P is when a = b = c = 100, so P = ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000. Wait, no: If a = b = c = 100, then ab + bc + ca = 3*(100*100) = 30,000. But wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no: If a = b = c = 100, then ab = 100*100 = 10,000, so ab + bc + ca = 3*10,000 = 30,000. So P can be as high as 30,000.

Wait, but if two variables are 150 and the third is 0, then P = 150*150 + 150*0 + 0*150 = 22,500, which is less than 30,000.

Wait, but actually, the maximum occurs when all three are equal because of the symmetry. So, yes, P can go up to 30,000.

So P is in the range 20,000 ≤ P ≤ 30,000.

But let's see if that's correct. Wait, if a = 300, b = c = 0, then P = 0. But in our case, P is at least 20,000.

So, the possible values of P range from 20,000 to 30,000.

But perhaps the maximum possible value for P is higher? Let me think again. Wait, when a is as large as possible, with b and c as large as possible, but given that a + b + c = 300.

Wait, let me think: For fixed a, the maximum P is achieved when b = c = (300 - a)/2, assuming that 300 - a is even.

Wait, but since a, b, c are integers, 300 - a must be even for b and c to be integers if we are to maximize P.

So, in general, for given a, the maximum P is when b = c = (300 - a)/2, so ab + bc + ca = a*( (300 - a)/2 ) + ( (300 - a)/2 )^2 + a*( (300 - a)/2 )

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum of P occurs when two variables are equal and the third is as small as possible, but I'm not sure.

But perhaps we can compute the maximum possible P by considering that.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but since we're dealing with integers, maybe it's not necessary.

Wait, but perhaps we can compute the maximum P as when a = b, c is as small as possible.

Wait, but maybe the maximum occurs when all three variables are as equal as possible.

But perhaps I should just note that P can be as high as 30,000, as when a = b = c = 100, which gives P = 3*100*100 = 30,000.

So, P ranges from 20,000 to 30,000.

But let's go back to our equation.

We have Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Also, since Q = abc, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q must be a nonnegative integer.

So, 100P - 2,000,000 must be ≥ 0, which we've already established, so P must be ≥ 20,000.

Now, since Q = abc must be an integer, 100P must be an integer, which it is because P is an integer (since a, b, c are integers, P = ab + bc + ca is also an integer).

So, now, to find the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, but perhaps I can express Q in terms of S, P, and other symmetric sums.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that for given a, b, c, we can compute P and Q, but maybe it's tricky to proceed this way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if we fix two variables, then the third is determined by a + b + c = 300.

Wait, but with three variables, that's a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can find a substitution or assume some order to reduce the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the second equation can be written as a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Another thought: Maybe factor this expression differently.

Wait, let me see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a)
Similarly for the others. So, we have that expression as 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Wait, but I already used that approach earlier, leading me to 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, perhaps I can now express Q as 100P - 2,000,000.

So, with Q = abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since S = 300, P is the sum of the products of the variables two at a time, and Q is the product of all three.

So, now, perhaps I can consider the monic cubic polynomial whose roots are a, b, c.

That polynomial would be x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0.

So, x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

But since Q = 100P - 2,000,000, substituting that in:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0
Simplify:
x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0
Hmm, perhaps I can factor this.

Let me group terms:

x³ - 300x² + (P - 100P)x + 2,000,000 = 0
Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the terms are:

x³ - 300x² + Px -100P + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor P from the middle terms:

x³ - 300x² + P(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as x³ - 300x² + Px = 100P - 2,000,000.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can think of this as a cubic in x and see if it can be factored.

Wait, perhaps we can consider that if a, b, c are roots, then perhaps I can use Vieta's formula.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think differently. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers and a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can assume some order, like a ≤ b ≤ c, to reduce the number of cases.

But with three variables, this might still be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second equation can be expressed as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a).

Wait, since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c, etc. So, that expression becomes:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b)

But this seems similar to what I had before.

Wait, perhaps I can write the second equation as:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000

But since a + b + c = 300, 300 - c = a + b, 300 - a = b + c, and 300 - b = a + c.

Hmm, so the second equation becomes:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000

Wait, but that's the same as earlier expressions, I think.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write ab(a + b) as ab(300 - c). So, the equation becomes:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, perhaps I can expand each term:

= 300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc
= 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Wait, but P is ab + bc + ca, which is 20,000 ≤ P ≤ 30,000.

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000

Which is the same as I derived before: Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, that's correct.

So, now we have:

Q = abc = 100P - 2,000,000

So, for each possible value of P, we can compute Q as 100P - 2,000,000, and then check if there exist nonnegative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300, ab + bc + ca = P, and abc = Q.

But this seems a bit abstract. Perhaps I can find a way to relate P and Q more directly.

Wait, let me think about the values of P and Q.

We have Q = 100P - 2,000,000. So, if I can find a, b, c such that ab + bc + ca = P and abc = 100P - 2,000,000, then that would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps factor this:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca = -2,000,000

Factor:

ab(c - 100) -100c(a + b) = -2,000,000

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps add 100^3 to both sides:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 100^3 = 100^3 - 2,000,000

So, the left side can be factored as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100)

Yes! Because:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac + 10000a -100bc + 10000b + 10000c - 1,000,000

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding. Let me check:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 100^2(a + b + c) - 100^3

Because:

First, expand two terms:

(a - 100)(b - 100) = ab -100a -100b + 10,000

Now, multiply by (c - 100):

= ab(c - 100) -100a(c - 100) -100b(c - 100) + 10,000(c - 100)
= abc -100ab -100ac + 10,000a -100bc + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000

So, grouping terms:

= abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000

So, that's the expansion.

Now, from our earlier equation, we had:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca = -2,000,000

So, substituting into the expansion:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000

But from our equation, abc -100ab -100ac -100bc = -2,000,000.

So,

= (-2,000,000) + 10,000*(a + b + c) - 1,000,000

But a + b + c = 300, so:

= (-2,000,000) + 10,000*300 - 1,000,000
= (-2,000,000) + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= 0

So, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0

Wait, that's interesting.

So, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

This implies that at least one of the terms (a - 100), (b - 100), or (c - 100) must be zero.

Therefore, at least one of a, b, c must be equal to 100.

So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a = 100.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, and a = 100, we have b + c = 200.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer solutions (b, c) to b + c = 200, and the second equation must satisfy the condition derived from setting a = 100.

Wait, but since (a - 100) = 0, then we already satisfy the condition, so all such triples where a = 100, and b + c = 200 will satisfy the second equation?

Wait, perhaps I should check that.

Wait, because earlier, we assumed that (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0, which arises from the second equation. So, any triple where at least one of a, b, c is 100 will satisfy the second equation.

Wait, but let me verify that.

Suppose a = 100, then we have b + c = 200.

Now, let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

Substituting a = 100:

= 100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b

= 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b

But since b + c = 200, perhaps I can substitute c = 200 - b.

Let me compute each term:

10,000b + 10,000c = 10,000(b + c) = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000

100b² + 100c² = 100(b² + c²)

b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*200

So, putting it all together:

2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200bc

Now, let's compute b² + c² + 2bc. Wait, that's (b + c)^2, which is 200² = 40,000.

Wait, but in our case, it's 100(b² + c²) + 200bc.

Hmm, so 100(b² + c²) + 200bc = 100(b² + c² + 2bc) = 100*(b + c)^2 = 100*(200)^2 = 100*40,000 = 4,000,000

So, the total becomes 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Which matches the second equation.

So, indeed, any triple where a = 100 and b + c = 200 will satisfy both equations.

Similarly, if b = 100 or c = 100, the same reasoning applies.

So, the solutions are all triples where one of a, b, c is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Now, since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, the number of solutions where a = 100 is equal to the number where b = 100 and the number where c = 100.

But we have to be careful not to double-count cases where two variables are 100.

Wait, can two variables be 100?

If a = 100 and b = 100, then c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100. So, c would also be 100. So, the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution where all three are 100.

So, in that case, how many times is this counted?

In the case where a = 100, we count all triples where a = 100, including when b and/or c are 100.

Similarly for b = 100 and c = 100.

So, to compute the total number of triples, we can compute the number of solutions for each case (a = 100, b = 100, c = 100) and then subtract the overlaps where two are 100, and then add back the case where all three are 100.

But perhaps it's easier to model each case separately and then account for overlaps.

But let's think about how many solutions there are for each case.

Case 1: a = 100.

Then, b + c = 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201, since b can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 200, and c = 200 - b.

Similarly, Case 2: b = 100.

a + c = 200, which also has 201 solutions.

Case 3: c = 100.

a + b = 200, which also has 201 solutions.

Now, if we add these up: 201 + 201 + 201 = 603.

But wait, this counts the cases where two variables are 100 multiple times.

Specifically, when a = 100 and b = 100, then c = 100. Similarly for other pairs.

So, how many such cases are there?

There are three such cases where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 as well: (100,100,100), (100,100,100), and (100,100,100). Wait, no, actually, each pair (a,b), (a,c), (b,c) being 100 leads to the same triple (100,100,100).

So, in our initial count of 603, how many times is (100,100,100) counted?

Each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) includes the triple (100,100,100). So, it's counted three times in the sum of 201 + 201 + 201.

But in reality, it's only one unique triple.

Similarly, any triple where two variables are 100 and the third is 100 has been counted three times, whereas they should be counted once.

Wait, but in our problem, the only triple where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100, because if two are 100, then the third must be 100 as well (since 100 + 100 + c = 300 ⇒ c = 100).

Wait, let's check. Suppose a = 100 and b = 100, then c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100.

Similarly, if a = 100 and c = 100, then b = 100.

So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100.

So, how many times have we counted (100,100,100) in the initial count?

In each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100), so three times.

But it's only one unique triple, so we have to subtract 2 to correct for overcounting.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion principle says:

Total = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - (number with a=100 and b=100) - (number with a=100 and c=100) - (number with b=100 and c=100) + (number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100)

In our case:

Number with a=100: 201
Number with b=100: 201
Number with c=100: 201

Number with a=100 and b=100: 1 (since c must be 100)
Similarly, number with a=100 and c=100: 1
Number with b=100 and c=100: 1

Number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100: 1

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 - 1 - 1 + 1
= 603 - 3 + 1
= 603 - 2
= 601

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute again.

Wait, 201 + 201 + 201 = 603

Minus (1 + 1 + 1) = 3 → 603 - 3 = 600

Plus 1 → 601.

Hmm, but that suggests that the total number of unique triples is 601.

But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think about the possible cases.

When a=100, the number of triples is 201: (100, b, 200 - b), where b ranges from 0 to 200.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But when we add all three, we have 201 * 3 = 603.

But now, the triple where a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted once in each of the three cases, so three times in total.

Similarly, any other triple where one variable is 100 and the others are not is counted once.

So, the total number of unique triples is:

Number of triples with exactly one variable equal to 100: Each case (a=100, b=100, c=100) has 201 solutions, but each includes the triple where the other two variables are 100. So, the number of triples where exactly one variable is 100 is (201 - 1) = 200 for each case. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in each case (a=100), the number of triples where exactly a=100 and b and c are not both 100 is 201 - 1 = 200. Because when a=100, the only case where b and c are both 100 is when b=100 and c=100, which is one case. So, for a=100, we have 201 solutions, of which one has b=100 and c=100. Similarly, for b=100, one solution has a=100 and c=100, and so on.

So, the number of triples where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*(201 - 1) = 3*200 = 600.

Plus the one triple where all three variables are 100: (100,100,100).

So, total number of triples is 600 + 1 = 601.

Wait, but that contradicts our earlier inclusion-exclusion which gave 601. But let's check if that's correct.

Wait, but if we have 201 solutions for a=100, 201 for b=100, and 201 for c=100, with the overlapping cases where two variables are 100, which is three cases each with one solution, and the case where all three are 100, which is one solution.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 - (number of overlaps where two variables are 100) + (number where all three are 100)

Wait, no, inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

So, substituting:

= 201 + 201 + 201 - (number where a=100 and b=100) - (number where a=100 and c=100) - (number where b=100 and c=100) + (number where a=100 and b=100 and c=100)

Now, the number where a=100 and b=100 is 1 (since c must be 100). Similarly for the other intersections.

So,

= 603 - 1 - 1 -1 + 1
= 603 - 3 + 1
= 603 - 2
= 601

So, that's correct. The total number of triples where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

Therefore, the number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure that each of these triples indeed satisfies both equations.

We already checked that when one variable is 100, the other two sum to 200, and that the second equation is satisfied. So, all these triples satisfy both equations.

So, the answer is 601.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check if a, b, c can be zero.

Wait, for example, when a=100 and b=0, then c=200. So, the triple (100, 0, 200) would satisfy a + b + c = 300, and the second equation as we saw earlier.

Similarly, when a=100, b=200, c=0.

So, all these cases are valid.

So, the total number is 601.

So, the final answer is 601.


To solve the problem, we need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying the equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Rewrite the Second Equation:**
   The second equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000
   \]
   Using \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\). This gives:
   \[
   a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
   \]

2. **Express in Terms of Symmetric Sums:**
   Expanding and simplifying, we find:
   \[
   300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
   \]
   Using the identities \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)\) and \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc\), we substitute \(S = 300\), \(P = ab + bc + ca\), and \(Q = abc\). This leads to:
   \[
   100P - Q = 2,000,000 \quad \text{or} \quad Q = 100P - 2,000,000
   \]

3. **Factor the Polynomial:**
   Considering the polynomial \((a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100)\), we find it equals zero. Thus, at least one of \(a, b, c\) must be 100.

4. **Counting Solutions:**
   - If \(a = 100\), then \(b + c = 200\), giving 201 solutions.
   - Similarly, if \(b = 100\) or \(c = 100\), each yields 201 solutions.
   - Using inclusion-exclusion, we subtract overlaps where two variables are 100 and add back the case where all three are 100.

5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   The total number of solutions is:
   \[
   201 \times 3 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601
   \]

### Final Answer:
The number of valid triples \((a, b, c)\) is \(\boxed{601}\).
