Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Alright, let me try to visualize this and remember what I know about triangle centers and their properties.

First, let's recall some definitions. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's the center of the circumscribed circle with radius 13. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors and is the center of the inscribed circle with radius 6.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. I'm going to need to use this somehow. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry or vector methods, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think about properties or theorems related to these centers.

I remember there's a relation involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. The formula is OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: Yes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So in this case, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay that's useful.

But how does IA being perpendicular to OI come into play? Maybe I can consider the vectors or coordinates. Let me try setting up a coordinate system to model this.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since OI is perpendicular to IA, and I is at (0,0), maybe O lies along the y-axis and A lies somewhere along the x-axis? Wait, no, actually, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then if OI is along some direction, IA must be along a perpendicular direction.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates more carefully. Let me let I be at (0,0), and let me consider vectors. The vector OI is from I to O, which is vector O. The vector IA is from I to A, which is vector A. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero. So O · A = 0.

So, in this coordinate system, if I is at (0,0), then O is at some point (h, k), and A is at (x, y). Then, the dot product of O and A is h*x + k*y = 0. So that's one condition.

Also, O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = 13. So the distance from O to each vertex is 13.

Since I is the inradius center, the distance from I to each side is 6. Hmm. Maybe it's useful to express the coordinates of the other points B and C in terms of the triangle's properties.

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of another way. I've heard that if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the triangle might have some special properties, like being a right triangle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or formulae involving the sides of the triangle. Let's recall that in a triangle, the inradius r is given by r = (Area)/s, where s is the semi-perimeter. And the circumradius R is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area), where a, b, c are the sides.

Also, AB*AC is equal to b*c, assuming AB = c and AC = b. Wait, let me confirm: In standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So AB is c, AC is b. So AB * AC = b * c.

So I need to find b*c. Hmm. Maybe I can express b*c in
