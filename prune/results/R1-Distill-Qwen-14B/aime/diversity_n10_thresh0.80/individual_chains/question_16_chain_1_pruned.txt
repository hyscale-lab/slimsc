Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n, and then find the smallest m for that p.

First, I should probably figure out what p is. Once I have p, finding m might be easier.

So, starting with p being the smallest prime where p² divides some n⁴ + 1.

I remember that for primes p, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p². So the order of n modulo p² divides 8. But the order also divides φ(p²) = p(p-1). So, the order of n mod p² divides gcd(8, p(p-1)).

I think primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. Or maybe not? Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I should check small primes first and see if their squares divide any n⁴ +1.

Let me start with p=2.

For p=2, p²=4. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4.

Since n is a positive integer, n can be 1 or 2 mod 4.

n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2 ≡ 2 mod 4. Not 0.

n=2: 2⁴ +1=16 +1=17≡1 mod 4. Also not 0.

n=3: 3⁴ +1=81 +1=82≡2 mod 4.

n=4: 256 +1=257≡1 mod 4.

Wait, n⁴ mod 4: Let's compute for n even and odd.

If n is even, n=2k: n⁴=(2k)^4=16k^4≡0 mod 4. So, n⁴ +1 ≡1 mod 4.

If n is odd, n=2k+1: (2k+1)^4. Let's compute mod 4.

(2k+1)^2 = 4k² +4k +1 ≡1 mod 4.

So, (2k+1)^4 = ((2k+1)^2)^2 ≡1^2=1 mod 4.

So, for any n, n⁴ ≡0 or 1 mod 4. Adding 1, n⁴ +1 ≡1 or 2 mod 4.

Thus, for p=2, n⁴ +1 can't be 0 mod
