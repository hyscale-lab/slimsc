Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2 of ratios of these variables. Then it's asking me to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by writing down the given equations to get a clearer picture.

First equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2.

Second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3.

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4.

So, each of these logs equals a fraction, which suggests that each ratio inside the log is a power of 2. Since log₂(something) = a number, that means that the something is 2 raised to that number.

So, for the first equation, log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 implies that x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2).

Similarly, the second equation: y/(x z) = 2^(1/3).

Third equation: z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).

Okay, so I can rewrite each of these as:

1. x = y z * sqrt(2)  => x = sqrt(2) y z.

2. y = x z * 2^(1/3) => y = 2^(1/3) x z.

3. z = x y * 2^(1/4) => z = 2^(1/4) x y.

Now, this gives me three equations with x, y, z in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of one variable or find a relationship between them.

Let me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

Plug this into equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z.

Simplify the right side: x = sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z^2.

So, x = (2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3)) x * z^2.

Wait, 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) is 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So, x = 2^(5/6) x z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by x (since x is positive, can't be zero). Then:

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6).

Which is the same as z^2 = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots: z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.

Wait, let me check: 2 * (-5/12) is -5/6, so yes, that's correct.

So z = 2^(-5/12).

Okay, so z is found. Now, can I use this to find y or x?

Looking back at equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Divide both sides by 2^(1/4):

x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4).

Let me compute the exponent: -5/12 - 1/4. Since 1/4 is 3/12, it's -5/12 - 3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3.

So, x y = 2^(-2/3).

So, equation A: x y = 2^(-2/3).

Now, from equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

We already know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents: 2^(1/3 - 5/12).

Let me compute 1/3 - 5/12. 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 - 5/12 = -1/12.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

So equation B: y = x * 2^(-1/12).

Now, from equation A, x y = 2^(-2/3), and equation B gives y in terms of x.

Substitute B into A: x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3).

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12).

Compute exponent: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 + 1/12 = -7/12.

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24), since square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24).

Wait, let
