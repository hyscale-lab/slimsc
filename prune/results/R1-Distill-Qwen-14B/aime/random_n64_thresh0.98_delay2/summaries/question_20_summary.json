This leads us to consider the grid as divided into four regions:\n\n1. **White region**: Intersection of white rows and white columns.\n2. **Black region**: Intersection of black rows and black columns.\n3. **Empty regions**: Where rows and columns do not agree in color (white row & black column, or black row & white column).\n\nThe number of white chips is determined by the product of the number of white rows ($R_w$) and white columns ($C_w$), i.e., $R_w \\times C_w$. Similarly, the number of black chips is $(5 - R_w) \\times (5 - C_w)$. The problem requires that no more chips can be added without violating the constraints, meaning the arrangement is maximal.\n\nWe calculate the total number of valid arrangements by considering all possible combinations of $R_w$ (0 to 5) and $C_w$ (0 to 5). Each combination contributes $\\binom{5}{R_w} \\times \\binom{5}{C_w}$ ways. Summing over all valid combinations gives $(2^5)^2 = 1024$ total arrangements. However, we must exclude the two cases where no chips are placed: when all rows are white and all columns are black, and vice versa. Thus, the total number of valid arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n1024 - 2 = 1022\n\\]\n\n$\\boxed{1022}$"
