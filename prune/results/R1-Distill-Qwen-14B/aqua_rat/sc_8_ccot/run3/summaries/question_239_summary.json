      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. There are 100 boys in the class, and I need to find out how many girls are there. The options are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70.\n\nHmm. So, first, I should understand what the given information is. Let's break it down. \n\nSo, 2/5 of the class are girls. That means that girls make up 40% of the class because 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, which is 40%. That also implies that the remaining part must be boys. Wait, because 100% minus 40% is 60%, right? So boys make up 60% of the class.\n\nWait, but the problem says there are exactly 100 boys. So if 60% of the class equals 100 boys, then I can find the total number of students in the class. Once I have that, I can find the number of girls by taking 2/5 of the total.\n\nSo let me set that up. Let's denote the total number of children as T. Then, 60% of T is 100. So, 0.6 * T = 100. I can solve for T by dividing both sides by 0.6.\n\nCalculating that: T = 100 / 0.6. Hmm, 100 divided by 0.6. Let me think, 0.6 is 3/5, so dividing by 3/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/3. So 100 * (5/3) is (100*5)/3, which is 500/3. Wait, 500 divided by 3 is approximately 166.666..., but wait, that can't be right because the number of children should be a whole number. Oh, but wait, maybe the calculation is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. The problem says 2/5 are girls, which is 40%, so the remaining 60% are boys. And the number of boys is 100. So 60% of the total equals 100. So 0.6*T = 100. So T = 100 / 0.6. Let me compute that again. 100 divided by 0.6. \n\n0.6 is the same as 3/5. So 100 divided by (3/5) is 100 * (5/3), which is 500/3. 500 divided by 3 is 166.666..., which is about 166 and two-thirds. But that's a fraction, and the number of children can't be a fraction. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should consider that the class has a certain number of boys and girls, and 2/5 are girls. So the number of girls is 2/5 of the total, and the number of boys is 3/5 of the total because 1 minus 2/5 is 3/5.\n\nWait, yes. Because 2/5 girls plus 3/5 boys equals the whole class. So the boys are 3/5 of the total. So if 3/5 of the total is 100, then the total is (100) divided by (3/5), which is 100 * (5/3) = 500/3. That's about 166.666... which is 166 and 2/3. But that's a fractional number of students, which isn't possible. So that can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. \"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.\" So 2/5 are girls, which is 40%, so 60% are boys. The problem states there are 100 boys. So if 60% of the class is 100, then the total is 100 / 0.6 = 166.666... But that's a fraction, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the question is designed with this in mind, and I might have to proceed regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If 3/5 of the class are boys, and that's 100, then the total number of students is 100 divided by 3/5, which is 100 * 5/3 = 500/3. So that's about 166.666... which is 166 and 2/3. But wait, that would mean the number of girls is 2/5 of 500/3. Let's compute that. \n\n2/5 of 500/3 is (2/5) * (500/3) = (2 * 500) / (5 * 3) = (1000)/(15) = 200/3 \u2248 66.666... Again, a fractional number of students. That can't be correct because the number of girls must be a whole number. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the fractions wrong. Let me check again. If 2/5 are girls, then the fraction of boys is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5. So 3/5 of the class are boys. So if the number of boys is 100, then 3/5 of T equals 100. So T = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3 \u2248 166.666. But that's not possible because you can't have a fraction of a child. So perhaps the problem is designed with incorrect numbers, but I have to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm just miscalculating. Let me try to compute the number of girls. The total number of students is 500/3, and the number of girls is 2/5 of that. So 2/5 * 500/3 = (2 * 500) / (5 *3) = (1000) / 15 = 200/3 \u2248 66.666. Again, that's not a whole number.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's try another approach. Let's let the total number of students be T. The number of girls is (2/5)*T, and the number of boys is (3/5)*T. The number of boys is 100, so (3/5)*T = 100. Solving for T: T = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3 \u2248 166.666. Then, number of girls is (2/5)* (500/3) = (2 * 500) / (5 *3) = 1000/(15) = 200/3 \u2248 66.666. But that's not an integer. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe I should check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. So none of these options are approximately 66.666. So perhaps I made a mistake in my setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem states that 2/5 of the girls are a part of the class, but perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the class consists of boys and girls. So the number of girls is 2/5 of the class, and the number of boys is 3/5. But 3/5 of the class is 100. So, total T = 100 / (3/5) = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3 \u2248166.666. So the number of girls is 2/5 of T, which is 2/5 * 500/3 = 200/3 \u224866.666. But that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question was written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again. \"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 2/5 of the class are girls, meaning that the number of girls is (2/5) of the class, and the rest are boys. So, if there are 100 boys, then the boys are 3/5 of the class. So the total class is (100 boys) / (3/5) = 100 *5/3 = 500/3 \u2248166.666. So the number of girls is 2/5 * 500/3 = (1000)/(15)= 66.666, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe 2/5 of the boys are girls? No, that doesn't make sense. Girls can't be part of the boys. So that can't be it. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio. The ratio of girls to boys is 2:3, because girls are 2 parts and boys are 3 parts. So if the boys are 100, which is 3 parts, then each part is 100/3 \u224833.333. Then the number of girls is 2 parts, which would be 66.666. Again, same problem.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match 66.666. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the question intended that 2/5 of the class are girls, but the boys are 100. So the total is 100/(3/5) = 500/3, and girls are 2/5 of that, which is 200/3, which is about 66.666, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be the case because the problem expects an answer.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B=100. The total number of students is T = G + B.\n\nGiven that G = (2/5) * T. So substituting T as G + 100, we have:\n\nG = (2/5) * (G + 100)\n\nLet me solve this equation for G.\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n5G = 2*(G + 100)\n\n5G = 2G + 200\n\nSubtract 2G from both sides:\n\n3G = 200\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nG = 200/3 \u224866.666...\n\nAgain, the same result. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a fractional number, but that's unlikely because you can't have a fraction of a child. So maybe I've made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of girls, but the options don't match. Let me check the options again. The options are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. Hmm. None of these are 66.666. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again. \"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.\" So 2/5 are girls, which is 40%, boys are 60%. Boys are 100, so 60% of T = 100. So T = 100 / 0.6 = 166.666. Girls would be 2/5 * 166.666 = 66.666, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of girls to boys. Girls are 2, boys are 3. So the ratio is 2:3. So for every 2 girls, there are 3 boys. So if there are 100 boys, how many girls? Let's see. The ratio part for boys is 3, so each part is 100/3 \u224833.333. So girls, which are 2 parts, would be 66.666. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question was intended to have the number of girls as 2/5 of the number of boys. So girls are 2/5 of 100. That would be 40 girls. But that's option A)50? No, 2/5 of 100 is 40, but that's not one of the options either. Wait, the options don't include 40. So perhaps that's not the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the total number of students. Let me denote the number of girls as G and boys as 100. So the total is G + 100. The fraction of girls is G/(G+100) = 2/5.\n\nSo cross-multiplying: 5G = 2*(G+100)\n\n5G = 2G + 200\n\nSubtract 2G from both sides: 3G =200 \u2192 G= 200/3 \u224866.666.\n\nAgain, same result. So the number of girls is approximately 66.666, which is not an option. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says 2/5 of the children are girls. So the fraction is correct. So the only possibility is that the answer is not among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of girls is 2/5 of the boys. No, that would be G = (2/5)*100 =40, which isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that 2/5 of the class are girls, meaning that 2/5 of the girls are in the class? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's 2/5 of the class are girls, and the rest are boys. So the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the number of girls as 2/5 of the total, which is 100, but that would be G=40, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem states that 2/5 of the children are girls. So the number of girls is (2/5)*T. Boys are T - G = (3/5)*T. And the number of boys is 100. So (3/5)*T = 100 \u2192 T= (100 *5)/3=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are 2/5 * 500/3 = 200/3\u224866.666. So again, same result.\n\nBut the options are A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70. None of these match. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation, but I don't see where.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm supposed to find the number of girls as 2/5 of the boys. Let me see. If girls are 2/5 of the boys, then G = (2/5)*100 =40. But that's not an option. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says 2/5 of the girls are in the class. But that doesn't make sense. Because the girls are part of the class. So the fraction is of the total class.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think in terms of the number of girls. Let me denote the number of girls as G. Then the number of boys is 100. So the total T = G + 100.\n\nWe know that G = (2/5)*T \u2192 G = (2/5)(G + 100)\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 5G = 2(G +100)\n\n5G = 2G +200 \u2192 3G=200 \u2192 G=200/3 \u224866.666.\n\nAgain, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is 200/3, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was written incorrectly, and the correct number of boys would be such that the number of girls is a whole number. For example, if the number of boys is 150, then T would be 250, and girls would be 100 (2/5 of 250 is 100). But the problem states that the number of boys is 100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended 2/5 of the class are girls, and the number of girls is one of the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, let's see which option makes sense. Let's compute the number of boys for each option and see if 2/5 of the total are girls.\n\nOption A)50 girls. So T=50 +100=150. Girls are 50, which is 50/150=1/3 \u224833.33%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption B)100 girls. T=100+100=200. 100/200=1/2=50%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption C)150 girls. T=150+100=250. 150/250=3/5=60%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption D)200 girls. T=200+100=300. 200/300=2/3\u224866.67%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption E)70 girls. T=70+100=170. 70/170\u224841.18%. Not 2/5.\n\nSo none of the options give exactly 2/5 girls. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that 2/5 of the class are girls, and 3/5 are boys. So boys are 3/5 of the class. So if boys are 100, then the total is 100 *5/3= 500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are 2/5 of 166.666, which is 66.666. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was intended to have the number of girls as 2/5 of the number of boys. So girls = (2/5)*100=40. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the number of girls when 2/5 are girls, and the number of boys is 100. So the total is T = G +100, and G= (2/5)*T \u2192 substituting, G= (2/5)(G+100). Which leads to G=200/3\u224866.666. So the correct answer is 66.666, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is incorrect, but since the options don't match, perhaps I should look for the closest option, but that's not a good approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the fraction is of the boys. For example, perhaps 2/5 of the boys are girls. But that doesn't make sense because girls are a separate group. So I think that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as 2/5 of the class are girls, and the rest are boys. So the number of boys is 3/5 of the total. So if boys are 100, then total is 100/(3/5)=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are 2/5 *166.666\u224866.666. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the number of girls to be 2/5 of the number of boys. So girls = (2/5)*100=40. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the question's phrasing. Perhaps it's 2/5 of the class are girls, and the number of boys is 100. So the number of girls is 2/5 of the total. Let's see:\n\nTotal T = G + 100.\n\nG = (2/5)*T \u2192 G = (2/5)(G +100)\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 5G = 2G + 200 \u2192 3G=200 \u2192 G=200/3\u224866.666.\n\nHmm. So none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the problem expects us to choose the closest one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again for any miscalculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 2/5 of the class as girls, and the boys are 3/5. So boys=3/5 of T=100. So T=100*(5/3)=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls=2/5 * 500/3= (2*500)/(5*3)= 1000/(15)=200/3\u224866.666. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options are all integers, so perhaps the problem is designed with an error. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the number of girls as 100, but that would mean that girls are 100 and boys are 100, making the total 200. Then, the fraction of girls would be 100/200=1/2=50%, not 2/5. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps the problem has a typo, and the number of boys is different. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, but that doesn't make sense because 2/5 of 250 (150 girls +100 boys) is 150/250=3/5, which is 60%, not 40%.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that 2/5 of the boys are girls, which is impossible. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of girls is 2/5 of the number of boys. So girls = (2/5)*100=40. But that's not an option.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is phrased as 2/5 of the class are girls, and the number of boys is 100. So the total number of students is T. Girls are (2/5)T, boys are (3/5)T=100. So T=100*(5/3)=500/3\u2248166.666. So girls are (2/5)*(500/3)= 200/3\u224866.666. But again, no option matches.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the fraction of the class as girls, but perhaps it's the fraction of the boys. No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a ratio of girls to total, but I think I've considered that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options by computing the percentage of girls for each option.\n\nOption A)50 girls. Total=150. 50/150=1/3\u224833.33%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption B)100 girls. Total=200. 100/200=50%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption C)150 girls. Total=250. 150/250=3/5=60%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption D)200 girls. Total=300. 200/300\u224866.67%. Not 2/5.\n\nOption E)70 girls. Total=170. 70/170\u224841.18%. Not 2/5.\n\nSo none of the options have girls as 2/5 of the class. Therefore, the problem must have an error, but since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of girls is 2/5 of the number of boys. So girls = (2/5)*100=40. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-express 200/3 as a mixed number. 200 divided by 3 is 66 with a remainder of 2, so 66 and 2/3. That's approximately 66.666. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the total number of students must be a whole number, so perhaps the number of boys is adjusted. For example, if the number of boys were 150, then T=250, and girls would be 100 (2/5 of 250). But the problem states that the number of boys is 100, so that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the number of girls to be 2/5 of the boys. So girls=40, but that's not an option.\n\nI'm really stuck here. All my calculations point to 66.666 girls, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since that's not an option, maybe I should choose the closest one. But looking at the options, the closest would be E)70, which is 70, but that's still not close.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the number of girls when 2/5 of the boys are girls. But that doesn't make sense because girls can't be part of the boys.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the number of girls in the class when 2/5 of the class are girls, and the number of boys is 100. So the total is T = G +100. G = (2/5) T.\n\nSo substituting, G = (2/5)(G +100)\n\nMultiply both sides by 5: 5G = 2G + 200 \u2192 3G=200 \u2192 G=200/3\u224866.666.\n\nBut that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is intended to have the number of girls as 100, but that would require the total to be 250, which would make girls 100/250=40%, which is 2/5. So if girls are 100, then boys are 150. But the problem states that the number of boys is 100, not 150.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?\"\n\nSo, girls are 2/5 of the class, boys are 3/5. Boys are 100, so 3/5 of the class is 100. So total is 100 *5/3=500/3\u2248166.666. Girls are 2/5 of that, which is 66.666.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem for any possible miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is written as 2/5 of the class are girls, and the number of boys is 100. So, number of boys is 3/5 of the total. So, T = 100 / (3/5) = 100 *5/3=500/3\u2248166.666. So, number of girls is 2/5 of T, which is 2/5 *500/3=200/3\u224866.666.\n\nBut again, no option matches. So perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly, but given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option C)150, but that would mean the total is 250, which would make the fraction of girls 60%, not 40%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended the number of girls to be 2/5 of the boys. So girls=40, but that's not an option.\n\nI'm really stuck here. I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the problem expects an answer, perhaps I should choose the closest one, but that's not a good approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if I've made any calculation errors. Let me recompute:\n\nNumber of boys is 3/5 of T. So 3/5 * T =100 \u2192 T=100 *5/3=500/3\u2248166.666.\n\nGirls are 2/5 of T: 2/5 *500/3=200/3\u224866.666.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 66.666, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different setup. But given the options, I don't see any other way. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, but that doesn't fit the fractions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as 2/5 of the boys are girls, but that's impossible because you can't have part of the boys being girls. So that can't be it.\n\nI think I've reached the limit of my understanding. The only possible conclusion is that the correct answer isn't among the options, but since that's not possible, perhaps the problem has a typo. But given the options, I can't find a correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)150, but I'm not confident.\n\n\nThe problem states that 2/5 of the children in a class are girls, and there are 100 boys. To find the number of girls, we first note that if 2/5 of the class are girls, then 3/5 of the class are boys. Since the number of boys is given as 100, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot T = 100\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( T \\) is the total number of children in the class. Solving for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\nT = 100 \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.67\n\\]\n\nThe number of girls is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot T = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.67\n\\]\n\nThis result is not an integer, which is problematic since the number of children must be a whole number. None of the provided options (A) 50, (B) 100, (C) 150, (D) 200, (E) 70) match the calculated value of approximately 66.67. \n\nTo verify further, we can check each option by calculating the percentage of girls in the class:\n\n- **Option A (50 girls):** Total children = \\( 50 + 100 = 150 \\). Fraction of girls = \\( \\frac{50}{150} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 33.33\\% \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n- **Option B (100 girls):** Total children = \\( 100 + 100 = 200 \\). Fraction of girls = \\( \\frac{100}{200} = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\% \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n- **Option C (150 girls):** Total children = \\( 150 + 100 = 250 \\). Fraction of girls = \\( \\frac{150}{250} = \\frac{3}{5} = 60\\% \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n- **Option D (200 girls):** Total children = \\( 200 + 100 = 300 \\). Fraction of girls = \\( \\frac{200}{300} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n- **Option E (70 girls):** Total children = \\( 70 + 100 = 170 \\). Fraction of girls = \\( \\frac{70}{170} \\approx 41.18\\% \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nNone of the options satisfy the condition that girls make up \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the class. The correct answer, based on the calculations, is approximately 66.67 girls, but this value is not among the provided options. Given the constraints of the problem, there is no valid answer from the options provided.\n\nANSWER: None of the options are correct.",
