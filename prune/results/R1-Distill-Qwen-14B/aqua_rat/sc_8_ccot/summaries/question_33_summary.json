      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular sheet being folded into two equal halves, and I need to find the area. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm. Wait, so the sheet is being folded in two different ways, resulting in different perimeters each time. I guess I need to figure out the original dimensions of the sheet from this information.\n\nLet me denote the length and width of the original rectangle as L and W, respectively. So, the sheet is a rectangle with sides L and W.\n\nWhen it's folded along one set of sides, say the length, the resulting two parts would each have dimensions L/2 and W. Because you're folding along the length, you're splitting the length into two equal parts. Alternatively, if you fold along the width, each part would have dimensions L and W/2.\n\nWait, but the perimeter changes based on how you fold. Let me clarify: when you fold along one set of sides, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle. Each of these smaller rectangles has a perimeter given.\n\nSo, if I fold along the length (the longer side), each half would have a length of L/2 and width W. The perimeter of each half would then be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. And the problem states that this perimeter is 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folding along the width, each half would have a width of W/2 and length L. The perimeter would be 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W. This perimeter is given as 66 cm.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. L + 2W = 48\n2. 2L + W = 66\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find L and W.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W = 48\nEquation 2: 2L + W = 66\n\nHmm, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here. Let's multiply equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of L match.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 2: 2L + 4W = 96\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from this new equation:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) = 96 -66\n2L +4W -2L -W = 30\n3W =30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation 1 to find L.\n\nEquation1: L + 2*(10) =48 \u2192 L+20=48 \u2192 L=28 cm.\n\nWait, so L is 28 cm and W is 10 cm. The area of the original sheet is L*W = 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2? Wait, but none of the options are 280. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, looking at the options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200. None of these are 280. Oh wait, did I miscalculate the equations?\n\nLet me check my equations again. When folding along the length, each part has dimensions L/2 and W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48. That seems correct.\n\nWhen folding along the width, each part has L and W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66. Correct.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=48\nEquation2: 2L + W=66\n\nLet me solve equation1 for L: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10. So L=48-20=28.\n\nHmm, same result. So area is 28*10=280. But the options don't have 280. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the folding direction wrong. Maybe the perimeters are for the folded sheet when considering both halves? Or perhaps I have the equations reversed.\n\nWait, the question says \"a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part\". Each part is a smaller rectangle. So perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along one side, you get two smaller rectangles. Each of those smaller rectangles has a perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the folding is along the length or width, but I got the equations wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nOriginal sheet: L and W.\n\nCase 1: Fold along the length. So each half is (L/2) by W.\n\nPerimeter of each half: 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W. So that's 48.\n\nCase 2: Fold along the width. Each half is L by (W/2).\n\nPerimeter: 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W = 66.\n\nSo equations are correct.\n\nWait, maybe the original sheet has area L*W. Let me compute that. 28 *10=280. But the options are much larger. So perhaps I have to find the area when the sheet is unfolded, but no, that's what I'm computing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the perimeters. Let me re-express the perimeters correctly.\n\nWait, when folding along the length, each part is a rectangle of length L/2 and width W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folding along the width, each part is L by W/2. So perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nYes, equations are correct. So L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the question says \"a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, could it be that when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48 cm for each part, but when folded along the other, the perimeter is 66 cm for each part? Or perhaps the perimeters when folded along the two different directions are 48 and 66, but perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-express.\n\nWhen folded along one set of sides (e.g., length), the sheet becomes two parts, each with perimeter 48 cm. So each smaller rectangle has perimeter 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set (e.g., width), each part has perimeter 66 cm.\n\nSo my initial approach is correct.\n\nBut the area I get is 280, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, maybe I have the equations wrong. Let me think about the perimeters again.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded, the perimeters are of the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, but the sheet is folded into two equal halves. So when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a folded sheet of size L/2 and W, but the perimeter would be for the folded sheet (each part is a half, but perhaps the perimeter is for the entire folded sheet? Or is it each half's perimeter?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, you create a single folded sheet, not two separate parts. So each folded sheet (i.e., the folded version) has a perimeter. So when you fold along the length, you have a folded sheet of size L/2 and W, and its perimeter is 48. Similarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet is L and W/2, with perimeter 66.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you fold along the length, the folded sheet's dimensions would be L/2 and W. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the folded sheet's dimensions are L and W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nBut again, the options are all larger. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding, not each part. But that's what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial sheet's area is being asked. But 280 isn't an option. So maybe I have a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the entire sheet, not each half. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet into two equal parts along a side, the folded sheet would have the same dimensions as each half. So for example, if the sheet is folded along the length, each half is L/2 x W, and the folded sheet is L/2 x W. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that when you fold along the length, the sheet is folded into two parts, each of which is L/2 x W, but when you look at the entire folded sheet, it's the same as one of the halves. So the perimeter is for the entire folded sheet, which is one of the halves.\n\nSo the same equations as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folding along length, each part is (W/2) x L. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the sheet is a rectangle. When you fold it along the length, you're bringing the two ends together along the length. So the length becomes half, and the width remains the same.\n\nWait, maybe I should define which sides are being folded. Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose the original sheet has length L and width W.\n\nCase 1: Fold along the length. So you fold along the length, which means you bring the two ends of the length together. So the folded sheet would have a length of L/2 and the same width W. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nCase 2: Fold along the width. Folding along the width would mean bringing the two ends of the width together. So the folded sheet has length L and width W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So L=28, W=10.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But this isn't one of the options. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are for both parts combined. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because each part is separate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the perimeters when both parts are considered together. For example, when you fold along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48. But two parts would have a combined perimeter of 96. But that doesn't make sense because they're separate sheets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter is of the folded sheet when both parts are considered as a single sheet. No, that wouldn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I should think that when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter of the folded sheet (which is a single sheet) is 48. And when folded along the width, the perimeter is 66. So the same equations as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check my algebra.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nSolving:\n\nLet me use substitution.\n\nFrom equation1: L=48 -2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSo L=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states that when folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm for each part. So each part has 48 cm perimeter, but when folded along the other set, each part has 66 cm perimeter. So that would mean that each part's perimeter is 48 and 66.\n\nWait, but that would change the equations.\n\nWait, if each part when folded along one set has perimeter 48, and each part when folded along the other set has perimeter 66, then each part is a separate rectangle. So, in the first case, each part is (L/2) x W, and each has perimeter 48. So 2*(L/2 + W) =48 \u2192 L + 2W=48.\n\nIn the second case, each part is L x (W/2), and each has perimeter 66. So 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48, but when folded along the other set, the same sheet when folded has a perimeter of 66. So perhaps when folded along length, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, the perimeter is 66.\n\nWait, but that's what I've been thinking. So same equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the combined folded sheets. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the way I set up the equations. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assume that when the sheet is folded along the length, the resulting perimeter is 48. So the folded sheet has dimensions (L/2) and W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen the sheet is folded along the width, the resulting perimeter is 66. So the folded sheet has dimensions L and (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution: L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding, which includes both parts. No, that doesn't make sense. Because when you fold the sheet, the folded sheet is a single piece, not two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe when folded along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48, but when folded along the other set, the same sheet has a perimeter of 66. So perhaps the sheet is folded in two different ways, each time resulting in a perimeter for each part.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters of the two parts are considered. So for each fold, the sheet is split into two parts, each with a perimeter. So when folded along the length, each of the two parts has a perimeter of 48. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, but that would require that each part when folded along the length has a perimeter of 48, and each part when folded along the width has a perimeter of 66. So:\n\nCase1: Fold along length. Each part has dimensions (L/2) x W. Perimeter is 48.\n\nSo 2*(L/2 + W) =48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nCase2: Fold along width. Each part has dimensions L x (W/2). Perimeter is 66.\n\nSo 2*(L + W/2)=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution: L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nHmm. Not matching options.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for both parts together? No, that doesn't make sense. Each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when folded along the length, the two parts together form a sheet with a perimeter of 48. But that's not how folding works. Folding doesn't create a new sheet; it just brings parts together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded in half, and the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 when folded along one side, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So when folded along the length, the folded sheet's perimeter is 48. When folded along the width, the folded sheet's perimeter is 66.\n\nSo the equations would be:\n\nFolded along length: dimensions (L/2) x W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nFolded along width: dimensions L x (W/2) \u2192 perimeter 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nHmm. So same result. So I'm back to square one. So perhaps the problem is not with the equations but with the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reverse the equations. Suppose that when folding along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when folding along the width, it's 48.\n\nBut that would give a different solution. Let me try.\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =66\n\nEquation2: 2L + W =48\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(66-2W) + W =48 \u2192 132 -4W +W =48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 3W=84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66-2*28=66-56=10.\n\nSo L=10, W=28. Area is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Same as before.\n\nNo, that doesn't help either.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when folding along the length, the perimeter is 48 for each part, meaning that the entire sheet when folded has a perimeter of 48. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one set, the perimeter of each part is 48. So each part is a rectangle, and each has a perimeter of 48.\n\nBut that's what I've been doing. So maybe the problem is that when the sheet is folded along length, each part has perimeter 48, and when folded along width, each part has perimeter 66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nAll are much larger than 280. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 6 or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the combined sheet. Like, when folded along length, the combined perimeter is 48. So the folded sheet is L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded, but including both parts. No, that wouldn't make sense because the sheet is folded, so it's a single sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts together. For example, when you fold along the length, you have two parts each with perimeter 48, so combined they have a perimeter of 96. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the total perimeter of both parts together is 48. But that doesn't make sense because the two parts are separate.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nLet me denote the original dimensions as L and W.\n\nWhen folded along length, each part is (L/2) x W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation1: L +2W =48 \u2192 L =48-2W.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute L from equation1 into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96 -4W + W =66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nSo L=48-20=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280. Not in options.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the area of the folded sheet, but that doesn't make sense because the problem asks for the area of the original sheet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeters are for each part when folded along the other direction.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along length, each part has a perimeter of 48, but when the same sheet is folded along width, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, but that's what I've been considering.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the area of the folded sheet, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, but each part has the same perimeter as when folded along the other direction. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along one set, resulting in a single folded sheet with perimeter 48. Then, when folded along the other set, the same sheet is folded again, resulting in a perimeter of 66.\n\nBut that would change the equations.\n\nWait, let me model it that way.\n\nFirst fold along length: sheet becomes (L/2) x W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nThen, fold along width: the sheet becomes (L/2) x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W/2) = L + W = ?\n\nBut the problem states that when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66.\n\nWait, perhaps after first folding, you then fold the resulting sheet along the width, leading to a perimeter of 66.\n\nBut that's two folds, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along both directions, and the perimeters are given for each fold.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"when folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nHmm. Maybe the sheet is folded into two parts, and for each fold, each part has a perimeter. So when folded along length, each part has 48, and when folded along width, each part has 66. So same equations.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the equations differently. Let me denote x and y as the length and width of the original sheet.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has dimensions (x/2) and y. Perimeter: 2*(x/2 + y) = x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part has dimensions x and (y/2). Perimeter: 2*(x + y/2) =2x + y=66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nSo solving:\n\nx +2y =48 \u2192 x=48-2y.\n\n2x + y=66 \u2192 substitute x:\n\n2*(48-2y) + y =66 \u219296-4y +y=66 \u219296-3y=66 \u21923y=30 \u2192y=10.\n\nx=48-20=28.\n\nArea x*y=28*10=280.\n\nHmm. No option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for both parts together. For example, when folded along length, each part has perimeter 48, so together they have a perimeter of 96. But that doesn't make sense because they're two separate sheets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the combined sheet.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a single sheet of (x/2) by y. So the perimeter is 48. So x + 2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it becomes x by (y/2), perimeter 66 \u2192 2x + y=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. So I'm stuck. Maybe the problem is that the perimeters are for the sheet when it's folded twice.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along both directions, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply the perimeters. Let me think.\n\nWait, 48 and 66. Let me find L and W.\n\nFrom equations:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W=48 \u2192 L=48-2W.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute equation1 into equation2: 2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u219296-4W + W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10. L=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280. Not in options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, not each part. So when folded along length, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, the perimeter is 66.\n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier. So same equations.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded along each direction, but the folded sheet is the entire sheet, not each half.\n\nWait, but that's what I've been considering.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheets, which are each of the two halves. So when you fold along length, each half is (L/2) x W, and the perimeter is 48 for each. So two perimeters of 48 each? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for both parts together. So when folded along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48. But that would be 2*(L +2W)=48 \u2192 L +2W=24. But that's not matching with the earlier equation.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Let's try.\n\nWhen folded along length, the two parts have combined perimeter of 48. So each part has perimeter 48/2=24. No, that doesn't make sense because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combined perimeter of both parts is 48. So for each fold, the two parts' perimeters add up to 48.\n\nBut when you fold a sheet into two parts, the two parts are separate. So their perimeters are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold along the length, the sheet is split into two parts, each of which has perimeter 48. So each part is (L/2) x W, with perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Maybe the problem is that I'm using the correct approach but the options are wrong. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded, not each half.\n\nWait, the problem says \"when folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"each part\" refers to the two parts after folding. So each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one set, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48. When folded along the width, each part has perimeter 66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet after being folded, which is a single sheet. So when folded along length, the sheet's perimeter is 48. When folded along width, the perimeter is 66.\n\nSo:\n\nWhen folded along length, the sheet is (L/2) x W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along width, the sheet is L x (W/2) \u2192 perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations.\n\nSo same solution: L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nBut since 280 isn't an option, perhaps I have to reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when folded along the length, the perimeter is 48 for the two parts combined. So 2*(perimeter of each part) =48 \u2192 each part has perimeter 24.\n\nWait, that would change the equations.\n\nSo each part when folded along length has perimeter 24. So 2*(L/2 + W) =24 \u2192 L +2W=24.\n\nEach part when folded along width has perimeter 33 (since 66/2=33). So 2*(L + W/2)=33 \u21922L + W=33.\n\nSo equations:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=24\n\nEquation2:2L + W=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation1: L=24-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(24-2W) + W=33 \u219248-4W + W=33 \u219248-3W=33 \u21923W=15 \u2192W=5.\n\nThen L=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70. Still not matching the options.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along length, each part's perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, each part's perimeter is 66. So same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the sheet is folded into two parts, each with a perimeter of 48 and 66, but that's not possible because the sheet can't have two different perimeters at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along one set, resulting in two parts with perimeter 48 each, and when folded along the other set, each part has perimeter 66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try plugging the options into the equations.\n\nWait, the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nThese are all much larger than 280. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when it's folded into two parts. So when the sheet is folded along the length, the entire sheet (now folded) has a perimeter of 48. Similarly, when folded along the width, the entire sheet has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, but when you fold a sheet into two parts, the folded sheet's perimeter would be different based on how you fold.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the folded sheet. So when folded along length, the sheet becomes (L/2) x W, with perimeter 48.\n\nWhen folded along width, the sheet becomes L x (W/2), with perimeter 66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nSo same solution: L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nBut again, not matching options.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply L and W by 6 or something to get to the options. 280*6=1680, which is close to option A (1584) and D (1320). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet, not the folded parts.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because folding would change the dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the original sheet when it's folded into two parts, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when it's folded into two parts, meaning that the perimeters include both the folded parts.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Because when you fold, the sheet is a single piece, not two.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when it's folded into two parts, but that would require the perimeter to be calculated differently.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the two parts combined.\n\nSo when folded along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48. Similarly, when folded along the width, the combined perimeter is 66.\n\nBut that's not how perimeters work when the sheet is split.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the two parts are arranged side by side, making a larger perimeter. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the original sheet when it's folded into two parts, meaning that the sheet is folded, and the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 and 66, depending on how it's folded.\n\nWait, that's what I thought earlier.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is 280, but it's not among the options, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that when the sheet is folded into two parts along one side, the perimeter of each part is 48, and when folded along the other side, the perimeter of each part is 66.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem differently. Let me assume that when the sheet is folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66. So:\n\nWhen folded along length: each part is (L/2) x W. Perimeter: 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along width: each part is L x (W/2). Perimeter: 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but the closest option is E)1200, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me re-derive.\n\nWhen folded along length, each part is (L/2) x W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. L + 2W =48 \u2192 L=48-2W.\n\n2. 2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute L into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96-4W + W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10.\n\nL=48-20=28.\n\nSo area is 28 *10=280.\n\nBut no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when folded along the length, the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded, not each part.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet, meaning that the perimeter is calculated for the original sheet after being folded.\n\nWait, when folded along length, the sheet is (L/2) x W. So perimeter is L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along width, it's L x (W/2). Perimeter is 2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the perimeters are for the combined sheet. So when folded along the length, the combined sheet (both parts) has a perimeter of 48. But that's not how folding works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the entire original sheet. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts when combined. For example, when folded along the length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48. So each part is (L/2) x W. The combined perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) *2 \u2192 but that's not correct.\n\nWait, if the sheet is folded along the length, the two parts are each (L/2) x W. But when you put them together, the combined shape would be L x W, the original sheet. So the perimeter would be the original perimeter.\n\nHmm, that can't be.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think the correct answer based on the equations is 280, but since it's not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet when it's folded into two parts along one set, but not each part. So when folded along length, the sheet's perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, it's 66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeters are for the folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck and will have to go with the equations I have, but since the options don't match, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along one set, the perimeter is for the entire sheet, which is made up of two parts. So the perimeter is calculated as the outer edges.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along the length, the folded sheet's perimeter is 48. So the dimensions are (L/2) x W. Perimeter: 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the perimeters are for each half, but including the folded edge.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet into two parts, each part has a perimeter that includes the folded edge. So the perimeter would be the sum of the outer edges plus the folded edge.\n\nWait, this is a new approach. Let me think.\n\nWhen you fold a sheet into two parts along the length, each part has dimensions (L/2) x W. The perimeter of each part includes the folded edge, which is an internal edge, not part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, no. Because when you fold, the folded edge becomes an internal edge, not part of the perimeter. So each part's perimeter is still 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48.\n\nHmm. I think this approach isn't changing anything.\n\nI'm really stuck here. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but since it's not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that when folded along length, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along width, the perimeter is 66. So:\n\nFolded along length: (L/2) x W \u2192 perimeter = 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nFolded along width: L x (W/2) \u2192 perimeter = 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nSo solving:\n\nFrom equation1: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u219296 -4W + W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nL=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280.\n\nHmm. Not in options. So perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the sheet when folded into four parts, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply the perimeters.\n\nWait, 48*66=3168. Not in options.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to go with the answer I have, even though it's not in the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along the width, the perimeter is 66. So the original sheet's perimeter is something else.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded, not the folded parts. So the original sheet's perimeter when folded along length is 48, and when folded along width is 66.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the original sheet's perimeter is fixed.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is designed incorrectly or I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the perimeters are for the two parts combined. So when folded along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48. So each part has a perimeter of 24.\n\nSo:\n\nWhen folded along length, each part is (L/2) x W \u2192 perimeter 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=24.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is L x (W/2) \u2192 perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=33.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. L +2W=24.\n\n2. 2L + W=33.\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation1: L=24-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(24-2W) + W=33 \u219248-4W +W=33 \u219248-3W=33 \u21923W=15 \u2192 W=5.\n\nL=24-10=14.\n\nArea=14*5=70. Still not in options.\n\nHmm. I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't get any of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but based on the equations, the area is 280.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by denoting the length and width of the original rectangular sheet as \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. The sheet is folded into two equal halves in two different ways, and the perimeters of the resulting folded sheets are given as 48 cm and 66 cm.\n\n### Case 1: Folding along the length\nWhen the sheet is folded along the length, the dimensions of the folded sheet become \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\). The perimeter of this folded sheet is given as 48 cm. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\nFor the folded sheet along the length:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 48\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nL + 2W = 48 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Folding along the width\nWhen the sheet is folded along the width, the dimensions of the folded sheet become \\( L \\times \\frac{W}{2} \\). The perimeter of this folded sheet is given as 66 cm. Using the perimeter formula:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 66\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n2L + W = 66 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n### Solving the system of equations\nWe now solve the two equations simultaneously.\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\\[\nL = 48 - 2W\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) into Equation (2):\n\\[\n2(48 - 2W) + W = 66\n\\]\n\\[\n96 - 4W + W = 66\n\\]\n\\[\n96 - 3W = 66\n\\]\n\\[\n3W = 30\n\\]\n\\[\nW = 10\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( W = 10 \\) back into \\( L = 48 - 2W \\):\n\\[\nL = 48 - 2(10) = 48 - 20 = 28\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the area of the original sheet\nThe area of the original rectangular sheet is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated area of the original sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, none of the provided options match this value. Despite extensive re-evaluation of the problem setup and equations, the result remains consistent. It is possible that the problem or options may contain an error.\n\n**Answer: None of the provided options are correct based on the given problem setup.**",
