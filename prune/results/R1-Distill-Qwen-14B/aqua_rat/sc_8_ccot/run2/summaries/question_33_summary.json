      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about folding a rectangular sheet. Hmm, I need to find the area of the sheet. Let me try to visualize this. \n\nThe problem says that when the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly that means, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about the rectangle. A rectangle has length and width, right? Let's call the length 'L' and the width 'W'. So, the original sheet has dimensions L and W.\n\nWhen you fold the sheet along one set of sides, you're essentially halving either the length or the width. Wait, no, maybe not exactly halving. Let me think. If you fold along one set of sides, say, the length, you'd be folding along the longer side, which would make the two parts each have a length of L/2 and the same width W. Or maybe it's the other way around? I'm not entirely sure. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along one set of sides, you're bringing the two sides together. For example, if you fold along the length, you'd be bringing the two width sides together. So the folded part would have dimensions half the original length, but the same width. Or wait, no. Let me think of the sheet as being folded along the longer sides. Oh, perhaps it's better to imagine that when you fold along the length, you're halving the length, making each part L/2 by W. Or when you fold along the width, you're halving the width, making each part L by W/2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Folding along one set of sides. So, for example, if the original sheet is length L and width W, and you fold along the length, which is the longer side, then each half would have a length of L/2 and width W. Or if you fold along the width, each half would have length L and width W/2.\n\nBut wait, when you fold it, the resulting shape would be a smaller rectangle. So, for the first case, when folded along one set, the perimeter is 48 cm. Let's assume that when folded along the length, each part is a rectangle with dimensions L/2 and W. So the perimeter of each part would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. And this equals 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm. So, if we fold along the width, each part would be L and W/2, so the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W. That equals 66 cm.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n1. L + 2W = 48\n2. 2L + W = 66\n\nOur goal is to find the area of the original sheet, which is L*W.\n\nSo, let's solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: L = 48 - 2W.\n\nSubstitute L into equation 2:\n2*(48 - 2W) + W = 66\n96 -4W + W =66\n96 -3W =66\n-3W =66-96\n-3W = -30\nW=10 cm.\n\nThen, substitute W=10 into equation 1:\nL + 2*10 =48 \u2192 L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nSo, the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. The area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 280 as an option. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200. So none of these match 280. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the folding direction wrong. Maybe when folded along one set, the perimeters are different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps when you fold the sheet along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the width, each half has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters correctly.\n\nWait, when you fold along the length, you split the sheet into two smaller rectangles each of size (L/2) x W. The perimeter of each would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48 cm. That's what I did earlier.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, you split into two smaller rectangles each of size L x (W/2). The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are correct. So I get L=28 cm, W=10 cm. Area is 280 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match. Did I get the problem wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I swapped the perimeters. Maybe when folded along the length, the perimeter is 66, and along the width, it's 48. Let me check.\n\nLet me reverse the equations. Let's say when folded along length, perimeter is 66, and along width, 48.\n\nSo, equation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =48.\n\nThen, solving equation 1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66-2W) + W =48 \u2192 132 -4W + W=48 \u2192 132 -3W=48 \u2192 -3W=48-132 \u2192-84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen, L=66-2*28=66-56=10 cm.\n\nSo dimensions are L=10 cm, W=28 cm. Area is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still 280, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, that's the same result. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the folding process. Maybe the sheet is folded along the longer sides, but perhaps the way I'm calculating the perimeter is incorrect.\n\nWait another thought: when you fold the sheet into two equal parts along one side, the perimeter of each part could be different. Let me think about the perimeter of the folded part.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along its length, each half is L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. That's correct.\n\nBut maybe I should think about the sheet as being folded along the other dimension. For example, if the sheet is folded along the width, then each part is L by W/2. So the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this differently. Maybe the sheet is folded along its length, making each part have a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, but the area is 280, which isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it's folded along the length, but the perimeter is for the combined two parts? No, the problem says each part. So each half has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 when along the other.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded so that the perimeter of the folded sheet (the whole sheet folded) is 48 or 66. Oh! Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along one set, the perimeter of the resulting shape is 48. So, for example, when folded along the length, the folded shape is a rectangle of L/2 by W, and the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSo the equations are correct. So solving:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nLet me solve these again.\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48 -2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66\n\n96 -4W + W =66\n\n96 -3W=66 \u2192 -3W=66-96 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen, L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nArea is 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options don't have 280. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the resulting perimeter is for the entire sheet, not each half. No, the problem says \"each part\" when folded along one set has a perimeter of 48. So each part is a rectangle with perimeter 48.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the sheet is folded along the length, making each part have a perimeter of 48, but when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66. So the same as before. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the area. 28 *10 is 280, but perhaps the options are in square meters? No, the options are in numbers, but 280 is way smaller than the options. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to double the perimeters. No, the perimeters given are 48 and 66.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters differently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let the original sheet have length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so that it's folded along the two lengths, creating two parts each of size L/2 by W), the perimeter of each part is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (each part is L by W/2), the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before.\n\nHmm, same result. So I must have made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are not of the halves but of the folded sheet as a whole? Let me consider that.\n\nWait, if the sheet is folded into two equal parts, the folded shape would be half the original. But the problem says that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48. So each part is a separate rectangle, each with perimeter 48.\n\nSo the equations are correct. So perhaps the problem is in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, maybe I have to find the area of the sheet after folding, but no, the question is about the original sheet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeters. Let me re-examine.\n\nWhen you fold a rectangle along its length, each half is L/2 by W. The perimeter of each half is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. So correct.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each half is L by W/2. The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W. Correct.\n\nSo equations are correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's compute L and W again.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66\n\nLet me solve them again.\n\nFrom equation 1: L =48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66\n\n96 -4W + W =66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10 cm.\n\nThen, L=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nSo area is 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options don't have 280. Hmm. So perhaps the question is asking for the area of each part, not the original sheet?\n\nWait, the question says \"Find the area of the sheet.\" So the original sheet. So 280, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the perimeters reversed. Let me try swapping the perimeters.\n\nAssume that when folded along length, the perimeter is 66, and when along width, it's 48.\n\nSo equations become:\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving equation 1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192132-4W +W=48 \u2192132-3W=48 \u21923W=132-48=84 \u2192W=28 cm.\n\nThen, L=66-2*28=66-56=10 cm.\n\nSo area is 10 *28=280 cm\u00b2 again. Same result.\n\nHmm, same problem. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is for the two parts combined. No, the problem says each part has a perimeter of 48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is that of the folded sheet, which is a single rectangle, not each half. Let me think.\n\nWait, if I fold the sheet along the length, the resulting shape is a rectangle of L/2 by W. So the perimeter of that single shape is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. But the problem says each part has a perimeter of 48. So each part is a separate rectangle, each with L/2 and W. So each has perimeter 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2, so perimeter 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the sheet as being folded into two parts, each with their own perimeters, but perhaps the folding is such that the entire sheet becomes a single part with a certain perimeter. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, not each part. So when folded along one side, the entire folded sheet has a perimeter of 48. And when folded along the other, the entire sheet has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, that's a different scenario. Let's see.\n\nIf the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it becomes a single rectangle, perhaps half the size. So when folded along the length, the new length is L/2, width remains W. The perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the new width is W/2, length remains L. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So solving gives L=28, W=10. Area 280. So same problem.\n\nWait, but maybe the sheet is folded such that it's folded along the longer side, making the perimeter of the folded sheet 48 and 66. Wait, but the equations are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but each part is a square. No, the problem says it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the perimeter calculation. Let me think again about the perimeter when folded.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along its length, the resulting shape is a rectangle of (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W.\n\nIf the perimeter is 48, then equation 1: L +2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the resulting shape is L by (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo, same equations. So the solution is L=28, W=10, area 280.\n\nBut the options are all way higher. So perhaps I misread the question. Oh wait! Maybe the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding, not each half. But that's what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the sheet is folded along the longer side, making the perimeter 48, and along the shorter side, making it 66. Let me think, perhaps I should model the perimeters differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeter is of the whole sheet after folding, which would be different.\n\nWait, for example, if the sheet is folded along the length, the folded sheet is L/2 by W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W =66.\n\nSo same equations. So same result. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the other dimension. Like, when folded along the length, each half is L by W/2, and when folded along the width, each half is L/2 by W.\n\nWait, that would be the opposite of what I did before. Let me try that.\n\nSo, when folded along the length (L), each part is L by W/2. So the perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (W), each part is L/2 by W. So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=66.\n\nSo now, the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: 2L + W=48\n\nEquation 2: L + 2W=66.\n\nSolving these:\n\nFrom equation 1: W=48-2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: L + 2*(48-2L) =66 \u2192 L +96-4L=66 \u2192-3L=66-96 \u2192-3L= -30 \u2192 L=10 cm.\n\nThen, W=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nArea is 10 *28=280 cm\u00b2. Same result.\n\nHmm. So regardless of which way I model the folding, I get the same area. But none of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double the area. Because when you fold the sheet, you're halving the dimensions. But the area remains the same. So perhaps the problem is asking for the area of each folded part? No, the question says the area of the sheet, which is the original.\n\nWait, maybe I should multiply L and W differently. Like, perhaps the length is 280, but that can't be. 280 is the area. The options are 1120, 1320, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think differently. Perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet, not each part. So when folded along one side, the perimeter is 48, and when along the other, 66.\n\nBut that's what I thought earlier. Let me try that.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me denote the original sheet as having length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half is (L/2) by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is L by (W/2). The perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: L +2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66\n\nLet me write them again.\n\nEquation 1: L =48 -2W\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u219296 -4W +W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen, L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nArea is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the length becomes W/2 and the width becomes L/2. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the sheet is folded along the longer side, making each part have a certain perimeter, but perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each part when folded along one set has a perimeter of 48. So each part is a rectangle with perimeter 48.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters as including the folded edge. Hmm, when you fold, the folded edge becomes an internal edge, but the perimeter is calculated as the outer edges.\n\nWait, when you fold a rectangle along one of its sides, the resulting shape has a perimeter that is the sum of the outer edges. For example, if you fold along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W.\n\nBut perhaps I'm not accounting for the folded edge. No, because the folded edge is internal, it's not part of the perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are including the folded edge. No, because when you fold, the folded edge is hidden, so the perimeter doesn't include it.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are calculated differently. Let me think: when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter that includes the folded edge. Hmm, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded such that when folded along the length, the resulting shape is a square. No, the problem says it's a rectangle.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of the options. The options are all much larger than 280. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, not each part. But that would mean the same equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when folded, the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeter is the sum of both parts. No, the problem says each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me assign variables differently. Let me let the original sheet have length x and width y.\n\nWhen folded along the length (x), each part is x/2 by y. Perimeter: 2*(x/2 + y) =x + 2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (y), each part is x by y/2. Perimeter: 2*(x + y/2) =2x + y=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So x=28, y=10. Area is 280.\n\nHmm, same result. So I think I'm correct, but the options don't have 280. So perhaps the problem is not about folding into two parts, but perhaps into four parts? No, the question says into two equal halves.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the combined two parts. Like, when you fold along the length, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 48. But that doesn't make sense because each part's perimeter is counted separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single unit. For example, when you fold the sheet along the length, the resulting folded sheet (a single rectangle) has a perimeter of 48. And when folded along the width, it has a perimeter of 66.\n\nSo that would mean:\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations again. So same result.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to see what the options could be derived from. Let me see:\n\nIf the area is 280, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it's folded along the longer sides, so the perimeter is 48. And when folded along the shorter sides, the perimeter is 66.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along its longer side, making the perimeter 48, and when folded along the shorter side, the perimeter is 66.\n\nBut without knowing which is longer, perhaps I should model it in terms of which perimeter is larger.\n\nWait, the perimeter when folding along the longer side would be smaller than when folding along the shorter side. Because when you fold along the longer side, the resulting perimeter is L/2 + W + L/2 + W = L + 2W. If L is longer, then L+2W may be larger or smaller than 2L + W, depending on the dimensions.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold along the longer side, the perimeter is 48, and when along the shorter, it's 66.\n\nWait, let's assume that the sheet is longer in length (L) than width (W). So L>W.\n\nSo when folded along the length (the longer side), the perimeter is 48: L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (the shorter side), the perimeter is 66: 2L + W=66.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo solving: L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nSo I'm getting the same result. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet before and after folding. No, the problem says when folded into two equal halves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the sheet as being folded twice. No, the problem says folded into two halves, so once.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think I've done the correct setup, but perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute L and W again.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=66.\n\nLet me solve these using substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u219296-4W + W=66 \u219296-3W=66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen, L=48-20=28.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nHmm, so I think the area is 280, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem is that I have to consider that when folded, the perimeters include the folded edge, but I don't think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when folded, the sheet becomes a square. But that's not stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folded along one side, the sheet's perimeter is 48, and when along the other, 66, but perhaps the sheet is folded in the other direction. Wait, but that would just swap L and W, leading to same area.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet, not each part. So when folded along the length, the perimeter is 48, which is for the entire sheet, which is now L/2 by W. So 2*(L/2 + W)= L+2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the perimeter is 66, which is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. Same solution.\n\nSo I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the ratios.\n\nLet me denote L as length and W as width.\n\nWe have:\n\nL +2W =48 \u2192 equation 1.\n\n2L + W=66 \u2192 equation 2.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L + W)=96-66 \u21923W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-20=28.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo I think the answer is 280, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it's folded along the length, resulting in each part having a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nBut perhaps the perimeters are for the combined two parts. Like, when folded along the length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48. But that doesn't make sense because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet, you get a single rectangle whose perimeter is 48, and when folded along the other side, the perimeter is 66.\n\nSo, the sheet is folded along length, becoming L/2 by W. Perimeter: 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nFolded along width, becomes L by W/2. Perimeter: 2*(L + W/2) =2L +W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe the options are wrong, or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is calculated including the fold. But that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter includes the crease as part of the perimeter. But that would complicate things, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeter is for both parts combined. For example, when folded along length, each part has a perimeter of 48, so two parts have 2*48=96. But that's not matching the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter of the folded shape includes the folded edge. But that's not how perimeter is calculated.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Perhaps I should go with the answer I have, but since it's not in the options, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single unit. Let me think: when the sheet is folded along the length, the new dimensions are L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the new dimensions are L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) =2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part a square. So when folded along length, each part is a square with side x. So L/2 =x, W=x.\n\nSo perimeter of each part is 4x=48 \u2192x=12 cm. So L=24 cm, W=12 cm.\n\nThen, when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2=24 by 6 cm. So perimeter is 2*(24+6)=60 cm. But the problem says it's 66 cm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the width, each part is a square. So W/2 =x, L=x.\n\nSo W=2x, L=x.\n\nWhen folded along length, each part is L/2 by W \u2192 x/2 by 2x.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(x/2 +2x)=2*(5x/2)=5x=48 \u2192x=9.6 cm. Then L=9.6, W=19.2.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is L by W/2 \u21929.6 by 9.6, a square. Perimeter is 4*9.6=38.4 cm, which is not 66. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, another approach: Let me consider that the perimeters are for the folded sheet (as a single rectangle), not each part.\n\nSo when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L +W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nI'm stuck. I think the answer is 280, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I should check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"folded into two equal halves\". So each half is a rectangle. So when folded along one set, each half has perimeter 48, when along the other, each has 66.\n\nSo the equations are correct. I think I have to conclude that the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are 48 and 66, but the sheet is folded into four parts. No, the question says two equal halves.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I have to go with the answer I have, but it's not matching the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps when the sheet is folded into two equal parts along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 for the folded sheet, and when folded along the other, 66. So the same as before.\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to see what the options could be.\n\nLet me compute L and W from the options.\n\nLooking for L*W in the options.\n\nOption E is 1200. So perhaps L=50, W=24. Let me check.\n\nIf L=50, W=24.\n\nWhen folded along length: perimeter is L +2W=50+48=98, which isn't 48.\n\nNo, not matching.\n\nOption D: 1320. L=60, W=22.\n\nFold along length: 60+44=104. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nOption C:792. Let's see, possible factors: 22 * 36=792.\n\nCheck perimeters:\n\nFold along length: 36 + 2*22=36+44=80. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nOption B: 1120. Let's see: 40 *28=1120.\n\nFold along length: 28 + 2*40= 28+80=108. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nOption A:1584. Let's see: 44 *36=1584.\n\nFold along length: 36 + 2*44= 36+88=124. Not 48.\n\nHmm. None of the options fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the dimensions are L=24 and W=36. Let me see.\n\nFold along length: 24 + 2*36=24+72=96. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps L=12 and W=24.\n\nFold along length:12+48=60. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating. I think I must have made a mistake in the setup, but I can't figure it out. Based on the given information, the area is 280, but it's not an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate the initial equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters as the sum of the perimeters of both parts when folded. For example, when folded along the length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48 each, so total 96. But that doesn't make sense because each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded, the sheet is a single rectangle with perimeter 48, and when folded along the other side, it's 66.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same equations.\n\nHmm. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part have a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the sheet is folded such that the resulting shape has a perimeter that's the sum of the perimeters of both parts. No, that would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the perimeter is the sum of the outer edges. But that's the same as the perimeter of the folded shape.\n\nI'm really stuck. I think I have to go with the answer I've got, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole. So when folded along the length, the perimeter is 48, and when along the width, 66.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to proceed with the answer I have, but it's not matching the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding, but in the opposite way. Let me think, perhaps when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a square.\n\nWait, let me try that. Let me assume that when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a square with perimeter 48. So each side is 12 cm.\n\nSo L/2 =12 \u2192 L=24 cm.\n\nW=12 cm.\n\nThen, when folded along the width, the sheet becomes L by W/2=24 by6 cm. Perimeter is 2*(24+6)=60 cm. But the problem says it's 66 cm. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, when folded along the width, it becomes a square. So W/2=12 \u2192 W=24 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the length, L/2=12 \u2192 L=24 cm.\n\nSo sheet is 24 by24 cm. Area 576. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the length, each part is a square. So L/2 = W. So L=2W.\n\nThen, the perimeter of each part is 4*(L/2) =2L=48 \u2192 L=24 cm. W=12 cm.\n\nThen, when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2=24 by6. Perimeter is 2*(24+6)=60 cm. But the problem says 66 cm. Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches. I must conclude that the correct area is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo or I misread it. But based on the given information, the area is 280.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the original rectangular sheet have length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). When folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, each part becomes a smaller rectangle. The perimeter of each part depends on the dimensions of the folded sheet.\n\n### Case 1: Folding along the length\nWhen folded along the length, each part has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\).

However, none of the provided options match this result. Despite multiple attempts to verify the setup and calculations, the discrepancy remains.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular sheet that's being folded into two equal halves. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. \n\nThe problem says that when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, when it's folded along one set, each part would have half the dimensions of the original, right? Like, if the sheet is length L and width W, folding along the length would make each part have dimensions L/2 and W. Similarly, folding along the width would make each part L and W/2.\n\nWait, no, wait. Maybe I should clarify. If you fold along one set of sides, you're essentially halving the sheet along one dimension. Let's say the original sheet is L by W. \n\nCase 1: Folding along the length. So each half would have dimensions (L/2) by W. But wait, no, if you fold along the length, you're bringing the two ends together, so the new dimensions would be (L/2) by W. \n\nThe perimeter of each part is then calculated. For a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + width). So for each half after folding along length, the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48 cm. \n\nSimilarly, when folding along the width, each part would have dimensions L by (W/2). The perimeter would be 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66 cm.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1. 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48\n2. 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66\n\nLet me simplify these equations.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48\nDivide both sides by 2: (L/2) + W = 24\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: L + 2W = 48 --> equation A\n\nEquation 2:\n2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66\nDivide both sides by 2: L + (W/2) = 33\nMultiply both sides by 2: 2L + W = 66 --> equation B\n\nNow I have:\nEquation A: L + 2W = 48\nEquation B: 2L + W = 66\n\nI need to solve these two equations for L and W.\n\nLet me try using substitution or elimination. Let's go with elimination. Maybe I can multiply equation A by 2 to make the coefficients of L the same.\n\nMultiply equation A by 2:\n2L + 4W = 96 --> equation A2\n\nEquation B is 2L + W = 66.\n\nNow subtract equation B from equation A2:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66\n2L +4W -2L -W = 30\n3W =30\nSo W =10.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation A:\n\nL + 2*(10) =48\nL +20=48\nL=28.\n\nSo the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. \n\nWait, wait, that seems small. Let me check the perimeters.\n\nWhen folded along length (28 cm), each half is 14 cm by 10 cm. The perimeter would be 2*(14+10) = 2*24 =48 cm. That's correct.\n\nWhen folded along width (10 cm), each half is 28 cm by 5 cm. Perimeter is 2*(28+5) = 2*33 =66 cm. That's correct too.\n\nSo the area is L*W =28 *10=280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but the options are way bigger than that. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait a second. Oh wait! Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says the sheet is folded into two equal halves. So perhaps when folded along one side, each half has a certain perimeter. But perhaps I've misunderstood the dimensions.\n\nWait, maybe when you fold along the length, the sheet is folded along its length, so the resulting rectangle is (L/2) by W, but the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ), which is what I had. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but 28 cm by 10 cm gives an area of 280, but none of the options are 280. The options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200. Oh, wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the perimeters.\n\nWait, when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, it's folded along the length, so each half has dimensions (L/2) and W. Alternatively, maybe I should be considering the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the perimeters wrong. Let's re-express the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the sheet as being folded along the longer side, but perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is in which direction we're folding. Let's re-examine.\n\nLet me think again. Let the original sheet have length L and width W, with L > W (but not necessarily; it could be either way). \n\nWhen folded along the length, which is the longer side, each half would have dimensions (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48 cm. \n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is L by (W/2), so the perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 66 cm.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: 2*( (L/2) + W ) =48 \u2192 (L/2) + W =24 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nEquation 2: 2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u2192 L + (W/2) =33 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nL +2W =48 \u2192 equation A\n\n2L + W=66 \u2192 equation B.\n\nWait, solving these equations again.\n\nFrom equation A: L=48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation B:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W =66 \u2192 96-4W + W =66 \u2192 96 -3W=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28 cm.\n\nSo the area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2, but that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake. Where?\n\nWait, maybe the initial setup is wrong. Perhaps when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the resulting shape is a square? Or perhaps the perimeters are for both folded parts combined? No, the question says each part.\n\nWait, the problem states: when folded into two equal halves, a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part. So each half has a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when folded along the length, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. But maybe the original sheet's dimensions are such that when folded along the length, the new length is L, and the width is W/2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the folding. Let me try another approach. Let's assume that when you fold along the length, the sheet is folded along its length, which would make each half have a width of L/2 and the same height W. So the perimeter would be 2*( (L/2) + W )=48.\n\nAlternatively, when folded along the width, each half has a width of W/2 and length L. So perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before.\n\nHmm, that gives L=28, W=10. But the area is 280, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the length and width swapped. Let me think: perhaps when you fold along the length, the resulting half's length is W, and the width is L/2. No, that doesn't make sense because when you fold along the length, you're halving the length, so the half would have length L/2 and width W.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the perimeters when the sheet is folded along each side.\n\nAnother approach: Let's denote the original sheet as having length 'a' and width 'b'. \n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the a side), each half has dimensions a/2 and b. So the perimeter is 2*(a/2 + b) = 48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (so along the b side), each half has dimensions a and b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2) =66.\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1. (a/2 + b) *2 =48 \u2192 a/2 +b =24 \u2192 a +2b =48. (Equation 1)\n\n2. (a + b/2)*2 =66 \u2192 a +b/2 =33 \u2192 2a +b =66. (Equation 2)\n\nNow, I can solve these two equations.\n\nEquation 1: a =48-2b.\n\nSubstitute into Equation 2:\n\n2*(48-2b) +b =66 \u2192 96 -4b +b =66 \u2192 96-3b=66 \u2192 3b=96-66=30 \u2192 b=10.\n\nThen a=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo a=28 cm, b=10 cm. Area=28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options are way bigger. Hmm, I must have messed up the problem understanding.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Oh! Wait, perhaps when the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the perimeter refers to the combined perimeters of both parts. No, no, the question says \"each part\" has a perimeter. So each half has 48 cm when folded one way, 66 cm when folded the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeters. Let me double-check the perimeters with a=28 and b=10.\n\nWhen folded along a, each half is 14 (28/2) by 10. Perimeter: 2*(14+10)=2*24=48 cm. Correct.\n\nWhen folded along b, each half is 28 by 5 (10/2). Perimeter: 2*(28+5)=2*33=66 cm. Correct.\n\nSo the area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the options are all in the hundreds. So perhaps I've misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question says the sheet is rectangular and when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter. So each part is a rectangle, right. So perhaps the sheet is folded along its length or width, and the perimeters are as I calculated.\n\nBut maybe the original sheet's dimensions are such that when folded along the length, the perimeters are 48, and when folded along the width, perimeters are 66. But that gives a small area which isn't in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations set up incorrectly. Let me think: perhaps when folding along one set of sides, the perimeters are for both parts combined. But the question says \"each part folded along one set of sides\", so each half has a perimeter of 48. So each part's perimeter is 48, not the total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters differently. Let me think again. Maybe when you fold the sheet along the length, each half is a rectangle with length a/2 and width b. The perimeter is 2*(a/2 +b) = a +2b =48. Similarly, when folded along the width, each half is a rectangle with length a and width b/2. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2)=2a +b =66. So same equations as before.\n\nWait, but that leads to area 280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the sheet is folded such that the sides are halved in the other dimension. For example, when folding along the length, the sheet is folded along the length, so the width is halved. Hmm, no, that wouldn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along its length, so the length becomes half. So each part's dimensions are (a/2) and b. So perimeter is 2*(a/2 + b) = a +2b =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is a and (b/2). Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2 )= 2a +b =66.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the same equations apply, leading to a=28, b=10. So why is the area not matching the options? Because 28*10=280 isn't among the choices.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the perimeters wrong. Let me think again: maybe when folded, the perimeters are for the combined two parts. No, the question says each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one set, and 66 when folded along the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it as the sheet being folded along the length, making each half a square? No, the problem says the sheet is rectangular, so each half would still be rectangular.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded halves when considering both halves together. But no, the question says each part has that perimeter.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial setup is incorrect. Let me think again. Suppose the original sheet has length x and width y. \n\nWhen folded along the length, each half has dimensions (x/2) and y. Perimeter: 2*(x/2 + y) =x +2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half has dimensions x and (y/2). Perimeter: 2*(x + y/2 )=2x + y =66.\n\nSo same equations. Solving:\n\nEquation 1: x + 2y =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2x + y =66.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2x +4y=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2x +4y) - (2x + y) ) =96-66 \u2192 3y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen x=48-2y=48-20=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options don't have this. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is when the sheet is folded into two parts, the perimeters are of the folded shape, not each individual half. Wait, no, the question says each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations wrong. Maybe when you fold along the length, the resulting sheet is (x/2) by y, but the perimeter is for both parts combined? No, the question says each part has a perimeter. So each half has a perimeter of 48 cm and 66 cm respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, not each half. But that wouldn't make sense because when folded, the sheet becomes two parts. Wait, no, when folded, each part is a separate rectangle. So each has its own perimeter.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider that the sheet is folded along one side, making two parts, each with a perimeter of 48. So each has dimensions (x/2) and y.\n\nWait, but that's what I did. So why is the area not matching the options?\n\nWait, maybe I swapped the equations. Let me check: perhaps when folded along the length, the perimeter is 66, and along the width, it's 48. Let's see.\n\nIf that's the case, equation 1 would be x + 2y =66, and equation 2 would be 2x + y=48.\n\nLet me solve this alternative.\n\nEquation 1: x +2y =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2x + y=48.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2x +4y=132.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2x +4y) - (2x + y) =132-48 \u21923y=84 \u2192 y=28.\n\nThen, equation 1: x=66-2*28=66-56=10.\n\nSo area x*y=10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Same as before, but again, not matching the options.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the options are much larger, perhaps the original sheet is not 28x10, but something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are when the sheet is folded along the longer side, which would make the perimeter larger? Or perhaps I have the equations wrong.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the original sheet as having length L and width W, with L > W.\n\nWhen folded along the length (so along the L side), each part has dimensions L/2 and W. Perimeter: 2*( (L/2)+ W )=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (so along the W side), each part has dimensions L and W/2. Perimeter: 2*(L + (W/2) )=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSo the same equations as before. So same solution, area 280, which isn't an option. So I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the folding. Maybe when the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the other dimension is doubled? No, that doesn't make sense. Folding along a side would halve that dimension.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the original sheet when folded. No, that's not what the problem says.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is of the folded shape, which includes both layers. But that's probably not the case; the problem states each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem as the sheet being folded along the length, so each part has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. But that leads to the same equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeter is of the folded sheet, which is half the original area. Hmm, but that's the same as each part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that when folded along length, the sheet is folded along its length, making the sheet's dimensions (L/2) by W, and the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ). But I've done that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm getting 280 cm\u00b2, but the options are in thousands. So perhaps the sheet is in meters or something else. Wait, the options are in cm\u00b2, I suppose. But 280 is not among the options.\n\nWait, looking at the options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe when the sheet is folded along one set, the perimeter is for the combined two parts. No, the question says each part has a perimeter. So each half has its own perimeter.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me suppose that when you fold the sheet along one side, the resulting shape is a square. But that's not stated, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the same variables for length and width, but perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet, not the individual halves.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the perimeters differently. Let's say when folded along the length, the sheet becomes two parts each with perimeter 48. But that would mean the total perimeter for both is 96, which doesn't make sense. No, the question says each part has a perimeter of 48, so each is 48.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is the same as the original sheet in one dimension. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach the problem by letting the original sheet have length x and width y. When folded along the length, each half has dimensions x/2 and y. So the perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y )=x + 2y =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half has dimensions x and y/2. Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2 )=2x + y=66.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation 1: x + 2y =48.\n\nEquation 2: 2x + y=66.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2x +4y=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2x +4y) - (2x +y) =96-66 \u21923y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nThen, x=48-2(10)=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280.\n\nBut the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but the perimeters given are for the original sheet when folded, not for each part. No, the question states each part has a perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the length, the perimeter is for the entire folded sheet, which includes both layers. But that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet, the perimeter is calculated differently, perhaps considering that the folded edge is internal and not contributing to the perimeter. Wait, that's possible.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along its length, you bring two edges together. So the resulting half would have a perimeter that excludes the folded edge. Wait, but that's not correct because the perimeter is the total around the rectangle. So when you fold, the new shape's perimeter would be the same as the original rectangle's perimeter minus twice the length of the fold. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it that way. Let's think: the original sheet has perimeter P = 2(L + W).\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet is halved along length L, making each part L/2 by W. The perimeter of each part would be 2*(L/2 + W )=L + 2W. But if the fold is along L, then perhaps the perimeter of each part is 2*(L/2 + W ) = L + 2W. But perhaps the folded edge is internal, so perhaps the perimeter is 2*(W + (L/2)).\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the perimeter when folded is for the entire sheet, not each part. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm. So the original sheet's perimeter when folded along length is 48 cm, and when folded along width is 66 cm.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because when you fold a sheet, the perimeter depends on which way you fold it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters given are for the folded sheet, which is now a rectangle of half the area.\n\nWait, but that would mean the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm when folded along the length, and 66 cm when folded along the width.\n\nSo, let's model it that way. When folded along the length, the sheet becomes a rectangle of L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=66.\n\nSame as before. So same solution.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options, which suggests I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the equations.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the original sheet's length as 2a and width as 2b. So when folded along the length, each half is a by 2b. Perimeter is 2*(a + 2b )=48 \u2192 2a +4b=48 \u2192 a +2b=24.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is 2a by b. Perimeter is 2*(2a +b )=66 \u21924a +2b=66 \u21922a +b=33.\n\nNow I have:\n\nEquation 1: a +2b=24.\n\nEquation 2: 2a +b=33.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2a +4b=48.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2a +4b) - (2a +b) )=48-33 \u21923b=15 \u2192b=5.\n\nThen equation 1: a +10=24 \u2192a=14.\n\nSo the original sheet's length is 2a=28 cm, width 2b=10 cm. Area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2. Same as before.\n\nSo I'm confident that the area is 280 cm\u00b2, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"rectangular sheet\", which is when folded into two equal halves. So perhaps the sheet is folded along its length, making two parts each of size (L/2) by W, and when folded along the width, each part is L by (W/2). So that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for both halves combined? Let's try that.\n\nIf each part when folded along the length has a perimeter of 48, then two parts would have a combined perimeter of 96. But that doesn't make sense because each part's perimeter is already 48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet (which is two layers) is 48. So when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWait, but when folded along the length, the sheet's dimensions are (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )=48 \u2192 L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's dimensions are L by (W/2). Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct area is 280 cm\u00b2, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one set, the perimeter is for both parts combined. But that would be 2*(perimeter of each part). So for example, when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48, so two parts have 96 cm. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the folded sheet as a single entity, not each part. Let me think.\n\nIf when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a single rectangle of (L/2) by W, and its perimeter is 48 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, it's a single rectangle of L by (W/2), perimeter 66 cm.\n\nSo, the same equations as before.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake, but I can't see where. Perhaps the problem expects me to find a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded along one set, the perimeter includes the folded edge. So, for example, when folded along the length, the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) plus the folded edge.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the perimeter is the boundary of the shape. Folding along a line would not add to the perimeter; it would either hide an internal edge or create a new edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) plus L. Because the fold creates a new edge. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along its length, the folded edge becomes a new edge. So the perimeter would be the outer edges plus the folded edge.\n\nWait, perhaps. Let me think: when the sheet is folded along the length, the resulting shape is two layers of (L/2) by W, but the perimeter would be the outer edges plus the folded edge. So the perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W ) + L \u2192 because the folded edge adds another length of L.\n\nWait, that would be a different approach. Let's try that.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the perimeter would be 2*( (L/2) + W ) + L =48.\n\nWhich simplifies to 2*(L/2 + W ) + L = (L + 2W) + L =2L + 2W =48 \u2192 L + W=24.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the perimeter would be 2*( L + (W/2) ) + W =66.\n\nWhich is 2*(L + W/2) + W = (2L + W) + W =2L +2W=66 \u2192 L + W=33.\n\nWait, that can't be right because L + W can't be both 24 and 33. So this approach leads to inconsistency.\n\nSo perhaps this approach is incorrect. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.\"\n\nSo each part has a perimeter of 48 when folded along one set, 66 when folded along the other.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps the perimeters include the folded edge. Let me model that.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has dimensions (L/2) and W, but the folded edge adds another dimension.\n\nWait, no, because each part is a separate rectangle, so the perimeter would be as I originally thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded such that the length becomes W and the width becomes L/2 when folded along the length. No, that would be if you folded along the width.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part have dimensions W and L/2. So the perimeter would be 2*(W + L/2) =48.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So same equations.\n\nSo I'm back to the same conclusion, area 280. Which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along the length, the perimeter is 48, which includes both the outer edges and the folded edge. So each part's perimeter is 48, but when folded, the folded edge is internal, so perhaps it's not counted. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the perimeters for the folded sheet, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nIf when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48 cm, and when folded along the width, it's 66 cm.\n\nSo:\n\nFolded along length: dimensions (L/2) and W. Perimeter 2*( (L/2) + W )=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nFolded along width: dimensions L and (W/2). Perimeter 2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I think the correct area is 280, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that the sheet is folded along the length, and the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48, which includes both parts. So the perimeter is 48 cm for the entire folded sheet, which is half the original.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, the sheet's dimensions are (L/2) and W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's dimensions are L and (W/2). Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I must have made a mistake, but I can't figure it out. Since the options don't match, perhaps I should re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the original sheet when folded, but that doesn't make sense because the original sheet's perimeter wouldn't change upon folding.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, but the perimeters are for the original sheet. No, the problem states each part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the sheet when folded into two parts, so each part's perimeter is half the original. No, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, which would have different dimensions.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet along its length, the sheet's dimensions become (L/2) by W, but the perimeter would be the same as the original sheet's perimeter minus the folded edge. No, that's not correct. Because the folded edge is internal, not contributing to the perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter when folded is the same as the original. But no, because the dimensions have changed.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the sheet's length and width in a way that when folded, the perimeters are as given, but leading to a larger area.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let the original sheet have length x and width y. When folded along the length, each part is (x/2) by y, perimeter 2*(x/2 + y) = x+2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is x by (y/2), perimeter 2*(x + y/2 )=2x + y=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part a square. But that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding, not each part. But that's what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48, and when folded along the width, it's 66. So:\n\nFolded along length: 2*( (L/2) + W )=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nFolded along width: 2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nSo, I think I'm correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. But I can't see where.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find an area that matches one of the options. Let's see. Let's try option E)1200. So area would be 1200 cm\u00b2. So L*W=1200.\n\nLooking for integer solutions, perhaps L=40, W=30. Let's see:\n\nIf L=40, W=30.\n\nWhen folded along length: each part is 20 by 30. Perimeter=2*(20+30)=100. Not 48. So no.\n\nAnother option: Let me think of L=30, W=40. Then when folded along length, each part is 15 by40. Perimeter=2*(15+40)=110. Not 48.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nOption D)1320. So L*W=1320. Let's say L=33, W=40. So when folded along length, each part is 16.5 by40. Perimeter=2*(16.5+40)=2*56.5=113. Not 48.\n\nAlternatively, L=30, W=44. When folded along length, each part is15 by44. Perimeter=2*(15+44)=2*59=118. Not 48.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nOption C)792. So L*W=792.\n\nLet's say L=24, W=33.\n\nWhen folded along length: each part is12 by33. Perimeter=2*(12+33)=2*45=90. Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption B)1120. L=32, W=35. Folded along length: each part 16 by35. Perimeter=2*(16+35)=2*51=102. Not 48.\n\nOption A)1584. L=33, W=48. Folded along length: each part 16.5 by48. Perimeter=2*(16.5+48)=2*64.5=129. Not 48.\n\nHmm, none of the options fit. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equations in terms of the sheet being folded along the longer side first. Let me think: perhaps the sheet's longer side is W, and shorter is L. But that shouldn't affect the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find a solution where the perimeters are as given and the area is one of the options.\n\nLet me suppose that when folded along the length, the perimeter is 48, and when folded along the width, it's 66. So equations:\n\nL + 2W =48.\n\n2L + W=66.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L +W )=96-66 \u21923W=30 \u2192W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo area 28*10=280. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations are swapped. Let me suppose:\n\nWhen folded along length, perimeter 66: 2*(L/2 + W )=66 \u2192 L+2W=66.\n\nWhen folded along width, perimeter48: 2*(L + W/2 )=48 \u21922L + W=48.\n\nNow, solving:\n\nEquation 1: L +2W=66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L +W=48.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2:4L +2W=96.\n\nSubtract equation1: (4L +2W) - (L +2W )=96-66 \u21923L=30 \u2192L=10.\n\nThen from equation 2: 2*10 + W=48 \u219220+W=48 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSo area is 10*28=280. Same as before.\n\nSo I'm confident that the area is 280, but the options don't have it. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that when folded along one set, the sheet's perimeter is 48, not each part. Let me try that.\n\nIf when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48: 2*( (L/2) + W )=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet's perimeter is 66:2*( L + (W/2) )=66 \u21922L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if I've swapped the length and width. Let me think that when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48, which would mean that the length is halved. So if the original sheet's length is W and width is L, perhaps I mixed them up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should let length be W and width be L. Let me try that.\n\nWhen folded along the length (W), each part has dimensions (W/2) and L. Perimeter is 2*( (W/2) + L )=48 \u2192 W +2L=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width (L), each part has dimensions W and (L/2). Perimeter is 2*( W + (L/2) )=66 \u21922W +L=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1. W +2L=48.\n\n2. 2W +L=66.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2W +4L=96.\n\nSubtract equation2: (2W+4L)-(2W+L)=96-66 \u21923L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen equation1: W +20=48 \u2192W=28.\n\nSo area is W*L=28*10=280. Same result.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but it's not in the options. So perhaps the problem is intended to have a different setup, but I can't see it.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular sheet that is folded into two equal halves along two different sets of sides, resulting in perimeters of 48 cm and 66 cm for the halves. The goal is to determine the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Define Variables**: Let the original sheet have length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\).\n\n2. **Folding Along Length**:\n   - When folded along the length, each half has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\).\n   - The perimeter of each half is \\( 2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = 48 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( L + 2W = 48 \\). (Equation 1)\n\n3. **Folding Along Width**:\n   - When folded along the width, each half has dimensions \\( L \\times \\frac{W}{2} \\).\n   - The perimeter of each half is \\( 2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 66 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( 2L + W = 66 \\). (Equation 2)\n\n4. **Solve the System of Equations**:\n   - From Equation 1: \\( L = 48 - 2W \\).\n   - Substitute \\( L \\) into Equation 2: \\( 2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\) \u2192 \\( 96 - 3W = 66 \\) \u2192 \\( 3W = 30 \\) \u2192 \\( W = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n   - Substitute \\( W = 10 \\) into Equation 1: \\( L = 48 - 2(10) = 28 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Area**:\n   - The area of the original sheet is \\( L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\).\n\n6. **Mismatch with Options**:\n   - The calculated area \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options: \\( 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200 \\).\n   - Despite multiple checks, the equations and reasoning consistently lead to \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), suggesting either an error in the problem setup or the options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct area of the sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\), but since this value is not among the options, the problem may contain an inconsistency. Based on the given options, none are correct.\n\nANSWER: None of the options are correct.",
