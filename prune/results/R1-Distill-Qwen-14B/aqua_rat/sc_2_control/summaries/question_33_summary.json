      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular sheet being folded, and I need to find the area. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nSo, the problem says that when the sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. Then, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nWait, wait. Let me visualize this. Imagine a rectangle. When you fold it along one pair of sides, you're halving it along either the length or the width. So the sheet has length L and width W, maybe?\n\nWhen folded along one set of sides, say the length, you get two smaller rectangles each of size (L/2) by W. The perimeter of each of these smaller rectangles would be 2*(L/2 + W) = 2*(L/2 + W). But wait, the problem says that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So:\n\n2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48. Simplify that: (L/2 + W) = 24. So, L + 2W = 48. Let me note that as equation 1.\n\nThen, when folded along the other set of sides, maybe along the width. So each part would be (W/2) by L. The perimeter of each would be 2*(L + W/2) = 66 cm. So:\n\n2*(L + W/2) = 66 \u2192 L + W/2 = 33. That's equation 2.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) L + 2W = 48\n\n2) L + (W/2) = 33\n\nHmm, I can solve these two equations together. Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1.\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =48\n\nEquation2: L + 0.5W=33\n\nSubtracting equation2 from equation1: (L - L) + (2W - 0.5W) =48-33 \u2192 1.5W=15 \u2192 W=15 / 1.5 = 10 cm.\n\nWait, so W is 10 cm. Now plug back into equation2 to find L.\n\nEquation2 says L + (10/2) =33 \u2192 L +5=33 \u2192 L=28 cm.\n\nSo length is 28 cm, width is 10 cm. So the area is L*W = 28*10 = 280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but none of the options are 280. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the folding. Maybe I should check the perimeters again.\n\nWait, when you fold along the length, each half has dimensions (L/2) and W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. Oh wait, that's correct. And that equals 48, so equation 1 is correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is (W/2) and L. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W. Oh wait, wait! I think I made a mistake in the second equation. Because 2*(L + W/2) is 2L + W, not L + W/2. Because 2*(L + (W/2)) = 2L + W.\n\nOh no, I messed up. So equation 2 should be 2L + W =66. Let me correct that.\n\nSo equation1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W =66.\n\nNow I have:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =48 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubtract equation2 from the modified equation1:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=96 -66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation1: L + 2*10 =48 \u2192 L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nSo same as before. Wait, then area is 28*10=280 again. But that's not in the options. Hmm, so something's wrong here. Did I get the perimeters wrong?\n\nWait maybe I should re-examine the problem. It says, when folded along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. When folded along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the dimensions wrong when folding. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal sheet is L (length) and W (width). When folded along the length, each part is (L/2) in length and W in width. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W =48. That's correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2) in width and L in length. Perimeter is 2*(L + (W/2)) = 2L + W. So that's 66. So equation 2 is 2L + W =66.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W =66.\n\nLet me solve these correctly.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2L +4W =96.\n\nNow subtract equation2 (2L + W =66):\n\n(2L+4W)-(2L+W) =96 -66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen from equation1: L=48 -2W \u2192 48-20=28 cm.\n\nSo area is 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut looking at the options, 280 is not listed. The options are 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200. Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the folding direction. Maybe when folded along the other sides, the perimeters are different? Or perhaps when folded, the perimeters are for the two parts combined, not each part.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. \"the perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, no, it says when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 or 66. So my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimensions when calculating the perimeters. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W.\n\nYes. So equation1 is correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is W/2 by L. Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 2L + W.\n\nEquation2 is correct.\n\nSo the solution leads me to L=28, W=10, area 280.\n\nBut that's not an option. Hmm. So perhaps I need to re-express the equations.\n\nWait, what if the perimeters were for the combined two parts? No, the question says each part has the given perimeter.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the equations set up wrong. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me denote the original rectangle as having length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half is (L/2) x W. So each has perimeter 2*( L/2 + W ) = (L + 2W). The problem says this equals 48: L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is (W/2) x L. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )= 2L + W. This equals 66: 2L + W =66.\n\nHmm, same equations as before. So same solution.\n\nBut the area is 28*10=280, which isn't an option. So maybe I need to re-express the equations differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the problem wrong. Maybe the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding. Wait, no, the question says each part folded. So two parts, each with a perimeter.\n\nWait, maybe the sheet is folded along one of its sides, but perhaps it's folded the other way. Like, if the sheet is folded in half, perhaps it's folded along the length or the width, but the perimeters change.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folded along one set, the perimeters are different. Let me try drawing a diagram.\n\nImagine the rectangle is folded along the length, so the new length is L/2, and width remains W. So each part is L/2 by W.\n\nAlternatively, when folded along the width, each part is W/2 by L.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the sheet being folded along its length, making each half's dimensions (L/2, W). So perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is (W/2, L). Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 ) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try another approach. Let me denote x and y as the sides. Let me say when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48, and when folded along the width, each part has perimeter 66.\n\nSo, when folded along the length, the half has dimensions (L/2) and W. Perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W =48 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2) and L. Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )= 2L + W=66 cm.\n\nSo same equations again. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the variables are swapped. Maybe I should let L be the width and W be the length. Wait, no, that shouldn't matter. Let me switch.\n\nLet me let length be W and width be L. Then equation1: W + 2L =48.\n\nEquation2: 2W + L =66.\n\nSo now solving:\n\nEquation1: W +2L=48.\n\nEquation2: 2W + L=66.\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 2: 2W +4L=96.\n\nSubtract equation2: (2W +4L) - (2W + L)=96-66 \u2192 3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nFrom equation1: W=48 -2*10=28.\n\nSo length is 10, width is28. Area is 28*10=280 again. Same result.\n\nBut the options are way bigger. Hmm. Maybe the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding. Wait, that would be different.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps when the sheet is folded, the perimeters are of the folded sheet, not each half. Wait, but the question says each part.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when folded, the entire sheet's perimeter is 48 and 66 when folded along different sides. No, the question says each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when folded, the two parts are joined, but that's not relevant. The question says each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is (L/2, W). Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (W/2, L). Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSo equations are correct.\n\nSo L=28, W=10. Area=280.\n\nBut the options are way larger. So perhaps the problem is in cm\u00b2 and the options are in something else, but the options are just numbers, so they must be in cm\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the problem says when folded into two equal halves, the perimeter is 48 for each part when folded along one set, and 66 for the other. So my equations are correct.\n\nBut the answer is not in the options. So maybe I need to check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm using the wrong perimeters. Let me calculate the perimeters again.\n\nIf L=28, W=10.\n\nWhen folded along length: each part is 14x10. Perimeter= 2*(14+10)=2*24=48. Correct.\n\nWhen folded along width: each part is 5x28. Perimeter= 2*(5+28)=2*33=66. Correct.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. But the area is 280, which is not among the options. So perhaps the question is asking for something else, or maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, but not along the length and width. Maybe along a diagonal or something else. No, the problem says along one set of sides, which implies either length or width.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is being folded along its length, which causes the other dimension to be halved. Wait, perhaps I got the folding direction wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. If the sheet is folded along its length, then the length is halved, and the width remains the same. So each part is (L/2) x W.\n\nAlternatively, if folded along the width, each part is (W/2) x L.\n\nSo my earlier approach is correct.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the options are wrong, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the combined two parts. But that would be a different approach.\n\nWait, if the perimeters were for the combined two parts, when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48, so two parts would have 96. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet after folding. But that doesn't make sense because the sheet is folded into two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"the perimeter of each part is...\". So when folded along one side, each part has a perimeter of 48, and when folded along the other, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWait, but that's what I did. So perhaps I need to check the equations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to solve for L and W differently.\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =48.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nLet me solve equation1 for L: L =48-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96 -4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=96-66=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-20=28.\n\nSo the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded in such a way that the perimeter is for the folded sheet, not each part. Let me think.\n\nIf I fold along the length, the folded sheet would have dimensions (L/2) and W. The perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nSimilarly, if I fold along the width, the folded sheet's dimensions are (W/2) and L. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before. So same solution.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 280, but that's not in the options. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1584\n\nB)1120\n\nC)792\n\nD)1320\n\nE)1200\n\nHmm, all are multiples of 100. So perhaps I missed a zero somewhere. Maybe the perimeters are in meters, but the problem says cm, so unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply my area by something. Wait, perhaps the original sheet is folded into four parts? No, the problem says two equal halves.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are of the entire folded sheet, not each part. Let me think.\n\nIf when folded along the length, the entire sheet's perimeter would be 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W=48. Same as before.\n\nBut when folded along the width, the entire sheet's perimeter would be 2*( (W/2) + L )= 2L + W=66. Same equations again.\n\nHmm. So same solution. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to swap L and W in the equations. Let me try:\n\nEquation1: W + 2L =48.\n\nEquation2: 2W + L=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: W=48-2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(48-2L) + L=66 \u2192 96 -4L + L=66 \u2192 96-3L=66 \u2192 3L=30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48-20=28.\n\nSo area is L*W=10*28=280. Same result.\n\nHmm, so no change.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me see the options\u2014maybe I should find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the combined two sheets. So:\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48, so two parts would have 96 cm total perimeter. But that seems unlikely because the perimeters would overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet (the two parts together) is 48. But that doesn't make much sense, because the folded sheet is just half the original.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet into two parts, the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48, not each part.\n\nWait, let me think. If original is L and W. When folded along length, the folded sheet is L/2 by W. Its perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L +2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along width, the folded sheet's perimeter is 2*(L + W/2) = 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before. So same solution.\n\nI'm stuck because the area isn't in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeter includes both the folded edge and the open edges. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you fold a sheet in half along the length, the folded sheet is L/2 by W. The perimeter of this folded sheet is 2*(L/2 + W) as before.\n\nBut maybe I should think about the perimeter of the original sheet as being split into the folded and open parts. No, I think the perimeter is correctly calculated as for the folded part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded, the perimeter includes the folded edge, which isn't part of the original perimeter.\n\nWait, no, the perimeter of the folded part includes all sides, including the folded edge. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded, the perimeter is for the entire folded structure, which would be different. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded and then the perimeter is measured around the folded edge and the two open sides. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, if the sheet is folded along the length, the folded part would have a perimeter that includes the two W sides and the folded L/2 and the remaining L/2. Hmm, no, that would be the same as the perimeter of the folded part, which is L/2 + W + L/2 + W = L + 2W. So same as before.\n\nI think I've tried all possible approaches and the solution is 280, but it's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters when folded are for the two parts together. Let me see.\n\nIf when folded along one side, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48, but that seems odd because each part has a perimeter, which would sum to more than 48.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet (which is two layers) is 48. But that's unlikely, as it's the same as the folded sheet's perimeter.\n\nHmm. Since I can't find any other approach, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to find the area of the original sheet, which is L * W =28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo. Alternatively, maybe I swapped the perimeters.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are 66 cm when folded along the length, and 48 when along the width.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo equation1: L +2W=66.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation2: 2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192 132 -4W +W=48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 3W=132-48=84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66-2*28=66-56=10 cm.\n\nArea is 10 *28=280 cm\u00b2. Same result.\n\nSo no change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the equations set up incorrectly. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me assume that when folded along one side, the perimeters are 48 cm, which includes the two open edges and the folded edge. But I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe the perimeter when folded is the sum of the three visible sides. For example, when you fold a rectangle along its length, the folded part has three sides contributing to the perimeter: the two W sides and the L/2 side. So perimeter would be 2W + L/2.\n\nWait, that's different. Let me try that.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part's perimeter is 2W + L/2 =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 2L + W/2=66.\n\nAh, perhaps that's where I went wrong. Earlier, I considered the perimeter as for a rectangle with sides L/2 and W, which is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48. But perhaps the perimeter is actually 2W + L/2, which is different.\n\nWait, wait, no. When you fold a rectangle along its length, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle of L/2 by W. The perimeter of this shape is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W. So that's correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering the perimeter when folded as the sum of the two open sides plus the folded edge. But that doesn't make sense because the perimeter includes all four sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. I think the initial approach is correct, but since I'm not getting any of the options, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the original sheet, not the folded parts. But that can't be, because the original sheet's perimeter is fixed.\n\nWait, let me compute the original sheet's perimeter.\n\nOriginal perimeter is 2*(L + W) =2*(28+10)=2*38=76 cm. But that's not relevant to the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach entirely. Let me think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me let the original sheet have length L and width W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half has dimensions (L/2, W). Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48. Equation1.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half has dimensions (W/2, L). Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66. Equation2.\n\nSo solving:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=48.\n\nEquation2: 2L +W=66.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation2: (2L +4W) - (2L + W)=96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo area is 28*10=280.\n\nHmm. So no, I'm stuck. Perhaps the answer isn't among the options, but that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the sheet is being folded into two parts, but the way it's folded changes the perimeter differently. Maybe when folded along the length, each part's perimeter is 48, which is the sum of two of its sides and the folded edge. But that doesn't make sense because the perimeter includes all four sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters when folded include the folded edge as a single length. But in reality, the perimeter includes all four sides, whether folded or not. So I think the initial setup is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area in square meters. No, the perimeters are in cm, so area would be in cm\u00b2, which is 280. But options are much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me call the length x and the width y.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is (x/2) by y. Perimeter: 2*(x/2 + y) =x + 2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (y/2) by x. Perimeter: 2*(x + y/2 )= 2x + y=66.\n\nSo equations:\n\nx +2y=48 \u2192 equation A.\n\n2x + y=66 \u2192 equation B.\n\nLet me solve equation A for x: x=48-2y.\n\nSubstitute into equation B: 2*(48-2y) + y =66 \u2192 96-4y +y=66 \u2192 96-3y=66 \u21923y=30 \u2192 y=10.\n\nSo x=48-20=28. So area is 28*10=280.\n\nAgain same result. So I'm confident in the solution, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the problem was intended to have different perimeters, or perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts together when folded.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, each part has perimeter 48, so two parts would have 96 cm. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, when folded, the total perimeter of both parts is 48. But that doesn't make sense because each part has its own perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the folded sheet's perimeter is 48 when folded along the length, and 66 when folded along the width. But that's the same as before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the perimeters differently. Let me think again about the perimeters.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is (x/2, y). Perimeter is 2*(x/2 + y) =x +2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (y/2, x). Perimeter is 2*(x + y/2)=2x + y=66.\n\nYes, same equations. So same solution.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded twice, but that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up equations differently. Let me try.\n\nLet me let the original sheet have dimensions a and b.\n\nWhen folded along a, each part is a/2 by b. Perimeter is 2*(a/2 + b)=a +2b =48.\n\nWhen folded along b, each part is b/2 by a. Perimeter is 2*(a + b/2)=2a + b=66.\n\nSo a +2b=48.\n\n2a +b=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply first equation by 2: 2a +4b=96.\n\nSubtract second equation: (2a+4b) - (2a +b)=96-66 \u21923b=30 \u2192b=10.\n\nThen a=48-2*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280. Same result.\n\nI think I've tried everything and the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps the problem intended the perimeters to be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps when folded along the length, the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + 2W). No, that doesn't make sense. Because when you fold along the length, you have two sides of L/2 and two sides of W.\n\nWait, no. When you fold a rectangle of L and W along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) =L +2W.\n\nYes, equation1 is correct.\n\nSo I think the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding, which would be the same as each part, so same result.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, which is two layers. But that doesn't change the perimeter.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the answer isn't in the options, perhaps I'll have to choose the closest option, but that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the area. L=28, W=10. 28*10=280. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is 1200. 280 is much smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if I have the correct dimensions. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, making each part's perimeter 48, and when folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 66.\n\nBut perhaps the perimeter when folded along the length is 48, which is for the entire folded sheet, meaning the perimeter is 48, not each part. So:\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) )= L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is W/2 by L. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations. So same solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into four parts, but that's not what the question says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet and the remaining sheet. But that's getting too complicated.\n\nI think I've spent enough time on this. The correct answer based on the problem as given is 280, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option D)1320. But I'm not sure how to get there.\n\nWait, perhaps I should multiply L and W by 10. 28*10=280, but 28*10*10=2800, which is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations and the correct answer is option D)1320.\n\nWait, let me try to find the correct equations again. Maybe I've swapped the perimeters.\n\nLet me assume that when folded along the length, the perimeter is 66, and when along the width, it's 48. So:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=66 \u2192 L=66-2W.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=48.\n\nSubstitute equation1 into equation2:\n\n2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192132-4W +W=48 \u2192132-3W=48 \u21923W=84 \u2192W=28.\n\nThen L=66-2*28=66-56=10.\n\nArea is 10*28=280. Again same result.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the problem is intended to have the perimeters as 66 and 48 when folded along the other sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I set up the equations is wrong. Let me think differently. Let me denote the original sheet as having length l and width w.\n\nWhen folded along length, the perimeter of each part is 48. Each part is (l/2, w). So perimeter is 2*(l/2 +w)= l +2w=48 \u2192 equation1.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is (w/2, l). Perimeter is 2*(l +w/2)=2l +w=66 \u2192 equation2.\n\nEquation1: l +2w=48.\n\nEquation2:2l +w=66.\n\nSolving:\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2 \u2192 2l +4w=96.\n\nSubtract equation2 \u2192 2l +4w - (2l +w)=96-66 \u21923w=30 \u2192w=10.\n\nThen l=48-20=28.\n\nArea=28*10=280. Same as before.\n\nSince the options don't include 280, perhaps the problem has a typo or I'm missing a step. But I can't figure it out. So perhaps the intended answer is option A)1584, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the area as (L * W). Let me try with L=48 and W=66, but that's not based on the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply the perimeters and take the square root. 48*66=3168. Square root is about 56.3, which doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations as:\n\nWhen folded along the length, the perimeter is (L/2 + W)*2=48 \u2192 L +2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the perimeter is (W/2 + L)*2=66 \u2192 2W +2L=66 \u2192 L +W=33.\n\nSo now I have:\n\nEquation1: L +2W=48.\n\nEquation3: L + W=33.\n\nSubtract equation3 from equation1: W=15.\n\nThen L=33-15=18.\n\nArea=18*15=270. Still not matching options.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps when folded along the width, the perimeter is (L + W/2)*2=66 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded into two parts, the perimeters are for the two parts together, not each part. So:\n\nWhen folded along the length, the perimeters of both parts would be 2*(L/2 + W) each, so 2*(L +2W) = 2*48=96. So L + 2W=48.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nWhen folded along the width, 2*(2L + W)= 2*66=132 \u2192 2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations.\n\nSo same solution.\n\nI think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is 280, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem is incorrect. But among the options, perhaps option C)792 is 28*28.5, but that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me set up the equations again.\n\nLet me let the original sheet have length x and width y.\n\nWhen folded along the length: each part has dimensions (x/2, y). Perimeter: 2*(x/2 + y) =x + 2y=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width: each part has dimensions (y/2, x). Perimeter:2*(x + y/2) )=2x + y=66.\n\nSo:\n\nx +2y=48 \u2192 equation1.\n\n2x + y=66 \u2192 equation2.\n\nMultiply equation1 by 2: 2x +4y=96.\n\nSubtract equation2: (2x+4y) - (2x + y)=96-66 \u21923y=30 \u2192y=10.\n\nThen x=48-2*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280.\n\nSo again, same result.\n\nI think I've tried everything. The correct answer is 280, but it's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a mistake.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular sheet with length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). When folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm, and when folded along the other set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. The goal is to find the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Folding along the length**:  \n   When folded along the length, each part has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\). The perimeter of each part is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\left( \\frac{L}{2} + W \\right) = L + 2W = 48 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Folding along the width**:  \n   When folded along the width, each part has dimensions \\( \\frac{W}{2} \\times L \\). The perimeter of each part is given by:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 2L + W = 66 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving the equations**:  \n   From Equation (1):  \n   \\[\n   L + 2W = 48 \\implies L = 48 - 2W\n   \\]  \n   Substitute \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) into Equation (2):  \n   \\[\n   2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 3W = 66\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   3W = 30 \\implies W = 10\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( W = 10 \\) back into \\( L = 48 - 2W \\):  \n   \\[\n   L = 48 - 2(10) = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the area**:  \n   The area of the original sheet is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mismatch with options**:  \n   The calculated area of \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options (\\( 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200 \\)). Despite multiple attempts to verify the setup and calculations, the solution remains consistent, and the discrepancy suggests either a typo in the problem or an issue with the provided options.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the correct area of the sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, since this value is not among the given options, the problem may contain an error or require further clarification.\n\n**Answer: None of the provided options are correct.**",
