      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where Kevin is driving from point A to point B, then turning around and driving back. I need to find the distance between A and B. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Kevin's speed is 70 mph going from A to B. Then, when he gets to B, he turns around and comes back at 90 mph. The problem says that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, I think this means that in the last 3 hours of his entire trip, he was still traveling towards B but 70 miles away. So, the trip is from A to B, then back to A, and 3 hours before the end, he was 70 miles from B.\n\nLet me think about the total time of the trip. Let's denote the distance between A and B as D. So, the time taken to go from A to B is D/70 hours. The time taken to return from B to A is D/90 hours. So, the total time of the trip is (D/70 + D/90) hours.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions that 3 hours before the end, he was 70 miles away from B. So, I need to figure out where he was at that point in time. Let's model his trip.\n\nLet me denote the total trip time as T. Then, 3 hours before the end, the time elapsed would be T - 3 hours. At that time, he was 70 miles away from B, which means he was D - 70 miles from A. Because he's on his way back from B to A. Wait, no. Wait, when he's approaching B, that means he's going towards B. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.\" So, approaching B implies he's on his way to B, but that's confusing because he started at A, drove to B, then turned around. So, the only time he's approaching B after turning around is when he's going back towards A. Wait, no, after turning around, he's moving away from B, right? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. So, Kevin starts at A, drives towards B. Once he reaches B, he turns around, which means he starts driving back towards A. So, during the return trip, he's moving away from B. So, when the problem says he's approaching B, that can't be when he's on the return trip. Because he's moving away from B. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem's phrasing is a bit different. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.\" So, the end of his trip is when he arrives back at A. So, 3 hours before arriving back, he was 70 miles away from B. So, at time T - 3, he was 70 miles away from B.\n\nWait, when he's returning, he's moving towards A. So, the distance from B is increasing as he goes towards A? No, wait, no. Wait, when he's on the return trip (from B to A), he's moving away from B, so the distance from B increases. Wait, no. Wait, when you're moving away from B, the distance increases. Like, if you're at B and start moving away, your distance from B increases.\n\nWait, but in the problem, when he's 3 hours away from the end, he's 70 miles away from B. So, he's on the return trip, moving towards A. So, at that point, he's D - something miles from A. Wait, maybe I should model this with equations.\n\nLet me think of the entire trip as two parts: going from A to B, taking time t1 = D/70 hours, and returning from B to A, taking time t2 = D/90 hours. So, the total time T = t1 + t2.\n\nAt time T - 3 hours, he was 70 miles away from B. So, let's find where he was at that time. So, at T - 3, the time elapsed is T - 3. Let's subtract the time taken for the first part (A to B) to see if he was still on the way there or on the way back. So, t1 is D/70. So, if T - 3 < t1, he was still on the way to B, but in our case, he must have turned around, so T - 3 would be after t1.\n\nSo, at time T - 3, he had already completed the trip from A to B, which took t1. So, the time spent on the return trip by then is (T - 3) - t1.\n\nWait, but T is t1 + t2, so T = (D/70) + (D/90). So, T -3 = (D/70 + D/90) - 3.\n\nBut the time spent on the return trip when he was at that point is (T -3) - t1 = (D/70 + D/90 -3 ) - D/70 = D/90 -3.\n\nWait, so the time spent on the return trip is (D/90 -3) hours. But wait, that time can't be negative, so D/90 must be greater than 3, which implies D > 270 miles.\n\nWait, but let me think again. At time (T -3), he is 70 miles away from B. Since he's on his way back, the distance from B is how much he has traveled on the return trip.\n\nWait, because when he's returning, each hour he covers 90 miles towards A, so the distance from B increases by 90 miles per hour. So, the distance from B after t hours on the return trip is 90 * t.\n\nWait, no. Because when he starts the return trip, he's at B. So, as he moves towards A, the distance from B would be 90 * t, where t is the time since he started the return.\n\nSo, at time (T -3), the time he has spent on the return trip is (T -3) - t1. Because t1 is the time taken to go from A to B. So, the time on return trip is (t1 + t2 -3) - t1 = t2 -3 = (D/90) -3.\n\nSo, the distance from B at that time is 90 * (t2 -3) = 90 * (D/90 -3) = D - 270.\n\nWait, but the problem states that at that time, he was 70 miles away from B. So, D - 270 =70.\n\nWait, D -270 =70 \u2192 D=340.\n\nWait, 340 is not one of the options. The options are 180,90,270,360, and E (none). So, the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me think again. At time T, he arrives back at A. So, at time T-3, he's 70 miles away from B, meaning he's 70 miles into his return trip. Because when he's on the return trip, each hour he goes 90 miles. So, the distance from B is 90 * t, where t is the time he's spent on the return trip.\n\nSo, at time T-3, the time he's spent on the return trip is (T-3) - t1.\n\nBut T is t1 + t2 = D/70 + D/90.\n\nSo, T-3 = (D/70 + D/90) -3.\n\nThe time on return trip is (D/70 + D/90 -3) - D/70 = D/90 -3.\n\nSo, the distance from B is 90 * (D/90 -3) = D - 270.\n\nThis equals 70 miles. So, D -270 =70 \u2192 D=340.\n\nHmm, but 340 isn't an option. The choices are A)180, B)90, C)270, D)360, E)None.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be E.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in setting up the problem? Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAssume that the total time from departure until arriving back at A is T.\n\nAt time T - 3, he is 70 miles away from B. So, he is on his way back, having already reached B.\n\nSo, in the time from the start until time T -3, he spent t1 = D/70 hours going from A to B, and then (T -3 - t1) hours going back towards A.\n\nIn the return trip, he's been driving for (T-3 - t1) hours. The distance he's covered on the return trip is 90*(T-3 - t1).\n\nBut since he's 70 miles away from B, that means he has covered (D -70) miles on the return trip. Because if the total distance is D, being 70 miles from B would mean he's covered D-70 miles towards A.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait, when he is on the return trip, the distance he has covered is from B to his current position. So, if the distance from B is 70, then the distance he has traveled on the return trip is 70 miles. Because when you're on the return trip, each mile you cover moves you that much away from B.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, think about it. If you're starting at B and driving towards A, after t hours, you've driven 90t miles towards A. So, the distance from B is 90t miles. So, if you are 70 miles away from B, that's the distance you have traveled from B, which is 70 = 90t \u2192 t=70/90 = 7/9 hours \u2248 46.67 minutes.\n\nWait, so in this case, the time spent on the return trip when he was 70 miles away from B is 70/90 hours.\n\nBut according to the problem, that time is (T -3) - t1.\n\nSo, T is the total time. T = t1 + t2 = D/70 + D/90.\n\nSo, (T -3) - t1 = (D/70 + D/90 -3) - D/70 = D/90 -3.\n\nAnd this equals 70/90 hours.\n\nSo,\n\nD/90 - 3 = 70/90 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 90:\n\nD - 270 =70 \u2192 D=340.\n\nSame result as before, 340 miles. Since this isn't an option, the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but what if I'm mixing up the direction? Let me think again.\n\nWait, when he's 70 miles away from B, is that on his way to B or on his way back? The problem says he was approaching B, which implies he was moving towards B. But that can't be because after he reaches B, he turns around and is moving away. So, the only time he's approaching B is when he's going towards it, which is during the first leg of the trip.\n\nWait, I think I might have misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nQuestion: Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.\n\nWait, the end of his trip is when he arrives back at A. So, 3 hours before arriving back, he was approaching B, 70 miles away.\n\nSo, at time T-3, he was 70 miles away from B, and approaching it. That suggests that he's still going towards B. But after he reaches B, he turned around and is heading back to A. So, if at T-3, he was approaching B, that would mean that the time T-3 is before he even reached B.\n\nWait, that changes everything. Oh! So, the 3 hours before the end of his trip is actually during his first leg, going towards B. So, he hasn't yet turned around.\n\nWait, that would mean that the 3 hours before the end (which is arrival at A), he was still on his way to B. So, the total trip time is T = t1 + t2, where t1 is the time to go from A to B, and t2 is the time to return.\n\nSo, at time (T -3), he was on his way to B, 70 miles away. So, he had not yet reached B. So, the time taken to go from A to B is t1 = D/70 hours.\n\nAnd the time (T-3) must be less than t1, because he hasn't reached B yet.\n\nSo, T -3 < t1 \u2192 T < t1 +3.\n\nBut T is the total time, which is t1 + t2.\n\nSo, T = t1 + t2 \u2192 t2 = T - t1.\n\nSo, substituting into T < t1 +3 \u2192 t1 + t2 < t1 +3 \u2192 t2 <3.\n\nSo, the return trip time t2 = D/90 is less than 3 hours.\n\nOkay, so now, at T -3, he was 70 miles away from B. That is, on his way to B, so the time spent going towards B is T -3.\n\nWait, no. Because at time (T -3), he has driven for (T -3) hours towards B, but hasn't reached it yet.\n\nWait, no. Let me model this correctly.\n\nFrom time 0 to t1, he's driving towards B. After that, he turns around and drives back towards A.\n\nThe problem states that at time (T -3), he was approaching B (so, in the first part of the trip, before reaching B). So, T -3 must be less than t1.\n\nSo, the distance he had covered by time (T -3) is 70*(T -3) miles. Because he's driving at 70 mph.\n\nBut since he's 70 miles away from B at that time, the distance he has covered is D -70 miles.\n\nSo,\n\n70*(T -3) = D -70.\n\nBut T is the total time, which is t1 + t2 = D/70 + D/90.\n\nSo, substituting T into the equation.\n\n70 * ( (D/70 + D/90) -3 ) = D -70.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n70*(D/70 + D/90 -3) = D -70.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets first.\n\nD/70 + D/90 = D(1/70 + 1/90) = D ( (90 +70)/(70*90) ) = D (160 / 6300 ) = D (16/630 ) = (8 D)/ 315.\n\nSo,\n\n70*( (8 D)/(315) -3 ) = D -70.\n\nCompute 70 * (8 D /315 ):\n\n70 * (8 D / 315 ) = (70 *8 D ) / 315 = (560 D ) /315.\n\nSimplify 560/315: both divided by 35 \u2192 16/9.\n\nSo, 16 D /9.\n\nThen, 70 * (-3) is -210.\n\nSo, overall equation:\n\n16 D/9 -210 = D -70.\n\nLet me bring all terms to left:\n\n16 D/9 -210 -D +70 =0.\n\nCombine D terms: (16D/9 -9D/9 )=7D/9.\n\nConstants: -210 +70 =-140.\n\nSo,\n\n7D/9 -140 =0 \u21927D/9 =140 \u2192 D= (140 *9)/7 \u2192 140/7=20 \u2192 20*9=180.\n\nSo, D=180 miles.\n\nWait, 180 is option A. So, the answer would be A) 180.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the time spent on the return trip was D/90 -3, which gave D=340, but that must have been a wrong approach because now I have a different setup.\n\nSo, let me re-examine the two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, I thought that the 3 hours before the end was during the return trip, but the problem says he was approaching B, which implies he was still on the way to B, i.e., during the first leg.\n\nSo, the correct approach is the second one, leading to D=180.\n\nWait, but let me verify.\n\nIf D=180, time to go from A to B is 180/70 = 1.2857 hours (approx 1 hour 17 minutes).\n\nTime to return is 180/90=2 hours.\n\nSo, total trip time is 1.2857 +2 =3.2857 hours (approx 3 hours 17 minutes).\n\n3 hours before the end, the time is 3.2857 -3 \u22480.2857 hours (17 minutes).\n\nIn 17 minutes, driving at 70 mph, he would have covered 70 * (17/60) \u224820.1667 miles.\n\nSo, he would be 180 -20.1667 \u2248159.83 miles away from B, which is not 70 miles. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. So, according to this, D=180 would mean that at T-3, he was 159.83 miles away from B, but the problem says 70 miles. So, something is wrong.\n\nWait, what did I do wrong here.\n\nWait, let's recheck the setup. If D=180, then:\n\nAt time T = 180/70 +180/90 = (180*90 +180*70)/(70*90) \u2192 no, wait, that's not correct. Let me compute T.\n\nt1 =180/70 = 18/7 \u22482.5714 hours (~2h 34m).\n\nt2=180/90=2 hours.\n\nSo, T=2.5714 +2=4.5714 hours (~4h 34m).\n\nSo, T-3=1.5714 hours (~ 1h 34m).\n\nAt this time, he's been driving for 1h 34m. Since t1 is ~2h34m, he hasn't reached B yet.\n\nSo, the distance he has covered is 70 * 1.5714 \u2248 110 miles.\n\nWhich means he's 180-110=70 miles away from B.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, when the problem says he was 70 miles away from B, that's correct.\n\nSo, D=180, which is option A.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A)180.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the distance between points A and B be \\( D \\). Kevin drives from A to B at 70 mph, taking \\( t_1 = \\frac{D}{70} \\) hours. He then turns around and returns to A at 90 mph, taking \\( t_2 = \\frac{D}{90} \\) hours. The total trip time is \\( T = t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} \\).\n\nThe problem states that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B. This means that at time \\( T - 3 \\), he was still approaching B during his first leg of the trip (before reaching B). At this time, he had driven for \\( T - 3 \\) hours at 70 mph, covering a distance of \\( 70 \\times (T - 3) \\) miles. Since he was 70 miles away from B, the distance he had covered is \\( D - 70 \\).\n\nThus, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n70 \\times (T - 3) = D - 70\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( T = \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n70 \\times \\left( \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} - 3 \\right) = D - 70\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{70} + \\frac{D}{90} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{70} + \\frac{1}{90} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{90 + 70}{70 \\times 90} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{160}{6300} \\right) = \\frac{8D}{315}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back into the equation:\n\\[\n70 \\times \\left( \\frac{8D}{315} - 3 \\right) = D - 70\n\\]\n\nDistribute \\( 70 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times \\frac{8D}{315} - 70 \\times 3 = D - 70\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{560D}{315} - 210 = D - 70\n\\]\n\nReduce \\( \\frac{560}{315} \\) to \\( \\frac{16}{9} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{16D}{9} - 210 = D - 70\n\\]\n\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{16D}{9} - D = 210 - 70\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{16D}{9} - D = \\frac{7D}{9} \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{7D}{9} = 140\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( D \\):\n\\[\nD = \\frac{140 \\times 9}{7} = 180\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance between A and B is \\( D = 180 \\) miles. This matches option A.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Time to reach B: \\( t_1 = \\frac{180}{70} \\approx 2.57 \\, \\text{hours} \\)\n- Return time: \\( t_2 = \\frac{180}{90} = 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\)\n- Total trip time: \\( T = t_1 + t_2 \\approx 4.57 \\, \\text{hours} \\)\n- At \\( T - 3 \\approx 1.57 \\, \\text{hours} \\), distance covered: \\( 70 \\times 1.57 \\approx 110 \\, \\text{miles} \\)\n- Distance from B: \\( 180 - 110 = 70 \\, \\text{miles} \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{A}",
