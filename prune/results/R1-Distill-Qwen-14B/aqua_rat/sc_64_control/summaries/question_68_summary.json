      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about determining how many helpers are needed to prepare a certain number of cakes. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour. The kitchen is available for 3 hours. We need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct number of helpers.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So each helper has two options: make large cakes or small cakes. I think the idea here is that the helpers can split their time between making large and small cakes, but each helper can only do one type at a time. Or maybe each helper can choose which type to make, but we need to make sure both the large and small cake requirements are met within the 3-hour timeframe.\n\nWait, perhaps each helper can only make one type of cake. So, for example, some helpers make large cakes, and others make small. So the total number of helpers would be the sum of helpers making large cakes and those making small.\n\nLet me structure this. Let's denote:\n\nLet x = number of helpers making large cakes.\nLet y = number of helpers making small cakes.\n\nSo total helpers needed = x + y.\n\nNow, each large cake helper makes 2 large cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, one helper makes 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.\n\nSimilarly, each small cake helper makes 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, one helper makes 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.\n\nWe need a total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.\n\nSo the equations would be:\n\n6x = 20 (for large cakes)\n105y =700 (for small cakes)\n\nSo let me solve these equations.\n\nFirst, for the large cakes:\n\n6x = 20\nx = 20 /6\nx \u2248 3.333.\n\nBut you can't have a fraction of a helper, so x needs to be at least 4 helpers. Because 3 helpers would make 3*6=18 cakes, which is less than 20. So 4 helpers would make 24 cakes, which is enough.\n\nNext, for the small cakes:\n\n105y =700\ny =700 /105\nLet me calculate that. 105 times 6 is 630, 105*7=735. Wait wait, wait. 105*6=630, which is less than 700. So 700-630=70. 70 divided by 105 is 2/3. So y would be 6.666... So you can't have 2/3 of a helper, so you have to round up. So y=7 helpers.\n\nSo total helpers would be x + y =4 +7=11.\n\nWait, but the options given are 8,10,12,15,19. 11 isn't an option. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the helpers can switch between making large and small cakes, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe each helper can split their time between making both types. But that might not be the case because each helper can make either 2 large or 35 small per hour\u2014so maybe a helper can't do both at the same time.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, if 4 helpers make large cakes, they produce 4*2*3 =24 large cakes. That's more than the 20 needed. Alternatively, could we have 3 helpers for large cakes? Let's see: 3 helpers *2 per hour *3 hours= 18 cakes. That's not enough because we need 20. So yes, 4 helpers are needed.\n\nFor the small cakes: 7 helpers would make 7*35*3=7*105=735 small cakes, which is more than 700. But 6 helpers would make 6*105=630, which is less than 700. So 7 helpers are needed.\n\nSo 4 +7=11 helpers. But none of the options is 11. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can have some helpers making large and some making small, but find a way to optimize the numbers so that the helpers can be used in a way that requires fewer helpers. Maybe some helpers can work on both, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the time is limited to 3 hours, so perhaps some helpers can work on large and others on small, but the total time is the same for all.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the helpers don't all have to work the entire time. For example, some could work on large cakes for a certain time and others on small cakes. But that might complicate things, but perhaps it's allowed.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the helpers can work on either type, but each helper can switch between tasks. So perhaps some helpers can make large cakes for a certain time, and then switch to small cakes, or vice versa. But that would complicate the calculation because it's about the total time each helper spends on each task.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a linear programming problem, but since it's a multiple-choice question, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider each helper as being able to contribute either large or small cakes. To find the minimal number of helpers, we can try to find how much each helper can contribute in total, whether it's better to assign helpers to make more of one type than the other.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the concept of equivalent helpers. Let me compute how much each helper contributes in terms of cakes, but considering both types.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express the problem in terms of the number of helpers and calculate the total cakes.\n\nWait, but each helper can only make one type of cake. So perhaps the minimal number of helpers is the sum of the helpers needed for each type.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation gave 11 helpers, and the options don't include 11. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-calculate.\n\nWait for the small cakes: 700 small cakes. Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour. So in 3 hours, 35*3=105 per helper.\n\nNumber of helpers needed for small cakes: 700 /105 = 6.666... So 7 helpers.\n\nFor large cakes: 20 / (2*3) = 20/6 \u22483.333, so 4 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers: 4 +7=11.\n\nBut the options are A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19.\n\n11 is not an option. So perhaps I'm not considering something.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each helper can work on both types, but perhaps in a way that we can have helpers working on both, but only part of the time.\n\nWait, for example, a helper could spend t hours making large cakes and (3 - t) hours making small cakes. Then the number of large cakes that helper contributes would be 2t, and small cakes would be 35*(3 - t).\n\nBut that complicates things, because each helper's time is split between the two tasks.\n\nBut since all helpers are identical, perhaps the optimal solution would be to have all helpers work on one task for some time and the other for the remaining time. But that might not be necessary, but perhaps we can model it to find the minimal number of helpers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that all helpers are assigned to one task or the other, and the minimal number of helpers is the sum of the helpers needed for each task.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, which leads to 11 helpers, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the total work required.\n\nTotal large cakes needed: 20. Each helper can make 2 per hour. So in 3 hours, each helper can make 6.\n\nSo helpers for large cakes: 20 /6 =3.333, so 4 helpers.\n\nTotal small cakes:700. Each helper makes 35 per hour, so 105 per helper in 3 hours.\n\nHelpers for small cakes: 700 /105 =6.666, so 7 helpers.\n\nTotal helpers:4+7=11.\n\nBut since 11 isn't an option, perhaps I need to find a way to have some helpers contribute to both tasks, thus reducing the total number.\n\nHmm, but each helper can't make both types at the same time. So perhaps by having some helpers do both, but in different time periods, we can reduce the total number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the helpers are split between the two tasks in a way that the time is optimally used.\n\nWait, perhaps we can set up equations considering that some helpers make L and others make S.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nLet x = number of helpers making large cakes.\n\nLet y = number of helpers making small cakes.\n\nWe have x + y = total helpers, which we want to minimize.\n\nEach helper making large cakes produces 2 *3=6 cakes.\n\nEach helper making small cakes produces 35 *3 =105 cakes.\n\nSo:\n\n6x >=20\n\n105y >=700\n\nWe can solve for x and y.\n\nFrom 6x >=20:\n\nx >=20/6\u22483.333 \u2192 x=4.\n\nFrom 105y>=700 \u2192 y>=700/105\u22486.666 \u2192y=7.\n\nSo x=4, y=7. Total helpers=11.\n\nBut again, 11 isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for some helpers to work on both tasks, but not for the entire time. For example, some helpers could spend part of the time on large cakes and part on small.\n\nLet me think: Maybe some helpers can make large cakes for a certain time and small cakes for the remaining time.\n\nLet's say that each helper can work on both tasks, but the sum of their time on each task is <=3 hours.\n\nLet me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote t as the time a helper spends on large cakes and (3 \u2013 t) on small cakes.\n\nEach helper can make 2t large cakes and 35(3 \u2013 t) small cakes.\n\nSo, the total large cakes produced would be 2t * x, where x is the number of helpers.\n\nSimilarly, the total small cakes would be 35*(3 \u2013 t)*x.\n\nWe need:\n\n2t * x >=20\n\n35*(3 \u2013 t)*x >=700\n\nWe want to minimize x.\n\nSo, we need to find t and x such that these inequalities are satisfied.\n\nLet me solve for x in terms of t.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx >=20/(2t) \u2192 x>=10/t.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n35*(3 \u2013 t)*x >=700 \u2192 x >=700/(35*(3 \u2013 t)) \u2192 x>=20/(3\u2013t).\n\nSo x must be >= max(10/t, 20/(3 \u2013 t)).\n\nTo minimize x, we can set the two expressions equal: 10/t =20/(3\u2013t).\n\nSolving:\n\n10/t =20/(3\u2013t)\n\nCross multiply: 10(3\u2013t) =20 t \u2192 30 \u201310t=20t \u219230=30t \u2192t=1.\n\nSo when t=1, both expressions give x=10/(1) \u2192 x=10.\n\nWait, so x=10.\n\nSo, if each helper spends t=1 hour on large cakes and (3-1)=2 hours on small cakes, then:\n\nEach helper makes 2*1=2 large cakes and 35*2=70 small cakes.\n\nSo, 10 helpers would make:\n\n10*2=20 large cakes and 10*70=700 small cakes. Exactly meeting the requirements.\n\nSo, with 10 helpers, each working 1 hour on large and 2 on small, we meet the required 20 and 700 cakes.\n\nSo, the minimal number of helpers is 10.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 10.\n\n\nTo determine the number of helpers required, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nEach helper can either make large cakes or small cakes. The goal is to meet the demand of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes within 3 hours. The constraints are:\n\n- Each helper making large cakes produces **2 large cakes per hour**, so in 3 hours, one helper makes **6 large cakes**.\n- Each helper making small cakes produces **35 small cakes per hour**, so in 3 hours, one helper makes **105 small cakes**.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate helpers needed for large cakes\nThe total number of large cakes required is 20. If each helper makes 6 large cakes in 3 hours, the number of helpers needed for large cakes is:\n\\[\nx \\geq \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.333\n\\]\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a helper, we round up to **4 helpers**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate helpers needed for small cakes\nThe total number of small cakes required is 700. If each helper makes 105 small cakes in 3 hours, the number of helpers needed for small cakes is:\n\\[\ny \\geq \\frac{700}{105} \\approx 6.666\n\\]\nAgain, rounding up, we need **7 helpers**.\n\n### Step 3: Total helpers if all helpers are dedicated to one task\nIf helpers are assigned exclusively to one task, the total number of helpers required is:\n\\[\nx + y = 4 + 7 = 11\n\\]\nHowever, 11 is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, we need to explore an alternative approach where helpers can split their time between making large and small cakes.\n\n### Step 4: Optimize helpers by splitting their time\nLet each helper spend \\( t \\) hours making large cakes and \\( (3 - t) \\) hours making small cakes. The number of large cakes produced by one helper is:\n\\[\n2t\n\\]\nThe number of small cakes produced by one helper is:\n\\[\n35(3 - t)\n\\]\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of helpers. The total number of large cakes produced is:\n\\[\n2t \\cdot x \\geq 20\n\\]\nThe total number of small cakes produced is:\n\\[\n35(3 - t) \\cdot x \\geq 700\n\\]\nFrom the first inequality:\n\\[\nx \\geq \\frac{20}{2t} = \\frac{10}{t}\n\\]\nFrom the second inequality:\n\\[\nx \\geq \\frac{700}{35(3 - t)} = \\frac{20}{3 - t}\n\\]\nTo minimize \\( x \\), we set the two expressions equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{t} = \\frac{20}{3 - t}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\\[\n10(3 - t) = 20t \\implies 30 - 10t = 20t \\implies 30 = 30t \\implies t = 1\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( t = 1 \\) into \\( x \\geq \\frac{10}{t} \\):\n\\[\nx \\geq 10\n\\]\nThus, with \\( t = 1 \\), each helper spends 1 hour making large cakes and 2 hours making small cakes. This ensures that:\n- Each helper produces \\( 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\) large cakes.\n- Each helper produces \\( 35 \\cdot 2 = 70 \\) small cakes.\n- For \\( x = 10 \\) helpers:\n  - Total large cakes: \\( 10 \\cdot 2 = 20 \\).\n  - Total small cakes: \\( 10 \\cdot 70 = 700 \\).\n\nThis meets the requirements exactly. Therefore, the minimal number of helpers is **10**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B) 10**",
