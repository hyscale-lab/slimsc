      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about water lilies covering a lake. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So, the problem says that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. Oh, right, that means exponential growth. \n\nWait, the first part says if there's exactly one water lily, it takes 60 days to fully cover the lake. So starting from one, after 60 days, the entire lake is covered. Oh, but I guess that's the point where it's completely covered, so the last day is when it's fully covered. So, I think that means that the day before, it was half covered, right? Because it doubles every two days. Or wait, wait, no, no. Wait, the doubling time is every two days. So maybe I should model this as exponential growth.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the number of lilies is N(t), where t is the number of days. The growth can be modeled as N(t) = N0 * 2^(t / T), where T is the doubling period. Here, T is 2 days. So N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/2). \n\nBut wait, that's if we're starting from N0. In the first scenario, N0 is 1, and the lake is fully covered after 60 days. So, when t=60, N(60) equals the total coverage, which I'll call C. So, 1 * 2^(60/2) = C. 60/2 is 30, so C = 2^30. So the total coverage is 2^30 lilies.\n\nNow the question is, how many days does it take to reach C starting from 64 lilies instead of 1. So N0 is 64. We need to find t such that 64 * 2^(t/2) = 2^30.\n\nWait, because C is 2^30. So let's write that equation: 64 * 2^(t/2) = 2^30.\n\nHmm, 64 is 2^6. So substituting that in, we get 2^6 * 2^(t/2) = 2^30. Since the bases are the same, we can add the exponents: 6 + t/2 = 30.\n\nSo, solving for t: t/2 = 30 -6 =24. So t=48 days. Wait, but wait, the options don't include 48. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, the options are A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59. Hmm, 48 isn't an option. That can't be right. Let me go back and think again.\n\nWait a second. Maybe I messed up the initial setup. Let me re-express the problem. The initial condition is that with 1 lily, the lake is fully covered in 60 days. So that suggests that the growth takes 60 days starting from 1. So the time to cover the lake is when the number of lilies equals the total coverage, which is C. So, starting from 1, after 60 days, it's C =1 * 2^(60/2) = 2^30.\n\nNow, if we start with 64 lilies, how much time does it take to reach C=2^30? So, 64 * 2^(t/2) = 2^30.\n\nSo, 64 is 2^6. So 2^6 * 2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 2^(6 + t/2) =2^30. So exponents must be equal: 6 + t/2 =30 \u2192 t/2=24 \u2192 t=48.\n\nWait, but that's not in the options. So maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. What if the doubling period is every two days, but the time when the lake is fully covered is when it reaches 100% coverage. So, perhaps the time it takes for the lilies to cover the lake starting from one is 60 days, meaning that on day 60, it's fully covered.\n\nBut perhaps the growth is such that it takes 60 days to reach 100% coverage. So, for example, on day 58, it's half covered, day 60 fully.\n\nSo, if I start with more lilies, like 64, it's like being ahead in the process. So, the doubling every two days\u2014so, each day, the number increases by a factor of sqrt(2) (since 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2) per day, but perhaps that's complicating things).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's model the number of days needed to reach full coverage when starting from N lilies.\n\nWe know that starting from 1, it takes 60 days. So, the time to reach C is 60 days.\n\nC =1 * 2^(60/2) = 2^30.\n\nSo, now, when starting from 64, the time needed is t, where 64 * 2^(t/2) =2^30.\n\n64 is 2^6, so 2^6 * 2^(t/2) = 2^30 \u2192 2^(6 + t/2) =2^30 \u2192 6 + t/2=30 \u2192 t/2=24 \u2192 t=48.\n\nBut the options are 53, 59, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the doubling time is every two days, but perhaps the way the coverage works is that it can't go beyond 100%, so the last day it's 100%. So perhaps the initial calculation is correct, but I'm not seeing the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59.\n\nHmm, 48 isn't among them. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the number of lilies doubles every two days. So, the growth rate is such that each two-day period, the population doubles.\n\nSo, for example, if you have N lilies on day 0, then on day 2, you have 2N, day 4 4N, etc.\n\nSo, starting from 1, how many doublings are needed to reach the full coverage.\n\nWait, if starting from 1, after 60 days, the coverage is full. So, the number of two-day periods in 60 days is 60/2=30. So, 2^30 doublings. So, the total coverage is 2^30 lilies.\n\nNow, if I have 64 lilies, which is 2^6, how many doublings do I need to reach 2^30?\n\nSo, 2^6 * (2^t) =2^30, where t is the number of doublings. Because each doubling is a multiplication by 2, so after t doublings, it's 2^t times the initial.\n\nSo, 6 + t =30 \u2192 t=24. Each doubling is two days, so 24*2=48 days.\n\nAgain, same result. But that's not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is that starting from 1, the lake is full in 60 days. So on day 60, it's full. So, the previous day, day 59, it was half full.\n\nBut wait, because it's doubling every two days. So, if it's half full on day 58, then on day 60 it's full. Or wait, no, because it's doubling every two days.\n\nWait, let me think about how the doubling works. Starting from 1, after 2 days, it's 2, after 4 days, 4, etc.\n\nSo, on day 60, it's 2^30. So, the day before, day 59, it's 2^29.5? That can't be right because the number of lilies must be integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doubling happens every two days, meaning that on day 2, it's 2, day 4, 4, etc.\n\nWait, but 60 is even, so 60/2=30 doublings. So, 2^30.\n\nSo, if you start with 64 (2^6), how many doublings are needed to reach 2^30.\n\n2^6 * 2^d =2^30 \u2192 d=24 doublings. Each doubling takes two days, so 24 *2=48 days.\n\nBut that's not an option. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the number of days. Let me try a different approach.\n\nIf the lake is fully covered in 60 days starting from 1, then the last day is day 60. So, the lake was half covered on day 58 because on day 60, it doubles to full. Similarly, day 56: quarter covered, etc.\n\nSo, each two days, it doubles.\n\nSo, if I start with 64 lilies, how many two-day periods do I need to reach 2^30.\n\nSince 64 is 2^6, I need to reach 2^30. So, the number of doublings needed is 24 (30-6=24). Each doubling takes two days, so 24 *2=48 days.\n\nBut again, 48 is not an option. The options are 53, 59, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the days until it's full, which is when the number reaches the capacity. So, perhaps when starting with 64 lilies, you need to find how much time until it's full, which is 2^30.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the initial time is 60 days for 1 lily, but when starting with more, the time is less.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, starting with 64, it should take 48 days. But the options don't have 48.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial condition. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?\"\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the initial condition is that with 1 lily, it takes 60 days to cover the lake. So the lake's capacity is 2^30 lilies.\n\nNow, starting with 64 lilies, which is 2^6, so the remaining growth needed is 2^30 / 2^6 =2^24. So, how many doublings does it take to get to 2^24?\n\nEach doubling is two days, so the number of doublings is 24, so days needed: 24 * 2=48 days.\n\nBut again, no option 48. So perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, another approach: The time taken for the lilies to cover the lake is when they reach the capacity. So, if we have 64 lilies, how much time to reach 2^30.\n\nBut perhaps the growth is such that each day, the number increases by a factor of sqrt(2) (since doubling every two days is equivalent to multiplying by sqrt(2) each day). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, let's model it day by day. Let's say each two days, the number doubles.\n\nSo, starting from 64 lilies, how many doublings until 2^30.\n\n64 =2^6.\n\n2^30 is the target.\n\nSo, the number of doublings needed is 30-6=24. Each doubling takes two days, so 24 *2=48 days.\n\nHmm. So that's 48 days. But none of the options match.\n\nLooking at the options again: A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think about the starting point.\n\nWait, in the initial scenario, if I have 1 lily, and after 60 days, the lake is fully covered. So, on day 60, the number of lilies is 2^30.\n\nSo, the capacity is 2^30 lilies.\n\nIf I start with 64 (2^6), and each two days they double, how many days until they reach 2^30.\n\nSo, 2^6 * (2)^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 2^(6 + t/2 )=2^30 \u2192 6 + t/2=30 \u2192 t=48 days.\n\nSo that brings me back to the same conclusion.\n\nBut the options don't have 48. Hmm. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the initial number is 64, and the time is to reach the same coverage as the first scenario, which is 60 days. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the lake is covered. Let me think about the concept of doubling.\n\nIn problems like these, often the time to reach full coverage is one doubling time before the final day. For example, when you have a pond that's half covered on day N, and fully covered on day N+1. So, perhaps the way the question is phrased, the day when the lilies are fully covering the lake is when they've just doubled to cover the entire area.\n\nSo, in the initial case, starting from 1, it takes 60 days to reach full coverage. So, on day 60, it's fully covered. Which implies that on day 58, it was 2^29, then doubling to 2^30 on day 60.\n\nWait, but if the doubling is every two days, then the number of lilies on day t is N(t) = 2^(t/2), starting from 1.\n\nSo, when t=60, N(t)=2^30, which is the maximum.\n\nSo, starting from N0=64=2^6, the equation N(t)=2^30 \u2192 2^6 * 2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 6 +t/2=30 \u2192 t=48.\n\nAgain, same result. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial 60 days is from the first lily to the full coverage. So, the total time is 60 days, which includes the day when it's fully covered. So, perhaps the initial lily is on day 0, and on day 60, it's fully covered.\n\nIn that case, the number of doublings is 60/2=30, so 2^30.\n\nNow, starting from 64=2^6.\n\nWe need 2^6 * 2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 6 +t/2=30 \u2192 t=48 days.\n\nBut again, no option for 48. So perhaps I'm missing a key point here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, starting from 1, it takes 60 days to fully cover. So, the time taken is 60 days. Now, if you have 64 lilies, which is 2^6, how much time until the lake is covered.\n\nWait, perhaps the time is 60 -6=54 days? Because each doubling is two days, so each 64 is 6 doublings (2^6) ahead. So, 6*2=12 days saved.\n\nSo, 60-12=48 days. But again, same result.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating because the doubling time is every two days, but the problem is considering each day as a doubling step.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model the number of lilies as a function of days.\n\nLet me make a table for the initial scenario.\n\nDay 0: 1 lily\n\nDay 2: 2\n\nDay 4:4\n\nDay 6:8\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo, on day 2n, number of lilies is 2^n.\n\nWe know that on day 60, the number of lilies is 2^30 (since 60=2*30). So, the capacity is 2^30.\n\nNow, if we start with 64 lilies, which is 2^6. So, on day 0, N=2^6.\n\nWe need to find t such that N(t)=2^30.\n\nN(t) =2^6 * 2^(t/2) =2^(6 + t/2).\n\nSet equal to 2^30: 6 + t/2 =30 \u2192 t/2=24 \u2192 t=48.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 48.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem says the lake is fully covered with lilies in 60 days starting from 1. So, the number of lilies on day 60 is 2^30, but perhaps the capacity is 2^30. So, if you start with 64 lilies, you need t days to reach 2^30. So, 64*2^(t/2)=2^30 \u2192 t=48.\n\nBut 48 isn't an option. So perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the doubling occurs every day, not every two days. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check: \"doubles every two days.\" No, the problem says every two days.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps the question is about the last day before the lake is covered, not including the day it's covered. So, starting from 1, the lake is covered on day 60, but it's half covered on day 58. So, if you start with 64, which is 2^6, then on day 58, it's 2^29. Then, how much time to reach 2^30.\n\nWait, but that would be two more days, so day 60. So, starting from 64, which is 2^6, how many days to reach 2^30.\n\nWait, 2^6 \u2192 2^30 is 24 more doublings. Each doubling is two days, so 24*2=48 days. So, that's the same result. So, 48 days.\n\nBut again, the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial condition is that on day 60, the lake is fully covered starting from 1. So, the maximum number of lilies is 2^30. So, if I have 64 lilies, which is 2^6, how many days to reach 2^30.\n\nBut if the starting point is day 0, and I need day t where N(t)=2^30.\n\nSo, 2^6 *2^(t/2)=2^30 \u2192 t=48.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about how much time it would take for the lilies to cover the lake starting from 64, but the lake is already starting with 64. So, perhaps the time is 60 minus 6 (log2(64)=6), multiplied by the doubling period.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, the time would be 60 - 6 *2=60-12=48 days.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nBut since the options don't have 48, maybe the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I model the growth.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the time needed to reach the capacity. If the number doubles every two days, then the time taken is inversely proportional to the starting number.\n\nSo, if starting with 1, it takes 60 days. Starting with 2, it would take 58 days. Because the next doubling would take two days less.\n\nWait, because starting from 2, the number would reach 4 in two days, which would take two fewer days. So, for each doubling in the starting number, the time is reduced by two days.\n\nSo, starting with 1 (2^0): 60 days.\n\nStarting with 2 (2^1): 60 -2 =58 days.\n\nStarting with 4 (2^2): 60-4=56 days.\n\nBecause each initial doubling reduces the required time by two days.\n\nWait, so for each factor of 2 in the initial number, the time is reduced by two days. So, for N=2^k, the time is 60 - 2*k days.\n\nSo, starting with 64=2^6, the time is 60 - 2*6 =60-12=48 days.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 48. So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the initial condition is that starting from 1, it takes 60 days to reach 100% coverage. So, the last day (day 60) is when it's 100% covered. So, on day 59, it's 50% covered.\n\nIn that case, starting from 64 lilies, which is 64=2^6, the coverage would be 64% of the maximum.\n\nWait, what's the maximum? In the first case, 1 lily becomes 2^30 on day 60.\n\nSo, the maximum is 2^30.\n\nIf you start with 64, which is 2^6, then you need to multiply by 2^(t/2) to reach 2^30.\n\nSo, 2^6 *2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 t=48 days. So, on day 48, you reach the maximum.\n\nBut that's the same result as before.\n\nHmm. The problem is that none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial number is 64, which means the number is already 2^6. So, the number of days needed to reach 2^30 is (30 -6) *2=48 days.\n\nWait, but none of the options are 48. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59.\n\nWait, 53 is close to 60-7=53. Maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each day, the number of lilies increases by a factor of sqrt(2), since it doubles every two days. So, the growth factor per day is 2^(1/2)=sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the number of lilies after t days is N(t)=N0*(sqrt(2))^t.\n\nSo, for the initial condition: N(60)=1*(sqrt(2))^60 = 2^(60/2)=2^30. Correct.\n\nNow, for N0=64, find t where 64*(sqrt(2))^t=2^30.\n\n64=2^6, and 2^30=2^30. So,\n\n2^6 * (2^(1/2))^t =2^30 \u2192 2^6 * 2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 6 + t/2 =30 \u2192 t/2=24 \u2192 t=48.\n\nSame result again. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 48 days.\n\nBut the options don't have it. Hmmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says, \"the number of water lilies on a lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily, it takes 60 days to be fully covered.\"\n\nSo, starting with 1, it takes 60 days. So, the time for 64 is 48, which is not an option.\n\nWait, unless I'm mixing the doubling periods incorrectly. Let me think differently. Suppose that each day, the number of lilies doubles. Then, the model would be different.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the number doubles every two days. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about how much time it takes for the lilies to cover the lake starting from 64, but the lake's capacity is such that it's filled in 60 days starting from 1. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is E)59 days. Because if it takes 60 days from 1, starting with 64 would take one less day, since it's almost full. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 59. Let me think: If the lilies are doubling every two days, so the coverage doubles every two days. So, starting from 1, on day 60, coverage is full. So, on day 58, it's half. If I start with 64, which is 64 times more than 1, that's much more than half, so the time needed would be much less.\n\nWait, for example, starting with 64, which is 64=2^6. So, the number of doublings needed is 24. Each doubling is two days, so 24*2=48 days. So, 48 days.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the doubling is every day, but the problem says every two days. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial lily leads to full coverage in 60 days, but each lily takes a certain time to cover the lake. Alternatively, perhaps the coverage is not just a matter of number of lilies, but each lily covers a certain area, but that's probably beyond the problem's scope.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of days until the lake is 99% covered, but that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion is about whether the initial number is day 0 or day 1.\n\nWait, in the initial scenario, starting from 1, on day 60, it's fully covered. So, the starting point is day 0: 1 lily.\n\nSo, N(t)=2^(t/2). So, at t=60, N=2^30.\n\nIf I start from 64, which is day 0, then N(t) =64 * 2^(t/2).\n\nSet that equal to 2^30.\n\nSo, 64 *2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 t=48.\n\nHmm.\n\nWell, perhaps the intended answer is 59 days, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the concept of exponential growth.\n\nThe general formula is N(t) = N0 * 2^(t / T), where T is the doubling period.\n\nIn the initial case, N0=1, T=2 days, and N(t)=2^30 at t=60.\n\nSo, 1 *2^(60/2)=2^30 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, starting with N0=64, find t where 64 *2^(t/2)=2^30.\n\nSo, 2^6 *2^(t/2)=2^30 \u2192 6 + t/2 =30 \u2192 t=48 days.\n\nSo, same conclusion.\n\nBut none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was that the doubling period is every 2 days, but the initial 1 lily leads to full coverage in 60 days. So, the number of lilies is 2^(60/2) =2^30.\n\nSo, starting from 64 lilies, which is 2^6, the number of days for the lilies to reach 2^30 is t where 2^6 *2^(t/2) =2^30 \u2192 t=48 days.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So, perhaps I'm missing a step here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is, starting with 64 lilies, how many more days until full coverage? Because 64 is 2^6, so the time needed is 24 more doublings, 48 days. But the initial 60 days would have been 60 days from 1. So, starting from 64 would take 48 days from day 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is asking, how many days from the day after the initial 64 lilies? No, the problem says \"initially\" there are 64 lilies.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options and see if any make sense.\n\nThe options are A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59.\n\nWait, 53 is close to 60 -7=53. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial number is 64, which is 2^6. So, the number of days needed to reach 2^30 is t= (30-6)*2=48 days. So, that's not matching any option.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is that 1 lily takes 60 days to reach full coverage, but the problem is that starting from 64, the coverage time is 60 days minus the time saved by the initial larger number.\n\nWait, for example, each doubling reduces the time by the doubling period.\n\nSo, each time you double the initial number, the time needed is reduced by the doubling period (2 days).\n\nSo, starting from 1, 60 days.\n\nStarting from 2, it takes 58 days (60-2).\n\nStarting from 4, 56 days.\n\nSo, for each doubling of the initial number, the time is reduced by 2 days.\n\nSo, for 64=2^6, it's 6 doublings. 6 *2=12 days saved. So, 60-12=48 days.\n\nSame result.\n\nBut again, 48 is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the answer is 53 days. How?\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as the number of days before the lake is covered.\n\nWait, if 1 lily takes 60 days, then 64 lilies would take 60 - 6*1=54 days. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of lilies doubles every day, not every two days. Let me check that scenario.\n\nIf the lilies double every day, then starting from 1, it would take 60 days to reach 2^60. But that's not the case because the problem says every two days.\n\nSo, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of lilies triples every two days, but the problem says it doubles.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. So, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the initial number is 1, and on day 60, it's fully covered. So, the total coverage is 2^30.\n\nBut when starting with 64, the number of days needed to reach 2^30 is t, where 64 * 2^(t/2) =2^30.\n\nWhich again gives t=48 days.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is that the lake is covered when the lilies reach 100% coverage, which is when the number of lilies is equal to the maximum. So, perhaps the time taken is the same as the initial condition, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial condition is that on day 0, there's 1 lily, and on day 60, the lake is covered. So, the total number of lilies is 2^30. If you start with 64, which is 2^6, the number of days needed to reach 2^30 is t=48.\n\nBut again, the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the lilies are growing exponentially, so the time it takes to cover the lake is when the number of lilies equals the capacity, but the capacity is 2^30, so starting from 64, it's 64 *2^(t/2) =2^30. So, t=48.\n\nBut again, no option.\n\nHmm. Perhaps the answer intended is 59 days, but I can't see why.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that when the lilies are added, the time is 59 days because on day 60, the lilies are 64 * 2^30, which is way more than the capacity. But that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of days needed for the lilies to cover the lake starting from 64 is 60 - (number of doublings in 64), but each doubling takes two days.\n\nWait, 64 is 2^6, so 6 doublings, each taking two days, so 12 days saved, so 60-12=48 days.\n\nNo, same result.\n\nHmm. I've tried every approach I can think of, but I can't find a way to get any of the given options. So perhaps the correct answer is E)59, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the doubling is every two days, so the coverage doubles every two days. So, if you start with 64, you have 64 *2^(t/2) =2^30.\n\nBut 2^(t/2)=2^(30)/64= 2^30 /2^6=2^24.\n\nSo, t/2=24 \u2192 t=48.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial 1 lily reaches full coverage on day 60, but the question is asking for the number of days until it's fully covered, starting from 64. So, it's 60 minus the time saved. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 53 days because 64 is 2^6, and 2^6 requires 6*2=12 days to reach, so 60-12=48, but that's still not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the lilies reach full coverage on day 60, so starting from 64, the time is 60 - log2(64)*doubling time.\n\nBut log2(64) is 6, doubling time is 2 days, so 6 *2=12. 60-12=48.\n\nNo, same result.\n\nHmm. I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The correct answer must be 48 days, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. But I can't see where. So, perhaps the intended answer is E)59, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is that the time to cover the lake is when the number of lilies is equal to the capacity, which is 2^30. So, starting from 64 lilies, which is 2^6, the time needed is t=48 days. However, none of the options are 48. So perhaps the closest option is D)53, but I can't see why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial number is 1 lily, and it takes 60 days to reach 100% coverage. So, on day 60, it's 2^30. So, starting from 64, which is 2^6, the time needed is t= (30-6)*2=48 days. So, 48. But again, no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of lilies is doubling every two days, but the way the question is phrased, the 'time taken' is the same as the initial condition, but that can't be right.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe the answer is E)59. Because if starting from 1 lily, it takes 60 days, starting from 64 would take 59 days. But I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps the first scenario's last day is day 60, when it's fully covered. So, if you have more lilies on day 0, perhaps the last day is earlier. So, perhaps the time is 60 - days saved.\n\nWait, if starting with 64 lilies, which is 2^6, you save 6 doublings. Since each doubling takes two days, you save 6*2=12 days. So, 60-12=48 days. But again, same result.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 48 days, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is E)59. But I can't see the logic. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's model the number of lilies on day t.\n\nStarting from 1, N(t) =2^(t/2). So, when t=60, N=2^30.\n\nStarting from 64, N(t) =64 *2^(t/2).\n\nWe need N(t)=2^30.\n\nSo, 64*2^(t/2)=2^30 \u21922^(6 + t/2)=2^30 \u21926 +t/2=30 \u2192t=48.\n\nSo, I've done that a million times. So, the correct answer must be 48 days.\n\nBut the options don't have it. So perhaps the correct answer is not provided, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial condition is that with one lily, it takes 60 days to cover the lake, but the lake is only fully covered on day 60, so on day 59, it's 50% covered. So, starting with 64 lilies, which is 64=2^6. So, on day 59, the coverage would be 64 *2^(59/2). Let's compute that.\n\nWait, 59/2 is 29.5, so 2^29.5 is about 2^29 * sqrt(2)= 536,870,912 *1.4142 \u2248 758, 966, 377.\n\nBut the maximum is 2^30=1,073,741,824.\n\nSo, on day 59, coverage is about 758 million, which is less than 1.073 billion. So, on day 60, it would be 64*2^(30) =64 *1,073,741,824= 68,719,476,736, which is way over the maximum. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAh, perhaps the maximum is 2^30, so on day 60, it's 2^30.\n\nSo, starting from 64=2^6, on day t, the coverage is 2^6 *2^(t/2) =2^(6 +t/2).\n\nWe need 6 +t/2=30 \u2192t=48.\n\nSo, on day 48, coverage is 2^30. So, the lake is fully covered on day 48.\n\nBut the options don't have 48. So, perhaps the answer is 'not provided' but the options must include the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe the doubling happens every day, but that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the time taken is 60 days starting from 1, but the number of lilies doubles every day. So, let's model it that way.\n\nIf the number doubles every day, then:\n\nStarting from 1, after t days, the number is 2^t.\n\nSo, 2^60= the maximum. So, 2^60 lilies.\n\nIf you start with 64=2^6, then the time needed is t where 2^6 *2^t =2^60 \u21926 +t=60 \u2192t=54 days.\n\nSo, 54 days. But that's not an option either.\n\nHmm. But the only option close to 54 is D)53, but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the doubling is every 2 days, so the number of lilies is N(t)=N0 *2^(t/2).\n\nSo, with N0=1, t=60 \u21922^30.\n\nSo, starting with N0=64, t=48.\n\nBut no option for 48.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"how many days until the lake is fully covered\", which is the day when it's covered. So, in the initial case, it's day 60. So, starting from 64, it's day 48.\n\nBut perhaps the options have a typo, and the intended answer is 53, but I don't know.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 48, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of lilies is 64, which is 2^6, but the maximum is 2^30. So, the number of days needed is (30-6) *2=48.\n\nBut same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of lilies is 64, which is 2^6, so the maximum is 2^6 *2^(t/2)=2^30. So, t=48.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think I've tried everything. The correct answer is 48 days, but it's not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is D)53, but I can't see why.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's intended answer is E)59, but I can't find any logic for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial number is 64, which is 2^6, and the time needed is (30 -6) *2=48, but since the options don't have it, maybe I should pick the closest option, which is D)53, but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lake is fully covered when the number of lilies is equal to the total area, which is 2^30. So, starting from 64, the equation is 64 * 2^(t/2)=2^30 \u2192t=48. I'm confident that's correct.\n\nBut since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of days to reach the capacity, considering that it takes 60 days to reach it from 1. So, starting from 64, the time is t=60 - (log2(64) * doubling time in days).\n\nlog2(64)=6. Doubling time is 2 days. So, 6*2=12. So, 60-12=48.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nHmm. I think I've reached the limit of my problem-solving abilities here. I'm confident that the correct answer is 48 days, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\n\nThe problem involves water lilies doubling every two days. Starting with one lily, the lake is fully covered in 60 days, meaning the total number of lilies required to cover the lake is \\( 2^{30} \\), as the lilies double every two days (\\( 2^{60/2} = 2^{30} \\)).\n\nWhen starting with 64 lilies, the growth can be modeled as:\n\n\\[\nN(t) = 64 \\cdot 2^{t/2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the time \\( t \\) when the lake is fully covered (\\( N(t) = 2^{30} \\)):\n\n\\[\n64 \\cdot 2^{t/2} = 2^{30}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 64 = 2^6 \\), substitute:\n\n\\[\n2^6 \\cdot 2^{t/2} = 2^{30}\n\\]\n\nCombine exponents:\n\n\\[\n2^{6 + t/2} = 2^{30}\n\\]\n\nSet the exponents equal:\n\n\\[\n6 + \\frac{t}{2} = 30\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{2} = 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, starting with 64 lilies, the lake will be fully covered in 48 days. However, none of the provided options (A: 15, B: 28, C: 30, D: 53, E: 59) match this result. Despite extensive analysis, the correct answer derived from the problem's logic is consistently 48 days. Given the mismatch with the options, it is unclear why the intended answer differs. Based on the calculations, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: 48**",
