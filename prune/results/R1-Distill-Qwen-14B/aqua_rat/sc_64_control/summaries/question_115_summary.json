      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is given as (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.\n\nWait, I remember that sometimes expressions like a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 can be factored into (a + b)\u00b2. Let me see if that works here. So in the numerator, we have n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) + 16. Let me check each term:\n\n- The first term is n squared, which is n\u00b2.\n- The second term is 2\u221an(n +4). Let me expand that a bit. Wait, \u221an times (n +4) would be \u221an * n + \u221an *4, which is n^(3/2) +4\u221an. But multiplied by 2, it becomes 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire numerator as a square of something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the numerator. Let's denote a = n, and b = something. Let me see. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe the middle term can be written as 2ab, so a would be n, and then 2ab would be 2\u221an(n+4). So 2ab = 2n\u221a(n+4). Wait, no, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the entire numerator is (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write the numerator as (\u221an + c)^2, where c is a term that includes the 4 or something.\n\nWait, let's compute (\u221an + d)^2, which is n + 2d\u221an + d\u00b2. Hmm, but our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Oh wait, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I should look for the numerator as (n + something)^2. Let me see.\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me see: n\u00b2 is (n)^2, and 16 is (4)^2. So maybe it's (n + 4)^2 plus something. Because (n+4)^2 is n\u00b2 + 8n +16. Comparing to the numerator, our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So the difference is that instead of +8n, we have +2\u221an(n+4). So maybe the numerator is (n + something)^2, but I'm not seeing it yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (sqrt(n) + something)^2. Let's try that. Let me think: (sqrt(n) + a)^2 = n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. But our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (n + 4)^2 plus something else. Wait, (n+4)^2 is n\u00b2 +8n +16. Our numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. So the numerator is (n+4)^2 minus 8n plus 2\u221an(n+4). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be expressed as (n + 4\u221an +4)^2 divided by something. Wait, because the denominator is (n +4\u221an +4). So perhaps if I can express the numerator as (n +4\u221an +4)^2, then x would be that squared over (n +4\u221an +4), which would simplify to (n +4\u221an +4) itself. But let's check:\n\nCompute (n +4\u221an +4)^2: that's n\u00b2 + 2 *n*(4\u221an) + 2 *n *4 + (4\u221an)^2 + 2*(4\u221an)*4 + 4\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe more accurately: (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.\n\nSo here, a = n, b=4\u221an, c=4.\n\nSo (n +4\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (4\u221an)^2 + 4\u00b2 + 2*n*(4\u221an) + 2*n*4 + 2*(4\u221an)*4.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nn\u00b2 = n\u00b2\n\n(4\u221an)^2 = 16n.\n\n4\u00b2 = 16.\n\n2*n*(4\u221an) = 8 n^(3/2)\n\n2*n*4 = 8n.\n\n2*(4\u221an)*4 = 32\u221an.\n\nSo altogether, (n +4\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nBut the numerator of x is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let's compute that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2\u221an *n + 2\u221an *4 +16.\n\nWhich is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nWait, comparing to (n +4\u221an +4)^2, which has n\u00b2 +16n +16 +8n^(3/2) +8n +32\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator of x is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So that's different from the square of the denominator. So that approach might not work directly.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor numerator and denominator differently. Let me try to see:\n\nNumerator: n^2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator as a perfect square. Let me think: suppose numerator = (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let's expand that.\n\n(n + a\u221an + b)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2a n^(3/2) + (a\u00b2 + 2b) n + 2b a \u221an + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should think of the numerator as (n + something)^2 plus another term. Alternatively, maybe I can write the numerator as (n + 4)^2 plus something.\n\nWait, let me compute numerator and denominator in terms of sqrt(n). Let me set m = sqrt(n), so m\u00b2 = n. Then, the numerator becomes m^4 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, let me compute that: m^4 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16 = m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator becomes m\u00b2 +4m +4, which is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo the expression x becomes [m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator as a product involving (m+2)^2. Let me try polynomial division or factorization.\n\nLet me consider the numerator: m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor it as (m^2 + a m + b)(m^2 + c m + d). Let's see:\n\n(m^2 + a m + b)(m^2 + c m + d) = m^4 + (a+c)m^3 + (ac + b +d) m^2 + (ad + bc) m + b d.\n\nComparing to m^4 +2m^3 +0 m^2 +8m +16.\n\nSo coefficients:\n\n1. a + c = 2\n2. a c + b +d = 0\n3. a d + b c =8\n4. b d =16.\n\nLooking for integers a, c, b, d that fit.\n\nFrom equation 4: possible pairs for (b, d) are (4,4), (2,8), (8,2), (16,1), (1,16), (-4,-4), etc. Let's try b=4, d=4.\n\nThen equation 2: a c +4 +4 = a c +8 =0 \u2192 a c = -8.\n\nEquation 1: a + c =2.\n\nSo solving a + c=2 and a c =-8.\n\nQuadratic equation: t^2 -2 t -8=0.\n\nSolutions: t = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +32)] /2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(36)]/2 = [2\u00b16]/2 \u2192 4 or -2.\n\nSo a=4, c=-2 or a=-2, c=4.\n\nNow, check equation 3: a d + b c = a*4 +4*c =4a +4c=4(a +c)=4*(2)=8. Which matches equation 3, since 8=8. So that works.\n\nSo the numerator factors as (m^2 +4m +4)(m^2 -2m +4).\n\nWait, because a=4, c=-2: so (m^2 +4m +4)(m^2 -2m +4) = (m+2)^2 (m^2 -2m +4).\n\nSo x becomes [ (m+2)^2 (m^2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2 ) = m^2 -2m +4.\n\nSo x simplifies to m\u00b2 - 2m +4.\n\nBut m is sqrt(n), so m\u00b2 is n. So x = n - 2 sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler expression! So x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write that as (sqrt(n) -1)^2 +3? Let me check: (sqrt(n) -1)^2 is n -2\u221an +1, so adding 3 gives n -2\u221an +4, which matches. So x = (sqrt(n)-1)^2 +3.\n\nBut maybe that's not the way to proceed. Alternatively, I can express x in terms of m, where m = sqrt(n), so m ranges from sqrt(36) =6 to sqrt(72) = approximately 8.485.\n\nSo x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4 = (m^2 -2m +1) +3 = (m-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo x is always greater than 3, but we need to find its range when m is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nWait, so m is between 6 and 8.485.\n\nSo x as a function of m is x = (m-1)^2 +3. So this is a parabola in m, opening upwards, with vertex at m=1, x=3. So for m >=6, the function is increasing as m increases.\n\nWait, yes. Because the derivative of (m-1)^2 +3 with respect to m is 2(m-1), which is positive when m>1. So as m increases beyond 1, x increases.\n\nSo when m is at its minimum (6), x is (6-1)^2 +3 = 25 +3=28.\n\nWhen m is maximum (8.485), which is sqrt(72) \u22488.485, x is (8.485 -1)^2 +3 \u2248 (7.485)^2 +3 \u2248 56.03 +3\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. So the possible values of x are between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) 20 <x<54 \u2192 No, because lower bound is 28, and upper is about 59.\n\nB)23<x<58 \u2192 23 is less than 28, so lower bound is okay, but upper bound is 58, but our x can go up to ~59, so this would include up to 58 but not beyond. So B's upper limit might not cover the entire range.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me recheck: when m is maximum (sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)=approximately 8.485), x is (8.485 -1)^2 +3 = (7.485)^2 +3. Calculating 7.485^2: 7^2=49, 0.485^2\u22480.235, and cross terms 2*7*0.485\u22486.79. So 49 +6.79=55.79 +0.235\u224856.025. Then +3 is 59.025. So x max is about 59.03.\n\nSo x can go up to approximately 59.03, which is just over 59. So the upper limit of x is a bit above 59.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x<60. That would cover up to 60, which includes the maximum x of about 59.03. So option D says 28 <x<60.\n\nAlternatively, option C is 25<x<64. So 25 is lower than our minimum x of 28, so 28 is higher. So 28 is the lower bound, so option C is too low on the lower end.\n\nOption B is 23<x<58. Our x can go up to about 59.03, which is more than 58, so option B's upper limit is 58, which is less than x's maximum. So B would exclude x beyond 58. So D is better.\n\nAlternatively, the options given are:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 x can be up to ~59, so this is too low on the upper end.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 x can be higher than 58, so this is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 25 is too low (x starts at 28).\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 correct, because x starts at 28 and goes up to ~59, which is within 60.\n\nE) None of these.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 <x <60. So the answer would be option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the expression to x = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nWe had x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4].\n\nI set m = sqrt(n) \u2192 n = m\u00b2.\n\nThen numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16 \u2192 (m^2)^2 + 2m (m\u00b2 +4) +16 \u2192 m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator: n + 4\u221an +4 \u2192 m\u00b2 +4m +4 \u2192 (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = [m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16] / (m+2)^2.\n\nWe factor the numerator as (m+2)^2 (m^2 -2m +4). So x = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2 \u2192 m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nSo yes, x = m\u00b2 -2m +4, which is (m-1)^2 +3.\n\nSo when m is at 6, x is (6-1)^2 +3=25+3=28.\n\nAt m=8.485, x is (8.485-1)^2 +3 \u22487.485^2 +3\u224856.025+3=59.025.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 yes, because 59.03 is less than 60.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the numerator and denominator\nLet \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = m^2 \\). Substituting \\( m \\) into the expression:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = m^4 + 2m(m^2 + 4) + 16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16.\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = m^2 + 4m + 4 = (m + 2)^2.\n  \\]\n\nThus, the expression for \\( x \\) becomes:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16}{(m + 2)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Factor the numerator\nThe numerator \\( m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16 \\) can be factored as:\n\n\\[\nm^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16 = (m + 2)^2(m^2 - 2m + 4).\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(m + 2)^2(m^2 - 2m + 4)}{(m + 2)^2} = m^2 - 2m + 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( m \\)\nUsing \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), we rewrite \\( x \\) as:\n\n\\[\nx = m^2 - 2m + 4.\n\\]\n\nThis can also be written as:\n\n\\[\nx = (m - 1)^2 + 3.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we find the range of \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{36} \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{72} \\implies 6 \\leq m \\leq 8.485.\n\\]\n\nNow, evaluate \\( x = (m - 1)^2 + 3 \\) at the endpoints of \\( m \\):\n\n- **At \\( m = 6 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  x = (6 - 1)^2 + 3 = 25 + 3 = 28.\n  \\]\n\n- **At \\( m = 8.485 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  x = (8.485 - 1)^2 + 3 \\approx 7.485^2 + 3 \\approx 56.03 + 3 = 59.03.\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from approximately \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the options\nThe options are:\n\n- **A)** \\( 20 < x < 54 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 54 \\).  \n- **B)** \\( 23 < x < 58 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 58 \\).  \n- **C)** \\( 25 < x < 64 \\): Incorrect, as \\( x \\) starts at \\( 28 \\), not \\( 25 \\).  \n- **D)** \\( 28 < x < 60 \\): Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\), which is within this interval.  \n- **E)** \\( \\text{None of these} \\): Incorrect, as option D is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. And then x is defined as this fraction: (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n +4), plus 16) all over (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. The question is asking which interval x falls into when n is in that range. The options are A to E, with various ranges given.\n\nAlright, so first, I want to simplify the expression for x. Maybe if I can rewrite it in a simpler form, it'll be easier to analyze how x behaves as n changes between 36 and 72.\n\nLooking at the numerator and denominator, I notice that both have terms involving n and sqrt(n). Maybe I can factor or simplify the expression. Let me write it out again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nHmm. The numerator looks like a quadratic expression. Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as a square of something. Let me check.\n\nLet me see: Let's suppose the numerator is (a + b)^2. Expanding that would give a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Comparing that to the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 is a\u00b2, so a would be sqrt(n\u00b2) which is n. Then 2ab would be 2\u221an(n+4). So 2ab = 2n * something. Wait, that's not matching directly. Alternatively, perhaps a is n and b is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + c\u221an + d)^2. Let's try expanding that:\n\n(n + c\u221an +d)^2 = n\u00b2 + 2c n^(3/2) + (c\u00b2 + 2d) n + 2c d \u221an + d\u00b2.\n\nWait, comparing to the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me expand 2\u221an(n+4): that's 2\u221an * n + 2\u221an *4 = 2n^(3/2) + 8\u221an.\n\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16.\n\nSo trying to match this to (n + c\u221an +d)^2:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2c n^(3/2) + (c\u00b2 + 2d) n + 2c d \u221an + d\u00b2.\n\nComparing term by term:\n\nn\u00b2 is same.\n\n2c n^(3/2) : Our numerator has 2n^(3/2), so 2c = 2 \u2192 c=1.\n\nNext term: (c\u00b2 + 2d) n: So here, our numerator has no term with just n, so the coefficient must be zero.\n\nc\u00b2 + 2d = 0. Since c=1, 1 + 2d=0 \u2192 d= -1/2.\n\nThen, the next term is 2c d \u221an. Since c=1 and d=-1/2, this becomes 2*(1)*(-1/2) \u221an = -\u221an.\n\nBut our numerator has +8\u221an. So that's a problem. Because in our expansion, this term would be negative, but in the numerator, it's positive 8\u221an. So that approach might not work.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Perhaps it's a perfect square but with different terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be factored as (n + a\u221an + b)(n + c\u221an + d). Let's try that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is a square of something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to factor, I can substitute m = sqrt(n). Let's see if that helps.\n\nLet m = sqrt(n). Then n = m\u00b2. So let's rewrite x in terms of m.\n\nSubstituting into numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 = (m\u00b2)^2 = m^4.\n\n2\u221an(n +4) = 2m(m\u00b2 +4) = 2m^3 +8m.\n\n16 is 16.\n\nSo numerator becomes m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = m\u00b2 +4m +4.\n\nHmm, denominator is m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m +2)^2.\n\nSo denominator is (m +2)^2.\n\nNow numerator is m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16. Let me see if that can be factored or written as something squared.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (m\u00b2 + a m + b)^2. Let's expand that:\n\n(m\u00b2 + a m + b)^2 = m^4 + 2a m^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) m\u00b2 + 2ab m + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to the numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +0 m\u00b2 +8m +16.\n\nSo equate coefficients:\n\n2a = 2 \u2192 a=1.\n\na\u00b2 +2b = 0 \u2192 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 b= -0.5.\n\nThen next term: 2ab m = 2*1*(-0.5) m = -m.\n\nBut the numerator has +8m, so this doesn't match. Hmm, so that approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the numerator can be split into two parts that can be factored.\n\nLooking at numerator m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nLet me try grouping terms:\n\n(m^4 + 2m^3) + (8m +16) = m^3(m +2) + 8(m +2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2).\n\nWait, that's interesting. Wait, m^3 +8 is (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4). Oh, so,\n\nNumerator becomes (m+2)(m^3 +8) = (m+2)*(m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) )= (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-calculate that.\n\nWait, m^3 +8 is (m + 2)(m\u00b2 - 2m +4). So m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16 = (m^3 +8)(m +2) = (m+2)(m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo that's (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nSo numerator is (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4).\n\nDenominator is (m+2)^2.\n\nSo x = numerator / denominator = [ (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4) ] / (m+2)^2 ) ] = m\u00b2 -2m +4.\n\nOh! That's a great simplification.\n\nSo x simplifies to m^2 - 2m +4.\n\nBut wait, m is sqrt(n), so m = sqrt(n). So x becomes (sqrt(n))^2 - 2 sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2 sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, that's even simpler: x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWow, okay, that's much easier to handle. So now, we can express x in terms of n as x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72, inclusive.\n\nSo we need to find the minimum and maximum values of x in this interval.\n\nGiven that x = n - 2\u221an +4, and n is from 36 to72.\n\nBut wait, since n is between 36 and72, sqrt(n) is between 6 and sqrt(72). Let me compute sqrt(72). 72 is 36*2, so sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= ~8.485.\n\nSo sqrt(n) is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nLet me think of x as a function of n, f(n) = n - 2\u221an +4. We need to find the range of f(n) when n \u2208 [36,72].\n\nSince f(n) is a function of n, which is a variable in a given interval, I can analyze how f(n) behaves in that interval.\n\nFirst, let's see if f(n) is increasing or decreasing. To find that, take the derivative of f(n) with respect to n.\n\nBut wait, since f(n)=n - 2\u221an +4, the derivative f\u2019(n) would be 1 - (2)/(2\u221an) ) = 1 - (1)/\u221an.\n\nSimplify: f\u2019(n) = 1 - 1/(\u221an).\n\nNow, for n \u226536, sqrt(n) \u22656. So 1/sqrt(n) \u22641/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo f\u2019(n) = 1 - (something less than or equal to 0.1667) \u2192 1 - 0.1667 = 0.8333. So f\u2019(n) is positive for all n \u226536. So f(n) is an increasing function in the interval.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When n is 36, sqrt(n)=6, so 1/sqrt(n)=1/6, so f\u2019(36)=1 - 1/6=5/6>0. As n increases, sqrt(n) increases, so 1/sqrt(n) decreases, making f\u2019(n) approach 1 from below. So yes, f\u2019(n) is always positive in [36,72], meaning f(n) is strictly increasing in this interval.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of x is at n=36, and the maximum is at n=72.\n\nSo we can compute x at n=36 and n=72, and that will give us the range.\n\nLet's compute x at n=36:\n\nx =36 - 2*sqrt(36) +4 =36 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nWait, 36-12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So x=28 when n=36.\n\nNow compute x at n=72:\n\nx=72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4.\n\nCompute sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2)= approximately 8.485.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)= 2*8.485\u224816.97.\n\nSo 72 +4 is 76. 76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nWait, let me compute this more accurately.\n\nLet me compute exact value for x at n=72.\n\nx =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 =76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nsqrt(72) = 6\u221a2, exact. So 2*sqrt(72)=12\u221a2.\n\nSo x=76 - 12\u221a2.\n\nWhat's the numerical value of 12\u221a2? Since \u221a2\u22481.4142, 12*1.4142\u224816.9704.\n\nSo 76 -16.9704\u224859.0296.\n\nSo x is approximately 59.03 when n=72.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03 when n is between 36 and72.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA)20 < x <54 \u2192 No, because our x goes up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 Hmm, our x is 28 to ~59.03. So at n=36, x=28>23, and at n=72, x\u224859.03>58. So the upper limit is above 58. So B's upper bound is 58, which is less than 59.03, so x would exceed 58. So B is not correct.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Our x starts at 28, which is above 25, and ends at about 59.03 <64. So x is between 28 and 59.03, which is entirely within 25 and64. So C's range includes all possible x. But wait, the options are about which interval x satisfies. So the correct interval must be a subset of C's, but perhaps C is the correct option because it's the broadest that includes all x.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, let's check each one.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Since the minimum x is 28, which is just a bit above 25, and maximum is about 59, which is way below 64. So all x satisfy 25<x<64. So yes, C is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check other options.\n\nOption D)28 <x <60. Our x is at minimum 28, but sometimes equals 28 when n=36. So x can be as low as 28, so the lower limit is 28. So if the option is 28 <x <60, then x=28 is not included; it's the lower bound. But the question says 36 \u2264n\u226472. So when n=36, x=28 exactly. So x can be equal to 28, which is the lower bound of D, but D says x>28, which excludes 28. So D's lower limit is 28, but x can be 28. So D would not include x=28, which is possible. So D is not correct.\n\nOption B: 23 <x <58. As discussed earlier, x can go up to 59.03, which is above 58. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 includes all x from 28 to ~59. So yes, all x will be in this range.\n\nSo the correct option is C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says x is in the given options. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I substituted n=36, I got x=28. Correct?\n\nYes: 36 -2*6 +4=36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72: 72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)= around 8.485. So 72 +4 is 76, minus 2*8.485=16.97. 76-16.97\u224859.03. So x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x ranges from 28 to ~59.03. So the range is between 28 and about 59.03.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, 28 is above 25, 59.03 <64.\n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 but x can be 28, so D says x>28, which is not the case.\n\nSo x can be as low as 28, so the correct option must include x=28 on the lower end.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 No, since x can be up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 No, x can be up to ~59, which is above 58.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 Yes, 28 is above 25, 59.03 is below 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 No, because x can be 28, which is the lower limit, but D's lower limit is exclusive.\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo option C is the correct one. Because all values of x are between 28 and ~59, which is entirely between 25 and 64.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that x could be as low as 25? Let me check.\n\nx =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nWe can find if x can be 25.\n\nSet x =25: n -2\u221an +4=25 \u2192 n -2\u221an =21.\n\nLet me let m=\u221an \u2192 m^2 -2m =21 \u2192 m\u00b2 -2m -21=0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation: m=(2\u00b1sqrt(4 +84))/2 \u2192 (2\u00b1sqrt(88))/2 \u2192 sqrt(88)=2*sqrt(22)=~9.38.\n\nSo m=(2+9.38)/2 \u224811.38/2\u22485.69. Or m=(2-9.38)/2, which is negative, so irrelevant.\n\nSo m\u22485.69 \u2192 n\u2248m\u00b2\u224832.39. But our n starts at 36. So when n=36, x=28 which is already higher than 25. So x cannot be less than 28, because it's increasing.\n\nSo the lower limit of x is 28, and the upper limit is approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the correct option is C, because 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is less than the minimum x (28) and 64 is more than the maximum x (59.03). So all x's are within option C.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\). The expression is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Expression\nLet \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = m^2 \\). Substituting into the numerator and denominator:\n\n- **Numerator**:  \n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16.\n  \\]\n\n- **Denominator**:  \n  \\[\n  n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = m^2 + 4m + 4 = (m + 2)^2.\n  \\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16}{(m + 2)^2}.\n\\]\n\nFactoring the numerator:\n\n\\[\nm^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16 = (m + 2)^2(m^2 - 2m + 4).\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = m^2 - 2m + 4.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), we calculate the corresponding range of \\( x \\).\n\n1. **Minimum \\( x \\)**:  \n   At \\( n = 36 \\),  \n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 2\\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Maximum \\( x \\)**:  \n   At \\( n = 72 \\),  \n   \\[\n   x = 72 - 2\\sqrt{72} + 4.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.485 \\),  \n   \\[\n   x \\approx 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03.\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from approximately \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n- **Option A**: \\( 20 < x < 54 \\)  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 54 \\).\n\n- **Option B**: \\( 23 < x < 58 \\)  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) exceeds \\( 58 \\).\n\n- **Option C**: \\( 25 < x < 64 \\)  \n  Correct, as \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\), which lies entirely within this interval.\n\n- **Option D**: \\( 28 < x < 60 \\)  \n  Incorrect, as \\( x \\) can equal \\( 28 \\), which is excluded by this option.\n\n- **Option E**: \\( \\text{None of these} \\)  \n  Incorrect, as Option C is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\\]",
