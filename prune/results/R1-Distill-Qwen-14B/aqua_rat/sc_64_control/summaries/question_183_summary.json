      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the missing part is. Let me read it again. The equation is written as a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) equals something, and that something should be equal to (a - b) squared. The question mark is in place of that missing something, and I have to choose the correct option from A to E.\n\nHmm, let me write down the equation to make it clearer. So,\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2 / (a + b)\u00b2] = ?\n\nAnd that equals (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, no, the equation is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) equals the question mark, and that equals (a - b)\u00b2. Or maybe the equation is a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] equals (a - b)\u00b2, and I'm supposed to find what's in the middle? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: What should come in place of the question mark (?) in each of the following questions? So, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nOh, right, so the structure is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) times the question mark equals (a - b) squared. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written as a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] = ?, and that equals (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me read it again.\n\nThe equation given is: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the question mark is part of the left-hand side. So maybe the expression is a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared] multiplied by something, which equals (a - b) squared. Alternatively, perhaps it's a\u00b2 minus [ b\u00b2/(a + b) squared ] multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b) squared.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is a\u00b2 minus [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ] equals the question mark, which is then supposed to be equal to (a - b)\u00b2. So the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] = (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, but that can't be, because I can compute both sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 minus [ b\u00b2/( (a + b)^2 ) ] times the question mark equals (a - b)^2. Or perhaps the question mark is in the numerator or denominator somewhere. Hmm, maybe I need to parse the equation correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] equals the question mark, and that equals (a - b)^2. So the question is asking what should replace the '?' such that a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = (a - b)^2? Or maybe the equation is a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b)^2. Hmm, perhaps the original equation is written as a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] * ? = (a - b)\u00b2. So we have to find the value of ? that makes this equation hold.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So the equation is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b)^2. So, let's write that as:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) * ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nWe need to find the value of ? such that this equation is true.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for ?. Let's move the second term to the other side. So,\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) * ?.\n\nSo, compute a\u00b2 minus (a - b)^2 on the left side. Let me expand (a - b)^2: it's a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So,\n\na\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) = (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) * ?.\n\nSimplify the left side: a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 + 2ab - b\u00b2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) * ?.\n\nLet me factor the left side: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\nb(2a - b) = (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) * ?.\n\nI can rearrange to solve for ?:\n\n? = [b(2a - b)] / [ (b\u00b2 / (a + b)^2) ) ]\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n? = [b(2a - b) * (a + b)^2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe b in the numerator and b\u00b2 in denominator gives 1/b.\n\nSo:\n\n? = (2a - b) * (a + b)^2 / b.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option that looks like this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\nA) (a + b)(a - b)\nB) (a - b)^2\nC) (a + b)^2\nD) a\u00b3 + b\u00b3\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm, none of the options match what I have here. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the original equation. Let me re-examine that. The question says: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 ] equals (a - b)\u00b2. So, the question is asking what is the value of a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 ].\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as: What should come in place of the question mark in the equation a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is written as (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 equals (a - b)\u00b2 times the question mark. Or maybe the question mark is in the numerator or denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is (a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 ]) equals (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark. So, perhaps the equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ]) = (a - b)^2 * ?.\n\nWhich would mean that the question mark is the factor that when multiplied by (a - b)^2 gives a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nWait, that might be a better way to look at it. Let me try that approach. So, the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = (a - b)^2 * ?.\n\nThen, solving for ?, we have:\n\n? = [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 )] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2.\n\nLet me write a\u00b2 as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2 so that I can combine the terms.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, but expanding a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 is a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator.\n\nLet me see: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the numerator:\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nExpanding (a + b)^2 gives a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) - b\u00b2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the numerator as a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2. Let me factor this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 = [a(a + b)]^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares, so it factors into [a(a + b) + b][a(a + b) - b].\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: a(a + b) + b = a^2 + ab + b = a^2 + ab + b.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute that again.\n\na(a + b) is a\u00b2 + ab.\n\nAdding b: a\u00b2 + ab + b.\n\nHmm, that's not a standard factorization. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire left-hand side expression.\n\nSo,\n\n[a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nExpanding (a + b)^2 gives a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Multiply by a\u00b2: a\u00b2(a\u00b2) = a^4, a\u00b2*(2ab) = 2a^3 b, a\u00b2*(b\u00b2) = a\u00b2 b\u00b2.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can factor this expression.\n\nLet me see if I can group terms:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor by grouping.\n\nGroup the first three terms and the last term:\n\n(a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2) - b^2.\n\nFactor a\u00b2 from the first three terms:\n\na\u00b2(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2.\n\nBut a^2 + 2ab + b^2 is (a + b)^2, so:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the numerator we started with. Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the entire left-hand side of the equation:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, when we divide by (a - b)^2, we get:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2 / (a - b)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ].\n\nHmm, but this seems too complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try a different tactic.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side and the right-hand side separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the original question is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] = (a - b)\u00b2 * ?. So, if I compute the left side minus the right side, it should be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] and see if it can be expressed as (a - b)^2 multiplied by one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute (a - b)^2 and see if it relates to the left-hand side.\n\n(a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = (a - b)^2 * ?. So,\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) * ?.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] - (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) * ? = 0.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to solve for ?.\n\nSo,\n\n? = [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)^2.\n\nLet me write this as a common denominator:\n\n= [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the entire expression for ? becomes:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ) / (a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator.\n\nLet me see:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 = [a (a + b)]^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [ a(a + b) ]^2 - [b]^2.\n\nSo, this factors into [ a(a + b) - b ] [ a(a + b) + b ].\n\nCompute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: a(a + b) - b = a\u00b2 + ab - b.\n\nSecond term: a(a + b) + b = a\u00b2 + ab + b.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure that helps. Let me compute each factor:\n\nFactor1 = a\u00b2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nFactor2 = a\u00b2 + ab + b = a(a + b) + b.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write each factor as a(a + b) \u00b1 b.\n\nBut I'm not seeing an obvious cancellation yet. Let me look at the denominator: (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2.\n\nWhich is [(a + b)(a - b)]^2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find a way to relate the numerator to the denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator can be written as [a(a + b)]^2 - b^2. Which is (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b), as I have.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor further. Let me compute the two factors:\n\nFactor1: a\u00b2 + ab - b.\n\nFactor2: a\u00b2 + ab + b.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor these terms.\n\nFactor1: a\u00b2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b. Hmm, not sure.\n\nFactor2: a\u00b2 + ab + b = a(a + b) + b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor Factor1 as (a^2 + ab - b) = a(a + b) - b. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor Factor1 as (a^2 - b) + ab = (a - sqrt(b))(a + sqrt(b)) ) + ab. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor Factor1 as a(a + b) - b = a(a + b) - b = a(a + b) - b*1 = a(a + b) - b*(a + b)/(a +b). No, that might not help.\n\nHmm, maybe I should take a different approach. Let's compute the numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, the denominator is (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = [ (a + b)(a - b) ]^2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nThe numerator is [a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] = a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this as a difference of squares: [a (a + b)]^2 - [b]^2.\n\nWhich is (a(a + b) - b) (a(a + b) + b) = (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm, but I'm not seeing a clear simplification here. Maybe I should compute each factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should plug in some numbers to test. Let me try substituting a=2 and b=1 to see what ? becomes.\n\nSo, with a=2, b=1.\n\nCompute the left-hand side: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\na\u00b2 = 4.\n\nb\u00b2 = 1.\n\n(a + b)^2 = (3)^2=9.\n\nSo, 4 - (1/9) = 4 - 0.111... \u2248 3.888...\n\nNow, compute (a - b)^2 = (1)^2=1.\n\nSo, according to the equation, 3.888... = 1 * ?, so ? \u22483.888..., which is 35/9.\n\nWait, but let's compute what each option gives when multiplied by (a - b)^2=1.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) =3 *1=3. So 3*1=3. So 3\u226035/9. Not matching.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2=1. So 1*1=1. Not matching.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2=9. So 9*1=9. Not matching.\n\nOption D: a\u00b3 +b\u00b3=8+1=9. Again, 9*1=9. Not matching.\n\nSo, none of the options evaluate to 35/9 when a=2, b=1. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in plugging in the values. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen a=2, b=1:\n\na\u00b2=4.\n\nb\u00b2=1.\n\n(a + b)=3, so (a + b)^2=9.\n\nSo, b\u00b2/(a + b)^2=1/9.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ]=4 - (1/9)= (36/9 - 1/9)=35/9.\n\nNow, (a - b)^2=1.\n\nSo, the equation is 35/9=1 * ?. So ?=35/9.\n\nLooking at the options, when a=2 and b=1, none of the options A-D give 35/9 when multiplied by (a - b)^2=1.\n\nSo, the correct answer must be E) None of these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem algebraically again. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = (a - b)^2 * ?.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nLet me represent this as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nFactor numerator as a difference of squares:\n\n[a (a + b) ]^2 - (b)^2 = [a (a + b) - b][a (a + b) + b].\n\nSo numerator factors into (a^2 + ab -b)(a^2 + ab +b).\n\nDenominator is (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the left side becomes:\n\n[(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)] / (a + b)^2.\n\nNow, the entire equation:\n\n[(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)] / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 * ?.\n\nSo, solving for ?, we get:\n\n? = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this.\n\nLet me see if (a^2 + ab - b) can be factored.\n\na^2 + ab - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor out terms.\n\nWait, let me compute (a^2 + ab + b)(a^2 + ab - b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, but I don't see an obvious way to factor this further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for common factors with the denominator.\n\nDenominator is (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo, denominator is a^4 - 2a^2 b^2 + b^4.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can write the numerator as (a^2 + ab)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nWhich is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm. Not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor (a^2 + ab - b) as a(a + b) - b.\n\nBut I don't see a clear way to proceed. Let me think if any of the options can be expressed in terms that would match.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently.\n\nWait, the denominator is (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nThe numerator is [a(a + b)]^2 - b^2 = a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should consider that none of the options fit, so the answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me check another method.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] and see if it can be written in terms of (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nLet me write this as (a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2) / (a + b)^2.\n\nWhich is [ a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nLet me expand a^2 (a + b)^2:\n\na^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSo numerator becomes a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out a^2 from the first three terms:\n\na^2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) - b^2.\n\nWait, a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 is (a + b)^2, so:\n\na^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = (a (a + b) )^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is [a (a + b) - b][a (a + b) + b].\n\nSo,\n\n[ a(a + b) - b ] [ a(a + b) + b ].\n\nWhich is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me think about the denominator again: (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the numerator in a way that would share a common factor with the denominator.\n\nWait, maybe I can write the numerator as (a^2 + ab -b)(a^2 + ab + b) and see if any factors cancel with the denominator.\n\nBut I don't see an immediate cancellation. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (a^2 - b^2) times something.\n\nWait, let me try another substitution. Let a =3, b=1.\n\nCompute the left side: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = 9 - [1/(16)]= 9 - 0.0625=8.9375.\n\n(a - b)^2= (2)^2=4.\n\nSo, 8.9375=4 * ?. So ?=8.9375/4 \u22482.234375.\n\nNow, let's compute each option when multiplied by (a - b)^2=4 to see which one gives 8.9375.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b)=4*2=8. 8 *4=32. No.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2=4. 4*4=16. No.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2=16. 16*4=64. No.\n\nOption D: a\u00b3 +b\u00b3=27 +1=28. 28*4=112. No.\n\nSo none of the options give 8.9375 when multiplied by 4. So the correct answer must be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me verify.\n\na=3, b=1:\n\na\u00b2=9.\n\nb\u00b2=1.\n\na + b=4, so denominator is 16.\n\n9 - 1/16 = (144 -1)/16 = 143/16 \u22488.9375.\n\n(a - b)^2=4.\n\nSo, ?=143/(16 *4)=143/64=2.234375.\n\nNow, check each option:\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b)=4 *2=8. So 8 *4=32. No match.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2=4. 4*4=16. No.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2=16. 16*4=64. No.\n\nOption D: a\u00b3 + b\u00b3=27 +1=28. 28 *4=112. No.\n\nSo again, none of the options fit. So the correct answer is E.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine what should replace the question mark (?) in the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\, ? = (a - b)^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the Equation\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = (a - b)^2 \\cdot ?.\n\\]\n\nHere, the question mark (?) represents the factor that, when multiplied by \\((a - b)^2\\), equals \\(a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}\\). To find ?, we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}}{(a - b)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Numerator\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}.\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms, write \\(a^2\\) with a common denominator of \\((a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = \\frac{a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Expand and Factor the Numerator\nExpand \\(a^2 (a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 (a + b)^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2.\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2.\n\\]\n\nThis can be factored as a difference of squares:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2 = [a^2 (a + b)]^2 - b^2 = [a^2 (a + b) - b][a^2 (a + b) + b].\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Denominator\nThe denominator is:\n\n\\[\n(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine and Simplify\nSubstituting the numerator and denominator into the expression for ?:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{[a^2 (a + b) - b][a^2 (a + b) + b]}{(a + b)^2 (a - b)^2}.\n\\]\n\nThis expression does not simplify to any of the given options (A to D). \n\n### Step 6: Verify with Substitution\nTo confirm, substitute specific values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (e.g., \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 1\\)) and compute both sides of the equation. None of the options match the required value, confirming that the correct answer is **E) None of these**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E}\n\\]",

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem is: a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) equals question mark, and that's equal to (a - b) squared. So, the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] = ? = (a - b)\u00b2. I need to find what comes in place of the question mark from the given options.\n\nHmm, wait, actually, the way it's written, maybe I should parse it again. Oh, no, wait, the question says: (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. So that question mark is in between, like a missing operator. Or maybe it's an equality where the question mark represents a missing expression. Wait, the way it's written could be a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is phrased as: \"What should come in place of the question mark (?) in each of the following questions ? a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?)=(a - b)\u00b2\". Oh, wait, perhaps it's an equation where the question mark is an operator or another term. Wait, but the way it's written, the equation is a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2/(a+b)\u00b2] equals (a - b)\u00b2. But that doesn't make sense because a\u00b2 minus that fraction might not directly give (a - b) squared.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] multiplied by something equals (a - b)^2. Oh wait, maybe the question is structured as (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]) * (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. Or perhaps it's a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals (a - b)^2 multiplied by something. Hmm, not sure, but the way the question is written, I think the equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) equals (something) which equals (a - b)^2. Wait, perhaps the equation is written as (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) times (?) equals (a - b)^2. So, perhaps it's a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b)^2. Then, we have to find what the question mark is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) equals (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark. Hmm, but the way it's written, the question mark is in between, so perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) equals something that's equal to (a - b)^2. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because a\u00b2 minus that fraction might not directly lead to (a - b)^2. So perhaps the question is to find which expression when multiplied by (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) gives (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, maybe I should restructure the equation. Let me try to write it down.\n\nLet me denote the question mark as X. So, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 multiplied by X equals (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]) * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nWe need to solve for X.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) equals X times (a - b)^2. Hmm, but the way the problem is written, the question mark is between a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 and equals (a - b)^2. So perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals (something), which is equal to (a - b)^2. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] is not the same as (a - b)^2. So perhaps the question is to find X such that when you multiply a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] by X, you get (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, X = [(a - b)^2] / [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2].\n\nHmm, that might be complicated, but let's try to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals X, and X equals (a - b)^2. But then, that would mean a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2, which may or may not be true. Let's check.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, compute (a - b)^2: that's a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nSo, a\u00b2 minus [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals (a - b)^2?\n\nWait, let me compute the left-hand side (LHS):\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, does a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equal a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2?\n\nWait, that would require that [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's not generally true. Let me check with specific numbers. Let a = 2, b =1.\n\nCompute LHS: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = 4 - (1/(3)^2) = 4 - 1/9 = 35/9 \u2248 3.888...\n\nRHS: (2 -1)^2 = 1.\n\n35/9 is not equal to 1, so that's not possible. So, that can't be the case. So, the question mark is not (a - b)^2. So, perhaps the equation is that a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] multiplied by X equals (a - b)^2. So, X is [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nSo, let's compute X.\n\nX = (a - b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nLet me compute the denominator first:\n\nDenominator D = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nD = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, because to subtract the fraction, I'll get a common denominator. So,\n\na\u00b2 = a\u00b2 * (a + b)^2 / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nD = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2.\n\nExpand (a + b)^2: a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nThen subtract b\u00b2:\n\nNumerator becomes a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. Let's think again.\n\nWait, let's compute the denominator D: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nWe can write D as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nD = [a\u00b2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure that's helpful. Maybe I should look for a way to factor or simplify the denominator and numerator.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the denominator:\n\nD = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nLet me factor a\u00b2 as [a (a + b) - b (a + b)]? Wait, no, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, think of a\u00b2 as (a + b)(a - b) + b\u00b2? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using a common denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute X as [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nLet me compute this by finding a common denominator.\n\nX = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) / [ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2) / (a + b)^2 ) ]\n\nWhich can be written as X = [ (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) * (a + b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute the denominator in the denominator.\n\nDenominator in the denominator: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, perhaps factor this.\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = [a (a + b)]^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b] = [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nHmm, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps expand it.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 (a + b)^2: a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2.\n\nSubtract b^2: a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nSo, the denominator is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this? Let's see.\n\nLooking for factors, it's a quartic in a, but perhaps it's a quadratic in a\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor it as (a\u00b2 + something)(something else).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's think of the numerator of X.\n\nThe numerator of X is (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) * (a + b)^2.\n\nCompute (a + b)^2: a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by (a^2 - 2ab + b^2):\n\nWait, (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) is (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, the numerator is (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2.\n\nWhich is [(a - b)(a + b)]^2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo, numerator is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nNow, the denominator in X is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nWait, maybe we can factor the denominator:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nLet me see: perhaps factor as a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2.\n\nWhich is a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is again a difference of squares: [a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nWhich simplifies to [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nSo, the denominator is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, X is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 divided by (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor (a^2 - b\u00b2) as (a - b)(a + b). So, the numerator is [(a - b)(a + b)]^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, X = [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, let me see if the denominator factors further.\n\nWait, the denominator is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b). Hmm, perhaps this can be written as [ (a^2 + ab) - b ] [ (a^2 + ab) + b ] = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nBut that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor each term.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to compute X as the ratio of the numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find that the denominator factors into terms involving (a - b) or (a + b). Let me see.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try to compute X as it is.\n\nX = (a - b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute denominator D again.\n\nD = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nWait, because when you have X = (a - b)^2 / [ D ], and D is [ ... ] / (a + b)^2, so dividing by D is multiplying by (a + b)^2 / [ ... ].\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator in the denominator: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nAs before, this is a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this expression.\n\nWait, perhaps factor as (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) as earlier.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a^2 + ab - b) (a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nLet me see if any terms cancel out.\n\nLooking at the denominator factors (a^2 + ab - b) and (a^2 + ab + b), perhaps I can factor them differently, but I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor a^2 + ab - b as a(a + b) - b, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'll try a substitution. Let me set c = a + b. Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of expanding everything, I can find X by considering the options given.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)(a + b)(a - b)\nB)(a - b)^2\nC)(a + b)^2\nD)a^3 + b^3\nE)None of these.\n\nSo, let's compute X using a sample value for a and b to see which option matches.\n\nLet me take a = 2, b = 1.\n\nCompute X.\n\nFirst, compute the denominator D: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\na=2, b=1: a + b =3.\n\nb\u00b2 =1, (a + b)^2=9.\n\nSo, D= 4 - (1/9) = (36 -1)/9 = 35/9.\n\nThen, X is (a - b)^2 / D.\n\n(a - b)^2 = (1)^2=1.\n\nSo, X = 1 / (35/9) )= 9/35.\n\nNow, let's compute each option for a=2, b=1.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) = 3 *1 =3.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2=1.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2=9.\n\nOption D: a^3 + b^3=8+1=9.\n\nSo, X is 9/35 \u22480.257.\n\nNone of the options A-D give 9/35. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, a=2, b=1.\n\nCompute X as:\n\nX = (a - b)^2 / [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2].\n\nWhich is (1)^2 / [4 - (1/9)] = 1/(35/9) = 9/35. That's correct.\n\nNow, the options: None of them is 9/35, so the answer would be E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach the problem algebraically without substituting numbers.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWe have X = [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) ]\n\nLet me simplify the denominator:\n\nD = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\nWe can write the denominator as:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this.\n\nWait, a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2   =   a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ) = a^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b ].\n\nWhich is [a\u00b2 + ab - b][a\u00b2 + ab + b].\n\nSo, X becomes:\n\nX = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + ab - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, let's see if this simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps (a\u00b2 + ab - b) can be factored.\n\nBut I don't see an obvious factorization. Let me try to factor it.\n\na\u00b2 +ab -b = a(a + b) -b = a(a + b) - b(1).\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out a from the first two terms.\n\nBut I don't see a clear way. Alternatively, maybe the numerator and denominator have common factors.\n\nWait, the numerator is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nThe denominator is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm, perhaps (a^2 + ab - b) can be written as (a^2 - b) + ab.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of (a^2 + ab -b) as a^2 + b(a -1). Hmm, no, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps using the substitution method, let me try to see if any of the options match.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are (a + b)(a - b), which is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nLet me see if X equals (a + b)(a - b).\n\nLet me compute X as (a + b)(a - b) and see if it equals the expression we have.\n\nWait, if X = (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nThen, let me check if [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] equals a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\n(a - b)^2 = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ].\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nSo,\n\n= (a - b)(a + b) [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ]\n\n= (a - b)(a + b) [ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)^2 ) ]\n\n= (a - b)(a + b) * [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ) / (a + b)^2 ]\n\n= (a - b) [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ) ] / (a + b )\n\n= (a - b) [ a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 ) ] / (a + b )\n\nHmm, not sure if that simplifies to (a - b)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach isn't leading anywhere. Let me try another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the original equation is not a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] equals (a - b)^2, but that a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] multiplied by something equals (a - b)^2. So, perhaps the question is to find that something.\n\nWait, let me think again about the equation: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (something) = (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, that can't be correct because when I plug in a=2, b=1, a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] =4 - 1/9=35/9, and (a - b)^2=1, which are not equal. So, the equation can't be written as a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (a - b)^2, unless perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is written differently. Perhaps the question is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 equals something, which equals (a - b)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) multiplied by something equals (a - b)^2.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is written as (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) equals (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark.\n\nBut regardless, I think the correct approach is to compute X as [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] and see if it simplifies to any of the given options.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nX = (a - b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ]\n\nAs before, compute denominator D:\n\nD = a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\nAs before.\n\nWe can write the denominator as a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator can be expressed as (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2.\n\nBecause (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / (a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 )\n\nNow, the denominator: a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to see if this can be written as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b), which would then match the earlier factorization.\n\nSo,\n\n(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = [a^2 + ab]^2 - (b)^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich matches the denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified. Let me see.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps the denominator can be written as (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b).\n\nHmm, but I'm not seeing a way to cancel terms here.\n\nWait, perhaps the denominator is a quadratic in (a^2 + ab). Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps in the denominator, (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) = (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich equals a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, X = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / [ (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps think of this as (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / ( (a^2 + ab)^2 - b^2 ).\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification. Let me try to factor the denominator.\n\nWait, the denominator is (a^2 + ab)^2 - (b)^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the denominator as (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) and see if any factors cancel with the numerator.\n\nBut the numerator is (a^2 - b^2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2. So, unless the denominator factors can be expressed in terms of (a - b) or (a + b), which I don't see, there's no immediate cancellation.\n\nSo, perhaps X can't be simplified to any of the given options, so the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the original equation is (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) multiplied by something equals (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, X is [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nWhich, as per substitution, for a=2, b=1, X is9/35, which doesn't match any of the options.\n\nSo, in that case, the correct answer is E.\n\nAnother way: perhaps the problem is written differently, like (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)^2 equals (a - b)^2 times something.\n\nWait, perhaps that's another interpretation.\n\nIf the question is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 * X, then solve for X.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 X.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a - b)(a + b) / (a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nSimplify the first fraction:\n\n= [ (a - b) / (a + b) ] / (a - b)^2.\n\n= [ 1 / (a + b) ] / (a - b).\n\n= 1 / [ (a + b)(a - b) ].\n\n= 1/(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2).\n\nHmm, that's a possibility. So, in that case, X would be 1/(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2).\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this. So again, the answer would be E.\n\nWait, but the original problem states that the question mark is in place of something in the equation. Another possible way is that the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = (something) equals (a - b)^2.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, this is not true in general, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is structured as (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) = (a - b)^2 multiplied by the question mark.\n\nSo, the equation is (a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2]) = (a - b)^2 * X.\n\nThen, X = [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nX = [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ) / (a + b)^2 ] / (a - b)^2.\n\n= [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 ) ]\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\na\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ) - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nAs before.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, denominator is (a + b)^2 (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 ) / (a^2 - b^2 )^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor the numerator.\n\nWait, the numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nLet me try to factor this.\n\nHmm, perhaps group terms:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ) = a^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo, numerator is a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a (a + b)]^2 - (b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n= [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b] = [a^2 + ab - b][a^2 + ab + b].\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / (a^2 - b^2 )^2.\n\nHmm, (a^2 - b^2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = [ (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b) ] / [ (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 ) ]\n\nHmm, not seeing any cancellation here.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator and denominator can be expressed in terms of (a + b) and (a - b).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute for specific values to see the options.\n\nTake a=3, b=1.\n\nCompute X in this scenario.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] =9 - (1/16) = (144 -1)/16=143/16.\n\n(a - b)^2= (2)^2=4.\n\nSo, X = (143/16) /4 = 143/(64) \u2248 2.234.\n\nNow, compute each option at a=3, b=1.\n\nOption A: (3+1)(3-1)=4*2=8.\n\nOption B: (2)^2=4.\n\nOption C: (4)^2=16.\n\nOption D:27 +1=28.\n\nNone of these is 143/64 \u22482.234. So, none of the options A-D match, so the answer is E.\n\nHmm, that's consistent with the earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, the correct answer must be E) None of these.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the expression that replaces the question mark (?) in the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\, ? \\, = (a - b)^2\n\\]\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Interpreting the Equation**:  \n   The equation can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\left(a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}\\right) \\cdot X = (a - b)^2\n   \\]\n   where \\(X\\) is the expression to be determined.\n\n2. **Solving for \\(X\\)**:  \n   Rearranging the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{(a - b)^2}{a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the denominator:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = \\frac{a^2(a + b)^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{(a - b)^2 \\cdot (a + b)^2}{a^2(a + b)^2 - b^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying Further**:  \n   Expanding the numerator and denominator:\n   - Numerator: \\((a - b)^2 \\cdot (a + b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2\\)\n   - Denominator: \\(a^2(a + b)^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2\\)\n\n   Substituting these:\n   \\[\n   X = \\frac{(a^2 - b^2)^2}{a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Testing Specific Values**:  \n   To verify, substitute \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 1\\):\n   - Compute \\(X\\):\n     \\[\n     a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = 4 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{35}{9}, \\quad (a - b)^2 = 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     X = \\frac{1}{\\frac{35}{9}} = \\frac{9}{35} \\approx 0.257\n     \\]\n   - Evaluate the options:\n     - \\(A: (a + b)(a - b) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(B: (a - b)^2 = 1\\)\n     - \\(C: (a + b)^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(D: a^3 + b^3 = 8 + 1 = 9\\)\n   - None of the options match \\(X = \\frac{9}{35}\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since none of the given options match the computed value of \\(X\\), the correct answer is **E) None of these**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E}\n\\]",

The question is about what should replace the question mark in the equation a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. The options are given from A to E, and I need to find the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's write down the equation as it is to visualize it better. So the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 * (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, actually, the way it's written is a bit confusing. It's a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b) squared. So the structure is:\n\na\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ] * (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe I should clarify the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ) * (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nNo, the way it's written, the question mark is in the middle. So probably, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ] multiplied by something equals (a - b) squared.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is: [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ] multiplied by (?) equals (a - b)\u00b2. So the question mark is the factor we need to find.\n\nWait, maybe the correct structure is [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2] multiplied by (?) equals (a - b)\u00b2. So, to solve for the question mark, we can rearrange the equation.\n\nLet me denote the question mark as X. So the equation becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2) * X = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nSo to find X, we can rearrange:\n\nX = (a - b)\u00b2 / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ]\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I need to compute this X.\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to combine these terms into a single fraction. Let's see:\n\nDenominator = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2.\n\nI can write a\u00b2 as a\u00b2 * (a + b)\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2, so that both terms have the same denominator.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)\u00b2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)\u00b2.\n\nSo that would be the denominator of X.\n\nSo X becomes:\n\nX = (a - b)\u00b2 / [ (a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2) / (a + b)^2 ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me compute the denominator's numerator: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nLet me expand a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 first.\n\n(a + b)^2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So multiplying by a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2*(a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2.\n\nSo the denominator becomes a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, that might not be the easiest way to go. Maybe there's a smarter way to factor or simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to factor the denominator's numerator.\n\nWait, the denominator inside the fraction is a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nLet me write this as [a (a + b)]^2 - b^2. Wait, [a(a+b)] squared is a\u00b2(a + b)^2, right? So, that's a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2. Then subtracting b\u00b2:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe we can factor this as a difference of squares.\n\nWait, [a (a + b)]\u00b2 - [b]^2 = (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLet me denote A = a(a + b) = a\u00b2 + a b.\n\nThen A\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (A - b)(A + b) = (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps, but perhaps factoring could help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach to the original equation.\n\nWait, maybe instead of computing X, I can manipulate the original equation differently.\n\nThe equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for X.\n\nLet me move the [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X term to the right and the others to the left:\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nHmm, that's a good approach. Let's compute the left side.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - (a - b)^2.\n\n(a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo a\u00b2 minus that is:\n\na\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - a\u00b2 + 2ab - b\u00b2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo the left side is 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 = [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nSo solving for X:\n\nX = (2ab - b\u00b2) * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2.\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = [b(2a - b) ] * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2.\n\nCancel a b from numerator and denominator:\n\nX = (2a - b) * (a + b)^2 / b.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the rearrangement steps. Let me double-check.\n\nThe original equation: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nI rearranged to: a\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. Then computed a\u00b2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = 2ab - b^2.\n\nSo that's correct. Then moving on, [2ab - b\u00b2] = [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nSo X = [2ab - b\u00b2] * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nX = [b(2a - b)] * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2.\n\nWhich simplifies to (2a - b)(a + b)^2 / b.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match this form. So perhaps I'm missing a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have approached the problem differently. Let me try another way.\n\nThe original equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo let me subtract (a - b)^2 from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nCompute the left side again:\n\na\u00b2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo 2ab - b\u00b2 = (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 * X.\n\nThen, X = (2ab - b\u00b2) * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So X = [b (2a - b) ] * (a + b)^2 / b\u00b2 = (2a - b) (a + b)^2 / b.\n\nHmm, but none of the options A to D match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I set up the problem. Let me read the original question again.\n\nThe problem is: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is different. Maybe it's a\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 ] * X = (a - b)^2, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)^2) multiplied by X equals (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps factor the numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to compute it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the denominator in X can be simplified differently.\n\nX = [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ]\n\nLet me compute the denominator: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ].\n\nLet me get a common denominator for these two terms. So, a\u00b2 can be written as [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, the denominator is a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, perhaps factor the denominator.\n\nWait, denominator's numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor as:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 b + a^2 b\u00b2 - b^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2a b + b^2) - b^2.\n\nWait, a^2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 is (a + b)^2. So,\n\n= a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: [a (a + b)]^2 - [b]^2.\n\nSo, factor as (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: a(a + b) - b = a\u00b2 + a b - b.\n\nSecond term: a(a + b) + b = a\u00b2 + a b + b.\n\nSo denominator's numerator becomes:\n\n( a\u00b2 + a b - b ) ( a\u00b2 + a b + b ).\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps the denominator can be expressed differently. Let me see.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 + a b - b) can be written as a(a + b) - b.\n\nSimilarly, (a\u00b2 + a b + b) is a(a + b) + b.\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 can be expressed as [ (a - b)(a + b) ]^2 = (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be factored more.\n\nWait, let me consider the denominator's factors again.\n\nDenominator's numerator is (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b). Let me denote this as:\n\nLet me let C = a\u00b2 + a b.\n\nThen, the denominator's numerator is (C - b)(C + b) = C^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire expression step by step.\n\nLet me compute the denominator: a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2.\n\nWhich is [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nThe numerator is a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor out a^2:\n\na^2 (a^2 + 2 a b + b^2) - b^2.\n\nWait, a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = (a (a + b))^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a difference of squares: (a (a + b) - b)(a (a + b) + b).\n\nAs we did before.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator's numerator is (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor the denominator's terms.\n\nWait, (a\u00b2 + a b - b) = a(a + b) - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nSimilarly, (a\u00b2 + a b + b) = a(a + b) + b.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe I can write the denominator as (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b).\n\nSimilarly, the numerator is (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2)^2.\n\nWait, (a^2 - b^2)^2 is the numerator.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a^2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a(a + b) - b)(a(a + b) + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps the denominator can be expressed in terms of a^2 - b^2 or something else.\n\nWait, let me think about the denominator again.\n\nDenominator's numerator: a\u00b2 + a b - b = a(a + b) - b.\n\nI can factor out a from the first two terms: a(a + b) - b.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator terms can be compared to the numerator.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me compute the denominator's factors.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 + a b - b) and see if it can be related to (a - b) or (a + b).\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiply and see if it's possible to get a cancellation.\n\nWait, perhaps if I compute (a^2 - b^2)^2 divided by (a^2 + a b - b)(a^2 + a b + b), maybe it simplifies.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2.\n\nDenominator is (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write the denominator as:\n\nLet me denote D = a\u00b2 + a b.\n\nSo denominator becomes (D - b)(D + b) = D^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps factor the denominator:\n\nDenominator = (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2 = [a\u00b2 + a b - b][a\u00b2 + a b + b ].\n\nWait, but that's what we had before.\n\nWait, perhaps comparing numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator is (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2.\n\nDenominator is (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2.\n\nWait, perhaps write (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 as (a(a + b))^2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this fraction:\n\nX = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\n= [ (a^2 - b^2 )^2 ] / [ (a^2 + a b)^2 - b^2 ]\n\nWait, perhaps expand the denominator:\n\n(a\u00b2 + a b)^2 = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2.\n\nSo,\n\nDenominator = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2.\n\nWhich is a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + (a^2 - 1) b^2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the denominator can be written as a^4 + 2 a^3 b + a^2 b^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + (a^2 b^2 - b^2) = a^4 + 2 a^3 b + b^2 (a^2 - 1).\n\nNot helpful, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try plugging in some numbers to see what X would be, and then see which option it matches.\n\nLet me choose specific values for a and b. Let's pick a=2 and b=1.\n\nCompute each part step by step.\n\nCompute the left side: a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] * X.\n\nWe need this to equal (a - b)^2.\n\nSo with a=2, b=1:\n\nLeft side: (2)^2 - [ (1)^2 / (2 + 1)^2 ] * X = 4 - [1/9] X.\n\nRight side: (2 - 1)^2 = 1.\n\nSo equation: 4 - (X/9) = 1.\n\nSolving for X:\n\n4 -1 = X/9 \u2192 3 = X/9 \u2192 X = 27.\n\nNow, let's compute each option with a=2, b=1.\n\nOption A: (a + b)(a - b) = (3)(1) =3 \u2192 3\u226027. So not A.\n\nOption B: (a - b)^2 =1 \u2192 1\u226027. No.\n\nOption C: (a + b)^2= 9 \u2192 9\u226027. No.\n\nOption D: a^3 + b^3=8 +1=9 \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct X in this case is 27, which isn't any of the options A-D. So the answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but I might have made a mistake in setup. Let's double-check the equation.\n\nWait, with a=2, b=1:\n\nThe equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo 4 - [1/9] X = 1 \u2192 4-1 = X/9 \u2192 3= X/9 \u2192 X=27. So if X is 27, which is (2+1)^3 =27, but the options don't have that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is to see whether the options would yield X=27. Since none of the options yield 27, then the answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try another set of values.\n\nLet me take a=3, b=1.\n\nCompute X.\n\nLeft side: 3\u00b2 - [1\u00b2/(3+1)^2] * X =9 - [1/16] X.\n\nRight side: (3-1)^2=4.\n\nEquation:9 - (X/16)=4 \u2192 9-4= X/16 \u21925= X/16 \u2192 X=80.\n\nNow, compute the options with a=3, b=1.\n\nOption A: (3+1)(3-1)=4*2=8\u226080.\n\nOption B: (3-1)^2=4\u226080.\n\nOption C: (3+1)^2=16\u226080.\n\nOption D:3^3 +1^3=27+1=28\u226080.\n\nAgain, X is 80, which isn't any of the options. So again, the answer would be E.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is structured differently. Maybe the question mark is in the numerator: a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2 / ( (a + b)^2 * ? ) ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. So the equation would be a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2 / ( (a + b)^2 * X ) ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nIf that's the case, then the setup is different.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nEquation: a\u00b2 - [ b\u00b2 / ( (a + b)^2 * X ) ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nThen, rearrange to:\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = [ b\u00b2 / ( (a + b)^2 * X ) ].\n\nCompute LHS: a\u00b2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 = [ b\u00b2 ] / [ (a + b)^2 X ].\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b)^2 X:\n\n(2ab - b\u00b2) (a + b)^2 X = b\u00b2.\n\nThen, solve for X:\n\nX = b\u00b2 / [ (2ab - b\u00b2) (a + b)^2 ].\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: b\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: b(2a - b) (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = b\u00b2 / [ b(2a - b)(a + b)^2 ) ] = b / [ (2a - b)(a + b)^2 ) ].\n\nHmm, that's a different expression. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: Let's compute X in terms of the options and see which one gives the correct RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to cross-multiply and see.\n\nThe original equation after setting up is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] ) * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ) ].\n\nWe can compute this.\n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2 ] = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 ].\n\nHmm, perhaps we can factor the denominator.\n\nDenominator inside the brackets: a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b^2.\n\nThat's [a (a + b)]^2 - b^2 = [a(a + b) - b][a(a + b) + b].\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b).\n\nSo,\n\nX = (a - b)^2 (a + b)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rewritten as [(a - b)(a + b)]\u00b2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nWhich is (a\u00b2 - b^2)^2 / [ (a\u00b2 + a b - b)(a\u00b2 + a b + b) ) ].\n\nI'm not seeing a clear way to simplify further. So perhaps the correct answer is E, none of these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is missing something, but given the options, E seems to be the case.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\cdot X = (a - b)^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging to isolate \\(X\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{(a - b)^2}{a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\(a^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2}\\). To combine the terms, we write \\(a^2\\) as \\(\\frac{a^2 (a + b)^2}{(a + b)^2}\\), giving:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = \\frac{a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Expand and Factor the Numerator\nThe numerator of the denominator is \\(a^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\na^2 (a + b)^2 = a^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\na^2 (a + b)^2 - b^2 = a^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2\n\\]\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a^3b + a^2b^2 - b^2 = (a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} = \\frac{(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)}{(a + b)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Back into \\(X\\)\nSubstituting the simplified denominator into \\(X\\):\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{(a - b)^2}{\\frac{(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)}{(a + b)^2}} = \\frac{(a - b)^2 (a + b)^2}{(a^2 + ab - b)(a^2 + ab + b)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Options\nWe compare \\(X\\) with the given options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\((a + b)(a - b)\\) does not match the structure of \\(X\\).\n- **Option B**: \\((a - b)^2\\) does not match.\n- **Option C**: \\((a + b)^2\\) does not match.\n- **Option D**: \\(a^3 + b^3\\) does not match.\n- **Option E**: None of these.\n\n### Step 5: Verification with Specific Values\nTo confirm, we test specific values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

The question is asking what should replace the question mark in the equation: \n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I should read that again. Oh right, the equation is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) multiplied by something equals (a - b) squared. So, it's like a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] \u00d7 ? = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nI think I need to solve for the question mark. Let me write this down to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 \u00d7 ? = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, maybe I misread the order. Let me check the original question again. Oh, the structure is a\u00b2 minus (b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared) equals (a - b) squared, but there's a question mark in place of a part. Oh wait, the question is written as a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?) = (a - b)2. So, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] \u00d7 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. Or maybe the question mark is part of what's being subtracted. Hmm, not entirely sure how it's structured. Maybe the equation is [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2)] \u00d7 ? = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2) multiplied by something equals (a - b)\u00b2. So, the structure is:\n\n(a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2]) \u00d7 ? = (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a\u00b2 minus ( [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] multiplied by ? ) equals (a - b)\u00b2. Either way, I'll need to approach it step by step.\n\nLet me first try to simplify the left side. Let's denote the left-hand side (LHS) as:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)\u00b2] \u00d7 Q = (a - b)\u00b2, where Q is the question mark.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for Q. Let me move all terms except the term with Q to the other side.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 = (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2.\n\nWait, no. If I subtract (a - b)^2 from both sides, but the equation is a\u00b2 minus something equals (a - b)^2. So, perhaps it's better to bring all terms to one side. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute (a - b)^2. That's a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So, the equation is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nNow, subtract a\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n- (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nNow, I can factor the right side:\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo, (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = b(2a - b).\n\nNow, I can solve for Q by multiplying both sides by (a + b)^2 and then dividing by b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\nQ = [b(2a - b) * (a + b)^2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nThe b in numerator and b\u00b2 in denominator gives 1/b. So,\n\nQ = [(2a - b) (a + b)^2 ] / b.\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a common denominator. Let me go back to the original equation:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side:\n\na\u00b2 - (a - b)^2 - [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = 0.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - (a - b)^2. (a - b)^2 is a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2, so subtracting that from a\u00b2 gives 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n2ab - b\u00b2 - [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's 2ab - b\u00b2 = [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2.\n\nWait, that's similar to earlier steps. So, let's factor 2ab - b\u00b2 as b(2a - b), so:\n\nb(2a - b) = (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2.\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b)^2:\n\nb(2a - b)(a + b)^2 = b\u00b2 Q.\n\nNow, divide both sides by b:\n\n(2a - b)(a + b)^2 = b Q.\n\nSo,\n\nQ = [ (2a - b)(a + b)^2 ] / b.\n\nHmm, that's a complex expression. Let me see if I can simplify it further.\n\n(2a - b)(a + b)^2 = (2a - b)(a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2).\n\nExpanding that would give a lot of terms. But looking at the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the equation is:\n\n[ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, let's compute the term in the brackets first.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2].\n\nLet me write them with a common denominator. The denominator is (a + b)^2, so:\n\n= [a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nWait, wait, that's not correct. Actually, a\u00b2 is equal to a\u00b2 * (a + b)^2 / (a + b)^2. So,\n\na\u00b2 = a\u00b2 * (a + b)^2 / (a + b)^2.\n\nThus, a\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] = [ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nBut that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor a\u00b2 as (a + b)(a - b) + something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me try to manipulate the equation.\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 - [b\u00b2/(a + b)^2] \u00d7 Q = (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me subtract a\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n- [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2 - a\u00b2.\n\nCompute the right side: (a - b)^2 - a\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2) - a\u00b2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n- [b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n[b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nFactor the right side: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\n[b\u00b2 Q]/(a + b)^2 = b(2a - b).\n\nDivide both sides by b:\n\n[b Q]/(a + b)^2 = 2a - b.\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b)^2:\n\nb Q = (2a - b)(a + b)^2.\n\nThen, divide both sides by b:\n\nQ = [ (2a - b)(a + b)^2 ] / b.\n\nHmm, that's the same result as before. But looking at the options, A is (a + b)(a - b), B is (a - b)^2, C is (a + b)^2, D is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3, and E is none of these.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Perhaps the question is structured differently. Let me re-examine the original problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?) = (a - b)2.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2. Because the way it's written could be interpreted as (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) divided by (a + b)^2, times ?, equals (a - b)^2.\n\nAh, that could make sense. Let me try this approach.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) as (a - b)(a + b), so:\n\n[(a - b)(a + b)] / (a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nSimplify the left side: (a - b)/(a + b) \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (a - b), assuming a \u2260 b, so:\n\n1/(a + b) \u00d7 ? = (a - b).\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b):\n\n? = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nWhich is (a^2 - b^2), but that's not one of the options. Wait, let's see the options again.\n\nOption A is (a + b)(a - b), which is the same as (a^2 - b^2). So, if that's the case, the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the question mark is (a + b)(a - b), which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the question mark was part of a subtraction, not a multiplication. So maybe the initial setup was wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The way the question is written is: a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2.\n\nSo, perhaps the ? is between the two terms. But I'm getting stuck on the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is structured as [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2/(a + b)^2)] \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nBut in that case, the earlier approach leads to a more complicated expression, which doesn't match any of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the equation.\n\nAlternatively, if the equation is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2, then the answer is A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/( (a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? ) = (a - b)^2.\n\nThen, solving for ? would give a different result. Let me try that.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nSo,\n\n( (a - b)(a + b) ) / [ (a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n(a - b)(a + b) / [ (a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nCancel (a + b) in numerator and denominator: (a - b) / [ (a + b) \u00d7 ? ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (a - b), assuming a \u2260 b:\n\n1/( (a + b) \u00d7 ? ) = (a - b).\n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b) \u00d7 ?:\n\n1 = (a - b)(a + b) \u00d7 ?.\n\nSo,\n\n(a - b)(a + b) \u00d7 ? = 1.\n\nWhich implies that ? = 1 / [ (a - b)(a + b) ) ].\n\nBut that's 1/(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2), which is not any of the options, so E might be the answer.\n\nHmm, I'm getting conflicting results based on how I interpret the equation's structure. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is [a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2.\n\nSo, same as the first approach, which gives Q = [ (2a - b)(a + b)^2 ] / b.\n\nBut none of the options match this, so perhaps the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in my algebra in the first approach. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting again:\n\nWe have a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2.\n\nCompute (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting from a\u00b2, we have:\n\na\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 ] = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSubtract a\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n- (b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n(b\u00b2 Q)/(a + b)^2 = 2ab - b\u00b2.\n\nFactor the right side: 2ab - b\u00b2 = b(2a - b).\n\nSo,\n\n(b\u00b2 Q) = [b(2a - b)] (a + b)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by b\u00b2:\n\nQ = [ b(2a - b) (a + b)^2 ] / b\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nQ = (2a - b)(a + b)^2 / b.\n\nHmm, but none of the options match this. Let me see if any of the options can be transformed into this.\n\nOption A is (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nOption B is (a - b)^2.\n\nOption C is (a + b)^2.\n\nOption D is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3.\n\nOption E is none of these.\n\nSo, since none of the options A to D match this, the correct answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting E, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me see if I can find another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is written as a\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is a\u00b2 minus [ (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 multiplied by ? ] equals (a - b)^2.\n\nIn that case, let's denote Q as the multiplier.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - [ (b\u00b2 Q) / (a + b)^2 ] = (a - b)^2.\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to the same conclusion that Q is (2a - b)(a + b)^2 / b.\n\nWhich again doesn't match any options. So the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should consider another way. Let me try to express the equation as:\n\n[ a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 ] \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nLet me compute the term in the brackets:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2.\n\nCompute this as:\n\n[ a\u00b2 (a + b)^2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nExpanding a\u00b2(a + b)^2: a\u00b2 (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 ) = a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2.\n\nSubtract b\u00b2: a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n[ a^4 + 2a^3 b + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 - b\u00b2 ] / (a + b)^2.\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write a\u00b2 as (a + b - b)^2, but that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about this differently. Let me try to make the equation a bit simpler. Suppose I let a = 2 and b = 1, to test the options.\n\nSo, substituting a=2, b=1:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 \u00d7 ?.\n\nWhich becomes 4 - (1)/(3)^2 \u00d7 ? \u2192 4 - (1/9) \u00d7 ?.\n\nRight side: (2-1)^2 = 1.\n\nSo,\n\n4 - (1/9) \u00d7 ? = 1.\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n- (1/9) \u00d7 ? = -3.\n\nMultiply both sides by -9:\n\n? = 27.\n\nNow, let's see what each option gives when a=2 and b=1.\n\nOption A: (2 +1)(2-1) = 3 *1 =3. \u2192 3. Not 27.\n\nOption B: (2-1)^2=1 \u2192 1.\n\nOption C: (2+1)^2=9 \u21929.\n\nOption D: 2^3+1^3=8+1=9 \u21929.\n\nOption E: None.\n\nBut my calculated ? is 27. None of the options give 27 when a=2 and b=1. So the correct answer would be E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me re-examine the equation with a=2 and b=1.\n\nThe equation is a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 \u00d7 ? = (a - b)^2.\n\nSo with a=2, b=1:\n\n4 - (1)/(3)^2 * ? = (1)^2 \u2192 4 - (1/9)*? = 1.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/9)*? = 4 -1 \u2192 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\n? = 3 *9=27.\n\nSo, the correct ? is 27. Now, let's see which option gives 27 when a=2 and b=1.\n\nOption A: (2+1)(2-1) =3 *1=3 \u21923.\n\nNope.\n\nOption B: (2-1)^2=1.\n\nNo.\n\nOption C: (2+1)^2=9.\n\nNo.\n\nOption D: 2^3 +1^3=8+1=9. No.\n\nThus, none of the options A-D yield 27. So the answer must be E.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\n\nThe problem requires determining the value that should replace the question mark (?) in the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\times ? = (a - b)^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nRewriting the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2 \\cdot ?}{(a + b)^2} = (a - b)^2.\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(a^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{b^2 \\cdot ?}{(a + b)^2} = (a - b)^2 - a^2.\n\\]\n\nExpand \\((a - b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{b^2 \\cdot ?}{(a + b)^2} = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 - a^2 = -2ab + b^2.\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2 \\cdot ?}{(a + b)^2} = 2ab - b^2.\n\\]\n\nFactor the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b^2 \\cdot ?}{(a + b)^2} = b(2a - b).\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\((a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\nb^2 \\cdot ? = b(2a - b)(a + b)^2.\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(b^2\\):\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{(2a - b)(a + b)^2}{b}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the options\nThe derived expression for \\(?\\) is:\n\n\\[\n? = \\frac{(2a - b)(a + b)^2}{b}.\n\\]\n\nThis does not match any of the given options:\n- **A)** \\((a + b)(a - b)\\),\n- **B)** \\((a - b)^2\\),\n- **C)** \\((a + b)^2\\),\n- **D)** \\(a^3 + b^3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Verification with specific values\nTo confirm, substitute \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 1\\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - \\frac{b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\times ? = (a - b)^2.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n4 - \\frac{1}{(3)^2} \\times ? = 1.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n4 - \\frac{?}{9} = 1.\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{?}{9} = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\\]\n\nMultiply by 9:\n\n\\[\n? = 27.\n\\]\n\nNow, evaluate each option with \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 1\\):\n- **A)** \\((2 + 1)(2 - 1) = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\),\n- **B)** \\((2 - 1)^2 = 1\\),\n- **C)** \\((2 + 1)^2 = 9\\),\n- **D)** \\(2^3 + 1^3 = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nNone of the options yield 27, confirming that the correct answer is **E) None of these**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{E}\n\\]",
