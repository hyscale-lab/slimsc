      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular sheet. Let me try to visualize it. The sheet is being folded into two equal halves in two different ways, and each time, the perimeter changes. I need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\nHmm, the problem says that when folded along one set of sides, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. And when folded along the other set, the perimeter is 66 cm. Wait, I should clarify what folding along one set of sides means.\n\nLet me think. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides: length and width. So when you fold it along one set, you're probably folding along the length, making two smaller rectangles each of which has dimensions (width/2) and length. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight.\n\nSuppose the original rectangle has length L and width W. When folded along the length, you divide the width into two parts. So each half would have dimensions L and W/2. Alternatively, if you fold along the width, then each part would have dimensions L/2 and W. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, when you fold along a side, you're bringing two sides together. So if you fold along the length, you cut the sheet along the length, so each part's length becomes half. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let's think again. If you have a rectangle, say, with length L and width W. When you fold it into two equal halves along one set of sides, say, along the length. So each half would have a length of L/2 and the same width W. Because you're folding along the length, meaning you cut the length in half. So each part's dimensions are L/2 by W.\n\nAlternatively, if you fold along the width, then each part would have a width of W/2 and the same length L. So each part is L by W/2.\n\nWait, but wait, when you fold a sheet into two halves, you're essentially halving one of the dimensions. So when folded along the length, the new length is L/2, and the width remains W. So each folded part is L/2 by W. Similarly, when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2.\n\nBut wait, the perimeters when folded are given. So for each case, I can compute the perimeter and set up equations.\n\nLet me try to model this. \n\nCase 1: Folding along the length. Each part is L/2 by W. The perimeter of each part would be 2*( (L/2) + W ). And that's given as 48 cm. So,\n\n2*( (L/2) + W ) = 48\n\nSimplify that: (L/2 + W) * 2 = 48 \u2192 L/2 + W = 24.\n\nWait, that's:\n\n(L/2) + W = 24 \u2192 equation (1).\n\nCase 2: Folding along the width. Each part is L by W/2. The perimeter is 2*( L + ( W/2 ) ) = 66 cm.\n\nSo,\n\n2*( L + W/2 ) = 66 \u2192 L + W/2 = 33 \u2192 equation (2).\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\nEquation (1): (L/2) + W = 24\n\nEquation (2): L + (W/2) = 33\n\nI can solve these two equations to find L and W.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n1. (L/2) + W = 24\n2. L + (W/2) = 33\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:\n\nL + 2W = 48 \u2192 equation 1a.\n\nEquation 2: L + (W/2) =33 \u2192 multiply both sides by 2:\n\n2L + W =66 \u2192 equation 2a.\n\nNow, equation 1a: L + 2W =48\n\nequation 2a: 2L + W =66\n\nI can solve these two equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1a by 2:\n\n2L +4W =96 \u2192 equation 1b.\n\nequation 2a is 2L + W =66.\n\nNow subtract equation 2a from equation 1b:\n\n(2L +4W) - (2L +W) )=96-66 \u2192 \n\n2L +4W -2L -W =30 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nNow plug W=10 into equation 1a: L + 2*10 =48 \u2192 L=48-20=28 cm.\n\nSo the original dimensions are L=28 cm, W=10 cm.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because when you fold along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So L/2 is 14, W is 10. So perimeter is 2*(14+10)=2*24=48 cm. That matches.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each part is L by W/2: 28 by 5. So perimeter is 2*(28+5)=2*33=66 cm. That also matches.\n\nSo the original sheet is 28 cm by 10 cm. Area is L * W =28 *10=280 cm\u00b2. Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misinterpreted the way the sheet is folded. Maybe when you fold the sheet into two equal halves along one set of sides, you're not just halving one dimension, but perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet, which is a single part. Wait, the problem says when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I got the description wrong. When you fold along one set of sides, each half has a perimeter of 48 cm. When you fold along the other set, each half has a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, but in either case, each half is a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, but perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me try to think again.\n\nSuppose the original rectangle is L by W.\n\nCase 1: Folding along the length. So the sheet is folded along the length, which is the longer side. Wait, no, the length could be either way, but perhaps I should think in terms of the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps folding along one set of sides means that you fold along the length, which would mean that each half has a width of W/2. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you fold along one set of sides, the resulting shape is a rectangle where the perimeter is calculated as such.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the sides.\n\nSo, when you fold along the length (i.e., the side with length L), each half has dimensions (L/2) by W. So the perimeter is 2*( L/2 + W )= L + 2W.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So equation 1: L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when you fold along the width, each half is L by (W/2). So the perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )= 2L + W.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =66.\n\nSo yeah, the equations are correct.\n\nSo solving them gives L=28, W=10. Area is 280 cm\u00b2. But none of the options match that. So I must have messed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe sheet is folded into two equal halves. So when folded along one set of sides, each part's perimeter is 48 cm. When folded along the other set, each part's perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in perimeters.\n\nWait, when you fold along the length, each part has perimeter 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W. Which is 48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each part has perimeter 2*( L + (W/2) )=2L + W, which is 66.\n\nSo equations are correct.\n\nBut since the options are all in the thousands, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait, wait, the perimeters are given in cm, but perhaps the area is in cm\u00b2, but the options are given without units. But that's not the issue, because 280 is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I've flipped the equations. Maybe when folding along the length, the perimeter is 66, and along the width, it's 48. Let me check.\n\nBecause perhaps I confused the two cases. Let me redo the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's suppose when you fold along the length (halving the length), each part's perimeter is 66 cm, and when you fold along the width, each part's perimeter is 48 cm.\n\nSo equation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =48.\n\nWait, let's solve these.\n\nEquation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W =48.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for L: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66-2W) + W =48 \u2192 132 -4W + W=48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 -3W= -84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L =66-2*28=66-56=10.\n\nSo dimensions would be L=10, W=28. So area is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2 again. Same result.\n\nNo, that's still 280, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm. Did I perhaps make a mistake in identifying which sides are being folded?\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe when the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the perimeter is of the folded sheet, not each half.\n\nWait, the question says: \"... had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread this. It says when folded, each part (each half) has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 when folded along the other. So perhaps each half's perimeter is 48 or 66.\n\nWait, but earlier calculations give area 280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should think that the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a whole, not each half.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet along one set of sides, the entire perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm. Similarly, when folded along the other set, it's 66 cm.\n\nWait, that would make more sense because maybe the perimeters would be larger.\n\nWait, but when you fold a sheet into two halves, how is the perimeter calculated?\n\nFor example, if you have a rectangle L x W and fold it along the length, you're creating a new shape. But wait, in reality, when you fold a sheet into two equal halves, the resulting shape is a smaller rectangle, but it's not clear if the perimeter is being considered as the sum of all edges, including the folded edge.\n\nWait, but perhaps the perimeter of the folded sheet (which is one half) is 48 cm, and when folded the other way, the perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWait, let's model it that way.\n\nSo folding along the length: each part is L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W =48.\n\nFolding along the width: each part is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) ) = 2L + W =66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nWhich again gives L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters include the folded edge. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet into two equal parts, the folded edge is internal, not contributing to the perimeter. So for the perimeter, you just have the outer edges.\n\nWait, no, because when you fold a sheet along, say, the length, each half has dimensions L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ) as before. So the setup is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think in terms of the original sheet's perimeters when folded, not the individual halves.\n\nWait, no, the question says when folded into two equal halves, each part has a certain perimeter. So each half is a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the perimeters. Let me think again.\n\nWhen I fold the sheet along the length, each part is L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen I fold along the width, each part is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2 )= 2L + W =66.\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nWait, but the area is 280, which is not an option. So perhaps the initial setup is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the perimeter is the same sheet when folded, meaning the sheet is folded so that the two halves are on top of each other, and the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm in one case and 66 in the other.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the case. Let me think.\n\nWhen you fold a sheet along its length, the new dimensions would be L/2 by W. So the perimeter would be 2*( L/2 + W )= L + 2W.\n\nBut perhaps the sheet is folded such that the two halves are stacked, making the sheet's dimensions remain L and W/2. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W, but the perimeter is of the folded sheet which is now a single rectangle of L/2 by W. So the perimeter is L + 2W =48.\n\nAlternatively, when folded along the width, the sheet becomes a single rectangle of L by W/2. So the perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same equations.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet (both halves together), not each half.\n\nWait, the question says: \"... when folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part ...\"\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet after folding. So when you fold the sheet into two halves along one direction, the resulting shape has a perimeter of 48 cm. Similarly, folding along the other direction gives a perimeter of 66 cm.\n\nWait, but wait, when you fold a sheet into two halves, you're creating a smaller sheet. So the perimeter of the folded sheet (single piece) would be different.\n\nLet me model it this way.\n\nCase 1: Folding along the length. The folded sheet's dimensions are L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nCase 2: Folding along the width. The folded sheet's dimensions are L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W =66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nWait, but again, solving gives L=28, W=10. Area 280, not in the options.\n\nSo I'm stuck. Maybe I should check the options. The options are 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet's perimeters are 48 and 66 when folded, but I think I mixed up the cases.\n\nWait, perhaps when L is folded, the perimeter is 66, and when W is folded, it's 48.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo equation 1: L + 2W =66.\n\nEquation 2: 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192 132-4W +W=48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 -3W= -84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nSo L=66 -2*28=10.\n\nSo dimensions are 10 cm by 28 cm. Area is 280. Still not in options.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Maybe when you fold along the length, you're halving the width, not the length. So when you fold along the length, the width is halved.\n\nWait, that would change the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think is: when you fold along the length (i.e., along the longer side), you're bringing the two width sides together. So each half would have width W/2 and length L. So the perimeter would be 2*(L + (W/2)).\n\nAlternatively, when you fold along the width (the other set of sides), you're bringing the two length sides together. Each half would have length L/2 and width W. Perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W ).\n\nWait, this would change the equations. Let me try that.\n\nCase 1: Fold along length. Each half is L by (W/2). Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2)=2L + W=48.\n\nCase 2: Fold along width. Each half is (L/2) by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)=L + 2W=66.\n\nSo now equation 1: 2L + W =48.\n\nEquation 2: L + 2W =66.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nFrom equation 1: W=48-2L.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: L + 2*(48-2L) =66 \u2192 L +96 -4L=66 \u2192-3L =-30 \u2192 L=10.\n\nThen W=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo dimensions are L=10, W=28 cm. Area is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, but the options are much larger. So perhaps the perimeters given are inches or something else, but the problem states cm. Alternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts each of which has a perimeter that's double what I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet into two equal halves, the total perimeter of both parts is 48 cm. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, the question says \"each part\" has a perimeter. So each half's perimeter is 48 or 66.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I should think that when you fold along one set of sides, the sheet is divided into two parts, but the perimeter of the folded sheet (i.e., the whole sheet folded, not each half) is 48 cm.\n\nWait, if I imagine a sheet of paper and fold it in half along its length, the folded sheet's dimensions would be (L/2) by W, and the perimeter of that folded sheet (which is a single piece) is 2*(L/2 + W)= (L + 2W).\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the dimensions are L by W/2, perimeter 2*(L + W/2)= (2L + W).\n\nSo that brings me back to the original equations. So I think the mistake must be somewhere else.\n\nWait, the problem states the sheet is rectangular. Maybe the rectangles are such that when folded, the perimeters are as given.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the sheet as being folded so that the dimension along the folding direction is halved. So for example, when folded along the length, the new length is L/2, but the width remains W. So each half is L/2 by W.\n\nBut maybe the perimeter is calculated as 2*(L/2 + W), which is L + 2W=48.\n\nAlternatively, when folded along the width, the new width is W/2, so the perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nThus, same equations again. So I'm going in circles.\n\nWait, maybe the original sheet's area is 280. But the options don't have that. Did I make a mistake in setting up the equations? Or perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeter is for the folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal parts, and the perimeter of the folded sheet is 48 cm. So when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 280. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe when you fold the sheet into two equal parts along the length, each part's perimeter is 48, but when you fold along the width, the two parts have a combined perimeter of 66.\n\nNo, that seems unlikely. The question says each part has a perimeter when folded along each set.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire sheet when folded, but the way I calculated was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter includes both the outer edge and the folded edge. Wait, no, because the folded edge is internal when folded.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded along the length, so each half is L/2 by W. But the perimeter of each half would include two sides of L/2 and two sides of W.\n\nSo perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded twice to form two parts, but how? I'm getting stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations correctly.\n\nLet me denote the original length as L and width as W.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W.\n\nThus, perimeter of each part is 2*( (L/2) + W ) = L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is L by (W/2).\n\nPerimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )=2L + W=66.\n\nSo two equations:\n\n1. L + 2W =48.\n\n2. 2L + W =66.\n\nLet me solve these.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 2L +4W=96.\n\nSubtract equation 2: (2L +4W) - (2L + W )=96-66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10 cm.\n\nThen equation 1: L + 2*10=48 \u2192 L=28 cm.\n\nArea is 28 *10=280 cm\u00b2. But the options are all 1000s. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded into two equal halves, but the perimeters are 48 and 66 for the entire sheet, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet when folded, not each half.\n\nSo when folded along the length, the sheet becomes a single rectangle of L/2 by W. So the perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, the sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nSo the area is 28*10=280 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA)1584\n\nB)1120\n\nC)792\n\nD)1320\n\nE)1200\n\nHmm, none of these. So perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts combined? That can't be, because each part has a perimeter.\n\nWait another approach: perhaps the perimeters are of the folded sheet (each part) including the folded edge. But when you fold, the folded edge is an internal line, so perhaps it's not part of the perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the perimeter is the total for both parts.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because when you fold, each part is a separate rectangle, each with their own perimeter. But the problem says each part has a perimeter of 48 and 66 depending on the fold.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to rederive the equations.\n\nLet me denote L and W as the original length and width.\n\nWhen you fold along the length, each half is L/2 by W. The perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, each half is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + (W/2) )= 2L + W=66.\n\nSo, yes, the same equations.\n\nBut the area is 280 and the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet after unfolding. No, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the two parts combined. But each part has a perimeter, so adding any perimeters would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the sheet is folded such that when you fold along the length, the sheet is L/2 by W, but the perimeter is 48 cm for the entire sheet (including both parts), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeter of the entire folded structure is 48 cm.\n\nWait, but it's unclear. Maybe I should think the problem is written incorrectly, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I mixed up the perimeters. Maybe:\n\nWhen folded along length, each part's perimeter is 66 cm.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part's perimeter is 48 cm.\n\nSo equations would be:\n\n1. L + 2W=66.\n\n2. 2L + W=48.\n\nSolving:\n\nEquation 1: L=66-2W.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: 2*(66-2W) + W=48 \u2192 132-4W + W=48 \u2192 132-3W=48 \u2192 -3W= -84 \u2192 W=28.\n\nThen L=66-2*28=10.\n\nArea is 10*28=280 cm\u00b2. Still no.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way the sheet is folded, perhaps the sheet is folded along the width, so when folded, the length becomes L/2 and width remains W. So the perimeter would be 2*( L/2 + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet's width becomes W/2, so perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same equations.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the entire folded sheet, but I'm considering each part. Let me try that.\n\nWait, when the sheet is folded into two equal parts along one set of sides, the folded sheet (if you consider it as one piece) would have a certain perimeter, which could be different from the perimeters of each individual part.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeter given is for the entire folded sheet when folded along one set.\n\nSo when you fold along the length, making each part L/2 by W. But the folded sheet is just L/2 by W. So the perimeter of the folded sheet is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen you fold along the width, the sheet becomes L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSame equations as before.\n\nSo same solution. So perhaps I should look for the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are in meters? But 280 cm\u00b2 is 0.028 m\u00b2, which is way smaller than the options. So that's unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire sheet when unfolded, but that would be incorrect because the sheet's original perimeter would be 2(L + W). But if the sheet is folded, the perimeter changes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the perimeters when folded. Let me think about a real-life example.\n\nImagine a sheet of A4 paper, which is folded along its length. The dimensions change, but the perimeter includes both the new length and the same width.\n\nWait, let's say the original sheet is L=28, W=10.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each half is 14 by 10. Perimeter is 2*(14+10)=48 cm. Correct.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each half is 28 by 5. Perimeter is 2*(28+5)=66 cm. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the area is 28 *10=280. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup by considering each part's perimeter, but the question refers to the sheet when folded into two equal parts, perhaps meaning that the sheet is folded, and the perimeter of the entire folded sheet is given.\n\nWait, but when you fold the sheet into two parts, the folded sheet is a single rectangle. So the perimeter would be as before.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that when you fold the sheet into two equal parts, the folded sheet's perimeter includes both the folded edge and the original edges. Which doesn't make sense because the folded edge isn't an external edge.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when folded, the sheet has the same perimeter as the original, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded, it creates two separate rectangles, each with a perimeter. But the total perimeter for both would be 2*(each perimeter). But that's not what the question says.\n\nWait, the question says, when folded into two equal halves, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set, and 66 cm when folded along the other set.\n\nSo each part's perimeter is 48 or 66.\n\nWait, unless the perimeters are for the two parts combined. For example, when folded along the length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48 cm. But that doesn't make sense because the two parts are separate, so their combined perimeter would be more than the original.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeter for each part is 48 and 66 when folded, but the original sheet's area is the sum of the areas of the two parts.\n\nWait, but each part's area is (L * W)/2. So the original area is L * W.\n\nWait, I think I'm stuck. The calculations seem correct, but the given options don't include the result.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is that when folding along one direction, the sheet is folded along its length, making each part a square. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, but if each part is a square after folding, then L/2 = W, and L = 2W.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume that when folded along the length, each part is a square. So L/2 = W \u2192 L=2W.\n\nThen, when folded along the length, each part is a square of side W. Perimeter is 4W=48 \u2192 W=12 cm. So L=24 cm.\n\nBut when folded along the width, each part is L by W/2. So dimensions are 24 by 6. Perimeter is 2*(24+6)=60 cm. But the problem states that this should be 66 cm. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when folded along the width, each part is a square. So W/2 = L \u2192 W=2L.\n\nWhen folded along the width, each part is a square of side L. So perimeter is 4L=66 \u2192 L=16.5 cm.\n\nThen W=33 cm.\n\nWhen folded along the length, each part is L/2 by W. So 8.25 by 33.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(8.25+33)=2*(41.25)=82.5 cm. But the problem states that this should be 48 cm. So no match.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe I should think in terms of the original sheet's perimeter.\n\nOriginal perimeter is 2(L + W).\n\nBut after folding into two parts, the perimeters of each part are 48 and 66. So perhaps the sum of the perimeters is 48*2 +66*2= ?\n\nWait, but that's not related to the original perimeter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like the sheet is folded along both directions, leading to four parts, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the sheet is folded along length, the perimeter of the folded sheet (each part) is 48, and when folded along width, it's 66. Then, the original sheet's area would be (28 * 10 )=280, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a multiplier.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters given are for the entire folded sheet, not each part.\n\nWait, when you fold the sheet into two equal halves along the length, the folded sheet's dimensions are L/2 by W. Perimeter is L + 2W =48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should check the equations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the perimeters are for the two parts when folded in each direction.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48. So two parts have a combined perimeter of 96. But the original sheet's perimeter is 2*(L+W). So 2*(L + W)=96? But that would mean L+W=48.\n\nBut from equation 1, L + 2W=48, so 2W= (L+W)=48 - W \u2192 2W=48-W \u21923W=48 \u2192 W=16. Then L=48-2*16=16.\n\nSo dimensions are L=16, W=16. Area=256 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut then when folded along the width, the perimeter would be 2*(16 + (16/2))=2*(16+8)=48 cm, but the problem says it's 66. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for both parts together. Let me think.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48, so two parts have 2*48=96 cm. Similarly, when folded along the width, two parts have 2*66=132 cm.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sheet's original perimeter is the sum of the perimeters of the two parts when folded. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the sheet is folded into two equal halves, and the perimeters of the two parts are 48 and 66 when folded along different directions.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that. Maybe the perimeters are 48 and 66, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the way the perimeters are being calculated. Perhaps when you fold the sheet, the perimeter of the folded sheet (each part) is L + 2W for the length fold and 2L + W for the width fold.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nI'm really stuck here. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial solution and see if maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate using the options.\n\nLet me think: the options are A)1584, which is 36*44=1584.\n\nSo let's suppose L=44, W=36.\n\nCheck if the perimeters fit.\n\nWhen folded along length: each part is 22 by 36. Perimeter=2*(22+36)=2*58=116 cm. Not 48.\n\nNo.\n\nOption D)1320. Let's see. 1320=40*33.\n\nFolded along length: 20 by33. Perimeter=2*(20+33)=2*53=106. Not 48.\n\nNot matching.\n\nOption E)1200= 30*40.\n\nFolded along length: 15*40. Perimeter=2*(15+40)=2*55=110. No.\n\nOption C)792= 33*24.\n\nFolded along length: 16.5 *24. Perimeter=2*(16.5+24)=2*40.5=81. Not 48.\n\nOption B)1120= 40*28.\n\nFolded along length:20*28. Perimeter=2*(20+28)=2*48=96. Not 48.\n\nHmm. So none of the options fit when we compute the perimeters.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try the equations again.\n\nWait, maybe I should express the area in terms of the equations.\n\nWe have:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W =48 \u2192 L=48-2W.\n\nEquation2:2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute L from equation1 into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96-4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 -3W= -30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nThen L=48-2*10=28.\n\nArea is 28*10=280.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But the problem is presented as a multiple-choice with these options, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should multiply the perimeters by 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for both halves when folded, so each part's perimeter is 48 and 66, but when combined, the perimeters add up.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when folded, each part is a separate rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters include the folded edge. But I don't think so.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking in the wrong way. Let me think of the sheet as being folded into two parts, and the perimeters given are for the entire sheet when folded.\n\nWait, when folded along the length, the sheet becomes L/2 by W. So perimeter is 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations as before.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not about a single fold but about multiple folds. Like, perhaps when folded into two equal halves, the sheet is folded twice, once along each direction, but that doesn't fit with the problem statement.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the sheet when folded into two parts along both directions, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the combined shape. But that's unclear.\n\nI'm stuck. Given that the correct answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the sheet is folded into two parts, and the perimeters are for the folded sheet as a single piece, but I have to consider that the folded sheet has the same area as two parts, which is the same as the original.\n\nWait, but that doesn't change the perimeters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet when it's considered as a single piece, not each half.\n\nWait, when you fold a sheet into two equal parts, the folded sheet (a single piece) has a smaller perimeter. So perhaps the perimeters are for the folded sheet, not each part.\n\nIn that case, when folded along the length, the sheet is L/2 by W. Perimeter is 2*(L/2 + W)= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, the sheet is L by W/2. Perimeter is 2*(L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo same solution: L=28, W=10, area=280.\n\nSince this isn't an option, perhaps I should re-examine the problem's wording.\n\nThe question says, \"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for each part when folded along each set of sides. So when folding along one set, each part has a perimeter of 48, and when folding along the other set, each part has a perimeter of 66.\n\nWhich again leads to the same equations.\n\nI'm stuck. I think I should proceed and conclude that the correct area is 280, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the correct option is missing. But among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to find L and W such that L + 2W=48 and 2L + W=66.\n\nWait, let's solve those equations again.\n\nEquation1: L =48 - 2W.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nSubstitute equation1 into equation2:\n\n2*(48-2W) + W=66 \u2192 96-4W + W=66 \u2192 96-3W=66 \u2192 3W=30 \u2192 W=10.\n\nL=48-2*10=28.\n\nSo area=28 *10=280.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for both parts together.\n\nSo when folded along the length, each part has a perimeter of 48. So two parts: 2 *48=96 cm.\n\nSimilarly, when folded along the width, each part's perimeter is 66, so two parts: 2*66=132 cm.\n\nBut how does that relate to the original sheet's dimensions.\n\nWait, perhaps the original sheet's perimeter is 2(L + W).\n\nBut when folded, each part has a perimeter of 48. So 2*( (L/2) + W ) *2=96.\n\nWait, that's 2*( (L/2 + W )) *2=96 \u2192 2*(L/2 + W )=48 \u2192 which is the same as equation1.\n\nSo same setup.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps when you fold the sheet, the perimeters are for the entire sheet, not each part. Let me see.\n\nWhen folded along the length, the sheet is L/2 by W. Perimeter= L + 2W=48.\n\nWhen folded along the width, it's L by W/2. Perimeter=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations.\n\nSo dimensions are 28 and 10, area 280.\n\nBut options don't have it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the sheet is folded into two equal parts, each part has a perimeter of 48 and 66 when folded along each direction, but perhaps the perimeters are double what I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are double.\n\nWait, if I think that the perimeters given are for both parts combined.\n\nSo when folded along the length, two parts have a combined perimeter of 48 cm. So each part's perimeter is 24 cm.\n\nBut that would change the equations.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet when it's folded, but including the folded edge.\n\nWait, but the folded edge is internal, so not part of the perimeter.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I've tried all possible approaches and the correct answer is 280, which isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should exchange L and W.\n\nWait, what if L=10, W=28.\n\nThen when folded along length, each part is 5 by 28. Perimeter=2*(5+28)=66 cm.\n\nWhen folded along width, each part is 10 by14. Perimeter=2*(10+14)=48 cm.\n\nAh! So that fits the perimeters.\n\nSo the original sheet is L=10, W=28.\n\nSo area is 10 *28=280.\n\nBut again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem considers the length as the longer side. So perhaps the original sheet has length 28 and width 10, but when folded along the width, each part is 28 by5. Perimeter=2*(28+5)=66 cm. Which matches.\n\nAnd when folded along the length, each part is14 by10. Perimeter=2*(14+10)=48 cm. Which also matches.\n\nSo the area is 280. But the options don't have it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the area in square meters? 280 cm\u00b2 is 0.028 m\u00b2. But the options are larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the perimeters are not for each part but for the folded sheet when considering both parts.\n\nWait, but I'm out of ideas.\n\nIn the given options, the closest approach would be to see which option fits the equations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as the sheet being folded into two parts, each part having a perimeter of 48 and 66 when folded in each direction.\n\nWait, perhaps the perimeters are for the same sheet when folded in two different ways, not each part.\n\nWait, for example, when folded along the length, the sheet's perimeter is 48. When folded along the width, it's 66.\n\nBut that would give:\n\nEquation1: L + 2W=48.\n\nEquation2: 2L + W=66.\n\nWhich gives L=28, W=10. Area 280.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck and think I should proceed to the step-by-step explanation, concluding that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended setup leads to 1320.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWhen you fold the sheet into two equal parts along one set of sides, each part is a rectangle.\n\nSo for the length fold: each part is L/2 by W.\n\nPerimeter: 2*( (L/2) + W )= L + 2W=48.\n\nFor the width fold: each part is L by W/2.\n\nPerimeter: 2*( L + W/2 )=2L + W=66.\n\nSo same equations again.\n\nThus, the area is 280, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using the entire sheet's perimeter when folded, but for both parts. But that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the perimeters are for the entire sheet, which is folded into two parts, but the perimeter is that of the original sheet.\n\nNo, because when folded, the perimeter changes.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible approaches and must conclude that the correct answer is 280, but it's not among the options. However, perhaps the intended correct answer is D)1320, which is 28*48=1344, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1320, which is 44 * 30.\n\nWait, let me plug L=44, W=30.\n\nFolded along length:22 by30. Perimeter=2*(22+30)=104. Not 48.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should give up and select the closest option, but I can't. Since the calculations are correct, perhaps the intended answer is 280, but it's not present. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed, but perhaps the intended answer is B)1120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the equations differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that when you fold the sheet into two equal parts, the perimeters are for the two parts together.\n\nSo when folded along the length, the two parts together have a perimeter of 48 cm.\n\nBut that would mean each part would have a perimeter of 24 cm, which changes the equations.\n\nBut I think that's not the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the perimeters are for the sheet when folded, but it's unclear.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given setup, the area is 280 cm\u00b2, which is not among the options. Therefore, there's likely a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\n\nThe problem involves a rectangular sheet folded into two equal halves along two different sets of sides, with the perimeters of the folded parts given as 48 cm and 66 cm. The goal is to find the area of the original sheet.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Defining Variables**: Let the original dimensions of the sheet be \\( L \\) (length) and \\( W \\) (width).\n\n2. **Folding Along Length**: When folded along the length, each half has dimensions \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\times W \\).

The perimeter of each part is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\left( L + \\frac{W}{2} \\right) = 2L + W = 66 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Equations**:\n   - From Equation (1): \\( L + 2W = 48 \\)  \n   - From Equation (2): \\( 2L + W = 66 \\)\n\n   Substituting \\( L = 48 - 2W \\) from Equation (1) into Equation (2):\n   \\[\n   2(48 - 2W) + W = 66 \\implies 96 - 4W + W = 66 \\implies 3W = 30 \\implies W = 10 \\, \\text{cm}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( W = 10 \\) back into Equation (1):\n   \\[\n   L + 2(10) = 48 \\implies L = 28 \\, \\text{cm}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Area of the Original Sheet**: The area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 28 \\times 10 = 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated area of \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\) does not match any of the provided options (\\( 1584, 1120, 792, 1320, 1200 \\)). Despite extensive re-evaluation of the setup and equations, the result remains consistent. It is possible that the problem statement or the options provided contain an error.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the calculations, the area of the original sheet is \\( 280 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\). However, since this value is not among the given options, the correct answer cannot be determined from the provided choices.\n\nANSWER: None of the options match the calculated result.",
