      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Jack and Jill cleaning a yacht. Hmm, let's see. The question says that Jack can clean the yacht by himself in 12 hours. On this particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work, and then Jill does the remaining part. But Jill's rate is only 5% of Jack's. I need to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work.\n\nAlright, first, let me break down the problem. I should probably find out how much work each person does and then calculate the time Jill takes.\n\nSo, let's start with Jack. He can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his work rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. Right? Because work rate is usually calculated as 1 divided by time. So, in one hour, Jack does 1/12 of the job.\n\nOn this day, he does two-thirds of the work. Wait, but how long does he take to do that two-thirds? Oh wait, no, the problem doesn't say he took a certain time\u2014it just says he finished two-thirds. So maybe I don't need to calculate how long he took, but just how much work is left for Jill.\n\nThe total work is 1 yacht. Jack did two-thirds, so the remaining is one-third. Right? Because 1 - (2/3) = 1/3.\n\nSo Jill has to do 1/3 of the work. Now, her rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Let's compute Jill's rate. Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% of that is 0.05*(1/12). Let me calculate that. 0.05 divided by 12 is 0.0041666... per hour. Wait, maybe it's better to write it as fractions.\n\n5% is 5/100, which simplifies to 1/20. So Jill's rate is (1/20) * (1/12) per hour. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because 5% of Jack's rate is 0.05 * (1/12). So that's 5/100 * (1/12) = 5/(12*100) = 5/1200 = 1/240 per hour. Oh wait, that's 1 divided by 240. So Jill's rate is 1/240 per hour.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 5% is 0.05. So 0.05 times (1/12) equals 0.05/12. Let's compute this as a fraction. 0.05 is 5/100, so 5/100 divided by 12 is (5/(100*12)) = 5/1200. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 5. 5 \u00f75 is 1, 1200 \u00f75 is 240. So yes, 1/240 per hour. So Jill can do 1/240 of the work each hour.\n\nNow, the remaining work is 1/3. So the time needed is work divided by rate. So time = (1/3) / (1/240). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 1/3 multiplied by 240/1. That equals 240/3 = 80. So the time is 80 hours?\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options don't have 80. Wait, wait a minute, the options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20. Hmm, 80 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me go back. Maybe I messed up the calculation of Jill's rate. Let's think again. Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% of that is 0.05*(1/12) = 0.0041666... per hour. So in decimal, 0.0041666 is approximately 1/240. Because 1/240 is about 0.0041666667.\n\nWait, but if I compute 1/3 divided by 1/240, that's 80 hours. But none of the options match that. Hmm. So I must have done something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read again.\n\n\"Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" Oh wait, maybe the rates are in terms of time, not the fraction of work done. Like, wait, maybe the problem is saying Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate. So yes, that's how I understood it. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe instead of dealing with rates, think about how long it takes to do each portion.\n\nSo the total work is 1 yacht. Jack does 2/3, so time he takes is (2/3) / (1/12) = (2/3 ) * 12 = 8 hours. So Jack works for 8 hours to do 2/3 of the job. Then the remaining 1/3 is done by Jill. But wait, the problem doesn't say how long Jack took, it just says he finished two-thirds. So perhaps that's irrelevant. Because the problem doesn't specify the time Jack took, just the portion he did. So perhaps the time doesn't matter because the work is what's important.\n\nSo the remaining work is 1/3. Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. Jack can do 1/12 per hour, so 5% is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo time for Jill is (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. But that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\n\"Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" So 5% of Jack's rate. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me think about the rates again. Let me assign variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Jack\u2019s rate = J = 1/12 per hour.\n\n- Jill\u2019s rate = 0.05*J = 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nWork done by Jack = 2/3. So time taken by Jack is (2/3)/J = (2/3)/(1/12) = (2/3)*12 = 8 hours. So Jack works 8 hours, then Jill does the remaining 1/3. The time Jill takes is (1/3)/(1/240) = (1/3)*240 = 80 hours. But that's 80, which isn't in the options. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking how long does Jill take, not the total time. But the options don't include 80. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe I should think of the time Jack took to do his part. Let me think: if Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, to do 2/3 of the work, time would be (2/3)/(1/12) = (2/3)*12 = 8 hours. So Jack took 8 hours. Then, the remaining 1/3 is done by Jill at 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, what's 5% of Jack's rate? Jack does 1/12 per hour, so 5% is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo time for Jill = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours. Hmm, same as before.\n\nWait, the answer is 80 hours, but it's not an option. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. \"The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" Oh wait, maybe \"rate of cleaning\" refers to her speed in terms of time, not the fraction of work done per hour. Or perhaps I'm getting it the other way around.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate.\" So Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, then 5% is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour. That's what I thought earlier. So why isn't 80 an option?\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps Jack's rate is 12 hours per yacht, so Jack's time is 12 hours. So Jill's time would be 12 / 0.05 = 240 hours per yacht? That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the time Jill takes to do her part, but I'm miscalculating something.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the work in terms of man-hours.\n\nJack can do 1 yacht in 12 hours. So 1 yacht = 12 Jack-hours.\n\nJack does two-thirds, which is (2/3)*12 = 8 Jack-hours. So he took 8 hours, as before.\n\nRemaining work is 1/3 of the yacht, which is (1/3)*12 = 4 Jack-hours.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So Jill's rate is 0.05 Jacks per hour. So 0.05 Jacks can do 1 hour of work. So in one hour, Jill does 0.05 of a Jack's work.\n\nWait, so in terms of man-hours, the remaining work is 4 Jack-hours. If Jill's rate is 0.05 Jacks per hour, then the time for Jill would be 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\" So perhaps, Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate in terms of the time it takes. So if Jack takes 12 hours, Jill's time per hour would be different.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Because rate is work per time, not time per work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to think that Jill's time is 20 times that of Jack's. Because 5% is 0.05, which is 1/20. So if Jack does it in 12 hours, Jill would take 12 / 0.05 = 240 hours. But that's for the entire job. But she's only doing 1/3 of the job. So 240 * (1/3) = 80 hours. Same as before.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the answer is 80 hours, but that's not in the options. The options are 4,8,22,50,20.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the remaining work. Wait, the work done by Jack is two-thirds of the total. So remaining is one-third. So if the total is 1, remaining is 1/3. So Jill has to do 1/3. So the time is (1/3) / (Jill's rate).\n\nWait, let me compute Jill's rate again. 5% of Jack's rate. Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So 5% is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.00416666666 per hour. So Jill's rate is approximately 0.0041666666 per hour.\n\nSo time = (1/3) / 0.0041666666 \u2248 (0.3333333333) / 0.0041666666 \u2248 80 hours. So that's correct.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So maybe the problem is that I'm miscalculating something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting what \"5% of Jack's rate\" means.\n\nWait, could it be that Jill is 5% as efficient as Jack, so she takes 20 times longer per unit of work? Because 5% efficiency would mean she's 1/20 as efficient. So for each unit of work, she takes 20 times as long as Jack.\n\nSo let's see. For the remaining 1/3 of the work: if Jack takes 12 hours for the whole job, he would take (1/3)*12 = 4 hours for that portion. So Jill, being 5% as efficient, would take 4 hours * 20 = 80 hours. Again, same conclusion.\n\nHmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem, perhaps I misread the numbers. Let me check:\n\n\"By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.\"\n\n\"On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work.\"\n\n\"The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.\"\n\nSo no, I think I read that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question asks for the time Jack took, not Jill's time. But the question says: \"how long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?\" So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fraction. Wait, 5% is 0.05, which is 1/20. So Jill's rate is 1/20 of Jack's rate. So if Jack's rate is 1/12, Jill's is (1/20)*(1/12) = 1/240, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo time is (1/3) divided by (1/240) equals 80. So 80 hours. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the work done. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be in terms of time, not work rates. Let me think: if Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, and Jill is 5% of that, then her rate is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nThus, for 1/3 of the work, the time is (1/3)/(1/240) = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nBut the options don't have 80. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have Jill's rate as 5% per hour, not 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. The problem says Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the time taken for the entire job. Jack does two-thirds, and Jill does one-third. Let me calculate the total time as the sum of Jack's time and Jill's time. But the problem doesn't ask for the total time, just Jill's time for her part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking how much time it takes for Jill to do her part, but I'm using the wrong rates.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to think in terms of time per work done. For example, if Jack takes 12 hours for 1 yacht, then Jill's time per yacht would be 12 / 0.05 = 240 hours. Because 5% of Jack's rate. So for a full job, Jill would take 240 hours. But since she's only doing 1/3, she'd take 240 * (1/3) = 80 hours. Again, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident the answer is 80 hours, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, the closest is option E)20. Hmm. 80 divided by 4 is 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the calculation.\n\nWait, 5% of Jack's rate: 5% is 0.05. So Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.0041666... per hour.\n\nThe work left is 1/3. So time is (1/3) / 0.00416666... Let me compute this division.\n\n1/3 is approximately 0.3333333.\n\n0.3333333 divided by 0.004166666.\n\nLet me compute this as a division:\n\n0.3333333 \u00f7 0.004166666 \u2248 80.\n\nBut why am I getting 80 when the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about what's being asked.\n\nWait, the question is asking how long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work. So I calculated that as 80 hours. But none of the options are 80. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. Oh, wait! Wait, the problem says \"finishing two-thirds of the work.\" Does it mean that Jack and Jill are working together, and he did two-thirds? Or that Jack did two-thirds alone, and then Jill did the remaining one-third.\n\nWait, the problem says \"he happens to finish two-thirds of the work\" on a particular day. So perhaps they're working together, and Jack did two-thirds of the work, and Jill did the remaining one-third. So that may change the calculation.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill.\" So Jill is working alone after Jack has done two-thirds. So perhaps the way I approached it before is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the time that Jill takes regardless of how much work it is, but based on her rate.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me think, perhaps the time taken by Jack to do two-thirds is 8 hours, as calculated before. Then, Jill starts working and does the remaining one-third at her rate of 1/240 per hour. So time would be 80 hours. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking the time in terms of the portion of the day. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that Jill's rate is 5% of the work per hour, not 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nWait, that would be a different approach. Let's say Jill's rate is 5% per hour, i.e., 0.05 of the work per hour. Then, the remaining work is 1/3, so time = (1/3) / 0.05 = (1/3) * 20 = 20/3 \u2248 6.666... hours, which is approximately 6.67 hours. That's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to compute the time in terms of the entire day. But I can't see how that would apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo. Let me think: maybe the rate is 50% instead of 5%. Because 5% leads to a time not in the options, but 50% would make sense.\n\nWait, if instead, Jill's rate is 50% of Jack's, then Jill's rate would be 0.5*(1/12) = 1/24 per hour. Then time would be (1/3)/(1/24) = 8 hours. Which is option B.\n\nBut the problem states 5%, not 50%. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the problem is asking for the time in the same units, but perhaps I mixed up hours and something else.\n\nWait, let me take a step back and think of it as work done.\n\nTotal work = 1.\n\nJack does 2/3, so he takes (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 hours. Then, the remaining 1/3 is done by Jill at 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour, so 5% is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240. So time = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nHmm, but that's not in the options. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the problem says that Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours when working alone. But when they're working together, he finishes two-thirds, and then Jill works on the remaining one-third. But the problem doesn't say that.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me compute how much time Jill would take to do the entire work, and then since she's only doing one-third, perhaps her time is longer. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So if Jack can do it in 12 hours, Jill would take 12 / 0.05 = 240 hours for the entire job. So for one-third, it's 240 * (1/3) = 80 hours. Same as before.\n\nBut the given options are A)4, B)8, C)22, D)50, E)20. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial step. Let me compute how much time Jill takes to do 1/3 of the work.\n\nWait, another way: Let's compute the time in terms of fractions.\n\nJack's rate: 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate: 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, work done = rate * time.\n\nWork done by Jill is 1/3 = (1/240) * t.\n\nSo t = (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours.\n\nSo, the answer is 80 hours, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the time that Jill takes, but in terms of the portion of the day, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I messed up the rate calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the time in hours for the remaining 1/3, based on Jill's rate.\n\nWait, Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's. So 5% of 1/12 is 1/240 per hour. So she does 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo, for 1/3, time = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nSo again, 80, but no option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to say that Jill's rate is 5 times that of Jack's, but it's written as 5%. Because 5 times would give an option in the given choices.\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5 times Jack's, then her rate is 5*(1/12) = 5/12 per hour.\n\nThen, time = (1/3)/(5/12) = (1/3)*(12/5) = 4/5 hours = 0.8 hours, which is about 48 minutes. But that's not an option either.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the time in terms of the work done per day. For example, if a day is 24 hours, but that doesn't seem applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different way of expressing the rates. For example, perhaps \"5% of the time it takes Jack.\" But that would not make sense because rate is work over time.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the remaining work. Wait, the problem says Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so the remaining is one-third. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. All my calculations point to 80, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think again: perhaps Jill's rate is 5% of the total work per hour, not 5% of Jack's rate. So, if the total work is 1, then Jill's rate is 0.05 per hour.\n\nIn that case, time would be (1/3) / 0.05 = (1/3)*20 = 20/3 \u22486.666 hours, which is around 6.67 hours. That's approximately 6.67 hours, which is about 6 hours and 40 minutes. That's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased in a way that I'm not considering. For example, if Jack's rate is 12 hours per yacht, then Jill's rate is 12 hours / 0.05 = 240 hours per yacht.\n\nWait, but the remaining work is 1/3 of a yacht. So time for Jill would be (1/3) * 240 = 80 hours. Same result again.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the work is measured in man-hours, so Jill's contribution is 1/3, which is 4 man-hours (since the total is 12 hours for Jack). So if Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, which is 0.05 man-hours per hour, then time is 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours. Same as before.\n\nHmm. I'm not seeing any way to get an answer matching the options. So perhaps the correct answer is E)20, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup, and the correct answer isn't in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using fractions incorrectly. Let me think: If Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour, and Jill's is 5% of that, which is 0.05/12 per hour. Then, for 1/3 of the work:\n\nTime = (1/3) / (0.05/12) = (1/3) * (12/0.05) = (1/3)*240 = 80 hours.\n\nSo yes, 80.\n\nBut again, not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is E)20, but I must have misread the problem somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says \"5% faster than Jack.\" But it says \"5% of Jack's rate.\" So not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the work is done by both working together. But the problem says Jill does the remaining portion after Jack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 5% is per day, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should take a different approach. Let me look for an answer that's in the options by plugging in.\n\nLet's see: The options are 4,8,22,50,20.\n\nSuppose Jill takes 20 hours (option E). Then, her rate is (1/3) /20 = 1/(60) per hour.\n\nSo, is 1/60 per hour 5% of Jack's rate?\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% of that is 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nBut 1/60 is 4 times larger than 1/240. So that's not 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, option E is not correct.\n\nWhat about option B)8 hours.\n\nIf Jill takes 8 hours, her rate is (1/3)/8 = 1/24 per hour.\n\nIs 1/24 per hour 5% of Jack's rate?\n\nJack's rate is 1/12. 5% is 1/240. 1/24 is 10 times 1/240. So that's 10 times larger, not 5%.\n\nSo option B is 8 hours, which would imply a rate 10 times higher than 5% of Jack's rate. So that's not right.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think: perhaps Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's time, not rate.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Let me think. If Jack takes 12 hours, Jill's time would be 5% of 12 hours, which is 0.6 hours. But that would be the time she takes for the whole job, not a portion. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that Jill's rate is 5% slower than Jack's. But that's not what the problem states.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm considering the time for the entire job, but I'm only considering part of it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining work is one-third, and I'm to calculate how long it takes Jill at her rate of 5% of Jack's rate. So maybe I should find the time differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the total work is 12 hours for Jack. So 12 hours = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.\n\nJack does two-thirds, which is 480 minutes of work. So he took 480 minutes.\n\nRemaining work: 1/3, which is 240 minutes.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of Jack's. Jack's rate is 720 minutes per work. So 5% of that is 36 minutes per work. So Jill's rate is 36 minutes per work.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because work rate is work per time, not time per work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Jill's rate in terms of the time she takes. So if Jack takes 12 hours for the whole job, Jill takes 20 times as long for the same job because she's 5% as efficient. So for the whole job, 240 hours. For one-third, 80 hours. Same as before.\n\nBut again, no option matches.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. All my calculations point to 80, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is E)20, but I can't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me compute the time Jill takes for the remaining 1/3 as follows:\n\nIf Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's, then:\n\nJack's rate = 1/12 per hour.\n\nJill's rate = 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nTime = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nSo the correct answer is 80, but it's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should re-express 80 hours as days. 80 hours is 3 and 1/3 days, but that's not any of the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for how long it takes both Jack and Jill to finish the remaining work together. But the problem says Jill does the remaining work, implying she works alone.\n\nHmm. I'm confused. Maybe I should pick the closest option, but that's not a good approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for how long it takes Jill to do the remaining work, but in the same time that Jack took. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if 20 hours is the correct answer.\n\nIf Jill takes 20 hours, then her rate is (1/3)/20 = 1/60 per hour.\n\nCheck if that's 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nJack's rate is 1/12 per hour. 5% is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nBut 1/60 is 4 times 1/240 (because 1/60 = 4*(1/240)). So that's not 5% of Jack's rate. So option E)20 would imply a rate 4 times higher than 5% of Jack's rate.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nAnother option: option D)50.\n\nTime =50 hours. Rate = (1/3)/50 = 1/150 per hour.\n\nCheck: 1/150 is 4/600. 1/240 is 2.5/600. So 1/150 is 1.6 times higher than 1/240. Not 5%.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that Jill's rate is 5% of the total work per hour. So 5% of 1 per hour is 0.05 per hour.\n\nSo, work needed is 1/3. Time = (1/3) / 0.05 = 20/3 \u22486.666 hours. So that's about 6.67 hours, which is not an option.\n\nBut option E is 20 hours. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using fractions incorrectly. Let me think again.\n\nMaybe the problem is intended to have the answer as 80 hours, but since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong proportion.\n\nWait, Jack's rate is 1/12 per hour. So in one hour, he does 1/12 of the work.\n\nJill's rate is 5% of that, so 0.05*(1/12) = 1/240 per hour.\n\nSo the remaining work is 1/3. Time = (1/3) / (1/240) = 80 hours.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem intended to say that Jill's rate is 5 times Jack's, not 5% of it. Because 5 times would give:\n\nJill's rate =5*(1/12) =5/12 per hour.\n\nTime = (1/3)/(5/12) = (1/3)*(12/5)=4/5 hours=0.8 hours=48 minutes. Not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem said 50% instead of 5%. Let's see:\n\nJill's rate =0.5*(1/12)=1/24 per hour.\n\nTime=(1/3)/(1/24)=8 hours. Option B is 8, which could be the intended answer.\n\nSo perhaps the problem had a typo, and it's supposed to be 50% instead of 5%. Then the correct answer would be option B)8.\n\nBut since the problem states 5%, that's not the case.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none lead to an option provided. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup, but I can't see where.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n1. **Jack's Work Rate**: Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his work rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) of the yacht per hour.\n\n2. **Work Done by Jack**: Jack completes two-thirds of the work. Since the total work is 1 yacht, the remaining work is \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Jill's Work Rate**: Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate is:\n   \\[\n   0.05 \\times \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{240} \\, \\text{(of the yacht per hour)}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time for Jill to Complete the Remaining Work**: The remaining work is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the yacht. Using the formula \\( \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Work}}{\\text{Rate}} \\), the time Jill takes is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{240}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 240 = 80 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated time of 80 hours does not match any of the provided options (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 22, (D) 50, (E) 20. This suggests either a miscalculation or an issue with the problem setup.\n\n6. **Rechecking Calculations**: Multiple approaches were taken to verify the calculations, including alternative interpretations of the problem and potential typos in the problem statement. However, all methods consistently led to the same result of 80 hours.\n\n7. **Final Conclusion**: Despite the mismatch with the options, the calculations confirm that the correct time for Jill to finish the remaining work is 80 hours. Since this is not among the provided choices, the answer cannot be determined from the given options.\n\nAnswer: None of the provided options match the correct calculation.",
