      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. Then, we have this expression for x:\n\nx = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) / (n + 4\u221an +4)\n\nAnd we need to find which option x satisfies. The options are A to E, with various ranges.\n\nHmm, the expression looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it. Let me see if the numerator and denominator can be factored or rewritten in a different way.\n\nFirst, let's look at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. I notice that n\u00b2 and 16 are perfect squares. n\u00b2 is (n)^2 and 16 is (4)^2. Maybe this is a perfect square trinomial. The form is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2, which equals (a + b)\u00b2. Let me check if that fits.\n\nSo, a would be n and b would be 4? Let me compute 2ab: 2*(n)*4 = 8n. But in the numerator, the middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Wait, that's not the same as 8n. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly applicable. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the middle term is 2ab where a is \u221an and b is something else. Let me try that. If a is \u221an, then a\u00b2 is n. The middle term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let me factor that: 2\u221an * (n +4). So that would be 2a*(n +4), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be expressed as (\u221an + something)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire numerator can be represented as (\u221an + something)^2. Let me try expanding (\u221an + c)^2, which would be n + 2c\u221an + c\u00b2. Comparing that to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Wait, no, that's not matching because the numerator is n squared, but (\u221an)^2 is n. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the numerator is a perfect square involving terms with n and \u221an. Let me see. Let me try to write it as (something involving n and \u221an) squared. Let me think of the numerator as:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nHmm, could this be equal to (n + something)^2? Let me compute (n + a\u221an + b)^2 and see if I can match terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's (\u221an * something + something else)^2. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (\u221an + d)^2 multiplied by something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor the numerator and denominator differently. Let me consider the denominator first.\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if that can be factored. Hmm, perhaps as (\u221an + 2)^2? Let's check: (\u221an + 2)^2 is n +4\u221an +4. Yes, that's exactly the denominator. So denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2.\n\nThat's a good start. Now, let's look at the numerator again. If I can express the numerator as another square, then perhaps x can be simplified.\n\nNumerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, let me expand that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an + 8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, maybe I can group terms differently. Let me see: n\u00b2 + 8\u221an +16 is a part, plus 2n\u221an. Wait, n\u00b2 + 8\u221an +16. Let me check if that's a perfect square. Suppose it is (n + a\u221an + b)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + something)^2. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me let t = \u221an. Then, since n is between 36 and 72, t would be between 6 and \u221a72 \u2248 8.485. So t ranges from 6 to about 8.485.\n\nExpressing everything in terms of t, perhaps it will be easier.\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16 = (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nWait, wait, because n = t\u00b2. So n squared is (t\u00b2)^2. Let me compute each term:\n\nn\u00b2 = (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\n2\u221an (n +4) = 2t (t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 + 8t.\n\nSo the numerator becomes: t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t +2)^2.\n\nHmm, so now x is [t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16] / (t+2)^2.\n\nHmm, can I factor the numerator? Let's see. Let me try factoring t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nLooking for factors, perhaps group terms:\n\n(t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16) = t^3(t +2) + 8(t + 2) = (t^3 +8)(t +2).\n\nWait, that's neat. So, numerator factors into (t+2)(t^3 +8). Then, x becomes:\n\nx = (t+2)(t^3 +8) / (t+2)^2.\n\nWe can cancel one (t+2) from numerator and denominator, as long as t+2 is not zero, which it isn't since t is at least 6.\n\nSo x = (t^3 +8) / (t + 2).\n\nHmm, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Because 8 is 2^3. So t^3 + 8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo, substituting back in, x becomes:\n\nx = [(t +2)(t^2 -2t +4)] / (t +2) ) = t^2 - 2t +4.\n\nBecause (t+2) in numerator and denominator cancels out.\n\nSo, x simplifies to t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Now, since t = \u221an, x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. Because t\u00b2 is (\u221an)^2, which is n. So x = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, but earlier steps: x = t\u00b2 - 2t +4. Since t=\u221an, x = (\u221an)^2 \u2212 2\u221an +4 \u2192 n \u2212 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit strange. Let me check the simplification again.\n\nWait, when I had t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16, I grouped as (t^4 +2t^3) + (8t +16) \u2192 t^3(t +2) + 8(t +2) \u2192 (t^3 +8)(t+2). Correct.\n\nThen, t^3 +8 is (t + 2)(t\u00b2 \u2212 2t +4). So yeah, the numerator becomes (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 \u22122t +4) \u2192 (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4). Wait wait, wait, no:\n\nWait, wait, the numerator is (t^3 +8)(t +2) = (t + 2)^2 (t\u00b2 \u2212 2t +4). So when I have numerator over denominator (t+2)^2, the denominator cancels with (t+2)^2 in the numerator, leaving me with (t\u00b2 \u2212 2t +4).\n\nYes, right. So x = t^2 \u2212 2t +4. And since t is \u221an, x = (\u221an)^2 \u2212 2\u221an +4 \u2192 n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, but n is between 36 and 72, so let's compute x for n=36 and n=72 to find the range.\n\nWait, but perhaps x is a quadratic function in terms of t, which is \u221an. Since t is between 6 and about 8.485, let's find x in terms of t and find its minimum and maximum in that interval.\n\nx = t^2 - 2t +4. This is a quadratic in t, which opens upwards because the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive. The vertex of this parabola is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. So the minimum occurs at t=1, but our t ranges from 6 to about 8.485. So in this interval, the function is increasing because the vertex is at t=1, which is far to the left of our interval.\n\nSo as t increases from 6 to 8.485, x increases from x(6) to x(8.485).\n\nLet me compute x at t=6: x=6\u00b2 \u22122*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4= 28.\n\nAt t=8.485, which is approximately \u221a72 (since 8.485^2 \u224872). Let's compute x there.\n\nt=8.485: t\u00b2 is 72, so x=72 \u22122*8.485 +4 = 72 \u221216.97 +4 \u2248 (72+4) \u221216.97 =76 \u221216.97=59.03.\n\nWait, but t is exactly \u221a72, which is 6\u221a2, so t=6\u221a2. Let me compute x exactly.\n\nx = (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4 = 36*2 \u221212\u221a2 +4 =72 +4 \u221212\u221a2 \u2192 76 \u221212\u221a2.\n\nWhat's 12\u221a2 approximately? \u221a2 is about 1.4142, so 12 *1.4142=16.9704. So 76 \u221216.9704=59.0296, which is about 59.03.\n\nWait, but that's the value when t=\u221a72. So x increases from 28 to approximately 59.03 as t increases from 6 to ~8.485.\n\nWait, so x ranges from 28 to about 59. Let me check the endpoints.\n\nWait, when n=36, t=6, x=6\u00b2 \u22122*6 +4=36 \u221212 +4=28. Correct.\n\nWhen n=72, t\u22488.485, x\u224859.03.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03. So the possible range is 28 < x < ~59.03.\n\nWait, let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA)20 < x < 54\n\nB)23 < x < 58\n\nC)25 < x < 64\n\nD)28 < x < 60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo x is between 28 and approximately 59.03. So the range is greater than 28 and less than 60.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 28 <x <60. So that would include x's maximum around 59.03.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, perhaps I should check for all t between 6 and 8.485 whether x is within that range.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: x = t^2 - 2t +4. Since t is between 6 and 8.485, let me compute x at the endpoints.\n\nAt t=6: 36 -12 +4=28.\n\nAt t=8.485: ~59.03 as before.\n\nSo the minimum is 28, maximum about 59. So the range of x is (28, ~59.03), so it's between 28 and just under 60.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D is 28 < x <60. So that would include all x in our computed range.\n\nBut wait, let me check if x can actually reach 60. Our upper limit is about 59.03, so it doesn't reach 60. So the maximum x is less than 60.\n\nSo the correct range is 28 <x < approximately 59.03. So the option that includes this is D, which says 28 <x <60.\n\nWait, but let me see whether the maximum x is exactly when n=72, which is t=6\u221a2.\n\nx at t=6\u221a2 is 76-12\u221a2. Let me compute 12\u221a2 more accurately. \u221a2 is 1.41421356, so 12 * 1.41421356 = 16.97056272.\n\n76 \u221216.97056272 = 59.02943728. So approximately 59.0294. So x is less than 60, so the upper limit is just under 60.\n\nTherefore, the range for x is 28 <x < ~59.03, which is entirely within option D's range of 28 <x <60. So option D is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D says 28 <x <60, which is correct.\n\nWait, but what about the other options? Let's see:\n\nOption B is 23 <x <58. But our x starts at 28, so 23 <x isn't necessary. Also, our maximum is about 59, which is above 58. So option B is not correct.\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. Our x starts at 28, so 25 is lower. And 64 is higher than our maximum of ~59.03, so the upper limit is correct, but the lower limit is too low. So the x range is entirely within 25-64, but the exact range is tighter. So option C includes more possibilities, but our x doesn't go as low as 25.\n\nOption A is 20<x<54. Again, our x starts at 28, so the lower limit is higher, and the upper limit is 54, which is lower than our maximum of ~59. So option A would exclude some possible x values.\n\nHence, the correct option is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\( n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( (\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2 \\). This simplifies the expression to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{(\\sqrt{n} + 2)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Numerator\nThe numerator is \\( n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 \\). Let \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\). Substituting \\( t \\) into the numerator:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t(t^2 + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Factor the Numerator\nThe numerator \\( t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 \\) can be factored by grouping:\n\n\\[\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 = (t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t + 16) = t^3(t + 2) + 8(t + 2) = (t^3 + 8)(t + 2)\n\\]\n\nFurther factor \\( t^3 + 8 \\) using the sum of cubes formula:\n\n\\[\nt^3 + 8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n(t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4)(t + 2) = (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify \\( x \\)\nSubstituting the factored numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)}{(t + 2)^2} = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx = (\\sqrt{n})^2 - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Range of \\( x \\)\nGiven \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\) ranges from \\( 6 \\) to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\). Substituting these values into \\( x = t^2 - 2t + 4 \\):\n\n1. At \\( t = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n   \\]\n\n2. At \\( t = \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = (8.485)^2 - 2(8.485) + 4 \\approx 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges approximately from \\( 28 \\) to \\( 59.03 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the Options\n- **Option A: \\( 20 < x < 54 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) starts at \\( 28 \\), which is above \\( 20 \\), and exceeds \\( 54 \\).\n\n- **Option B: \\( 23 < x < 58 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) starts at \\( 28 \\), which is above \\( 23 \\), and exceeds \\( 58 \\).\n\n- **Option C: \\( 25 < x < 64 \\)**  \n  This is incorrect because \\( x \\) starts at \\( 28 \\), which is above \\( 25 \\), and the upper limit \\( 64 \\) is too high.\n\n- **Option D: \\( 28 < x < 60 \\)**  \n  This is correct because \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to approximately \\( 59.03 \\), which lies entirely within this interval.\n\n- **Option E: None of these**  \n  This is incorrect because Option D is valid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
