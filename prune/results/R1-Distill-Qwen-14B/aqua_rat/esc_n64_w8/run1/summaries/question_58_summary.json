      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, and 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. That means there's no overlap between the two; each chocolate is one or the other. So if I know the percentage of one, I can find the other.\n\nFirst, 10% are cocoa. So that leaves 90% as vanilla, right? Because 100% - 10% = 90%. So vanilla is 90% of all chocolates.\n\nThen, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the \"rest\" must refer to the vanilla ones, because 10% are already cocoa. So the rest after subtracting cocoa is the vanilla. So the rest is 90% of the chocolates.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the rest after what? Oh, the first line says all are vanilla or cocoa. Then 10% are cocoa. So the rest is 90% which are vanilla. So of that 90%, 90% are squashed. Oh, so 90% of vanilla are squashed.\n\nWait, so 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. So what's the percentage of vanilla that's not squashed?\n\nLet me calculate that. So vanilla is 90% of all chocolates. Of that 90%, 90% are squashed. So the not squashed would be 10% of vanilla, which is 10% of 90% of total. Because 90% of vanilla are squashed, so 10% are not.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's say the total number of chocolates is 100 for simplicity.\n\nTotal chocolates = 100.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10 chocolates.\n\nVanilla: 90% \u2192 90 chocolates.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest (vanilla) are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed.\n\nWait, wait. The rest refers to vanilla. So 90% of 90 (vanilla) are squashed. So 81 squashed vanilla.\n\nSo how many vanilla are not squashed? That's 90 - 81 = 9.\n\nSo 9 out of 100 chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. That's 9%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Oh wait, the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed. So that's 9 out of 100, so 9% which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option D is 9%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me do it again.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10.\n\nVanilla: 90% \u219290.\n\nOf vanilla, 90% are squashed. So 90 * 0.9 =81 squashed vanilla. So the remaining vanilla is 90 -81=9.\n\nSo 9% of total chocolates are vanilla and not squashed. So the answer is D)9%.\n\nWait, but let me think about the wording again. The problem says 90% of the rest are squashed. The rest after what? Oh, after taking out the 10% cocoa. So the rest is 90% which are vanilla. So 90% of that 90% are squashed. So yeah, 81 squashed vanilla.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is 90% of the rest (the 10% cocoa) are squashed. But that would complicate things because cocoa is 10%, and 90% of that is 9 squashed. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says the rest after the 10% cocoa are vanilla, so the rest is 90% which are vanilla, and 90% of that are squashed.\n\nSo I think I was correct. The answer is 9%, so option D.\n",

So 9 is the number we're looking for, which is 9% of total.\n\nSo the answer should be D)9%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total Chocolates**: Assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.\n\n2. **Cocoa and Vanilla Chocolates**:\n   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so there are \\( 10 \\) cocoa chocolates.\n   - The remaining \\( 90\\% \\) are vanilla flavored, which means there are \\( 90 \\) vanilla chocolates.\n\n3. **Squashed Chocolates**:\n   - The problem states that \\( 90\\% \\) of the vanilla chocolates are squashed.\n   - Calculate the number of squashed vanilla chocolates:  \n     \\[\n     90\\% \\times 90 = 0.9 \\times 90 = 81\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the number of vanilla chocolates that are **not** squashed is:  \n     \\[\n     90 - 81 = 9\n     \\]\n\n4. **Percentage of Vanilla and Not Squashed Chocolates**:\n   - There are \\( 9 \\) vanilla chocolates that are not squashed out of \\( 100 \\) total chocolates.\n   - The percentage is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{9}{100} \\times 100\\% = 9\\%\n     \\]\n\nThus, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is **9%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about chocolates in a store. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, the total is divided into vanilla and cocoa. \n\nThe problem says 10% are cocoa flavored. That means the rest, which is 90%, must be vanilla because those are the only two options. So if I have, say, 100 chocolates, 10 would be cocoa and 90 vanilla. But wait, there's more to it.\n\nIt also says that 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest\u2014does that mean the rest after considering cocoa? Because earlier, 10% are cocoa, so the rest would be 90% of the total. Oh right, so the 90% rest are the vanilla ones. So 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. \n\nLet me think with numbers. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates. 10 are cocoa, 90 are vanilla. Now, 90% of the vanilla are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. That means 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed. So from the vanilla group, 10% are not squashed. Because 90% are squashed, so 10% remain. So 10% of 90 is 9. \n\nSo out of 100 chocolates, 9 are vanilla and not squashed.

I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. So, there are only two flavors: vanilla and cocoa. That means if I know the percentage of one, I can find the other by subtracting from 100%, right?\n\nThe first piece of information is that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored. So, the rest must be vanilla. Because 100% minus 10% is 90%, so 90% are vanilla. Okay, that part makes sense.\n\nNext, it says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the 'rest' here refers to the vanilla chocolates, right? Because the 10% are cocoa, so the rest (which would be 90%) are vanilla. So, 90% of these vanilla chocolates are squashed. Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again.\n\nOh, wait, the 90% of the rest are squashed. So, 'the rest' is referring to the chocolates after accounting for the cocoa ones. So the rest is 90% of the total chocolates. Of that 90%, 90% are squashed. Oh, wait, so of the vanilla ones, 90% are squashed? Or is it that 90% of the rest (which is the 90%) are squashed?\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" So the 'rest' is the remaining chocolates after 10% cocoa. So, the rest is 90% of the total. Then, 90% of that 90% are squashed. So, squashed vanilla chocolates would be 90% * 90% of total? Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, 90% of the rest (which is 90% of total) are squashed. So, squashed = 90% * 90% = 81% of total chocolates. Wait, no. Wait, no, that would be 81% of the total are squashed. But wait, that can't be right because all the squashed ones are part of the vanilla group.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this with variables. Let me assume the total number of chocolates is 100 for simplicity. That makes percentages easy to work with.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100.\n\nCocoa flavored: 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates.\nVanilla flavored: 100 - 10 = 90 chocolates.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest (which is the vanilla 90) are squashed. So, 90% of 90 is 81. So, 81 vanilla chocolates are squashed. Wait, but wait, the problem says 90% of the rest are squashed, so 90% of 90 is 81, so 81 are squashed. Therefore, the remaining vanilla chocolates (not squashed) would be 90 - 81 = 9.\n\nSo, the percentage of vanilla and not squashed is 9 out of 100, which is 9%. So the answer would be 9%, which is option D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nTotal: 100.\n\nCocoa: 10. So vanilla: 90.\n\nOf these vanilla 90, 90% are squashed. 90% of 90 is 81. So 81 are squashed, 9 are not. So 9 are vanilla and not squashed, which is 9% of the total. So the answer is D)9%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me think again. The question asks for the percentage that are both vanilla and not squashed. So, yes, that's 9%.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the 90% of the rest (vanilla) being squashed implies that 10% are not squashed. Because 100% - 90% =10%. So 10% of the vanilla are not squashed. So 10% of 90 is 9, which is 9%. That matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo yes, the answer is 9%, which is option D.\n",
