      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem says, \"If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x?\" The options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12.\n\nHmm, I think I can solve this by substitution. Since y is given in terms of x, I can plug that into the first equation. So, y is 3x. Let me write down the first equation: 6x - y =24. And since y is 3x, I can replace y with 3x in that equation.\n\nWait, so substituting, it becomes 6x - (3x) =24. Let me compute that. 6x minus 3x is 3x, so 3x equals 24. Oh, wait, that's simple. To find x, I just divide both sides by 3. So x = 24/3. What's 24 divided by 3? That's 8. So x is 8. Let me check the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait a second, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. Substitute y=3x into 6x - y =24. So 6x -3x is indeed 3x. 3x=24, so x=8. Yeah, that's correct.

The question says: If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x? The options are A)8, B)9, C)10, D)11, E)12.\n\nHmm, so I have two equations here. The first one is 6x - y = 24, and the second one is y = 3x. I think I can use substitution since the second equation gives y in terms of x. That should make it easier to solve for x.\n\nWait, substitution method, right. So if y is equal to 3x, I can plug that into the first equation wherever there's a y. Let me write that out. So substituting y in the first equation, I get 6x - (3x) = 24. Because y is 3x, so I replace y with 3x.\n\nNow, simplifying that: 6x minus 3x is 3x. So the equation becomes 3x = 24. Oh, right, then I can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3. So x equals 24 divided by 3, which is 8. So x is 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If x is 8, then y should be 3 times x, so y is 24. Let me plug those back into the first equation to make sure. 6 times 8 is 48. Then subtract y, which is 24. So 48 minus 24 equals 24. Yep, that's correct because the first equation is 24 on the right side. So it all checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.\n",
