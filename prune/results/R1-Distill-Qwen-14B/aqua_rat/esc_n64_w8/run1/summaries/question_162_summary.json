      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this mixture problem. So, the question is about a 10kg mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of this mixture we should remove and replace with pure sand so that the new mixture has equal parts clay and sand. Hmm, equal parts would mean 50% each, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. Oh, wait, the mixture after replacement should have equal quantities of clay and sand. So, after adding sand, the clay and sand should be the same in mass. But wait, the initial mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay. So the initial amounts are 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nSo, let's see. The total mass is 10kg. Let's denote the amount to be removed as x kg. But wait, when we remove x kg of the mixture, we're removing both sand and clay. The mixture is uniform, so the proportion remains the same. So the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x, and clay removed would be 0.7x.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Then, we add back x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want the clay and sand to be equal. So, 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x. Let me write that equation down:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, let's solve for x. Adding 0.7x to both sides gives:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x =4\n\nDivide both sides by 1.4:\n\nx =4 /1.4\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4/(14/10) =4 * (10/14)=40/14=20/7. Wait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the steps again. Because when we remove x kg of the mixture, which is 30% sand, so sand removed is 0.3x, clay removed is 0.7x. Then, we add x kg of pure sand, which is 100% sand.\n\nSo after replacement, the sand is (3 -0.3x) +x =3 +0.7x. Clay is 7 -0.7x. Setting them equal:\n\n3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x \u2192 1.4x=4 \u2192 x=4/(1.4) \u2192 which is 40/14 \u2192 simplifies to 20/7. So x is 20/7 kg.\n\nWait, but 20/7 is about 2.857 kg. So the amount to be removed is 20/7 kg. Let me check the options. Option B is 20/7. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal mixture: 3kg sand, 7kg clay.\n\nAfter removing x kg, we remove 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay. So left with 3-0.3x sand and 7-0.7x clay.\n\nAdding x kg of pure sand, so sand becomes 3-0.3x +x =3 +0.7x.\n\nClay remains at 7-0.7x.\n\nSet 3+0.7x =7-0.7x \u2192 1.4x=4 \u2192 x=4/1.4=40/14=20/7.

To do this, we have to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. The question is asking how much of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced.\n\nHmm, okay. So initially, the mixture is 10 kg. 30% is sand, so that's 3 kg of sand, and 70% is clay, which is 7 kg of clay. The goal is to have equal parts clay and sand, so each should be 5 kg in the end because 10 kg divided by two is 5 kg each.\n\nWait, but how do we get from 3 kg sand and 7 kg clay to 5 kg each? We need to remove some mixture and add pure sand. Because when we remove some of the mixture, we're removing both sand and clay, but adding pure sand will increase the sand content.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote the amount of mixture to be removed as x kg. When we remove x kg of the mixture, we're removing 30% sand and 70% clay.

So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve that equation.\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 1.4:\n\nx = 4 / 1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4.

So we remove 20/7 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 20/7. So the answer should be B.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Initial amounts: 3 kg sand, 7 kg clay.\n2. Remove x kg of mixture, which is 30% sand and 70% clay. So removed sand: 0.3x, clay: 0.7x.\n3. Remaining sand: 3 - 0.3x. Add x kg of sand: so total sand is 3 -0.3x +x = 3 +0.7x.\n4. Remaining clay: 7 -0.7x.\n5. Set 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x. Solve for x.\n\nYes, that seems correct. 3 +0.7x =7-0.7x \u2192 1.4x=4 \u2192 x=4/(1.4)=20/7. So yes, option B is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing sand and clay. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a mixture that's 10kg total. It's 30% sand and 70% clay. So first, I think I should calculate how much sand and clay there are initially.\n\nRight, 30% of 10kg is sand. So 0.3 * 10 = 3kg of sand. And the rest is clay, which is 70% of 10kg. So 0.7 *10=7kg of clay. Got that.\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand. So each should be 5kg because 10kg divided by 2 is 5kg each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the total mixture is 10kg. If we want equal quantities of clay and sand, each would be 5kg, but the total would still be 10kg. So we need to end up with 5kg sand and 5kg clay.\n\nBut the initial state is 3kg sand and 7kg clay. So we need to somehow adjust that. The problem is asking how much of the mixture we need to remove and replace with pure sand to achieve this.\n\nHmm, I remember something about these kinds of problems. They're usually mixture replacement problems. So the idea is to remove some of the mixture and add sand to it. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The mixture we're removing would have both sand and clay in the same proportions as the original mixture, right? Because when you remove some of the mixture, the proportions stay the same unless you add something else. Oh wait, but in this case, after removing, we're replacing it with pure sand. So that changes the composition.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x, and clay removed would be 0.7x.\n\nAfter removing, the remaining mixture would have (3 - 0.3x) kg of sand and (7 - 0.7x) kg of clay. Then, we're adding x kg of pure sand. So the sand after addition would be (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. And the clay remains at (7 - 0.7x) kg.\n\nWe want the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation. Let's bring all terms to one side.\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x -7 =0 \u2192 1.4x -4 =0 \u2192 1.4x =4 \u2192 x=4/(1.4)\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4/(14/10)=4*(10/14)=40/14=20/7. Oh wait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup. So the initial sand is 3kg. We remove 0.3x, so sand becomes 3-0.3x. Then we add x kg of sand, so it's 3-0.3x +x =3+0.7x.\n\nClay is initially 7kg. We remove 0.7x, so it's 7-0.7x. And since we're only adding sand, the clay remains at 7-0.7x.\n\nWe set sand equal to clay: 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x. Adding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7. Subtract 3: 1.4x=4. So x=4/1.4= 40/14=20/7 kg. That's about 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 20/7. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with these problems, you might have to make sure that the final amounts are correct.\n\nSo after removing 20/7 kg of mixture, which is approximately 2.857 kg, we replace it with pure sand. So the new sand is 3 - 0.3*(20/7) + 20/7.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.3 is 3/10. So 0.3*(20/7) = (3/10)*(20/7) = (60/70)=6/7.\n\nSo 3 -6/7 = (21/7 -6/7)=15/7. Then adding 20/7: 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. Correct.\n\nClay: initial 7 kg. We removed 0.7*(20/7)= (7/10)*(20/7)= (140/70)=2 kg. So clay is 7-2=5 kg. So yes, both are 5 kg.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing sand and clay. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a mixture that's 10kg total. It's 30% sand and 70% clay. So first, I think I should calculate how much sand and clay there are initially.\n\nRight, 30% of 10kg is sand. So 0.3 * 10 = 3kg of sand. And the rest is clay, which is 70% of 10kg. So 0.7 *10=7kg of clay. Got that.\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand. So each should be 5kg because 10kg divided by 2 is 5kg each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the total mixture is 10kg. If we want equal quantities of clay and sand, each would be 5kg, but the total would still be 10kg. So we need to end up with 5kg sand and 5kg clay.\n\nBut the initial state is 3kg sand and 7kg clay. So we need to somehow adjust that. The problem is asking how much of the mixture we need to remove and replace with pure sand to achieve this.\n\nHmm, I remember something about these kinds of problems. They're usually mixture replacement problems. So the idea is to remove some of the mixture and add sand to it. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The mixture we're removing would have both sand and clay in the same proportions as the original mixture, right? Because when you remove some of the mixture, the proportions stay the same unless you add something else. Oh wait, but in this case, after removing, we're replacing it with pure sand. So that changes the composition.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x, and clay removed would be 0.7x.\n\nAfter removing, the remaining mixture would have (3 - 0.3x) kg of sand and (7 - 0.7x) kg of clay. Then, we're adding x kg of pure sand. So the sand after addition would be (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. And the clay remains at (7 - 0.7x) kg.\n\nWe want the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve this equation. Let's bring all terms to one side.\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x -7 =0 \u2192 1.4x -4 =0 \u2192 1.4x =4 \u2192 x=4/(1.4)\n\nWait, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4/(14/10)=4*(10/14)=40/14=20/7. Oh wait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup. So the initial sand is 3kg. We remove 0.3x, so sand becomes 3-0.3x. Then we add x kg of sand, so it's 3-0.3x +x =3+0.7x.\n\nClay is initially 7kg. We remove 0.7x, so it's 7-0.7x. And since we're only adding sand, the clay remains at 7-0.7x.\n\nWe set sand equal to clay: 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x. Adding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7. Subtract 3: 1.4x=4. So x=4/1.4= 40/14=20/7 kg. That's about 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 20/7. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with these problems, you might have to make sure that the final amounts are correct.\n\nSo after removing 20/7 kg of mixture, which is approximately 2.857 kg, we replace it with pure sand. So the new sand is 3 - 0.3*(20/7) + 20/7.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.3 is 3/10. So 0.3*(20/7) = (3/10)*(20/7) = (60/70)=6/7.\n\nSo 3 -6/7 = (21/7 -6/7)=15/7. Then adding 20/7: 15/7 +20/7=35/7=5 kg. Correct.\n\nClay: initial 7 kg. We removed 0.7*(20/7)= (7/10)*(20/7)= (140/70)=2 kg. So clay is 7-2=5 kg. So yes, both are 5 kg. Perfect.\n\nSo the correct amount to remove is 20/7 kg, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the initial amounts of sand and clay in the 10 kg mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, we calculate:\n\n- Sand: \\( 0.3 \\times 10 = 3 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay: \\( 0.7 \\times 10 = 7 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nThe goal is to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, which means each should be \\( 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\). To achieve this, we need to remove \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.\n\nWhen \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture is removed, the amounts of sand and clay removed are proportional to their initial percentages:\n\n- Sand removed: \\( 0.3x \\)\n- Clay removed: \\( 0.7x \\)\n\nAfter removal, the remaining amounts of sand and clay are:\n\n- Sand: \\( 3 - 0.3x \\)\n- Clay: \\( 7 - 0.7x \\)\n\nWe then add \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of pure sand, so the final amount of sand becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 - 0.3x + x = 3 + 0.7x\n\\]\n\nThe clay remains at \\( 7 - 0.7x \\). To make the amounts of sand and clay equal, we set:\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + 1.4x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{40}{14} = \\frac{20}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x = \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture must be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve equal quantities of sand and clay.\n\nTo verify, after removing \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\) of the mixture:\n\n- Sand removed: \\( 0.3 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{6}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- Clay removed: \\( 0.7 \\times \\frac{20}{7} = 2 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\nRemaining sand: \\( 3 - \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{15}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\), and after adding \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\) of pure sand:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{7} + \\frac{20}{7} = 5 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\nRemaining clay: \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\, \\text{kg} \\).

And the goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of clay and sand by removing some of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. I need to find out how much of the mixture should be removed and replaced.\n\nWait, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand. The original mixture is 10kg, right? So 30% is sand, which is 3kg, and 70% is clay, which is 7kg. Because 30% of 10kg is 3kg, and 70% is 7kg. So currently, we have more clay than sand.\n\nThe aim is to have equal amounts of clay and sand. So in the end, each should be 5kg because 10kg divided by two is 5kg each. So I need to adjust the mixture so that the clay is reduced from 7kg to 5kg, and sand is increased from 3kg to 5kg.\n\nBut how? Oh, right, the process is to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. So when you remove some of the mixture, you're taking away both sand and clay in the same proportion as they are in the mixture. Then you add pure sand, which only has sand, to make up the difference.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x, and clay removed would be 0.7x. After removal, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Then, we add x kg of pure sand, so the new sand amount is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nNow, we want the sand and clay to be equal. So set 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x. Let me write that equation down:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Let's bring the 0.7x terms to one side. So adding 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7\n\nWhich is 3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x =4\n\nThen, x=4 /1.4. Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 1.4. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4/(14/10)=4*(10/14)=40/14=20/7. Oh wait, 20 divided by 7 is approximately 2.857 kg. So x is 20/7 kg.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in algebra. So starting with 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x. Adding 0.7x to both sides gives 3 +1.4x=7. Then, 1.4x=4, so x=4/(1.4)=20/7. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo the amount to be removed is 20/7 kg. But wait, the question is asking how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced. So the answer is 20/7 kg. Looking at the options, option B is 20/7. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me think again.

Hmm, right.\n\nWait, so initially, the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay. That means in 10kg, sand is 3kg and clay is 7kg. Because 30% of 10 is 3, and 70% is 7. Got that part.\n\nWe need to end up with equal amounts of clay and sand. So the final mixture should have 5kg each. Because 10kg total, 50% each.

When you remove some mixture, you're taking away both sand and clay in the same proportion as they exist in the mixture. Then you add pure sand, which is 100% sand. So the process increases the sand content.\n\nLet me denote the amount to be removed as x kg. So when I remove x kg of the mixture, I'm removing 30% sand and 70% clay.

When you remove some mixture, you're taking away both sand and clay in the same proportion as they exist in the mixture. Then you add pure sand, which is 100% sand. So the process increases the sand content.\n\nLet me denote the amount to be removed as x kg. So when I remove x kg of the mixture, I'm removing 30% sand and 70% clay. So the sand removed is 0.3x, and clay removed is 0.7x.\n\nAfter removal, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x, and the remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Then I add x kg of pure sand, which is 100% sand, so that adds x kg of sand.\n\nSo the new amounts are:\n- Sand: (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x\n- Clay: 7 - 0.7x\n\nWe want these to be equal, so set them equal to each other.\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, solving for x.\n\nLet me combine like terms. Add 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x =4\n\nSo x=4 / 1.4. Let's compute that. 4 divided by 1.4 is the same as 40 divided by 14, which simplifies to 20/7. Oh, because 14*2=28, 40-28=12, so 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check the math. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4 * (10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo x is 20/7 kg. That's the amount of mixture to be removed. Then replaced with pure sand. So the answer should be option B, which is 20/7.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nAfter removing x kg, the remaining mixture is 10 - x kg. Then adding x kg of sand makes it back to 10 kg. So the new sand is original sand minus sand removed plus x kg of sand. Yeah, that part is correct.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer should be B, 20/7.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial mixture. The 10 kg mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, which means it contains 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay. The goal is to make the mixture contain equal amounts of sand and clay, i.e., 5 kg each.\n\nTo achieve this, we denote the amount of mixture to be removed as \\( x \\) kg. When \\( x \\) kg of the mixture is removed, 30% of it is sand, and 70% is clay. Therefore, the amount of sand removed is \\( 0.3x \\), and the amount of clay removed is \\( 0.7x \\). After removal, the remaining sand is \\( 3 - 0.3x \\), and the remaining clay is \\( 7 - 0.7x \\). Then, \\( x \\) kg of pure sand is added, increasing the sand content to \\( (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \\).\n\nTo make the amounts of sand and clay equal, we set up the equation:\n\\[\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n1.4x = 4\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{40}{14} = \\frac{20}{7}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\) kg of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve equal amounts of sand and clay in the final mixture.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a mixture of sand and clay. Let me see what it's asking. Hmm, the mixture is 10 kg total, right? And it's 30% sand and 70% clay. So I need to figure out how much of this mixture I should remove and replace with pure sand so that the mixture ends up with equal parts clay and sand.\n\nWait, wait. So currently, the mixture has 30% sand and 70% clay. That means the amount of sand is 30% of 10 kg, which is 3 kg. And the clay is 70% of 10 kg, so that's 7 kg. Oh right, because 10 * 0.3 is 3, and 10 * 0.7 is 7.\n\nThe goal is to have equal amounts of sand and clay. Since the total mixture is still 10 kg after replacing some, each would need to be 5 kg. Because 5 +5 is 10. So we need to go from 3 kg sand to 5 kg sand, and from 7 kg clay to 5 kg clay. Or wait, no, maybe the other way? Let me think. Oh, no, wait. Because when you remove some mixture and replace it with pure sand, you're adding more sand. So the sand increases, and the clay decreases.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no, because when you remove the mixture, you're taking away both sand and clay. So the amount of clay will decrease by the proportion in the mixture. So let me think again.\n\nSo the initial amounts are sand: 3 kg, clay:7 kg.\n\nWe want to end up with equal parts, so each should be 5 kg. So we need to add 2 kg of sand because 3 +2=5. But wait, no, because when we remove some mixture, we're removing both sand and clay. So the amount of sand after removal plus the added pure sand should equal 5 kg.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model it with variables.\n\nLet me denote x as the amount of mixture to be removed. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, when we remove x kg, we remove 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay.\n\nSo after removal, the sand left is 3 - 0.3x, and the clay left is 7 - 0.7x.\n\nThen, we add x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand is (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x.\n\nThe clay remains at 7 - 0.7x.\n\nWe want the sand and clay to be equal, so set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me solve for x.\n\n3 + 0.7x =7 -0.7x\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n0.7x +0.7x =7-3\n\n1.4x=4\n\nx=4 /1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4 is the same as 40/14, which simplifies to 20/7. Oh wait, 20/7 is approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, but the options are A) 10/7, B)20/7, etc. So that would be option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I set up the equation correctly?\n\nYes, when you remove x kg of the mixture, which is 30% sand, so 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay removed. So the remaining sand is 3-0.3x, and clay is 7-0.7x. Then adding x kg of pure sand (which is 100% sand) gives total sand as (3-0.3x) +x =3+0.7x. So the clay is 7-0.7x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n3 +0.7x =7-0.7x\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 +1.4x =7\n\n1.4x=4\n\nx=4 /1.4=20/7.\n\nYes, that seems right.

Hmm, the question says that there's a 10kg mixture containing 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to find out how much of this mixture should be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the resulting mixture has equal parts clay and sand. \n\nAlright, let's think about what's given. Initially, the mixture is 10kg. 30% is sand, so that's 0.3 *10 = 3kg of sand. The rest, 70%, is clay: 0.7 *10 =7kg clay. So initially, 3kg sand and 7kg clay.\n\nThe goal is to have equal amounts of clay and sand. So, in the end, we want 5kg each, because 5+5=10. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, because if we remove some mixture and replace it with pure sand, the total mass might stay the same? Or does it change? Hmm, the problem says \"removed and replaced,\" so I think the total mass remains 10kg because when you remove some mixture, you add back the same amount, right?\n\nSo the total mass after replacement is still 10kg. We need the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal, which would each be 5kg. Because 5+5=10. So we need to adjust the mixture so that the sand goes up to 5kg, and clay goes down to 5kg.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let\u2019s say we remove x kg of the mixture. Since the mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, when we remove x kg, we're removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. \n\nAfter removing x kg, the remaining mixture is (10 - x) kg. The remaining sand would be 3 - 0.3x kg, and remaining clay would be 7 - 0.7x kg.\n\nThen, we add back x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. The clay remains at (7 - 0.7x) kg.\n\nWe want the final sand and clay to be equal, so:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x.\n\nLet me solve this equation. Let's bring like terms together. \n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x =7\n3 + 1.4x =7\n1.4x=7-3=4\nx=4/(1.4)= 40/14= 20/7 \u2248 2.857 kg.\n\nWait, so x is the amount to remove and replace. So the answer is 20/7 kg, which is option B. \n\nLet me double-check my setup. The initial amounts: 3 sand,7 clay. After removing x kg, we subtract 0.3x sand and 0.7x clay. Then add x sand. So sand becomes 3-0.3x +x =3+0.7x. Clay becomes 7-0.7x. Setting them equal: 3+0.7x=7-0.7x. That's correct. Solving gives x=4/(1.4)=20/7. \n\nSo the correct answer should be B) 20/7.\n",
