      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a retailer selling an appliance. Hmm, let me read it again. The retailer sold it for 40 percent above cost, which is a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out the selling price. The options are A to E, with various numbers.\n\nWait, let's break this down. I remember that gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So if the cost is C, then the selling price S is C plus the profit. Here, the profit is $20, so S = C + 20.\n\nBut the problem also says that the selling price is 40% above cost. Oh right, that means S is 140% of the cost. So S = 1.4 * C. Alternatively, I could write that as S = C + 0.4C.\n\nSo now I have two expressions for S. One is S = C + 20, and the other is S = 1.4C. So I can set them equal to each other: 1.4C = C + 20.\n\nLet me solve for C. Subtract C from both sides: 0.4C = 20. Oh wait, so 0.4 times C equals 20. To find C, I divide both sides by 0.4. 20 divided by 0.4 is... let's see, 20 / 0.4 is the same as 200 divided by 4, which is 50. So C is $50.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the selling price. Oh right, S is 1.4 times C. So 1.4 * 50 is 70. So the selling price is $70. Looking at the options, D is $70.00. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, let me double-check my math. If the cost is $50, then 40% above cost would be 50 + 20 (since 40% of 50 is 20). So yes, 50 + 20 is 70. And the profit is indeed $20. So yeah, that makes sense.\n",

So, the cost is the original price the retailer bought it for. When they sell it for 40% above cost, that 40% is the profit. So, the selling price is cost plus 40% of cost, which equals the cost multiplied by 1.4. But that 40% is the gross profit, which is $20. So, I think the 40% of the cost is $20.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me call the cost 'C'. So, 40% of C is $20. So mathematically, 0.4 * C = 20. To find C, I can divide both sides by 0.4. So, C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So, the cost is $50.\n\nWait, but wait. The selling price is 40% above cost, so it's cost plus 40% of cost. So, that's C + 0.4*C = 1.4*C. So, if C is $50, then the selling price is 1.4 * 50. Let me compute that. 1.4 times 50 is 70. So, the selling price is $70. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is $70.00. So that's the answer. Let me double-check. If cost is $50, selling at 40% above is 50 +20 =70. So yes, gross profit is $20. So, that makes sense.\n",

The question says the retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. I need to find out what price the retailer sold the appliance for. The options are A) $27.30, B) $51.00, C) $63.00, D) $70.00, and E) $91.00.\n\nHmm. I think I should start by understanding what's given. The retailer's selling price is 40% above the cost. That means the selling price is 140% of the cost. Oh wait, because 100% would be the cost, and 40% more makes 140%. So if I denote the cost as C, then the selling price S is S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that this 40% increase resulted in a gross profit of $20.00. Gross profit is the selling price minus the cost. So gross profit P is S - C. Given that P is $20, so 20 = S - C.\n\nWait, but since S is 1.4C, substituting that in, the equation becomes 20 = 1.4C - C. Let me compute that. 1.4C minus C is 0.4C. So 0.4C = 20. To find C, I divide both sides by 0.4. So C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 multiplied by 2.5, because 0.4 is 2/5, so dividing by 2/5 is multiplying by 5/2. Wait, wait, 20 divided by 0.4: 0.4 times 50 is 20, right? Because 0.4 * 50 = 20. So C is $50.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.4 times 50 is 20, yes. So the cost C is $50.
