      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nJack buys 18 sharpeners, which are either white or brown, for a total of 100 rupees. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. The question is, how many white and brown sharpeners did he buy? And there are five options to choose from.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think I need to set up some equations here. Let me think about the variables involved. Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W, and the number of brown ones is B. \n\nWe know that the total number of sharpeners is 18, so the first equation would be W + B = 18.\n\nNow, the second part is about the cost. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Let me denote the cost of each brown sharpener as C rupees. Then, each white sharpener would cost C + 1 rupees.\n\nThe total cost for the white sharpeners would be W*(C+1), and for the brown ones, it would be B*C. The sum of these is 100 rupees. So the second equation is W*(C+1) + B*C = 100.\n\nWait, but I have two equations and three variables here (W, B, C). That might be a problem because usually, the number of equations should match the number of variables. But maybe I can find a way to eliminate one variable.\n\nSince W + B = 18, perhaps I can express B in terms of W. So B = 18 - W. That way, I can substitute into the second equation.\n\nSubstituting B into the second equation: W*(C+1) + (18 - W)*C = 100.\n\nLet me expand that. W*C + W*1 + 18*C - W*C = 100.\n\nWait, the W*C terms would cancel out. So W*C - W*C is zero. So what's left is W + 18C = 100.\n\nHmm, so now I have W + 18C = 100. But I still have two variables here: W and C. How can I find their values?\n\nWait, but I think I can express W in terms of C from this equation. Let me rearrange it: W = 100 - 18C.\n\nBut wait, W and B have to be non-negative integers because you can't buy a negative number of sharpeners. So W must be a positive integer, and so must B.\n\nAlso, since each white costs 1 rupee more than brown, C must be a positive integer as well. Let's see, what possible integer values can C take so that W is a positive integer and B is also positive.\n\nSo, since W = 100 - 18C, and W must be less than or equal to 18 (since there are 18 sharpeners in total), let's find the possible C values.\n\nLet's see, 100 - 18C must be positive and less than or equal to 18.\n\nSo 100 - 18C > 0 \u2192 18C < 100 \u2192 C < 100/18 \u22485.555. So C can be at most 5 since it must be an integer.\n\nWait, but wait, if C is 5, then W = 100 - 18*5 = 100 -90 = 10. So W would be 10, and B would be 18-10=8. Hmm, that's one of the options, option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that works with the cost. So if C is 5, each brown is 5 rupees, each white is 6. Then the total cost would be 10*6 +8*5=60 +40=100. Yep, that adds up. So that's a valid solution.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other possible values of C. Let's check other integer values.\n\nWhat if C=4? Then W=100-18*4=100-72=28. But that's impossible because W can't be more than 18. So C can't be 4 or lower? Wait, wait, no, wait: 18*4 is 72, so 100-72=28. But W can't be 28 because the total is 18. So that's not possible. So C can't be 4 or lower, because that would make W more than 18.\n\nWait, wait, let me think again. C is the cost of a brown sharpener. So if C is 5, that's okay. What about C=6? Then W=100-18*6=100-108= -8. That's impossible, so C can't be 6 or higher.\n\nWait, but wait, what about C=5? That gives W=10 and B=8, which works. So that's a valid solution.\n\nWait, but are there any other possible C values? Let's see, let's try C=5. So W=10, B=8. That adds up to 18, and the cost is 10*(5+1) + 8*5 = 60 +40=100.\n\nWhat about C=5.555? Well, no, because C must be an integer. So the only possible value is C=5.\n\nSo the answer is W=10, B=8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)10,8\n\nB)9,8\n\nC)7,8\n\nD)5,6\n\nE)11,12\n\nSo option A is 10 white and 8 brown.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that this is the only solution. Let me think about the equation again.\n\nWe had W +18C=100, and W=18 - B.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it differently. Let's consider that the average cost per sharpener is 100/18 \u22485.555. Since each white is 1 more than brown, perhaps the average is somewhere between C and C+1.\n\nBut I think the initial approach is correct. So the only possible integer solution is C=5, W=10, B=8.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n",

Also, he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Hmm, I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nWait, let me break it down. Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, W plus B equals 18 because he bought 18 in total. That's our first equation: W + B = 18.\n\nNext, the cost part. He paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener. Let me think about the prices. Suppose the cost of each brown sharpener is R rupees. Then each white sharpener would cost R + 1 rupees. So the total cost for white sharpeners is W*(R+1), and for brown ones it's B*R.\n\nThe total cost is 100 rupees, so the equation would be W*(R+1) + B*R = 100.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. W + B = 18\n2. W*(R +1) + B*R = 100.\n\nHmm, but I have three variables here: W, B, R. Oh wait, but maybe I can express B in terms of W from the first equation. Since B = 18 - W.\n\nSubstituting B into the second equation: W*(R+1) + (18 - W)*R = 100.\n\nLet me expand that. W*R + W + 18R - W*R = 100. Wait, the W*R terms cancel out. So what's left is W + 18R = 100.\n\nHmm, so W + 18R = 100. But I have only one equation now with two variables. I'm stuck. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express R in terms of W. From W + 18R = 100, rearranged: 18R = 100 - W \u2192 R = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut R has to be a positive number because it's the cost per brown sharpener. Also, since W and B are numbers of sharpeners, they have to be integers. So (100 - W) must be divisible by 18.\n\nLet me think about possible values of W that make (100 - W) divisible by 18. Let's compute 100 divided by 18. 18*5=90, 18*5=90, 18*5=90. 18*5=90, 18*6=108 which is over 100. So 100- W must be a multiple of 18. Let's see:\n\nCheck for W such that 100 - W is divisible by 18. Let's find possible W values.\n\n100 \u00f7 18 is approximately 5.555. So the possible multiples near 100 are 18*5=90, 18*6=108.\n\nWait, 100 - W = 90 \u2192 W=10. Then R = 90/18 = 5. So R=5. So each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, white is 6.\n\nIf W is 10, then B is 8. Let's check the total cost: 10*6 + 8*5 = 60 +40 =100. Yes, that adds up. So W=10, B=8. That's option A.\n\nBut wait, are there other possible W values? Let me check. The next multiple of 18 after 90 is 108, which would require W=100-108= -8, which is impossible. So the only possible value is W=10, B=8.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 10 and 8. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because another option, E, is 11 and 12. Let me check that. If W=11, then B=7. Then R=(100-11)/18 = 89/18 \u22484.944, which isn't an integer. So R wouldn't be a whole number, which makes sense because you can't pay a fraction of a rupee in this context. So option E isn't valid.\n\nOther options: Let's check option D, 5 and 6. W=5, B=13. Then R=(100-5)/18=95/18\u22485.277, not integer. So no. Option C: 7 and 8. W=7, B=11. R=(100-7)/18=93/18=5.166, no. Option B: 9 and 8. W=9, B=9. R=(100-9)/18=91/18\u22485.055, not integer.\n\nSo only option A gives an integer R=5. So the correct answer is A: 10,8.\n",

From W + 18R = 100, rearranged: 18R = 100 - W \u2192 R = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut R has to be a positive number because it's the cost per brown sharpener. Also, since W and B are numbers of sharpeners, they have to be integers. So (100 - W) must be divisible by 18.\n\nLet me think about possible values of W that make (100 - W) divisible by 18. Let's compute 100 divided by 18. 18*5=90, 18*5=90, 18*5=90. 18*5=90, 18*6=108 which is over 100. So 100- W must be a multiple of 18. Let's see:\n\nCheck for W such that 100 - W is divisible by 18. Let's find possible W values.\n\n100 \u00f7 18 is approximately 5.555. So the possible multiples near 100 are 18*5=90, 18*6=108.\n\nWait, 100 - W = 90 \u2192 W=10. Then R = 90/18 = 5. So R=5. So each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, white is 6.\n\nIf W is 10, then B is 8. Let's check the total cost: 10*6 + 8*5 = 60 +40 =100. Yes, that adds up. So W=10, B=8. That's option A.\n\nBut wait, are there other possible W values? Let me check. The next multiple of 18 after 90 is 108, which would require W=100-108= -8, which is impossible. So the only possible value is W=10, B=8.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 10 and 8. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because another option, E, is 11 and 12. Let me check that. If W=11, then B=7. Then R=(100-11)/18 = 89/18 \u22484.944, which isn't an integer. So R wouldn't be a whole number, which makes sense because you can't pay a fraction of a rupee in this context. So option E isn't valid.\n\nOther options: Let's check option D, 5 and 6. W=5, B=13. Then R=(100-5)/18=95/18\u22485.277, not integer. So no. Option C: 7 and 8. W=7, B=11. R=(100-7)/18=93/18=5.166, no. Option B: 9 and 8. W=9, B=9. R=(100-9)/18=91/18\u22485.055, not integer.\n\nSo only option A gives an integer R=5. So the correct answer is A: 10,8.\n\n\nLet the number of white sharpeners be \\( W \\) and the number of brown sharpeners be \\( B \\). The total number of sharpeners is given as \\( W + B = 18 \\). Additionally, the total cost is 100 rupees, and each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be \\( R \\) rupees, so the cost of each white sharpener is \\( R + 1 \\) rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\nW(R + 1) + B(R) = 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( B = 18 - W \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nW(R + 1) + (18 - W)R = 100\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nWR + W + 18R - WR = 100\n\\]\n\nThe \\( WR \\) terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[\nW + 18R = 100\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{100 - W}{18}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( R \\) must be an integer (as it represents the cost in rupees), \\( 100 - W \\) must be divisible by 18. Testing possible values of \\( W \\):\n\n- If \\( W = 10 \\), then \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\), which is divisible by 18. Thus, \\( R = \\frac{90}{18} = 5 \\).\n- Substituting \\( W = 10 \\) and \\( R = 5 \\) into \\( W + B = 18 \\), we find \\( B = 18 - 10 = 8 \\).\n- Verifying the total cost: \\( 10 \\times 6 + 8 \\times 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nTesting other options (e.g., \\( W = 11, 7, 9, 5 \\)) results in non-integer values for \\( R \\), making them invalid. Therefore, the only valid solution is \\( W = 10 \\) and \\( B = 8 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where Jack buys 18 sharpeners, which are either white or brown. He spends a total of 100 rupees. The tricky part is that he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. I need to figure out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown ones as B. So, the first thing I know is that the total number of sharpeners is 18. That gives me the equation W + B = 18.\n\nNext, the cost part. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is x rupees. Then, since each white is 1 rupee more, each white would cost x + 1 rupees. The total cost is 100 rupees. So, the cost equation would be:\n\nTotal cost = (number of white * cost per white) + (number of brown * cost per brown)\nSo, 100 = W*(x+1) + B*x.\n\nBut since W + B =18, maybe I can express B as 18 - W. That way, I can substitute into the cost equation and solve for W and B.\n\nLet me write that out. Substitute B = 18 - W into the cost equation:\n\n100 = W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x.\n\nExpanding that, 100 = Wx + W + 18x - Wx.\n\nWait, let me compute that correctly. So, W*(x+1) is Wx + W. Then (18 - W)*x is 18x - Wx. Adding those together:\n\nWx + W + 18x - Wx. The Wx and -Wx cancel out, leaving W +18x =100.\n\nHmm, so now I have W + 18x = 100. But I have two variables here, W and x, so I need another equation. Or perhaps I can find a way to express x in terms of W, or find integer values that satisfy this.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think differently. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nFrom W + 18x = 100, we can write 18x = 100 - W.\n\nHmm. So x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut x must be an integer because the cost per brown sharpener is in whole rupees, right? Because you can't pay a fraction of a rupee in this context. So (100 - W) must be divisible by 18. Let's see what possible W values would make that true.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: W=10. So 100-10=90. 90 divided by 18 is 5. So x=5. That works. So each brown is 5, white is 6.\n\nLet me check the total cost. 10 white at 6 each is 60, 8 brown at 5 each is 40. 60+40=100. Yep, that adds up. So option A would be a possible solution.\n\nOption B: W=9. 100-9=91. 91/18 is about 5.055, which isn't an integer. So x would not be a whole number. So B is not possible.\n\nOption C: W=7. 100-7=93. 93/18 is 5.166... Not integer. So C is out.\n\nOption D: W=5. 100-5=95. 95/18\u22485.277. Not integer. So D is not possible.\n\nOption E: W=11. 100-11=89. 89/18\u22484.944. Not integer. So E is out.\n\nSo only option A gives an integer value for x. So the answer should be A)10,8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me just confirm. Because the problem says he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown. So if x is 5, white is 6. Then 10 white would be 60, 8 brown would be 40. 60+40=100. Yep, that works. So yeah, option A is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack buying sharpeners. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says he bought 18 sharpeners in total, some white and some brown. The total cost is 100 rupees. Oh, and there's another condition: he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nAlright, let's think about variables. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, the first equation would be the total number: W + B = 18. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the cost part. Each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown one. So, if the cost of a brown sharpener is, say, x rupees, then the white one would be x + 1 rupees. So, the total cost for white sharpeners would be W*(x+1) and for brown ones, it would be B*x. The sum of these should be 100 rupees. So the equation is W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nWait, but I have two equations and three variables (W, B, x). Hmm, but maybe I can express x in terms of W and B. Or perhaps I can find another equation. Oh wait, I have W + B = 18, so I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's say B = 18 - W.\n\nSubstituting B into the cost equation: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100. Let's expand that. \n\nWx + W + 18x - Wx = 100. Oh, the Wx and -Wx terms cancel out. So we're left with W + 18x = 100.\n\nHmm, now I have an equation with two variables again. So I need another way to relate them. Wait, maybe I can find x in terms of W or vice versa. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express x from the equation W + 18x = 100. Let's rearrange it: 18x = 100 - W. So x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut x is the cost per brown sharpener. Since the cost per item is likely an integer, (100 - W) must be divisible by 18. Let me think about possible values of W that make this true.\n\nWait, W is the number of white sharpeners, so it can't be more than 18, and both W and B must be positive integers. So let's list possible W values and see when (100 - W) is divisible by 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find x as a function of W and see what integer values satisfy.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible options given. The options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12. Each option gives W and B. Let me test each option to see which fits.\n\nLet's try option A: W=10, B=8. So total sharpeners 18, correct.\n\nNow, the cost: each white is x+1, each brown x. Total cost: 10*(x+1) +8*x =10x +10 +8x= 18x +10 =100. So 18x=90 \u2192 x=5. So brown is 5, white is 6. So each white is 6. Let me check the total cost: 10*6=60, 8*5=40 \u2192 60+40=100. That works. So option A is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but let me check other options to see if any fit as well.\n\nOption B: W=9, B=9. Wait, no, option B is W=9, B=8? Wait the option says 9,8. So W=9, B=8. Then:\n\nCost: 9*(x+1) +8x =9x +9 +8x=17x +9=100 \u219217x=91 \u2192x=91/17=5.3529\u2026 which is not an integer. So that's not possible because the cost per sharpener should be a whole number. So option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: W=7, B=8. Wait, no, option C is 7,8? So W=7, B=11? Wait no, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9? No, wait, 9+9=18, but option B is 9 and 8, so B=8, W=9? So 9+8=17, which is less than 18. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8 \u2192 total 18.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9? Because 9+9=18. Or wait, the options might list W and B in order, so option B is 9 white and 8 brown? That would add to 17, which is wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the original problem says he bought 18 sharpeners. So W + B must equal 18. So let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 10 white, 8 brown \u2192 total 18.\n\nOption B: 9 white, 8 brown \u2192 17, which is wrong. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm misreading the options. Maybe the options are listed as (W, B), but perhaps the second number is B. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"how many white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\" So the options are presented as (W, B). So for option B, it's 9 and 8. So W=9, B=8 \u2192 17, which is less than 18. So that's impossible. So that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the options.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8 \u2192 18. Correct.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9 \u2192 because 9+9=18? Wait, maybe the option is presented as (W,B) = (9,9). Or perhaps the options are written as two numbers, first being white, second being brown. So for B, it's 9 white and 9 brown. Hmm, perhaps I need to check the options again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 10 white, 8 brown \u2192 18.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 9 white, 8 brown \u2192 17. So that's invalid.\n\nC)7,8 \u2192 7 white, 8 brown \u2192 15. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait the options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12.\n\nWait, perhaps the second number in each option is the number of brown sharpeners, and the first is white. So for option B, it's 9 white and 8 brown, which adds up to 17, which is wrong. So that can't be a correct answer. So the only option that adds up to 18 is option A and E.\n\nWait, let's check E: 11 white, 12 brown \u2192 23, which is way more than 18. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Maybe the options are for the numbers of white and brown, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the options are correct, and only A is possible.\n\nWait, so going back, the first option is A:10 white, 8 brown. Let me see if that works.\n\nIn that case, W=10, B=8.\n\nSo the cost equation: 10*(x+1) +8*x =100 \u219210x +10 +8x=18x+10=100 \u219218x=90 \u2192x=5.\n\nSo each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, white is 6.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack buying sharpeners. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says he bought 18 sharpeners in total, some white and some brown. The total cost is 100 rupees. Oh, and there's another condition: he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nAlright, let's think about variables. Let me assign variables to the unknowns. Let's say the number of white sharpeners is W and the number of brown ones is B. So, the first equation would be the total number: W + B = 18. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the cost part. Each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than each brown one. So, if the cost of a brown sharpener is, say, x rupees, then the white one would be x + 1 rupees. So, the total cost for white sharpeners would be W*(x+1) and for brown ones, it would be B*x. The sum of these should be 100 rupees. So the equation is W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nWait, but I have two equations and three variables (W, B, x). Hmm, but maybe I can express x in terms of W and B. Or perhaps I can find another equation. Oh wait, I have W + B = 18, so I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's say B = 18 - W.\n\nSubstituting B into the cost equation: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100. Let's expand that. \n\nWx + W + 18x - Wx = 100. Oh, the Wx and -Wx terms cancel out. So we're left with W + 18x = 100.\n\nHmm, now I have an equation with two variables again. So I need another way to relate them. Wait, maybe I can find x in terms of W or vice versa. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express x from the equation W + 18x = 100. Let's rearrange it: 18x = 100 - W. So x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut x is the cost per brown sharpener. Since the cost per item is likely an integer, (100 - W) must be divisible by 18. Let me think about possible values of W that make this true.\n\nWait, W is the number of white sharpeners, so it can't be more than 18, and both W and B must be positive integers. So let's list possible W values and see when (100 - W) is divisible by 18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find x as a function of W and see what integer values satisfy.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the possible options given. The options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12. Each option gives W and B. Let me test each option to see which fits.\n\nLet's try option A: W=10, B=8. So total sharpeners 18, correct.\n\nNow, the cost: each white is x+1, each brown x. Total cost: 10*(x+1) +8*x =10x +10 +8x= 18x +10 =100. So 18x=90 \u2192 x=5. So brown is 5, white is 6. So each white is 6. Let me check the total cost: 10*6=60, 8*5=40 \u2192 60+40=100. That works. So option A is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but let me check other options to see if any fit as well.\n\nOption B: W=9, B=9. Wait, no, option B is W=9, B=8? Wait the option says 9,8. So W=9, B=8. Then:\n\nCost: 9*(x+1) +8x =9x +9 +8x=17x +9=100 \u219217x=91 \u2192x=91/17=5.3529\u2026 which is not an integer. So that's not possible because the cost per sharpener should be a whole number. So option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: W=7, B=8. Wait, no, option C is 7,8? So W=7, B=11? Wait no, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9? No, wait, 9+9=18, but option B is 9 and 8, so B=8, W=9? So 9+8=17, which is less than 18. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8 \u2192 total 18.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9? Because 9+9=18. Or wait, the options might list W and B in order, so option B is 9 white and 8 brown? That would add to 17, which is wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the original problem says he bought 18 sharpeners. So W + B must equal 18. So let me check the options again.\n\nOption A: 10 white, 8 brown \u2192 total 18.\n\nOption B: 9 white, 8 brown \u2192 17, which is wrong. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm misreading the options. Maybe the options are listed as (W, B), but perhaps the second number is B. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"how many white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\" So the options are presented as (W, B). So for option B, it's 9 and 8. So W=9, B=8 \u2192 17, which is less than 18. So that's impossible. So that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the options.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8 \u2192 18. Correct.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9 \u2192 because 9+9=18? Wait, maybe the option is presented as (W,B) = (9,9). Or perhaps the options are written as two numbers, first being white, second being brown. So for B, it's 9 white and 9 brown. Hmm, perhaps I need to check the options again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 10 white, 8 brown \u2192 18.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 9 white, 8 brown \u2192 17. So that's invalid.\n\nC)7,8 \u2192 7 white, 8 brown \u2192 15. No, that's not right.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait the options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12.\n\nWait, perhaps the second number in each option is the number of brown sharpeners, and the first is white. So for option B, it's 9 white and 8 brown, which adds up to 17, which is wrong. So that can't be a correct answer. So the only option that adds up to 18 is option A and E.\n\nWait, let's check E: 11 white, 12 brown \u2192 23, which is way more than 18. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Maybe the options are for the numbers of white and brown, but perhaps in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the options are correct, and only A is possible.\n\nWait, so going back, the first option is A:10 white, 8 brown. Let me see if that works.\n\nIn that case, W=10, B=8.\n\nSo the cost equation: 10*(x+1) +8*x =100 \u219210x +10 +8x=18x+10=100 \u219218x=90 \u2192x=5.\n\nSo each brown sharpener is 5 rupees, white is 6. So total cost: 10*6=60, 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Correct. So option A works.\n\nWait, but let's check option D:5 white,6 brown. W=5, B=6. So 5+6=11, which is less than 18. So that's not possible. So D is invalid.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A.\n\n\nJack buys a total of 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for 100 rupees.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total. They're either white or brown. He spent a total of 100 rupees. Also, he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Hmm, I need to find out how many of each he bought.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and brown as B. So, W plus B equals 18 because that's the total number he bought. So, equation one: W + B = 18.\n\nNow, about the cost. Each white sharpener costs 1 rupee more than a brown one. Let's let the cost of a brown sharpener be X rupees. Then, a white one would cost X + 1 rupees. \n\nSo, the total cost would be the number of each multiplied by their price. So, the total cost is W*(X+1) + B*X = 100. \n\nWait, because he bought W white and B brown, so yeah, that makes sense. So equation two is W(X+1) + B X = 100.\n\nBut I have two equations and three variables (W, B, X). Hmm, maybe I can express B in terms of W from equation one and substitute into equation two.\n\nFrom equation one, B = 18 - W. So substituting into equation two:\n\nW(X + 1) + (18 - W) X = 100.\n\nLet me expand that. W*X + W*1 + 18X - W X = 100.\n\nWait, the W*X and -W X terms would cancel each other. So that leaves W + 18X = 100.\n\nHmm, so equation now is W + 18X = 100.\n\nBut I have two variables here, W and X. How can I find their values?\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another relation. Because we're dealing with the cost, which must be a positive integer. So X has to be a positive integer, and W and B as well.\n\nLet me think. Let's try to express X in terms of W.\n\nFrom W + 18X = 100, so 18X = 100 - W. So X = (100 - W)/18.\n\nSince X must be an integer (assuming you can't have a fraction of a rupee here, as it's currency), (100 - W) must be divisible by 18.\n\nSo 100 minus W must be a multiple of 18. Let's think about possible values of W that make this happen.\n\nWhat's 100 divided by 18? 18*5=90, 18*5=90, 18*5=90. So 18*5=90, 100-90=10. Wait, wait, maybe I should find possible W such that (100 - W) is divisible by 18.\n\nSo 100 - W = 18k, where k is an integer. So W = 100 - 18k.\n\nBut W has to be between 0 and 18 because he bought 18 sharpeners in total. Let's find the possible k.\n\nIf k=5: 18*5=90, so W=100-90=10. That's possible because W=10 is within 0-18.\n\nk=4: 18*4=72, W=100-72=28. That's more than 18, so not possible.\n\nk=5 is the only possible value because k=6 would give W=100-108= -8, which is impossible.\n\nSo k=5, W=10.\n\nSo then X would be (100 - W)/18 = (100-10)/18=90/18=5. So X=5.\n\nSo the cost of a brown sharpener is 5 rupees, white is 6 rupees.\n\nNow, check the total cost. W=10, B=8.\n\n10*6 + 8*5 = 60 +40=100. Yep, that adds up.\n\nSo the numbers are W=10, B=8.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how many white and brown sharpeners Jack bought. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, some white and some brown. The total cost is 100 rupees. And here's the kicker: he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Hmm, I think I need to set up some equations to solve this.\n\nWait, let me break it down. Let me denote the number of white sharpeners as W and brown ones as B. Since the total is 18, I can write the first equation as:\n\nW + B = 18.\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, the cost part. Let's say the cost of each brown sharpener is x rupees. Then, since each white costs 1 rupee more, each white would cost x + 1 rupees. \n\nThe total cost is 100, so the cost equation would be:\n\nW*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have two equations with two variables, W and B, and another variable x, which is the cost per brown sharpener. But wait, I can express W and B in terms of each other from the first equation. Since W = 18 - B, I can substitute that into the cost equation.\n\nLet me try that substitution. So replacing W with (18 - B) in the cost equation gives:\n\n(18 - B)*(x + 1) + B*x = 100.\n\nExpanding that, I get:\n\n18x + 18 - Bx - B + Bx = 100.\n\nWait, the -Bx and + Bx cancel each other out. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nHmm, so 18x + 18 - B = 100. Let me rearrange this to solve for B.\n\n18x - B = 100 - 18 \u2192 18x - B = 82.\n\nBut from the first equation, I know that B = 18 - W. Alternatively, since W + B = 18, B = 18 - W. Maybe I can express x in terms of B or W.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find another way. Let's see. Let me write down the two equations again.\n\nEquation 1: W + B = 18.\n\nEquation 2: W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nI can rearrange equation 2 as:\n\nWx + W + Bx = 100.\n\nBut since W + B =18, I can factor x from the first two terms:\n\nx(W + B) + W = 100.\n\nWhich becomes x*18 + W = 100.\n\nSo 18x + W = 100.\n\nNow, from equation 1, W = 18 - B. Substituting that into this:\n\n18x + (18 - B) = 100.\n\nHmm, but this seems similar to what I had before. Let me think. Wait, perhaps I can express B in terms of x.\n\nWait, from the equation 18x + W = 100, and W = 18 - B, so substituting that in:\n\n18x + (18 - B) = 100 \u2192 18x +18 - B = 100 \u2192 18x - B = 82.\n\nSo, B = 18x -82.\n\nBut I also know that W + B =18. So W = 18 - B. Substituting B from above:\n\nW = 18 - (18x -82) = 18 -18x +82 = 100 -18x.\n\nHmm, but wait, W and B must be positive integers because you can't buy a negative number of sharpeners. So let's think about possible values for x.\n\nWe have B = 18x -82. But B has to be a positive integer. So 18x -82 >0 \u2192 18x >82 \u2192 x > 82/18 \u22484.555... So x must be at least 5 rupees.\n\nAlso, since W = 100 -18x, that must be positive. So 100 -18x >0 \u2192 18x <100 \u2192 x <100/18 \u22485.555. So x must be less than 5.555.\n\nWait, but x is an integer because you can't pay a fraction of a rupee in this context. So x must be 5.\n\nLet me check that. If x=5, then:\n\nB = 18*5 -82 =90 -82=8.\n\nAnd W =18 - B= 18-8=10.\n\nSo W is 10, B is 8. Let me check the cost.\n\nEach white is 5+1=6 rupees, so 10 *6=60.\n\nEach brown is 5, so 8*5=40.\n\nTotal is 60+40=100. Yep, that adds up.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 10 white and 8 brown. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible x values. x has to be 5 because 5 is the only integer between 4.555 and 5.555. So x=5 is the only possibility.\n\nSo the answer is A)10,8.\n",

He spends a total of 100 rupees. Also, he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown one. Hmm, I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nWait, let me parse that again. So, the variables here are the number of white and brown sharpeners. Let me denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown ones as B. So, the first equation I can write is that W plus B equals 18, since he bought 18 in total. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the cost part is a bit trickier. It says he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than brown. Oh wait, so each white one is more expensive by 1 rupee. So, if I let the cost of a brown sharpener be x rupees, then the cost of a white one would be x + 1 rupees. \n\nSo, the total cost would be the number of white ones times their cost plus the number of brown ones times theirs. So, that's W*(x+1) + B*x. And this total equals 100 rupees. So, the second equation is W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nBut wait, I have two variables here: W and B, and another variable x, the cost of a brown sharpener. Hmm, that's three variables, but I have only two equations. That's a problem because I can't solve for three variables with two equations. Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of one variable. Let me think.\n\nFrom the first equation, W = 18 - B. Because W plus B is 18. So, I can substitute W in the second equation. Let's try that.\n\nSo substituting, the cost equation becomes (18 - B)*(x + 1) + B*x = 100.\n\nLet me expand that. (18 - B)*x + (18 - B)*1 + B*x = 100.\n\nLet me distribute: 18x - Bx + 18 - B + Bx = 100.\n\nWait, the -Bx and + Bx terms cancel each other. So that leaves me with 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nHmm, so 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nLet me rearrange that: 18x - B = 100 - 18 \u2192 18x - B = 82.\n\nHmm, but I still have two variables here: x and B. I need another way to relate them.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express B in terms of x. From the equation 18x - B = 82 \u2192 B = 18x -82.\n\nBut B must be a positive integer because it's the number of sharpeners. Also, since W is 18 - B, W must also be a positive integer. So, B must be less than 18.\n\nWait, let's think about possible x values. The cost x for brown sharpeners must be such that when multiplied by the number bought, it's a reasonable number. Let me see.\n\nSo, B is 18x -82. But B has to be positive, so 18x -82 > 0 \u2192 18x >82 \u2192 x>82/18 \u2192 x>4.555... So x must be at least 5, since it's in rupees and can't be a fraction.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If x is 5, then B = 18*5 -82 = 90 -82=8. So B=8. Then W=18-8=10.\n\nLet me check if that works with the cost.\n\nEach white is x+1 =6 rupees. So 10 white sharpeners would cost 10*6=60. 8 brown at 5 each would be 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Yes, that adds up.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check x=5, B=8. Then W=10. That's option A: 10 and 8. So that's one possibility.\n\nBut let me check x=6. Then B=18*6 -82=108-82=26. But that can't be, because W would be 18-26= -8, which is impossible. So x can't be 6.\n\nWait, but what about x=4? Let me see. B=18*4 -82=72-82= -10. That's negative, which is impossible. So x must be at least 5.\n\nWait, but what if x is 5.5? Well, the problem probably expects integer values for x, because you can't have half a rupee in this context. So x=5 is the only possible integer that works.\n\nSo then, the numbers are W=10, B=8. So option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12.\n\nSo option A is 10 white and 8 brown. That seems to fit.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. Are there any other x values that could satisfy B being a positive integer less than 18?\n\nLet me try x=5: B=8, which is fine.\n\nx=6: B=26, which is way over 18, so no.\n\nx=4: B=-10, which is invalid.\n\nSo x=5 is the only valid integer solution.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10,8.\n",

(18 - B)*x + (18 - B)*1 + B*x = 100.\n\nLet me distribute: 18x - Bx + 18 - B + Bx = 100.\n\nWait, the -Bx and + Bx terms cancel each other. So that leaves me with 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nHmm, so 18x + 18 - B = 100.\n\nLet me rearrange that: 18x - B = 100 - 18 \u2192 18x - B = 82.\n\nHmm, but I still have two variables here: x and B. I need another way to relate them.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express B in terms of x. From the equation 18x - B = 82 \u2192 B = 18x -82.\n\nBut B must be a positive integer because it's the number of sharpeners. Also, since W is 18 - B, W must also be a positive integer. So, B must be less than 18.\n\nWait, let's think about possible x values. The cost x for brown sharpeners must be such that when multiplied by the number bought, it's a reasonable number. Let me see.\n\nSo, B is 18x -82. But B has to be positive, so 18x -82 > 0 \u2192 18x >82 \u2192 x>82/18 \u2192 x>4.555... So x must be at least 5, since it's in rupees and can't be a fraction.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. If x is 5, then B = 18*5 -82 = 90 -82=8. So B=8. Then W=18-8=10.\n\nLet me check if that works with the cost.\n\nEach white is x+1 =6 rupees. So 10 white sharpeners would cost 10*6=60. 8 brown at 5 each would be 8*5=40. 60+40=100. Yes, that adds up.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check x=5, B=8. Then W=10. That's option A: 10 and 8. So that's one possibility.\n\nBut let me check x=6. Then B=18*6 -82=108-82=26. But that can't be, because W would be 18-26= -8, which is impossible. So x can't be 6.\n\nWait, but what about x=4? Let me see. B=18*4 -82=72-82= -10. That's negative, which is impossible. So x must be at least 5.\n\nWait, but what if x is 5.5? Well, the problem probably expects integer values for x, because you can't have half a rupee in this context. So x=5 is the only possible integer that works.\n\nSo then, the numbers are W=10, B=8. So option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are A)10,8; B)9,8; C)7,8; D)5,6; E)11,12.\n\nSo option A is 10 white and 8 brown. That seems to fit.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. Are there any other x values that could satisfy B being a positive integer less than 18?\n\nLet me try x=5: B=8, which is fine.\n\nx=6: B=26, which is way over 18, so no.\n\nx=4: B=-10, which is invalid.\n\nSo x=5 is the only valid integer solution.\n\nSo the answer should be A)10,8.\n\n\nJack buys a total of 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for 100 rupees. Let the number of white sharpeners be \\( W \\) and the number of brown sharpeners be \\( B \\). From the problem, we have:\n\n1. \\( W + B = 18 \\) (total number of sharpeners).\n2. The cost equation: \\( W(x + 1) + Bx = 100 \\), where \\( x \\) is the cost of each brown sharpener, and \\( x + 1 \\) is the cost of each white sharpener.\n\nSubstituting \\( W = 18 - B \\) into the cost equation gives:\n\\[\n(18 - B)(x + 1) + Bx = 100\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n18x + 18 - B = 100\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\n18x - B = 82\n\\]\nFrom this, \\( B = 18x - 82 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack buying sharpeners. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. Jack buys 18 sharpeners, which are white and brown. He spends a total of 100 rupees. The key point is that he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than each brown one. Hmm, I need to find out how many white and brown sharpeners he bought.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think I should set up some variables. Let me denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown ones as B. So, the total number of sharpeners is 18, which means W plus B equals 18. That's equation one: W + B = 18.\n\nNext, the cost part. Each white sharpener costs more than each brown by 1 rupee. Let me think about this. Let's say the cost of a brown sharpener is x rupees. Then the cost of a white one would be x + 1 rupees because it's 1 rupee more. So, the total cost for white sharpeners would be W*(x+1), and for brown, it's B*x. The total cost is 100, so adding those together gives W*(x+1) + B*x = 100.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. W + B = 18\n2. W(x+1) + Bx = 100\n\nHmm, but I have three variables here: W, B, and x. I need another equation or a way to eliminate a variable. Wait, maybe I can express B in terms of W from the first equation. Since B = 18 - W.\n\nSubstituting B into the second equation, we get:\nW(x +1) + (18 - W)*x = 100\n\nLet me expand this:\nWx + W + 18x - Wx = 100\n\nWait, the Wx and -Wx terms cancel each other out. So I'm left with W + 18x = 100.\n\nHmm, so now I have W + 18x = 100. But I still have two variables here. I need another relation. Oh, wait, perhaps I can express x in terms of W or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I can find the total cost another way. Let's see, each white is x+1 and each brown is x. So the total cost is (x+1)*W + x*B = 100.\n\nBut B is 18 - W, so substituting that in:\n(x+1)*W + x*(18 - W) = 100.\n\nLet me distribute that:\nxW + W + 18x - xW = 100.\n\nAgain, xW cancels with -xW, so W + 18x = 100.\n\nSo same as before. Hmm, so I have W + 18x = 100. But I need to find integer values for W and B, since you can't buy a fraction of a sharpener.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe I can express x in terms of W.\n\nFrom W + 18x = 100, we can rearrange to 18x = 100 - W. So x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nSince x must be a positive number, and W must be less than 18 because B is positive.\n\nWait, but x is the cost per brown sharpener. Let me think about possible integer values for W and B. Let's see, perhaps I can try each option and see which fits.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=9? Wait, no, B is 8 here, because 9+8=17? Wait, wait, wait, no, wait the first option is A)10,8 \u2192 total 18? 10+8=18. Oh right.\n\nLet me test each option.\n\nOption A: W=10, B=8.\n\nThen, total cost is 10*(x+1) + 8*x = 10x +10 +8x = 18x +10.\n\nThis must equal 100. So 18x +10 =100 \u2192 18x=90 \u2192 x=5. So each brown is 5, white is 6. Let's check if 10*6 +8*5 = 60 +40=100. Yes, that works. So option A is a possible solution.\n\nWait, but let's check other options to see if any also fit, because sometimes there might be multiple solutions.\n\nOption B: W=9, B=9? Wait no, option B is 9,8? Wait no, the options are A)10,8, B)9,8. So B is 9 white and 8 brown? Wait, no, B is 9 and 8? Wait, wait, the options list W and B. So B) is 9 white, 8 brown? Because 9+8=17, which is not 18. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, the options are: for example, option A is 10 white and 8 brown, which is 18. So option B is 9 white and 9 brown? Because 9+9=18? Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8 \u2192 18? 10+8=18? 18 yes. So total is 18.\n\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=8 \u2192 9+8=17. That's not 18. So that's not possible. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me read again.\n\nThe options are:\nA)10,8 \u2192 W=10, B=8\nB)9,8 \u2192 W=9, B=8 (Wait, 9+8=17, not 18. So that's invalid. So option B can't be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again. Oh wait, perhaps the second number is the count of brown, and the first is white. So for each option, first is W, second is B.\n\nSo option B is 9 white and 8 brown: 9+8=17, which is less than 18. So that can't be right. So that's not a valid option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says Jack buys 18 sharpeners. So any option where W + B is not 18 can't be correct. So looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 10+8=18 \u2192 valid.\n\nOption B: 9+8=17 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption C:7+8=15 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption D:5+6=11 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOption E:11+12=23 \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So only option A is valid. Hmm, but that's not possible because the problem is presented as a multiple-choice, implying that one of the options is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The options are:\n\nA)10,8 \u2192 18.\n\nB)9,9 \u2192 18?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread option B as 9,8. Let me check the user input again.\n\nLooking back: the options are:\n\nA)10,8\n\nB)9,8\n\nC)7,8\n\nD)5,6\n\nE)11,12\n\nWait, all except A and E have W + B less than 18. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go back to the problem. Let me re-express the equations.\n\nWe have W + B = 18.\n\nTotal cost: W*(x+1) + B*x =100.\n\nSubstituting B=18-W:\n\nW(x+1) + (18-W)x =100.\n\nExpanding: Wx + W +18x -Wx =100 \u2192 W +18x =100.\n\nSo W = 100 -18x.\n\nBut since W must be positive and less than 18, and x must be positive, let's see possible x values.\n\nWe can write x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nBut W must be such that x is positive and an integer? Or maybe not necessarily integer, but the total cost must be 100.\n\nWait, but the cost per sharpener could be fractional. However, in reality, perhaps the cost is in whole rupees. Let me think.\n\nIf x is the cost of a brown sharpener, and each white is x+1, then the cost per brown must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a rupee in this context.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that the cost is an integer. Hmm, but in real-life scenarios, prices are in whole numbers. So perhaps x is an integer.\n\nSo let's assume x is an integer. So (100 - W) must be divisible by 18, because x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nSo 100 - W must be a multiple of 18.\n\nLet me compute possible W values where (100 - W) is divisible by 18.\n\nPossible W must be between 0 and 18.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n100 mod 18 is equal to 100 /18 = 5*18=90, 100-90=10. So 100 mod 18 is 10. So 100 = 5*18 +10.\n\nSo 100 - W must be a multiple of 18. So 100 - W = 18k, where k is an integer.\n\nSo W =100 -18k.\n\nBut W must be \u22650 and \u226418.\n\nSo let's find k such that W is in that range.\n\n100 -18k \u22650 \u2192 18k \u2264100 \u2192 k \u22645.555... So k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nLet's compute W for each possible k:\n\nk=5 \u2192 W=100-90=10 \u2192 B=8. So x = (100 -10)/18=90/18=5. So each brown is 5, white is 6. So total cost:10*6 +8*5=60+40=100. That works.\n\nk=4 \u2192 W=100-72=28. But W can't be 28 because B would be 18-28= -10, which is invalid. So no.\n\nk=3 \u2192 W=100-54=46 \u2192 B=18-46=-28 invalid.\n\nk=2 \u2192 W=100-36=64 \u2192 B= -46 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1 \u2192 W=82 \u2192 B= -64 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=0 \u2192 W=100 \u2192 B= -82 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the only valid solution is when k=5 \u2192 W=10, B=8. So the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but what about when k=6? 18*6=108 \u2192 W=100-108= -8 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the only possible solution is W=10, B=8. Which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",

So (100 - W) must be divisible by 18, because x = (100 - W)/18.\n\nSo 100 - W must be a multiple of 18.\n\nLet me compute possible W values where (100 - W) is divisible by 18.\n\nPossible W must be between 0 and 18.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n100 mod 18 is equal to 100 /18 = 5*18=90, 100-90=10. So 100 mod 18 is 10. So 100 = 5*18 +10.\n\nSo 100 - W must be a multiple of 18. So 100 - W = 18k, where k is an integer.\n\nSo W =100 -18k.\n\nBut W must be \u22650 and \u226418.\n\nSo let's find k such that W is in that range.\n\n100 -18k \u22650 \u2192 18k \u2264100 \u2192 k \u22645.555... So k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nLet's compute W for each possible k:\n\nk=5 \u2192 W=100-90=10 \u2192 B=8. So x = (100 -10)/18=90/18=5. So each brown is 5, white is 6. So total cost:10*6 +8*5=60+40=100. That works.\n\nk=4 \u2192 W=100-72=28. But W can't be 28 because B would be 18-28= -10, which is invalid. So no.\n\nk=3 \u2192 W=100-54=46 \u2192 B=18-46=-28 invalid.\n\nk=2 \u2192 W=100-36=64 \u2192 B= -46 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=1 \u2192 W=82 \u2192 B= -64 \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=0 \u2192 W=100 \u2192 B= -82 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the only valid solution is when k=5 \u2192 W=10, B=8. So the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but what about when k=6? 18*6=108 \u2192 W=100-108= -8 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the only possible solution is W=10, B=8. Which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n\n\nJack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for a total of 100 rupees. Let the number of white sharpeners be \\( W \\) and the number of brown sharpeners be \\( B \\). The total number of sharpeners is given by:\n\n\\[\nW + B = 18\n\\]\n\nThe cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener. Let the cost of a brown sharpener be \\( x \\) rupees, so the cost of a white sharpener is \\( x + 1 \\) rupees. The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\nW(x + 1) + Bx = 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( B = 18 - W \\) into the cost equation:\n\n\\[\nW(x + 1) + (18 - W)x = 100\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nWx + W + 18x - Wx = 100 \\implies W + 18x = 100\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nW = 100 - 18x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( W \\) and \\( B \\) must be non-negative integers, \\( 100 - 18x \\) must be a multiple of 18. Testing possible values of \\( x \\), the only valid solution is \\( x = 5 \\), which gives:\n\n\\[\nW = 100 - 18(5) = 10, \\quad B = 18 - 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nVerifying the total cost:\n\n\\[\n10(5 + 1) + 8(5) = 10(6) + 8(5) = 60 + 40 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. Among the options, only **A) 10, 8** satisfies the conditions.\n\nAnswer: A",
