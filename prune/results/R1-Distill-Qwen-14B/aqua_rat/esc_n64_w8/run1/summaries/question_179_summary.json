      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nThe question says that the boundary is 1 metre broad around the rectangular plot. The perimeter of the plot is 340 metres, and the rate is 10 per square metre. I need to find the cost, which means I have to calculate the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate.\n\nHmm, wait, I think the boundary is like a strip around the rectangle. So the area I need is the area of this strip. But how do I calculate that? Maybe I can think of it as the area of a larger rectangle minus the area of the original plot.\n\nRight, the original plot has a perimeter of 340 m. Let me denote the length and width of the original plot as L and W. The perimeter formula is 2(L + W) = 340. So L + W = 170.\n\nNow, the boundary is 1m wide, so the larger rectangle (including the boundary) would have a length of L+2 and width of W+2. Wait, because adding 1m on each side, so both length and width increase by 2 meters each. \n\nThe area of the original plot is L*W, and the area including the boundary is (L+2)*(W+2). So the area of the boundary alone would be (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that: L*W + 2L + 2W +4 - L*W = 2L + 2W +4. \n\nWait, simplifying, that's 2(L + W) +4. Oh, because 2L +2W is 2(L+W), and then plus 4 from the 4 in the expansion.\n\nBut from the perimeter, I know L + W is 170. So substituting that in, the area of the boundary is 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the perimeter is 340, which is 2(L+W)=340, so L+W=170. So 2(L+W) would be 340. So the area is 340 +4=344. That makes sense.\n\nSo the area is 344 m\u00b2. The rate is 10 per square metre, so the cost is 344 *10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, when you have a border around a rectangle, especially when it's 1m wide, the area might be calculated differently. Like, perhaps the area is perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the corners. Oh wait, no, in this case, the method I used already accounted for that because when I subtracted the original area from the larger rectangle, the extra area includes all the parts.\n\nSo yeah, the correct area is 344 m\u00b2, cost is 3440. So the answer is C.\n",

Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to find the area of the boundary that needs to be gardened. Since the boundary is 1 metre wide around the rectangular plot, it's like adding a strip around all four sides. \n\nWait, the perimeter is 340 metres. Perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width) = perimeter. So 2*(l + w) = 340. That simplifies to (l + w) = 170. \n\nBut wait, I don't know the individual lengths of the length and width. They could be any pair of numbers that add up to 170. For example, l could be 100 and w 70, or something else. \n\nSo, the area of the boundary... Hmm, maybe I can think of it as the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. \n\nThe original plot has length l and width w. The area is l*w. \n\nThe boundary adds 1 metre on all sides, so the larger rectangle's length would be l + 2 (1m on each side), and width would be w + 2. So the area of the larger rectangle is (l+2)*(w+2). \n\nThe area of the boundary would then be (l+2)(w+2) - l*w. Let me compute that:\n\n(l+2)(w+2) = l*w + 2l + 2w +4. Subtract l*w and you get 2l + 2w +4. \n\nWait, 2l + 2w is 2*(l +w) which is 2*170 = 340. Then add 4, so the area is 344 square metres. \n\nSo the total area to be gardened is 344 m\u00b2. \n\nThe cost is 10 per square metre, so 344 *10 = 3440. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait a second, but could there be another way to think about this? Another approach: the boundary area can also be considered as the sum of the areas of the four sides minus the corners, which are counted twice.\n\nEach of the longer sides is length l, and each shorter side is w. So the four sides would contribute 2*l + 2*w. But when you add 1m all around, each corner is a 1x1 square. There are four corners, so adding 4*1*1=4. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you calculate the perimeter as 2*(l + w) =340, so adding 1m all around, the area of the path is perimeter * width of the path (1m) plus the area of the four corners. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If you have a path around a rectangle, the area is (perimeter * width) + (4 * (width)^2). Because the corners are squares of width x width.\n\nIn this case, width is 1m. So area would be (340 * 1) + (4*(1)^2) = 340 +4=344 m\u00b2. Yep, same as before. So that confirms it. \n\nSo the area is 344, cost is 344 *10 = 3440, which is option C. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 3440. So that's the correct choice. \n\nI think that's solid. No other factors to consider, like the original plot's dimensions, since the problem doesn't require knowing them. The perimeter is given, and the calculation works out regardless of l and w as long as their sum is 170. So the answer must be C.\n",

The perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340, so L + W = 170.\n\nThe area of the original plot is L * W.\n\nNow, when we add a 1-metre boundary around it, the new dimensions become (L + 2) and (W + 2). Because adding 1 metre on each side, so both length and width increase by 2 metres each.\n\nSo the area of the larger rectangle is (L + 2) * (W + 2).\n\nTherefore, the area of the boundary is (L + 2)(W + 2) - L*W.\n\nLet me expand that: L*W + 2L + 2W +4 - L*W = 2L + 2W +4.\n\nSo the area is 2(L + W) +4.\n\nWait, since L + W = 170, that becomes 2*170 +4 = 340 +4= 344.\n\nOh, interesting! So the area of the boundary is 344 square meters.\n\nNow, the rate is 10 per square metre, so the cost is 344 * 10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but why didn't I need the exact length and width? Because when you expand the area of the boundary, the terms involving L*W cancel out, leaving only terms that depend on L + W, which I know from the perimeter. So that's why it worked out without needing individual values of L and W.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 3440.\n\n\nTo calculate the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres at a rate of 10 per square metre, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Perimeter of the plot**: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \\( P = 2(L + W) \\), where \\( L \\) is the length and \\( W \\) is the width. Given \\( P = 340 \\), we find \\( L + W = 170 \\).\n\n2. **Area of the boundary**: The boundary is 1 metre wide, so the new dimensions of the plot including the boundary are \\( (L + 2) \\) and \\( (W + 2) \\). The area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) is \\( (L + 2)(W + 2) \\), and the area of the original plot is \\( L \\cdot W \\). The area of the boundary is the difference:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of boundary} = (L + 2)(W + 2) - L \\cdot W\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying:\n   \\[\n   (L + 2)(W + 2) - L \\cdot W = L \\cdot W + 2L + 2W + 4 - L \\cdot W = 2L + 2W + 4\n   \\]\n   Since \\( L + W = 170 \\), this becomes:\n   \\[\n   2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\, \\text{square metres}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of gardening**: The rate is 10 per square metre, so the total cost is:\n   \\[\n   344 \\times 10 = 3440 \\, \\text{rupees}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the cost of gardening the boundary is **3440 rupees**, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the boundary is 1-metre broad. The plot itself has a perimeter of 340 metres. The rate is 10 per square metre. I need to find the total cost.\n\nWait, so the garden area they're talking about is the boundary around the rectangular plot. That would be a strip of land that's 1 metre wide all around the rectangle. So, the area of this boundary is what I need to calculate, right?\n\nBut wait, how do I find the area of this 1-metre boundary? I remember that when you have a border around a rectangle, the area can be found by subtracting the area of the inner rectangle from the area of the outer rectangle. But in this case, since the border is 1m wide, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me think. If the original plot is a rectangle, and the boundary is 1m around it, the outer dimensions would be increased by 2m on each side. Like, for length and width, each increases by 1m on both ends. So, the outer rectangle's length would be original length + 2, and the width would be original width + 2. But wait, I don't know the original length and width, only the perimeter.\n\nOh right, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). Given that the perimeter is 340m, so 2*(l + w) = 340. So l + w = 170. Hmm, but I don't know l and w individually. That might complicate things because without knowing l and w, I can't find the area of the original plot.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need the original area. Because the area I need is the area of the boundary, which is the area of the outer rectangle minus the inner rectangle. Let me write that down.\n\nArea of boundary = (outer length * outer width) - (inner length * inner width)\n\nSince the boundary is 1m wide, the outer length is inner length + 2m (because you add 1m on each side). Similarly, outer width is inner width + 2m.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nArea = ( (l+2) * (w+2) ) - (l * w )\n\nExpanding the first part: l*w + 2l + 2w +4 - l*w = 2l + 2w +4.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is 2(l + w) +4.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because l + w is 170 (from the perimeter), so substituting that in:\n\nArea = 2*(170) +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nOh, wait a second! That's neat. So the area doesn't depend on the individual length and width, only the perimeter. So regardless of the original dimensions of the plot, as long as the perimeter is 340m, the area of the 1m boundary around it is 344 square metres.\n\nThen, the cost is the area multiplied by the rate. The rate is 10 per square metre. So 344 * 10 = 3440.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I miss anything?\n\n1. Perimeter is 340, so l + w = 170. Correct.\n2. Area of boundary is (l+2)(w+2) - l w = 2l + 2w +4. Correct.\n3. Substituting l + w =170: 2*170 +4=344. Correct.\n4. Cost is 344 *10=3440.

Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres? The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are given as A to E.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost. But wait, how do I find the area of the boundary? Oh right, it's like a border around the rectangle. I remember that when you add a border of uniform width around a shape, the area of the border is the area of the larger shape minus the area of the original shape.\n\nSo, let's think. The plot is rectangular. The perimeter is 340 metres. Let me denote the length and width as l and w. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w) = 340. So l + w = 170. That's one equation.\n\nBut wait, to find the area of the plot, I need both l and w. But I don't have enough information to find l and w individually, right? Because with just one equation, l + w = 170, there are infinitely many possibilities for l and w. So, without more info, can I find the area of the boundary?\n\nWait, maybe I don't need l and w separately. Let me think about the area of the boundary. The boundary is 1 metre wide. So the outer rectangle would have a length of (l + 2) and a width of (w + 2). Because adding 1m on each side. So the area of the outer rectangle is (l+2)(w+2). The area of the original plot is l*w. So the area of the boundary is (l+2)(w+2) - l*w.\n\nLet me expand that: (l*w + 2l + 2w +4) - l*w = 2l + 2w +4. Oh, that's interesting. So the area is 2(l + w) +4. But wait, I know that l + w is 170. So substituting that in, the area is 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is 344 m\u00b2. Then the cost is 344 multiplied by the rate, which is 10 per square metre. So 344 *10 = 3440. That would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when you add a border, the area could be calculated another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the border as a frame. The area would be perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the corners. Wait, no, that's another approach. Let me see.\n\nAnother way: the area of the border is perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). Because when you add a border of width 'a' around a rectangle, the area added is perimeter*a + 4a\u00b2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the cost of gardening around a rectangular plot. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: What will be the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot that has a perimeter of 340 metres? The rate is 10 per square metre. The options are given as A to E.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost. But wait, how do I find the area of the boundary? Oh right, it's like a border around the rectangle. I remember that when you add a border of uniform width around a shape, the area of the border is the area of the larger shape minus the area of the original shape.\n\nSo, let's think. The plot is rectangular. The perimeter is 340 metres. Let me denote the length and width as l and w. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w) = 340. So l + w = 170. That's one equation.\n\nBut wait, to find the area of the plot, I need both l and w. But I don't have enough information to find l and w individually, right? Because with just one equation, l + w = 170, there are infinitely many possibilities for l and w. So, without more info, can I find the area of the boundary?\n\nWait, maybe I don't need l and w separately. Let me think about the area of the boundary. The boundary is 1 metre wide. So the outer rectangle would have a length of (l + 2) and a width of (w + 2). Because adding 1m on each side. So the area of the outer rectangle is (l+2)(w+2). The area of the original plot is l*w. So the area of the boundary is (l+2)(w+2) - l*w.\n\nLet me expand that: (l*w + 2l + 2w +4) - l*w = 2l + 2w +4. Oh, that's interesting. So the area is 2(l + w) +4. But wait, I know that l + w is 170. So substituting that in, the area is 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square metres.\n\nSo the area of the boundary is 344 m\u00b2. Then the cost is 344 multiplied by the rate, which is 10 per square metre. So 344 *10 = 3440. That would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes when you add a border, the area could be calculated another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the border as a frame. The area would be perimeter multiplied by the width of the border plus the corners. Wait, no, that's another approach. Let me see.\n\nAnother way: the area of the border is perimeter * width + 4*(width^2). Because when you add a border of width 'a' around a rectangle, the area added is perimeter*a + 4a\u00b2. In this case, a is 1m. So area = perimeter *1 +4*(1)^2 = 340 +4 = 344 m\u00b2. Yep, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nSo the cost is 344 * 10 = 3440. Looking at the options, C is 3440. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but the options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these.

The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the rate is 10 per square meter. So I need to find the area of this boundary and then multiply by the rate to get the cost.\n\nWait, wait. So the boundary is 1 meter wide. I remember that when you add a border around a rectangle, the area of the border can be calculated in different ways. One approach is to think about the outer rectangle (the plot plus the boundary) minus the inner rectangle (the original plot) to get the area of the boundary.\n\nBut how do I find the dimensions of the outer rectangle? Well, the original plot has a perimeter of 340 meters. Let's denote the length and width of the original plot as L and W, respectively. So the perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340. That simplifies to L + W = 170 meters.\n\nNow, when we add a 1-meter boundary around all sides, the new dimensions become (L + 2) meters in length and (W + 2) meters in width. Because adding 1 meter to each side (left and right for length, front and back for width) increases each by 2 meters.\n\nThe area of the original plot is L * W. The area of the outer rectangle is (L+2)(W+2). So the area of the boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W.\n\nLet me expand that: (LW + 2L + 2W +4) - LW. The LW terms cancel out, leaving 2L + 2W +4. Which can be written as 2(L + W) +4.\n\nWait, we already know that L + W is 170. So substituting that in: 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters. So the area of the boundary is 344 m\u00b2.\n\nThe cost is then 344 multiplied by 10 per square meter. That's 344 *10 = 3440. So the cost should be 3440, which would correspond to option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Another approach is to consider the boundary as the sum of the areas along each side. The boundary would consist of two lengths each of (L + 2) meters and 1 meter wide, and two widths each of (W + 2) meters and 1 meter wide, but wait, no, that might not be the right way. Or maybe it's the perimeter multiplied by the width of the boundary. Wait, the formula for the area of a border around a rectangle is perimeter * width of border plus the area added at the corners. Oh wait, no, because the corners are squares of width squared each. So maybe the area is perimeter * width + 4*(width)^2. Wait, let's think.\n\nPerimeter is 340 meters, and the width is 1 meter. So perimeter * width is 340*1 = 340. Then the four corners: each is a 1x1 square, so 4*(1*1) =4. So total area is 340 +4=344. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo yes, 344 m\u00b2.
