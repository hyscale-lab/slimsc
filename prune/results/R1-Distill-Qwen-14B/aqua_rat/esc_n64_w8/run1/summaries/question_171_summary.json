      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about magazine subscriptions and cover prices. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I think I should figure out what the total cover price would be without the subscription discount. Because the subscription is cheaper by 25%, that means you're paying 75% of the cover price total. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me make sure. If the subscription cost is a saving of 25%, that implies that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. So, the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues.\n\nSo, mathematically, I can represent this as:\n\nSubscription price = Total cover price \u00d7 (100% - 25%)\nSo, $42 = Total cover price \u00d7 0.75\n\nWait, that makes sense. So to find the total cover price, I can rearrange the equation. Total cover price would be $42 divided by 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 times 4 is 168, divided by 3 is 56. Oh, so the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.\n\nWait, that's if I'm understanding correctly. So each issue's cover price is 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 56 divided by 15.\n\nWell, 15 times 3 is 45, 15 times 3.7 is 55.5. So 56 divided by 15 is approximately 3.7333... So about $3.73 per issue.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is $3.73. But let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky.\n\nWait, another approach: The subscription is 25% off the total cover price. So, the total cover price is 42 / 0.75 = 56. Then per issue, 56 /15 is about 3.733, so E is $3.73.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages. The saving is 25% of the cover price. So, the subscription is 75% of the cover price. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the subscription cost is the amount you save. Let me think again. If the cover price for 15 issues is X, then the saving is 25% of X, which is 0.25X. So the subscription price is X minus 0.25X, which is 0.75X. So 0.75X = 42, so X is 42 /0.75 =56. So yes, same as before.\n\nSo each issue's cover price is 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that exactly.\n\n15 times 3 is 45. 56 minus 45 is 11. So 3 and 11/15. 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333. So 3.7333, which is about $3.73.\n\nLooking at the options, E is $3.73. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check my calculation for 56 divided by 15. Let me do it step by step.\n\n56 divided by 15: 15 goes into 56 three times (3*15=45), subtract 45 from 56, you get 11. Bring down a zero: 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (7*15=105), subtract, get 5. Bring down another zero: 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (3*15=45), subtract, get 5. So it's 3.7333... So about $3.73, which is option E.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E.\n",

Hmm, let's see what the question says. \n\nAlright, the subscription is for 15 issues, and it costs $42.00. That's the total price you pay for all 15. But wait, it says that this represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Oh right, so the subscription price is 25% off the total cover price. That means the $42 is 75% of what you'd pay if you bought each issue individually.\n\nWait, let me think again. If 25% is saved, then the subscription price is 75% of the cover price total. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%. So the $42 is 75% of the original total.\n\nSo, I need to find the total cover price for 15 issues first.

Hmm, 0.75 is three quarters, so dividing by 0.75 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. \n\n42 * (4/3) is... let's see. 42 divided by 3 is 14, and 14 times 4 is 56. So, T is $56.00. \n\nWait, that makes sense because 75% of 56 is 42. Let me check: 56 * 0.75 is indeed 42, yes.\n\nNow, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.

Divided by 15, that's 56/15. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n15 into 56: 3 times 15 is 45. 56-45 is 11. Bring down a zero, so 110 divided by 15 is 7 (15*7=105), remainder 5. Bring down another zero, 50 divided by 15 is 3 (15*3=45), remainder 5 again. So it's 3.7333... So approximately $3.73.\n\nSo the correct answer is E, which is $3.73. But wait, let me think again because sometimes in these problems, it's easy to confuse what's being saved. \n\nThe problem says the subscription is a saving of 25% of the cover prices.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about magazine subscriptions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find the cover price per issue.\n\nWait, so normally, without the subscription, each issue would cost more, right? And by subscribing, you save 25% on the total cover price. So the $42 is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me think about how percentages work here. If the subscription is a 25% saving, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%. So, the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, 75% of T is $42. So, 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nCalculating that: 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is three-fourths, so 42 divided by (3/4) is the same as 42 multiplied by (4/3). Let me compute that. 42 * 4 = 168, and 168 divided by 3 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nWait, that means the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide this total by 15. So, 56 divided by 15.\n\nLet me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45). Subtract 45 from 56, which leaves 11. Bring down a zero to make it 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (15*7=105). Subtract, get 5. Bring down another zero, making it 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (15*3=45). Subtract, get 5 again. So it's 3.733... repeating.\n\nWait, so 56 / 15 is approximately 3.7333. Hmm, but let me check the options. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nWait, I got 3.7333, which is about 3.73. But that's option E. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if each issue's cover price is around $3.73, then 15 issues would be 15*3.73 = 55.95, which is about $56. So that seems right. But wait, let me check again because the options don't seem to match what I thought.\n\nWait, but the subscription is $42 for 15 issues, which is a 25% saving. So the total without discount is $56. So each issue is 56/15 = approx 3.73. So that would make the cover price per issue around $3.73, which is option E.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have higher numbers. Let me double-check my calculations. Because 25% saving on the total cover price would mean the subscription is cheaper, which it is\u2014$42 is less than $56. So that makes sense.\n\nWait another way: if each issue is $3.73, then 15 issues would be 3.73 *15. Let me calculate that. 3.73 *10 is 37.30, 3.73*5 is 18.65. Sum is 37.30 +18.65=55.95, which is approximately $56, so correct.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 3.73, which matches. But I'm a bit uncertain because the other options are higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the percentages. Let me think again. The subscription is 25% off the cover price, meaning the subscription is 75% of the cover price. So, 42 = 0.75*T, where T is the total cover price. So T=42/0.75=56. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: The saving per issue is 25%, so the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price. So each subscription issue is 0.75*cover_price. Then, total subscription is 15 * (0.75 * cover_price) = 42. So 15 *0.75 *cover_price =42.\n\n15 *0.75 is 11.25. So 11.25 * cover_price =42. So cover_price =42/11.25.\n\nWait, 42 divided by 11.25. Let me compute that. 11.25 is 45/4. So 42 divided by (45/4) is 42*(4/45) = (168)/45. Let's compute that: 45*3=135, 45*3.7=166.5, 45*3.7333= 168. So 3.7333, which is about 3.73.\n\nSo again, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which is option E. But wait, the options are A:7.73, B:6.73, C:5.73, D:4.73, E:3.73.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n",

So the $42 is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me think about how percentages work here. If the subscription is a 25% saving, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving is 75%. So, the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, 75% of T is $42. So, 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75.\n\nCalculating that: 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is three-fourths, so 42 divided by (3/4) is the same as 42 multiplied by (4/3). Let me compute that. 42 * 4 = 168, and 168 divided by 3 is 56. So T is $56.\n\nWait, that means the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. Now, to find the cover price per issue, I divide this total by 15. So, 56 divided by 15.\n\nLet me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45). Subtract 45 from 56, which leaves 11. Bring down a zero to make it 110. 15 goes into 110 seven times (15*7=105). Subtract, get 5. Bring down another zero, making it 50. 15 goes into 50 three times (15*3=45). Subtract, get 5 again. So it's 3.733... repeating.\n\nWait, so 56 / 15 is approximately 3.7333. Hmm, but let me check the options. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nWait, I got 3.7333, which is about 3.73. But that's option E. But wait, that doesn't make sense because if each issue's cover price is around $3.73, then 15 issues would be 15*3.73 = 55.95, which is about $56. So that seems right. But wait, let me check again because the options don't seem to match what I thought.\n\nWait, but the subscription is $42 for 15 issues, which is a 25% saving. So the total without discount is $56. So each issue is 56/15 = approx 3.73. So that would make the cover price per issue around $3.73, which is option E.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have higher numbers. Let me double-check my calculations. Because 25% saving on the total cover price would mean the subscription is cheaper, which it is\u2014$42 is less than $56. So that makes sense.\n\nWait another way: if each issue is $3.73, then 15 issues would be 3.73 *15. Let me calculate that. 3.73 *10 is 37.30, 3.73*5 is 18.65. Sum is 37.30 +18.65=55.95, which is approximately $56, so correct.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 3.73, which matches. But I'm a bit uncertain because the other options are higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I inverted the percentages. Let me think again. The subscription is 25% off the cover price, meaning the subscription is 75% of the cover price. So, 42 = 0.75*T, where T is the total cover price. So T=42/0.75=56. So that's correct.\n\nAnother approach: The saving per issue is 25%, so the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price. So each subscription issue is 0.75*cover_price. Then, total subscription is 15 * (0.75 * cover_price) = 42. So 15 *0.75 *cover_price =42.\n\n15 *0.75 is 11.25. So 11.25 * cover_price =42. So cover_price =42/11.25.\n\nWait, 42 divided by 11.25. Let me compute that. 11.25 is 45/4. So 42 divided by (45/4) is 42*(4/45) = (168)/45. Let's compute that: 45*3=135, 45*3.7=166.5, 45*3.7333= 168. So 3.7333, which is about 3.73.\n\nSo again, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which is option E. But wait, the options are A:7.73, B:6.73, C:5.73, D:4.73, E:3.73.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription price of $42.00 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price for 15 issues. This means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Let the total cover price for 15 issues be \\( T \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times T = 42\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{42}{0.75} = 56\n\\]\n\nThus, the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. To find the cover price per issue, divide this total by 15:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cover price per issue} = \\frac{56}{15} \\approx 3.73\n\\]\n\nThis matches option E. The calculations confirm that the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73.\n\nAnswer: E",

The question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find out what the cover price per issue is.\n\nWait, so normally, if you buy each issue separately, you pay the cover price each time. But when you subscribe, you get a discount of 25%, meaning you save 25% on the total cover price. So the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me write down what I know. The subscription price is $42.00. This is after a 25% discount. So the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me denote the total cover price for 15 issues as T. Then, 42 is 75% of T. So, 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can rearrange that. T equals 42 divided by 0.75.\n\nLet me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4. So dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = ?\n\nWait, 42 divided by 3 is 14. 14 multiplied by 4 is 56. So T is $56. That's the total cover price for 15 issues without the discount.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I need to divide this total by 15. So 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, which leaves 11. So 3. something. 15 * 3.73 is 56? Wait, 15 * 3 is 45. 15 * 0.73 is 10.95. So 45 +10.95 = 55.95, which is about 56. So 56 divided by 15 is approximately 3.7333...\n\nWait, that would make the cover price per issue around $3.73. But wait, looking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, let me double-check. Because 15 times 3.73 is 55.95, which is just a little less than 56. So that's about right.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me go through it again. The subscription is $42, which is 25% off the cover price. So the cover price would be the original total without discount.\n\nSo the equation is: Subscription Price = Cover Total * (1 - discount rate). Here, discount is 25%, so 0.25. So Subscription = Cover Total * 0.75.\n\nSo Cover Total = Subscription / 0.75 = 42 / 0.75. Which is 56, as I had before. So each issue's cover price is 56 /15, which is approximately 3.7333.\n\nLooking at the options, E is $3.73. But wait, the options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73.\n\nWait, but wait, that would make E the correct answer. But wait, that seems a bit low. Because if 15 issues at $3.73 each would be 15*3.73 = $55.95. So the original price is $55.95, and the subscription is $42, which is a $13.95 discount. Let me see what percentage that is. 13.95 is what percentage of 55.95?\n\nCalculate (13.95 /55.95)*100. Let me approximate. 13.95 /55.95 is roughly 0.25, which is 25%. That's correct because the problem states a 25% saving. So the math checks out.\n\nWait, but the options have E as $3.73, which is exactly what I got. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: Maybe the saving per issue is 25%, not the total. But no, the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So it's 25% off the total.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is E) $3.73.\n",

Let me compute 56/15 exactly. 15 *3.73 is 55.95. Because 3.73 *15 = (3*15) + (0.73*15). 3*15=45, 0.73*15 is 10.95. 45 +10.95=55.95. So 56 is 55.95 +0.05, so 3.73 + (0.05/15). 0.05/15 is about 0.0033. So 3.7333... So the exact value is approximately 3.7333, so $3.73 is the correct option. So E is the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription price of $42 represents a 25% saving compared to the total cover price. This means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues. Let the total cover price be \\( X \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\cdot X = 42\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{42}{0.75} = 56\n\\]\n\nThe total cover price for 15 issues is $56. To find the cover price per issue, divide this total by the number of issues:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cover price per issue} = \\frac{56}{15} \\approx 3.7333\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73. Among the given options, the closest match is **E) $3.73**.\n\nAnswer: E",

The question says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and that this represents a 25% saving compared to buying each issue at the cover price. I need to find the cover price per issue.\n\nWait, so the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue individually because you're getting a discount. The discount is 25%, which I think means that the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price of all 15 issues. So, if I let the total cover price be something, the subscription price is 75% of that total.\n\nLet me write this down. Let me call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. The subscription is $42, which is 25% off, so it's 75% of T. So, 0.75 * T = 42. To find T, I can rearrange that. T = 42 / 0.75.\n\nCalculating that... 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is the same as 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = 56. Oh, wait, so the total cover price for 15 issues is $56.\n\nNow, to find the cover price per issue, I divide the total by the number of issues. So 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 goes into 56 three times (15*3=45), with a remainder of 11. So 3 and 11/15, which is 3.733... dollars per issue.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is $3.73. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, another approach. Maybe I should think about it differently. The subscription is a 25% saving, which means you pay 75% of the original price. So the subscription cost is 75% of the total cover price. So, 42 = 0.75 * total. So total is 42 / 0.75 = 56, same as before.\n\nThen 56 /15 is approximately 3.733. So the cover price per issue is about $3.73. So option E is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

I need to find out what the cover price per issue is. The options are A to E, with various dollar amounts.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, the subscription is cheaper than buying each issue individually. The saving is 25%, which means the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues. So, the $42 is what you pay after the discount.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of percentages.

So, $42 is 75% of the total cover price for 15 issues.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation. Let's say the total cover price is T. So, 75% of T equals 42. So, 0.75 * T =42.
