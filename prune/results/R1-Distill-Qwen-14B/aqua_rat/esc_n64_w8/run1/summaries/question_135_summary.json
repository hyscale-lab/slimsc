      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find out how many employees there are. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nAlright, let's think about what variables we have. Let me denote the number of employees as N. The original contribution per employee is what I'll call C. So, the total contribution is N multiplied by C, and that equals 6 lakh. So, my first equation is N * C = 600,000.\n\nNow, the second scenario is when each employee contributes Rs. 60 more. So each person's contribution becomes C + 60. The total in this case is N*(C +60) = 624,000. Because 6.24 lakh is 624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. N * C = 600,000\n2. N*(C + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate N*C. Let's see: \n\nN*(C +60) - N*C = 624,000 - 600,000\nThat simplifies to N*60 = 24,000.\n\nSo, 60*N = 24,000. To find N, I can divide both sides by 60.\n\nN = 24,000 / 60. Let's calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 goes into 240 four times, so 60 into 24,000 is 400. Because 60 *400 = 24,000.\n\nWait, so N is 400? Let me check that. If there are 400 employees, then the original contribution per employee is 600,000 /400. 600,000 divided by 400. Let's see, 400 * 1500 is 600,000, right? Because 400 *1000 is 400,000, and 400*500 is 200,000, so 400*1500=600,000. So each contributes 1500.\n\nIf each contributes 60 more, that's 1560 per employee. Multiply by 400: 400 *1560. Let's compute that. 400 *1500 is 600,000, and 400*60 is 24,000. So total is 624,000, which matches the second condition. So yes, N is 400.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer must be C.\n",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says an organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by getting equal contributions from each employee.

The options are A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500.\n\nHmm, alright, let's break this down. So, let's denote the number of employees as N, and the original contribution each person made as X rupees.\n\nFrom the problem, the first scenario is that each employee contributes X, and together they make 6 lakh. So, the equation would be N multiplied by X equals 600,000 (since 1 lakh is 100,000). So, N * X = 600,000. Let's write that as equation (1): N * X = 600,000.\n\nThe second scenario is if each employee contributes Rs.60 more, so each would give X + 60. The total contribution then becomes 6.24 lakh, which is 624,000. So, the equation is N*(X + 60) = 624,000. Let's call this equation (2): N*(X +60)=624,000.\n\nNow, I can solve these two equations to find N. Let's see. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2). So, equation (2) minus equation (1) would be:\n\nN*(X +60) - N*X = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplifying the left side: N*X +60N - N*X = 60N.\n\nThe right side: 24,000.\n\nSo, 60N =24,000. Solving for N, divide both sides by 60. 24,000 divided by 60 is 400. So N=400.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. So, 60N =24,000 \u2192 N=24,000 /60=400. So the number of employees is 400.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400.

Let's say N=400.\n\nFrom equation (1): 400 * X=600,000 \u2192 X=600,000/400 = 1500. So each employee contributed Rs.1500.\n\nIn the second case, each contributes 1500+60=1560. So total contribution is 400*1560. Let's compute that. 400 * 1500 is 600,000, and 400 *60 is 24,000. So total is 624,000, which matches the given data.

So, the initial target is 600,000 rupees (since 1 lakh is 100,000). Each employee contributes equally, so if there are 'x' employees, each contributes 600,000 divided by x.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many employees are in the organization. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find the number of employees.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break it down. I'll probably need to set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the number of employees as N and the original contribution per employee as C. So, from the first part, the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh, which is 600,000. So the equation would be N * C = 600,000.\n\nIn the second scenario, each employee contributes Rs. 60 more. So each contributes (C + 60) now. And the total becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh, which is 624,000. So the second equation is N * (C + 60) = 624,000.\n\nWait, so I have two equations:\n\n1. N * C = 600,000\n2. N * (C + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find out something about N. Let's see:\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1: N*(C + 60) - N*C = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplifying the left side: N*C + 60N - N*C = 24,000. So 60N = 24,000.\n\nOh, that's easy. So 60N = 24,000 \u2192 N = 24,000 / 60.\n\nCalculating that: 24,000 divided by 60. Let me see. 60 goes into 240 four times. So 24,000 divided by 60 is 400. Because 60 * 400 = 24,000.\n\nSo N is 400. Let me check the options. Option C is 400. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many employees are in the organization. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. Then, if each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find the number of employees.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break it down. I'll probably need to set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the number of employees as N and the original contribution per employee as C. So, from the first part, the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh, which is 600,000. So the equation would be N * C = 600,000.\n\nIn the second scenario, each employee contributes Rs. 60 more. So each contributes (C + 60) now. And the total becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh, which is 624,000. So the second equation is N * (C + 60) = 624,000.\n\nWait, so I have two equations:\n\n1. N * C = 600,000\n2. N * (C + 60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find out something about N. Let's see:\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1: N*(C + 60) - N*C = 624,000 - 600,000.\n\nSimplifying the left side: N*C + 60N - N*C = 24,000. So 60N = 24,000.\n\nOh, that's easy. So 60N = 24,000 \u2192 N = 24,000 / 60.\n\nCalculating that: 24,000 divided by 60. Let me see. 60 goes into 240 four times. So 24,000 divided by 60 is 400. Because 60 * 400 = 24,000.\n\nSo N is 400.

Let me calculate that. 400 * 1500 is 600,000, and 400 * 60 is 24,000. Adding those gives 624,000, which matches the problem statement. So yes, it's correct.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, they're trying to collect a certain amount from each employee. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Total amount needed initially: Rs. 6 lakh. Oh, wait, 1 lakh is 100,000, right? So 6 lakh is 600,000.\n- If each employee contributes Rs. 60 more than the initial amount, the total becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh. Oh, that's 624,000.\n\nWait, so the total amount would increase by 6.24 lakh minus 6 lakh, which is 24,000.

Because each employee contributes 60 more, the total extra is 24,000. \n\nSo, if each of the employees contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total extra is 24,000. So how many employees are there?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of employees as 'n'. \n\nEach employee contributes 60 extra, so the total extra is 60 * n. And this equals 24,000. So:\n\n60 * n = 24,000\n\nSo solving for n:\n\nn = 24,000 / 60\n\nLet me compute that. 24,000 divided by 60. Well, 60 goes into 24,000 how many times? \n\n60 * 400 is 24,000 because 60*400 = 24,000. So n would be 400. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go back to the problem.\n\nThe initial contribution per employee is such that the total is 6 lakh. So, if each contributes x rupees, then n * x = 600,000.\n\nIf each contributes x + 60, then n * (x +60) = 624,000.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) n x = 600,000\n2) n (x +60) = 624,000\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives:\n\nn (x +60) - n x = 624,000 - 600,000\nn * 60 = 24,000\nWhich brings us back to n = 24,000 /60 =400. \n\nSo yes, that confirms that the number of employees is 400. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the initial contribution per employee. If n=400, then x=600,000 /400 = 1500. So each contributes 1500. If each contributes 60 more, that's 1560. Then 400 *1560 = 624,000. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, yeah, the correct answer is 400 employees, which is option C.\n\n\nThe organization aims to raise Rs. 6 lakh (600,000) by collecting equal contributions from its employees. If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh (624,000). The difference between the two totals is Rs. 24,000, which arises from the additional Rs. 60 contributed by each employee. \n\nLet the number of employees be \\( n \\). Since each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, the total extra contribution is \\( 60 \\times n \\). This equals Rs. 24,000:\n\n\\[\n60n = 24,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{24,000}{60} = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of employees is 400. Verifying, if each employee initially contributes Rs. 1500 (\\( \\frac{600,000}{400} \\)), the total contribution is Rs. 600,000. If each contributes Rs. 60 extra (Rs. 1560), the total becomes \\( 400 \\times 1560 = 624,000 \\), confirming the calculation.\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 400**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about an organization raising money through employee contributions. Hmm, I need to find out how many employees there are. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh. Each employee contributes equally. So, let's say the number of employees is 'n', and each contributes 'x' rupees. So, the total contribution would be n multiplied by x, which equals 6 lakh. So, the first equation I can write is n * x = 600,000.\n\nBut then there's a second condition. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. So, each person contributes x + 60, and the new total is n*(x +60) = 624,000.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. n*x = 600,000\n2. n*(x +60) = 624,000\n\nHmm, I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate the n term. Let me do that. \n\nSo, subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\nn*(x +60) - n*x = 624,000 - 600,000\nSimplifying the left side, it's n*x +60n -n*x, which leaves 60n.\nThe right side is 24,000.\n\nSo, 60n = 24,000. To find n, I divide both sides by 60.\n\nn = 24,000 / 60 = 400.\n\nWait, that gives me n equals 400. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nSo, if there are 400 employees, each contributing x, then x = 600,000 / 400 = 1500. So each contributes 1500 initially.\n\nIf each contributes 60 more, that's 1560 per employee. 400 * 1560 = 400*1500 + 400*60 = 600,000 +24,000=624,000. That matches the second condition.\n\nSo yeah, n is 400. Looking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C.\n",
