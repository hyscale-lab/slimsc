      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Hmm, let's see. The question says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. I need to find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A through E, with numbers like 0.5, 1, etc.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, I'll think about what's given. Initially, the soft drink is 40% orange juice. Since the total volume is one gallon, that means 0.4 gallons of orange juice and 0.6 gallons of water. Because 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4 gallons.\n\nNow, the problem is asking how much more orange juice I need to add so that orange juice makes up 60% of the new mixture. Let's denote the additional orange juice as x gallons. So when I add x gallons of OJ, the total volume of the soft drink increases because I'm adding more liquid.\n\nWait, but the initial mixture is 1 gallon. After adding x gallons of OJ, the total volume becomes (1 + x) gallons. Because I'm adding x to the original 1 gallon.\n\nSo, after adding x gallons, the amount of OJ is the original 0.4 plus the added x. So that's (0.4 + x) gallons of OJ. And the total mixture is (1 + x) gallons.\n\nWe want OJ to be 60% of the total. So setting up the equation: (0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x). Because 60% is 0.6.\n\nNow, let's solve this equation. Let me write it out:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6*1 + 0.6*x = 0.6 + 0.6x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nI need to get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Let's subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2\n\nSo 0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. That would mean adding half a gallon of orange juice. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal OJ: 0.4 gallons. Add 0.5 \u2192 0.9 gallons OJ. Total mixture: 1.5 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 = 0.6 \u2192 60%. Yep, that works.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.5, which matches what I got. So the answer should be A.\n",

And that's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So first, I should figure out how much orange juice is in that initial gallon. \n\nLet me calculate that. 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4 gallons of orange juice. And the rest, which is 0.6 gallons, is water.\n\nNow, the problem is asking how much more orange juice we need to add to make the orange juice 60% of the new soft drink. So I guess I need to find the amount of additional orange juice, let's call it x gallons, that when added, the total orange juice becomes 60% of the total volume.\n\nWait, so when we add x gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink will increase. Because we're adding only orange juice. So the new total volume is 1 + x gallons.\n\nThe amount of orange juice after adding x gallons would be 0.4 + x gallons, right? Because initially, it was 0.4, and we add x more.\n\nWe want this new amount of orange juice to be 60% of the total soft drink. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nHmm, let me write that equation out.\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's expand the right side.\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nWait, subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nSimplify the left side: 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen, subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4 \u2192 0.4x = 0.2\n\nSo, x = 0.2 / 0.4 \u2192 x = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons.

Let me plug x=0.5 back into the equation.\n\n0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons of OJ. The total volume is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. 60% of 1.5 is 0.9, which matches. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of ratios. Initially, 0.4 OJ and 0.6 water. After adding x OJ, OJ is 0.4 + x, and water remains 0.6 because we're only adding OJ. The new ratio is (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same equation. So the calculation seems right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing soft drinks. Let me read it again. It says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. The question is asking how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. So initially, the soft drink is 1 gallon. 40% of that is orange juice. Wait, 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4 gallons of OJ, right? And the rest is water, which is 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, the goal is to have orange juice make up 60% of the drink. So I'm adding more orange juice. Let's say I add x gallons of OJ. After adding, the total volume of the drink increases because I'm adding more OJ. So the new total volume would be 1 + x gallons.\n\nBut wait, the amount of orange juice now is the original 0.4 plus the added x, so it's 0.4 + x gallons. And this should be 60% of the new total volume. So I can set up an equation for that.\n\nThe equation would be: 0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x)\n\nLet me write that down more clearly:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nHmm, solving for x. Let's expand the right side.\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, subtract 0.6x from both sides:\n\n0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen subtract 0.4 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nWait, so x is 0.5 gallons. That means I need to add half a gallon of OJ. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Original OJ is 0.4. Add 0.5, so OJ becomes 0.9.

Hmm, the question is about finding out how much additional orange juice needs to be added to a gallon of soft drink to make the orange juice 60% instead of 40%. \n\nWait, the initial mixture is one gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice. So let me calculate how much orange juice is in that gallon. 40% of one gallon is 0.4 gallons. Oh, right, because 0.4 * 1 = 0.4. So the initial amount of orange juice is 0.4 gallons, and the rest is water, which would be 0.6 gallons.\n\nNow, the problem says we need to add more orange juice so that orange juice makes up 60% of the soft drink. Let me think about how to model this. Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice. After adding, the total volume of the soft drink will increase because we're adding more liquid. \n\nSo the new total volume is 1 gallon + x gallons. The amount of orange juice becomes 0.4 + x gallons. We want this new amount of orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture. \n\nSo the equation would be: (0.4 + x) = 0.6 * (1 + x). Let me write that down. \n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6*(1 + x) = 0.6 + 0.6x. So the equation is 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x.\n\nHmm, let me solve for x. Subtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6. That simplifies to 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6.\n\nThen subtract 0.4 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2. So 0.4x = 0.2.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: x = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5. Oh, so x is 0.5 gallons.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I add 0.5 gallons of orange juice, the total orange juice becomes 0.4 + 0.5 = 0.9 gallons. The total volume is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo the additional orange juice needed is 0.5 gallons. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5. So the answer should be A.\n",

The question says that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. They want to know how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. The options are A to E, with E being 2.\n\nWait, so I need to figure out how much more orange juice to add. Let's break it down. The initial mixture is one gallon. 40% is orange juice, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water.\n\nBut when you add more orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink increases, right? Because you're adding more OJ to it. So, if I add x gallons of OJ, the total volume becomes 1 + x gallons.\n\nThe goal is to have OJ make up 60% of this new total. So, the amount of OJ in the mixture will be 0.4 + x gallons, because the initial OJ is 0.4 and we're adding x more.\n\nSo the equation would be: (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6.

So, 0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x).\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 * 1 is 0.6, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So the equation becomes 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x.\n\nHmm, let's subtract 0.6x from both sides to get the x terms together. So, 0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6. Simplifying the left side, x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So, 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6.\n\nNow, subtract 0.4 from both sides. 0.4x = 0.6 - 0.4, which is 0.2. So, 0.4x = 0.2.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4 to solve for x. x = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5.\n\nSo x is 0.5 gallons.
