      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike or whatever. Let's see what it's asking. Shweta rides at 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes every 15 km. I need to find out how long it'll take her to cover 100 km. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, her speed is 10 km/h. So without any stops, how long would she take? Well, time is distance divided by speed. So 100 km divided by 10 km/h is 10 hours. But wait, she takes breaks every 15 km. So I have to account for those stops.\n\nWait, how often does she stop? Every 15 km, right. So how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km? Let me calculate. 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666. Hmm, but she can't do a fraction of a segment. Let me think. She'll stop after every 15 km, so up to 15*6=90 km, she would have stopped 6 times. Then the next segment is 10 km, which is less than 15, so no stop after that.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. She stops after every 15 km. So for each 15 km she completes, she takes a 10-minute break. So for 100 km, how many times does she stop?\n\nLet me think again. The first 15 km: ride, then stop. Then another 15 km: ride, stop. How many times does she stop?\n\nWait, the first stop is after 15 km, so for 15 km, she rides and then stops. So for 15 km, she takes one stop. Then, another 15 km, another stop. So for each 15 km, one stop.\n\nBut wait, when she's done with 15 km, she stops. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments does she have?\n\nLet me divide 100 by 15. 15 *6=90, so 6 full segments, each 15 km. Then the remaining is 100-90=10 km. So she has 6 stops, right?\n\nWait, no. Because each 15 km after the first one. Wait, let's count the stops:\n\n- After 15 km: first stop.\n- After 30 km: second stop.\n- After 45 km: third.\n- After 60: fourth.\n- 75: fifth.\n- 90: sixth stop.\n- Then she goes another 10 km to reach 100, but she doesn't stop because that's less than 15 km.\n\nSo total stops are 6. Each stop is 10 minutes. So total stop time is 6 *10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nBut wait, the total riding time is 100 km at 10 km/h. That's 10 hours. But wait, no\u2014because she's stopping after each 15 km. So she rides 15 km, stops, rides another 15, stops, etc. So perhaps the riding time isn't 100/10, but broken into segments.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the riding time for each 15 km segment plus the stops, and then see about the last segment.\n\nEach 15 km takes how long? 15 km at 10 km/h is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So each 15 km takes 1.5 hours of riding, plus a 10-minute stop. So for each segment, time is 1.5 + 0.166666... hours (since 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, approximately 0.1667).\n\nWait, but for the last segment, she doesn't stop. So let's break it down.\n\nNumber of full 15 km segments in 100 km: 6 (since 6*15=90). Then the remaining 10 km is the seventh segment, which she rides without stopping.\n\nSo for each of the first 6 segments:\n\nTime per segment = riding time + stop time.\n\nRiding time for each 15 km: 1.5 hours.\n\nStop time: 10 minutes = 1/6 hour \u22480.1667.\n\nSo per segment: 1.5 + 0.1667 \u22481.6667 hours.\n\nBut wait, for the 6 segments, that's 6*(1.5 + 0.1667) =6*(1.6667)=10 hours.\n\nWait, 1.6667 *6 is 10? Let me compute 1.6667 *6: 10 exactly.\n\nThen the last segment is 10 km. How long does that take? 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. And no stop after that.\n\nSo total time is 10 (from 6 segments) +1 (last 10 km) =11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount. 6 segments of 15 km each, each taking 1.5 hours ride plus 10 minutes stop. So for each segment, 1.5 + 0.1667 =1.6667 hours. 6 segments: 6 *1.6667 =10 hours.\n\nThen, the last 10 km: 1 hour. So total is 11 hours.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the last segment 10 km, which is after 90 km, and she doesn't stop. So the time for that is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 6*(1.5 + 0.1667) +1*(1.0) =6*(1.6667) +1 =10 +1=11 hours.\n\nSo the answer should be 11 hours, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of stops. Let me think about the number of stops. She stops after every 15 km. So after 15, 30,45,60,75,90 km. That's 6 stops. Each is 10 minutes. So 6 *10=60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nThe riding time without any stops would be 100/10=10 hours. But she's adding 1 hour of stops. So total time is 11 hours.\n\nWait, that's another way to compute it. So riding time is 10 hours, stop time is 1 hour. So 11 total.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is C) 11 hours.\n",

We need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km in total.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I think I should figure out how much time she spends riding and how much time she spends resting. Then add both together to get the total time.\n\nSo, she rides at 10 km/h. To find out the time she takes to ride 15 km, I can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed. So 15 km divided by 10 km/h is 1.5 hours. Wait, that's 90 minutes, right? Because 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. So 1 hour and 30 minutes for each 15 km ride.\n\nBut wait, she stops after every 15 km. So after each 15 km, she rests for 10 minutes. But what about the last segment? Like, does she stop after the final 15 km if she's exactly at 100 km? Let me think. Wait, 100 km divided by 15 km per segment... Let's see, 15 *6 is 90, 15*7 is 105. So she can't go 7 segments because that's 105 km which is more than 100. So she does 6 full segments of 15 km each, which is 90 km, and then the 7th segment is 10 km.\n\nWait, but she stops after each 15 km. So after the first 15 km, she rests, then another 15, rests, etc. So for 6 segments, she'll have 6 rests. Then the last 10 km, does she need to rest after that? No, because she's already reached 100 km. So the number of rests is 6 times 10 minutes.\n\nWait, let me double-check. First 15 km: ride, rest. Second 15 km: ride, rest. Third: ride, rest. Fourth: ride, rest. Fifth: ride, rest. Sixth: ride, rest. Then, she has 10 km left, which she rides, but doesn't rest after because she's done. So yes, 6 rests.\n\nSo each ride segment is 15 km, taking 1.5 hours, and each rest is 10 minutes. So for 6 ride segments, the riding time is 6 * 1.5 hours. Let's calculate that: 6 *1.5 is 9 hours.\n\nThe resting time is 6 intervals * 10 minutes each. 6*10 is 60 minutes. 60 minutes is 1 hour.\n\nSo so far, 9 hours riding plus 1 hour resting is 10 hours. But wait, that's only for 6 segments (90 km), and she needs to cover 100 km. So she has another 10 km to go after that.\n\nSo the next part is the 10 km ride. How much time does that take? Time is distance over speed, so 10 km /10 km/h is 1 hour.\n\nSo the total riding time is 9 hours + 1 hour = 10 hours. The resting time is still 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1 =11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again: She goes 15 km each ride, rests, until she's covered 90 km. Then she goes another 10 km. So the 10 km ride is part of the seventh segment, but she doesn't rest after it.\n\nSo the breakdown:\n\nSegments 1-6: 15 km each, 6 times, riding time 1.5 h each, rest 10 min each.\n\nRiding time for 6 segments: 6 *1.5 =9 h.\n\nResting time: 6 *0.1667 h (since 10 min is 1/6 h) = 1 h.\n\nThen, the last 10 km: 10 km /10 km/h =1 h.\n\nSo total time: 9h +1h +1h =11h.\n\nWait, so that makes the total time 11 hours. So looking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model it differently. Let's see, how many rest stops are there.\n\nWait, when she's done the 15 km, she rests. So for each 15 km, she has a rest. But the last part, 10 km, she doesn't rest after.\n\nSo the number of rests is equal to the number of 15 km segments she completes. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there?\n\n100 /15 is approximately 6.666. So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, rests 6 times, then rides 10 km without resting.\n\nSo the time for the 6 segments: 6 *15 km =90 km. Time is 6 *1.5 =9h. Rests 6 *10 min =60 min =1h.\n\nThen the last 10 km: 10 /10=1h. So total time 9 +1 +1 =11h.\n\nSo the answer is 11 hours, which is option C.\n",

To cover 100 km, we break the journey into segments:\n\n1. **Riding Time for 15 km Segments**:  \n   Each 15 km segment takes time:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time per segment} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{15 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1.5 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]  \n   She completes 6 full segments of 15 km each, covering:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 15 \\, \\text{km} = 90 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]  \n   Total riding time for these segments:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{hours} = 9 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Resting Time**:  \n   After each 15 km segment, she rests for 10 minutes. For 6 segments, the total rest time is:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 10 \\, \\text{minutes} = 60 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final 10 km Segment**:  \n   After the 6 segments (90 km), she has 10 km left. The time to cover this segment is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 \\, \\text{km}}{10 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 1 \\, \\text{hour}.\n   \\]  \n   Since she reaches the destination after this segment, she does not rest afterward.\n\n4. **Total Time**:  \n   Adding the riding time, rest time, and time for the final segment:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time} = 9 \\, \\text{hours (riding)} + 1 \\, \\text{hour (resting)} + 1 \\, \\text{hour (final segment)} = 11 \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km is **11 hours**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shweta riding her bike. Let me try to figure out how to solve it. Hmm, the question says she rides at 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. We need to find out how long she'll take to cover 100 km.\n\nWait, right. So first, I should break this down. She's cycling 10 km/h, but every 15 km, she takes a 10-minute break. So for each 15 km segment, she's actually taking some time to ride plus a break. Except maybe the last segment, because if 100 isn't a multiple of 15, she might not need a break after.\n\nWait, let's see. 100 divided by 15 is like 6 with a remainder, because 15*6 is 90, and 15*7 is 105 which is over. So she'll have six full 15 km segments and then a 10 km segment for the last part.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, 15 * 6 is 90, so 90 km, and then she has another 10 km to reach 100. So that's correct.\n\nSo each of the first six segments is 15 km, and then the seventh is 10 km.\n\nNow, for each 15 km, how long does she ride? Since she rides at 10 km/h, time is distance over speed. So 15 km / 10 km/h is 1.5 hours per segment. Then she takes a 10-minute break after each 15 km. But wait, after the last 15 km, does she take a break? Because she needs to go another 10 km. So the breaks are only after the 15 km segments except the last one. Hmm, wait, the problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So after 15 km, 30 km, etc., she takes a break. So for 100 km, which is 6*15 +10, she'll have 6 breaks, right? Because each 15 km after the first.\n\nWait, wait, let's think. The first 15 km: ride, then break. Second 15 km: ride, then break. And so on until the sixth 15 km. Then she rides the last 10 km, but doesn't take a break because she's done.\n\nSo, the total number of breaks is 6. Each break is 10 minutes, which is 1/6 of an hour (since 60 minutes = 1 hour). So 6 breaks would be 6 * (10/60) hours. Let me compute that: 6*(1/6) = 1 hour. So the breaks add up to an hour.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes 1.5 hours. So for six segments, that's 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. Then the last 10 km: time is 10 km /10 km/h = 1 hour. So riding time is 9 +1=10 hours.\n\nPlus the breaks: 10 +1=11 hours. So the total time is 11 hours. So looking at the options, option C is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount.\n\nSegments:\n\n1. 15 km: time 1.5h, break 10min.\n\n2. 15 km: 1.5h, break.\n\n3. 15 km: 1.5h, break.\n\n4. 15 km: 1.5h, break.\n\n5. 15 km: 1.5h, break.\n\n6. 15 km: 1.5h, break.\n\nWait, after the sixth 15 km, she's at 90 km. Then she rides 10 km, which is 1h, and no break.\n\nSo the breaks are after each 15 km, so for the six 15 km segments, she takes 6 breaks. So 6 breaks *10 min = 60 min =1h.\n\nRiding time: 6*1.5 +1 = 9+1=10h. So total time 10+1=11h. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C, 11 hours.\n",

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, first, the problem says she rides at 10 km per hour. But wait, every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. Hmm, so she doesn't take breaks every hour or something; it's after every 15 km. I need to calculate the total time she spends both riding and resting.\n\nLet me break it down. She's covering 100 km in total. So how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km? Well, 100 divided by 15 is... let me do that. 15 times 6 is 90, and then 100 minus 90 is 10. So she has six full 15 km segments, and then a remaining 10 km. Wait, but after each 15 km, she rests. So does she rest after the last 15 km or not? Because if she does, she'll have a rest after the 90 km, then ride the last 10 km without resting. Or maybe she rests after each segment, including the last one. Wait, the problem says she stops after every 15 km, so if her journey is 100 km, she'll have 6 segments of 15 km each (total 90 km) and then 10 km. But for the 6 segments, she rests 6 times. Because after each 15 km, she rests. So after the 6th 15 km, she rests once more, but then she still has 10 km to go. Wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let's imagine she rides 15 km, then rests. Then another 15, rests, etc. So for 100 km, she has 100 divided by 15. That's approximately 6.666... So she completes 6 full 15 km rides, covering 90 km, rests 6 times. Then she has 10 km left. So she rides 10 km without resting again because she doesn't reach another 15 km.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased: \"stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km.\" So, after every 15 km, she stops. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. So that's 6 stops for 10 minutes each. Then she rides the remaining 10 km, which doesn't require a stop because she doesn't reach another 15 km. So total resting time is 6 * 10 minutes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the riding time. She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. So time equals distance over speed. 100 km / 10 km/h = 10 hours. But wait, that's without considering the rest stops. Oh right, so the 10 hours is just riding time. But she's taking breaks, so the total time is riding time plus rest time.\n\nSo the riding time is 10 hours. The rest time is 6 intervals of 10 minutes each. Each 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour (since 60 minutes = 1 hour). So 6 * (10/60) hours = 6 * (1/6) hours = 1 hour. So total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see: She rides 15 km in 1.5 hours (because 15/10 = 1.5). Then rests 10 minutes. So each 15 km takes 1.5h + 10m. 10 minutes is 1/6 hour, so 1.5 + 1/6 = 1.666... hours per 15 km segment.\n\nSo for 6 segments (90 km), each takes 1.666 hours. 6 * 1.666... = 10 hours. Then she has 10 km left. 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. So total time is 10 (for the 90 km) + 1 (for the 10 km) = 11 hours. Wait, that's the same result as before. So the total is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait a minute: Let me think about how many rests she takes. After each 15 km, so for the first 15 km, she rides and then rests. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. So that's 6 stops. So 6*10 minutes is 1 hour.\n\nRiding time: 100 km /10 km/h = 10h.\n\nTotal time: 10h + 1h =11h.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) 11 hours.\n",

Her speed is 10 km/h, so the time she takes to travel 15 km would be distance divided by speed. So that's 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours. So every 15 km, she spends 1.5 hours riding. But then she stops for 10 minutes. Oh, right, 10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour, which is approximately 0.1667 hours.\n\nNow, how many times does she take a rest? Well, she rests after every 15 km. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let me calculate 100 / 15. That's about 6.666... So she completes 6 full 15 km segments, and then a partial one of 100 - (6*15) = 100 - 90 = 10 km. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 6 *15 is 90. So the 7th segment is 10 km. So she doesn't complete the 7th segment, but does she rest after the 6th segment?\n\nWait, let me think. After every 15 km, she rests. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she rests. So for 90 km, that's 6 times. Then she goes another 10 km to reach 100. So she doesn't rest after the 10 km because she's done. So the number of rest periods is 6.\n\nSo the total riding time is the time for each 15 km segment multiplied by the number of segments plus the time for the last 10 km.\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nEach 15 km takes 1.5 hours. So 6 segments would be 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours.\n\nThe last 10 km: time = 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nBut wait, she rests 6 times. Each rest is 10 minutes. So 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is riding time + rest time. So 10 hours + 1 hour = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 6 segments: each 15 km, 6 times. Each takes 1.5 hours. So 6 *1.5 is 9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So riding is 10 hours. Rests: after each 15 km, so after 15, 30, etc., up to 90 km. That's 6 rests, each 10 minutes. So 6 *10=60 mins =1 hour. So total time is 10+1=11 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nShweta rides at a speed of 10 km per hour. But she stops for 10 minutes every time she covers 15 km. The question is, how many hours will she take to cover 100 km?\n\nHmm, so I need to calculate the total time she takes, including the rest periods. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much time she spends riding and how much time she spends resting. Then add both together to get the total time.\n\nHer riding speed is 10 km/h. So for any distance she covers while riding, I can find the time by dividing the distance by speed. But she doesn't ride continuously; she stops after every 15 km.\n\nSo, let's see. She needs to cover 100 km. How many 15 km segments are there in 100 km?\n\nWait, 15 km each segment. Let me calculate how many segments she completes.\n\n100 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 * 6 is 90, which is less than 100. 15*7 is 105, which is more. So she completes 6 full segments of 15 km each, and then a remaining 10 km.\n\nWait, because 15 *6=90, so 100-90=10 km left. So she does 6 segments, each 15 km, and then a last part of 10 km.\n\nNow, for each of those 15 km segments, she rides, then rests for 10 minutes. But after the last segment, does she need to rest again? Because the problem says she stops after every 15 km. So if the last distance she rides is less than 15 km, maybe she doesn't rest after that.\n\nWait, let's think. She stops after every 15 km. So after each 15 km, she rests. So the number of rest stops is equal to the number of times she completes a 15 km segment, except possibly the last one if she doesn't complete a full 15 km.\n\nIn this case, she does 6 segments of 15 km. So she rests 6 times. Because after each 15 km, she stops. But after the 6th 15 km, which brings her to 90 km, she then rides the last 10 km. Since that's less than 15, she doesn't stop again. So she rests 6 times.\n\nSo, each rest is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 minutes. Let me convert that into hours because the answer is in hours.\n\n10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour. So 6 * (1/6) = 1 hour. So she spends 1 hour resting.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes her 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours. So per segment, 1.5 hours of riding.\n\nShe does 6 segments, so 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours.\n\nPlus the last 10 km. That's 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nAdding the rest time, which is 1 hour, total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So:\n\nNumber of 15 km segments: 6 (each taking 1.5 hours, so 9 hours) plus the last 10 km (1 hour) \u2192 10 hours riding.\n\nRests: 6 times, 10 minutes each \u2192 60 minutes \u2192 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1 = 11 hours. So option C is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but another way to think: maybe she rests after each 15 km, including the last one? Let me see.\n\nWait, if she completes 6 segments, each 15 km, so 6 stops. But the last segment is 15 km, so after that, she rests. Then she has 10 km left. So she starts riding again, rides 10 km, but does she need to rest again after that? Because she only rests after completing 15 km. Since 10 km is less than 15, she doesn't rest after that. So rests only after 15 km segments. So yes, 6 rests.\n\nSo the total time is 10 hours riding plus 1 hour resting \u2192 11 hours. So option C.\n",

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how much time she spends riding and how much time she spends resting.

But she doesn't ride continuously; she stops after every 15 km.\n\nSo, let's see. She needs to cover 100 km. How many 15 km segments are there in 100 km?\n\nWait, 15 km each segment. Let me calculate how many segments she completes.\n\n100 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 * 6 is 90, which is less than 100. 15*7 is 105, which is more. So she completes 6 full segments of 15 km each, and then a remaining 10 km.\n\nWait, because 15 *6=90, so 100-90=10 km left. So she does 6 segments, each 15 km, and then a last part of 10 km.\n\nNow, for each of those 15 km segments, she rides, then rests for 10 minutes. But after the last segment, does she need to rest again? Because the problem says she stops after every 15 km. So if the last distance she rides is less than 15 km, maybe she doesn't rest after that.\n\nWait, let's think. She stops after every 15 km. So after each 15 km, she rests. So the number of rest stops is equal to the number of times she completes a 15 km segment, except possibly the last one if she doesn't complete a full 15 km.\n\nIn this case, she does 6 segments of 15 km. So she rests 6 times. Because after each 15 km, she stops. But after the 6th 15 km, which brings her to 90 km, she then rides the last 10 km. Since that's less than 15, she doesn't stop again. So she rests 6 times.\n\nSo, each rest is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 minutes. Let me convert that into hours because the answer is in hours.\n\n10 minutes is 1/6 of an hour. So 6 * (1/6) = 1 hour. So she spends 1 hour resting.\n\nNow, the riding time. Each 15 km takes her 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours. So per segment, 1.5 hours of riding.\n\nShe does 6 segments, so 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours.\n\nPlus the last 10 km. That's 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nSo total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours.\n\nAdding the rest time, which is 1 hour, total time is 10 + 1 = 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So:\n\nNumber of 15 km segments: 6 (each taking 1.5 hours, so 9 hours) plus the last 10 km (1 hour) \u2192 10 hours riding.\n\nRests: 6 times, 10 minutes each \u2192 60 minutes \u2192 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 +1 = 11 hours. So option C is 11 hours.\n\nWait, but another way to think: maybe she rests after each 15 km, including the last one? Let me see.\n\nWait, if she completes 6 segments, each 15 km, so 6 stops. But the last segment is 15 km, so after that, she rests. Then she has 10 km left. So she starts riding again, rides 10 km, but does she need to rest again after that? Because she only rests after completing 15 km. Since 10 km is less than 15, she doesn't rest after that. So rests only after 15 km segments. So yes, 6 rests.\n\nSo the total time is 10 hours riding plus 1 hour resting \u2192 11 hours. So option C.\n\n\nShweta rides at a speed of 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Shweta is riding her bike or something, going at 10 km per hour. But she stops every 15 km for 10 minutes of rest. The question is, how long will it take her to cover 100 km? The options are from 9 to 13 hours, so I need to figure out the exact time.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, her riding speed is 10 km/h. So without any stops, the time she would take is total distance divided by speed. For 100 km, that would be 100 / 10 = 10 hours. But wait, she doesn't ride continuously; she stops after every 15 km. So I need to account for those rest periods.\n\nSo how often does she stop? Well, she stops after every 15 km. Let's see, 100 km divided by 15 km per stop. 15*6 is 90, so she'll have six segments of 15 km each, which gets her to 90 km. Then she has another 10 km to go. Wait, no, 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666, which suggests she completes 6 full 15 km segments and then a partial one. But wait, each 15 km segment is followed by a rest, except maybe the last one. Because once she reaches the destination, she doesn't need to stop.\n\nSo let's think about it. Each 15 km chunk takes her some time to ride, and then a 10-minute break. How many breaks does she take?\n\nFor 100 km, how many 15 km intervals are there? Let's compute 100 /15 = approximately 6.666. So that's 6 full intervals, and then a remaining 10 km. So she'll ride 15 km six times, and then 10 km once. But wait, after each 15 km, she stops. So for each of the first six intervals, she stops once. So the number of stops is 6. Because after the sixth 15 km, she's at 90 km, then rides another 10 km, reaching 100 km. So she doesn't stop after the last 10 km.\n\nSo she has 6 stops, each 10 minutes. Each stop adds 10 minutes to her total time.\n\nNow, calculate the riding time. Each 15 km takes her 15 /10 = 1.5 hours. So six times that is 6 * 1.5 =9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 10 /10 = 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 +1 =10 hours.\n\nThen the stops: 6 stops *10 minutes each. 6*10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 10 (riding) + 1 (stops) =11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. So for each 15 km, she rides and then stops. So for the first 15 km, she takes 1.5 hours, then 10 minutes stop. Then another 15 km, another 1.5 hours, another 10 min stop, and so on.\n\nSo for 6 intervals of 15 km each, that's 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes. So 6 *10 =60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nThe time for 6 *15 km is 6 *1.5 =9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total time is 9 +1 +1=11 hours. So option C is 11 hours.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: the number of rest periods. Let me think about it as after every 15 km, so for each 15 km, she has a break except the last segment. So the number of rest periods is equal to the number of completed 15 km segments minus one?\n\nWait, no. Let me think: she rides 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. So for each 15 km, she stops once, except maybe the last one. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let's see:\n\n15*6=90, so she has 6 full stops after each 15 km. Then she rides 10 km, no stop. So total stops are 6, each 10 minutes.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So total stops add 6*10=60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nSo riding time: 100 km at 10 km/h is 10 hours. Plus 1 hour for stops: 11 hours. So the answer is C)11 hours.\n",

Wait, no, 100 divided by 15 is about 6.666, which suggests she completes 6 full 15 km segments and then a partial one. But wait, each 15 km segment is followed by a rest, except maybe the last one. Because once she reaches the destination, she doesn't need to stop.\n\nSo let's think about it. Each 15 km chunk takes her some time to ride, and then a 10-minute break. How many breaks does she take?\n\nFor 100 km, how many 15 km intervals are there? Let's compute 100 /15 = approximately 6.666. So that's 6 full intervals, and then a remaining 10 km. So she'll ride 15 km six times, and then 10 km once. But wait, after each 15 km, she stops. So for each of the first six intervals, she stops once. So the number of stops is 6. Because after the sixth 15 km, she's at 90 km, then rides another 10 km, reaching 100 km. So she doesn't stop after the last 10 km.\n\nSo she has 6 stops, each 10 minutes. Each stop adds 10 minutes to her total time.\n\nNow, calculate the riding time. Each 15 km takes her 15 /10 = 1.5 hours. So six times that is 6 * 1.5 =9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 10 /10 = 1 hour. So total riding time is 9 +1 =10 hours.\n\nThen the stops: 6 stops *10 minutes each. 6*10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is 10 (riding) + 1 (stops) =11 hours.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. So for each 15 km, she rides and then stops. So for the first 15 km, she takes 1.5 hours, then 10 minutes stop. Then another 15 km, another 1.5 hours, another 10 min stop, and so on.\n\nSo for 6 intervals of 15 km each, that's 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes. So 6 *10 =60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nThe time for 6 *15 km is 6 *1.5 =9 hours. Then the last 10 km takes 1 hour. So total time is 9 +1 +1=11 hours. So option C is 11 hours.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: the number of rest periods. Let me think about it as after every 15 km, so for each 15 km, she has a break except the last segment. So the number of rest periods is equal to the number of completed 15 km segments minus one?\n\nWait, no. Let me think: she rides 15 km, stops. Then another 15, stops. So for each 15 km, she stops once, except maybe the last one. So for 100 km, how many 15 km segments are there? Let's see:\n\n15*6=90, so she has 6 full stops after each 15 km. Then she rides 10 km, no stop. So total stops are 6, each 10 minutes.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So total stops add 6*10=60 minutes=1 hour.\n\nSo riding time: 100 km at 10 km/h is 10 hours. Plus 1 hour for stops: 11 hours. So the answer is C)11 hours.\n\n\nShweta rides at a speed of 10 km/h and stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. To determine the total time she takes to cover 100 km, we break the journey into segments:\n\n1. **Number of 15 km segments**:  \n   Since \\( 100 \\div 15 \\approx 6.666 \\), there are 6 full 15 km segments, covering \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\) km. The remaining \\( 100 - 90 = 10 \\) km is covered in a final segment.\n\n2. **Time for riding**:  \n   - Each 15 km segment takes \\( \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \\) hours.  \n   - For 6 segments: \\( 6 \\times 1.5 = 9 \\) hours.  \n   - The final 10 km segment takes \\( \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\) hour.  \n   - Total riding time: \\( 9 + 1 = 10 \\) hours.\n\n3. **Number of stops**:  \n   Shweta stops after every 15 km. Since there are 6 full 15 km segments, she takes 6 stops. Each stop is 10 minutes, so total stop time is \\( 6 \\times 10 = 60 \\) minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\n4. **Total time**:  \n   Adding the riding time and stop time: \\( 10 + 1 = 11 \\) hours.\n\nThus, the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km is **11 hours**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Shweta is riding her bike or maybe a bicycle, and she goes at a speed of 10 km per hour. But every time she covers 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes to rest. The question is, how long will it take her to cover 100 km in total?\n\nHmm, let me think about this. So, I need to calculate the total time she takes, including the rest periods. Since she stops after every 15 km, I should figure out how many such intervals she has in 100 km and then calculate the time for each part.\n\nFirst, let me figure out how many 15 km segments there are in 100 km. So, 100 divided by 15. Let me do that: 15 times 6 is 90, and 15 times 7 is 105. Oh wait, but 100 is less than 105. So she would have 6 full 15 km segments, which make 90 km. Then, the remaining distance would be 10 km because 100 minus 90 is 10. Wait, but she only stops after every 15 km, so the last segment of 10 km wouldn't require a rest stop after it. So that's important.\n\nSo, she has 6 rest stops, each 10 minutes long. Because after each 15 km, she rests. So for the first 15 km, she rides, then rests, then another 15, rests, and so on until the 90th km. Then she rides the last 10 km without resting after that.\n\nNow, let's calculate the riding time. She rides at 10 km/h. So for each 15 km, the time taken is 15 km divided by 10 km/h, which is 1.5 hours, or 90 minutes. Wait, that's for each 15 km.\n\nSo for 6 segments of 15 km each, the riding time is 6 * 1.5 hours. Let's compute that: 6 * 1.5 is 9 hours. Then, she has the last 10 km to go. The time for that is 10 km / 10 km/h = 1 hour.\n\nSo the total riding time is 9 + 1 = 10 hours. But wait, that's only the riding time. We need to add the rest periods.\n\nHow many rest periods are there? She rests after each 15 km, so for 6 segments, she rests 6 times. Each rest is 10 minutes. So 6 * 10 minutes is 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nSo total time is riding time plus rest time. That would be 10 hours + 1 hour = 11 hours.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So 6 segments of 15 km each: 6 *15=90 km. Then 10 km more. So riding time is (15*6 +10)/10 = (90 +10)/10 = 100/10=10 hours. So yes, 10 hours of riding. Then 6 rests, each 10 minutes: 6*10=60 mins=1 hour. So total time is 11 hours. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n",
