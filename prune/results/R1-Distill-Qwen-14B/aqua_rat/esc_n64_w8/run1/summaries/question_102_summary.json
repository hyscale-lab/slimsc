      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression, or AP. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club.\n\nHmm, let me think about what I remember about arithmetic progressions. An AP is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. In this case, the difference is 3 months. But wait, the ages are given in years and months. I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make calculations easier. Let's convert months into years since the youngest is 7 years old. So 3 months is 0.25 years.\n\nSo the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, 7.75, and so on. Each subsequent member is 0.25 years older than the previous.\n\nNow, the sum of the ages is 250. I remember the formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the formula right. Oh yes, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term. Either formula should work, but perhaps the first one is more straightforward here since I don't know the last term yet.\n\nLet me plug in the values I have. The first term 'a' is 7 years. The common difference 'd' is 0.25 years. The sum S is 250.\n\nSo plugging into the sum formula: 250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me write that out.\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)].\n\nI'll expand the terms inside the brackets first. 0.25*(n-1) is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding 14 gives 14 +0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n).\n\nExpanding that: 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2.\n\nI can rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0.\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit tricky. Maybe I can multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the decimals. Let's see: 4*0.25n\u00b2 is n\u00b2, 4*13.75n is 55n, 4*(-500) is -2000. So the equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 0.25 *4 is 1, correct. 13.75 *4 is 55, yes. 500*4 is 2000, so with the negative sign it's -2000. So yes, the quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for n. I'll use the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 105 squared is 11025. Oh right! So sqrt(11025) =105.\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nn = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So take the positive option:\n\nn = (-55 + 105)/2 = 50/2 =25.\n\nWait, that's 25. So n is 25? Let me check the options. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27. So option C is 25. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes mistakes happen.\n\nLet me go back through the steps. The ages are in AP, difference 3 months which is 0.25 years. First term a=7. Sum S=250.\n\nFormula: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d].\n\nSo 250 = (n/2)(14 +0.25(n-1)).\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the expansion earlier. Let's re-calculate:\n\nWait, 2a is 14, correct. Then (n-1)*d is (n-1)*0.25. So 14 + 0.25(n-1) =14 +0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 +0.25n. So that part is correct.\n\nThen 250 = (n/2)(13.75 + 0.25n). Multiply both sides by 2: 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n). So 500 =13.75n +0.25n\u00b2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4: 2000 =55n +n\u00b2.\n\nWhich gives n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. So that's correct.\n\nQuadratic formula: [ -55 \u00b1 sqrt(55^2 +4*2000) ] /2.\n\nWait, wait, because c is -2000, so 4ac is 4*1*(-2000)= -8000. But in the discriminant, it's b\u00b2 -4ac, which is 3025 - (-8000) = 3025 +8000=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo [ (-55 +105) ]/2 =50/2=25. So n=25. So the answer is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check whether 25 members would actually sum to 250. Let's compute the sum with n=25.\n\nFirst term a=7, last term l= a + (n-1)d =7 +24*0.25 =7 +6=13. Sum S= n*(a +l)/2 =25*(7 +13)/2=25*(20)/2=25*10=250. Yes, that matches exactly. So the calculations are correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C)25.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, arithmetic progression, right? So that's a sequence where each term increases by a common difference. The common difference here is 3 months. Oh wait, and the youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club.\n\nLet me think about what I know. The ages are in AP, so if the first term is the youngest age, which is 7 years. Wait, but the common difference is in months, 3 months. So I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make it easier. Let's see, 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months, so each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous.\n\nSo the ages in months would be 84, 87, 90, ... and so on. The sum of these terms is 250 years. Wait, 250 years? No, wait, the sum is 250 in what unit? Oh, the problem says the sum is 250, but I need to check the units. Oh, the problem states the sum of the ages is 250. Let me make sure: the ages are in years, but the common difference is in months. So maybe I should convert everything to months to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me redo the units. The youngest is 7 years, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The sum of all their ages is 250 years. Wait, no, wait, the sum is 250, but in which unit? The problem says the sum is 250. Wait, the problem says, \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" So I think 250 is in years. Because the individual ages are in years. So 250 years total. Hmm, that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 250 in months. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work entirely in months. Let me try that. So, the first term a1 is 84 months. Common difference d is 3 months. The sum S of n terms is 250 years. Wait, but 250 years is 250 * 12 = 3000 months. So the sum of all the members' ages in months is 3000.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me read the problem again. It says the ages are in A.P., common difference 3 months. The youngest is 7 years old. Sum of ages is 250. So, 250 in what? The problem says \"sum of the ages\", and the ages are given in years (youngest is 7 years). So probably the sum is 250 years. So, each member's age is in years, so the sum is 250 years.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. For example, if there are 25 members, each averaging around 10 years, sum would be 250. So maybe that's possible. But let me get back to the math.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure the units are consistent. Let's make everything in years. So a is 7 years, d is 3 months, which is 3/12 = 0.25 years. The sum S is 250 years.\n\nSo plug into the formula:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Let me expand the terms:\n\n2*7 is 14.\n\n(n-1)*0.25 is 0.25(n-1).\n\nSo inside the brackets: 14 + 0.25(n-1) = 14 + 0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. Hmm, arithmetic progression, right? So that's a sequence where each term increases by a common difference. The common difference here is 3 months. Oh wait, and the youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club.\n\nLet me think about what I know. The ages are in AP, so if the first term is the youngest age, which is 7 years. Wait, but the common difference is in months, 3 months. So I should probably convert everything into the same unit to make it easier. Let's see, 7 years is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months, so each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous.\n\nSo the ages in months would be 84, 87, 90, ... and so on. The sum of these terms is 250 years. Wait, 250 years? No, wait, the sum is 250 in what unit? Oh, the problem says the sum is 250, but I need to check the units. Oh, the problem states the sum of the ages is 250. Let me make sure: the ages are in years, but the common difference is in months. So maybe I should convert everything to months to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me redo the units. The youngest is 7 years, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The sum of all their ages is 250 years. Wait, no, wait, the sum is 250, but in which unit? The problem says the sum is 250. Wait, the problem says, \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" So I think 250 is in years. Because the individual ages are in years. So 250 years total. Hmm, that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 250 in months. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work entirely in months. Let me try that. So, the first term a1 is 84 months. Common difference d is 3 months. The sum S of n terms is 250 years. Wait, but 250 years is 250 * 12 = 3000 months. So the sum of all the members' ages in months is 3000.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me read the problem again. It says the ages are in A.P., common difference 3 months. The youngest is 7 years old. Sum of ages is 250. So, 250 in what? The problem says \"sum of the ages\", and the ages are given in years (youngest is 7 years). So probably the sum is 250 years. So, each member's age is in years, so the sum is 250 years.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. For example, if there are 25 members, each averaging around 10 years, sum would be 250. So maybe that's possible. But let me get back to the math.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an AP is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nBut wait, I have to make sure the units are consistent. Let's make everything in years. So a is 7 years, d is 3 months, which is 3/12 = 0.25 years. The sum S is 250 years.\n\nSo plug into the formula:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute this step by step. Let me expand the terms:\n\n2*7 is 14.\n\n(n-1)*0.25 is 0.25(n-1).\n\nSo inside the brackets: 14 + 0.25(n-1) = 14 + 0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n )\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal.\n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2\n\n13.75n *4= 55n\n\n500 *4= 2000\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait: 0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2.\n\n13.75 *4 is 55.\n\n-500 *4 is -2000.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0\n\nWait, wait, I think I messed up the signs. Let me re-examine.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 2:\n\n500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n )\n\nWhich is 500 = 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 = 0.\n\nMultiplying by 4:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, solve for n using quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 + 4 *1 *2000.\n\nWait, because c is negative, so 4ac is 4 *1 * (-2000) = -8000. But since the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac, it becomes 55^2 -4*(1)*(-2000) = 55^2 + 8000.\n\n55^2 is 3025. 3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nsqrt(11025) is 105, because 105 *105=11025.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2).\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because n can't be negative.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) /2 = 50 /2 =25.\n\nAlternatively, (-55 -105)/2= -160/2= -80, which we discard.\n\nSo n=25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because 25 is one of the options, option C.\n\nSo that would be the answer. But wait, let me cross-verify.\n\nLet me compute the sum with n=25.\n\nSum S= n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\na=7, d=0.25 years.\n\nSo S=25/2 [14 + 24 *0.25 ]\n\n24 *0.25 is 6.\n\nSo 14+6=20.\n\n25/2 *20 = (25 *20)/2 = 250. Which matches the given sum.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (AP) with the youngest member being 7 years old and a common difference of 3 months (which is 0.25 years).

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club, with the options given.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what an arithmetic progression is. An A.P. is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. In this case, the common difference is 3 months. But wait, the youngest is 7 years old. Oh, right, so I should probably convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. Or maybe I should convert everything into months. Let's see.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as 'n'. The ages will then form an A.P. starting at 84 months with a common difference of 3 months.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'n' is the number of terms.\n\nWait, but the sum given is 250. Oh, but wait, the sum is in years, right? Because the ages are given in years and months. So perhaps I should convert the sum into months to keep the units consistent. 250 years? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the sum is of ages, which are given as 7 years, so I think the sum is in years. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: the sum is 250. The problem says, \"the sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" So the sum is 250 years? That seems a bit off because if each member is 7 years or older, and say, 25 members, that would be way more than 250. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. So, 250 is in years. Hmm, but if each member is 7 or older, and the difference is 3 months, the sum could be 250 years. So let me think in terms of years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to convert everything into months. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, the youngest is 7 years = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months. The sum S is 250 years. Wait, but 250 years is 250 * 12 = 3000 months. Hmm, that's a lot. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the sum is 250 years? But that can't be, because the sum of ages in a club of, say, 25 members would be 250 if each is 10 on average. But the youngest is 7, so maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work in years. Let me try that.\n\nSo the first term a = 7 years. Common difference d = 3 months = 0.25 years. So the terms are 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc.\n\nThe sum S is 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n500 = 14n + 0.25n(n -1)\n\nHmm, let's multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal. Alternatively, maybe expand it first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the equation:\n\n500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n500 = 0.25n^2 + (14n -0.25n)\n500 = 0.25n^2 + 13.75n\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n2000 = n^2 + 55n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nn^2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0\n\nWe can solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an = 1, bn=55, cn= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (55)^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\nSquare root of D is sqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2*1)\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) / 2 = (50)/2 =25\n\nSo n is 25. Let me check the options. Option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps.\n\nI converted the common difference to 0.25 years.\n\nSum S is 250.\n\nEquation: 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 14 -0.25 =13.75, so 13.75 +0.25n.\n\nSo 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nWhich gives 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 = 55n + n\u00b2\n\nSo equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nDiscriminant: 55\u00b2 is 3025. 4ac is 4*1*2000=8000. So 3025 +8000=11025.\n\nsqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo solutions: (-55 \u00b1105)/2.\n\nPositive solution: (50)/2=25.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If there are 25 members, the sum is 250. Let me compute the sum again with n=25.\n\nThe first term is 7, the last term is 7 + (25-1)*0.25 = 7 +24*0.25=7+6=13 years.\n\nSum = number of terms * (first + last)/2 =25*(7+13)/2=25*(20)/2=25*10=250. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is 25, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.). The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find out how many members are in the club, with the options given.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what an arithmetic progression is. An A.P. is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. In this case, the common difference is 3 months. But wait, the youngest is 7 years old. Oh, right, so I should probably convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so 0.25 years. Or maybe I should convert everything into months. Let's see.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous one.\n\nLet me denote the number of members as 'n'. The ages will then form an A.P. starting at 84 months with a common difference of 3 months.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where 'a' is the first term, 'd' is the common difference, and 'n' is the number of terms.\n\nWait, but the sum given is 250. Oh, but wait, the sum is in years, right? Because the ages are given in years and months. So perhaps I should convert the sum into months to keep the units consistent. 250 years? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the sum is of ages, which are given as 7 years, so I think the sum is in years. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: the sum is 250. The problem says, \"the sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" So the sum is 250 years? That seems a bit off because if each member is 7 years or older, and say, 25 members, that would be way more than 250. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. So, 250 is in years. Hmm, but if each member is 7 or older, and the difference is 3 months, the sum could be 250 years. So let me think in terms of years.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to convert everything into months. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, the youngest is 7 years = 84 months. The common difference d is 3 months. The sum S is 250 years. Wait, but 250 years is 250 * 12 = 3000 months. Hmm, that's a lot. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the sum is 250 years? But that can't be, because the sum of ages in a club of, say, 25 members would be 250 if each is 10 on average. But the youngest is 7, so maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work in years. Let me try that.\n\nSo the first term a = 7 years. Common difference d = 3 months = 0.25 years. So the terms are 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc.\n\nThe sum S is 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n500 = 14n + 0.25n(n -1)\n\nHmm, let's multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal. Alternatively, maybe expand it first.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to rearrange the equation:\n\n500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n500 = 0.25n^2 + (14n -0.25n)\n500 = 0.25n^2 + 13.75n\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n2000 = n^2 + 55n\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nn^2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0\n\nWe can solve for n using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an = 1, bn=55, cn= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (55)^2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\nSquare root of D is sqrt(11025) = 105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/(2*1)\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because number of members can't be negative.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) / 2 = (50)/2 =25\n\nSo n is 25. Let me check the options. Option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps.\n\nI converted the common difference to 0.25 years.\n\nSum S is 250.\n\nEquation: 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 = n [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 14 -0.25 =13.75, so 13.75 +0.25n.\n\nSo 500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nWhich gives 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 = 55n + n\u00b2\n\nSo equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nDiscriminant: 55\u00b2 is 3025. 4ac is 4*1*2000=8000. So 3025 +8000=11025.\n\nsqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo solutions: (-55 \u00b1105)/2.\n\nPositive solution: (50)/2=25.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If there are 25 members, the sum is 250. Let me compute the sum again with n=25.\n\nThe first term is 7, the last term is 7 + (25-1)*0.25 = 7 +24*0.25=7+6=13 years.\n\nSum = number of terms * (first + last)/2 =25*(7+13)/2=25*(20)/2=25*10=250. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of members in a club where their ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all ages is 250 years.

Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe club has members whose ages form an arithmetic progression (A.P.), and the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of all their ages is 250. We need to find the number of members.\n\nHmm, so arithmetic progression means each term increases by a fixed amount. Here, the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, right? So 3/12 = 0.25 years.\n\nWait, but sometimes in problems like this, people might mix units. Like, maybe the ages are in years and the common difference is in months. I need to make sure I handle the units correctly. Let me think\u2014since the sum is given in years (250), I should convert everything into years to keep the units consistent.\n\nSo the first term, a1, is 7 years. The common difference, d, is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. The number of terms, n, is what we're trying to find. The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. Or wait, another version is S_n = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Either way, both formulas are equivalent.\n\nLet me write down the formula I remember: S_n = (n/2) * [2a1 + (n-1)d]. Yeah, that's right. So plugging in the values I have:\n\nS_n = 250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nWait, let's compute the terms inside the brackets. 2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25. So the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * [14 + 0.25(n -1)]\n\nExpanding the right side: 14n + 0.25n(n -1)\n\nSo 500 = 14n + 0.25n\u00b2 - 0.25n\n\nCombine like terms: 14n - 0.25n = 13.75n\n\nSo 500 = 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the 0.25. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply each term by 4:\n\n4*500 = 4*(0.25n\u00b2) +4*(13.75n)\n\n2000 = n\u00b2 + 55n\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check my steps again. Because 0.25*4 is 1, so 0.25n\u00b2 becomes n\u00b2. 13.75 *4 is 55. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for n. Let's apply the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 +bx +c = 0, the solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nWhat's the square root of 11025? Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is (100+5)^2 = 10000 + 1000 +25=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nWait, but 25 is one of the options. Let me check the options: C)25, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nSo let's recap:\n\n- Youngest age is 7 years.\n- Common difference is 3 months = 0.25 years.\n- Sum is 250 years.\n\nUsing the sum formula:\n\nSum = (n/2) * [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25n -0.25]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n500 = n [13.75 +0.25n]\n\nExpanding:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n2000 = 55n + n\u00b2 \u2192 n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)]/2\n\nWait, no, the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0, so when I compute discriminant, it's b\u00b2 -4ac. So 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4ac is 4*1*(-2000)= -8000. So D=3025 +8000=11025, as before.\n\nSo n=( -55 +105 )/2=50/2=25.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sum formula. Sometimes I get confused between the two sum formulas. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is also S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the nth term.\n\nan = a1 + (n-1)d \u2192 7 + (n-1)*0.25\n\nSo sum S = n*(7 + [7 + (n-1)*0.25])/2 \u2192 n*(14 +0.25(n-1))/2.\n\nWhich is the same as the first equation I used. So that's correct.\n\nSo with n=25, let's compute the sum to verify.\n\nCompute a1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nThe last term a25 =7 + (25-1)*0.25 =7 +24*(0.25)=7+6=13 years.\n\nSum S =25*(7+13)/2 =25*(20)/2=25*10=250. Which matches the given sum. So yes, n=25 is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C)25.\n",

Let me check the options: C)25, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nSo let's recap:\n\n- Youngest age is 7 years.\n- Common difference is 3 months = 0.25 years.\n- Sum is 250 years.\n\nUsing the sum formula:\n\nSum = (n/2) * [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25n -0.25]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n500 = n [13.75 +0.25n]\n\nExpanding:\n\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n2000 = 55n + n\u00b2 \u2192 n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)]/2\n\nWait, no, the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0, so when I compute discriminant, it's b\u00b2 -4ac. So 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4ac is 4*1*(-2000)= -8000. So D=3025 +8000=11025, as before.\n\nSo n=( -55 +105 )/2=50/2=25.\n\nSo the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sum formula. Sometimes I get confused between the two sum formulas. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is also S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the nth term.\n\nan = a1 + (n-1)d \u2192 7 + (n-1)*0.25\n\nSo sum S = n*(7 + [7 + (n-1)*0.25])/2 \u2192 n*(14 +0.25(n-1))/2.\n\nWhich is the same as the first equation I used. So that's correct.\n\nSo with n=25, let's compute the sum to verify.\n\nCompute a1=7, d=0.25, n=25.\n\nThe last term a25 =7 + (25-1)*0.25 =7 +24*(0.25)=7+6=13 years.\n\nSum S =25*(7+13)/2 =25*(20)/2=25*10=250. Which matches the given sum. So yes, n=25 is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C)25.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression (A.P.):\n\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2a_1 + (n-1)d]\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\(a_1 = 7\\) (youngest member's age in years),\n- \\(d = 0.25\\) (common difference in years, since 3 months = 0.25 years),\n- \\(S_n = 250\\) (total sum of ages),\n- \\(n\\) is the number of members (to be determined).\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)]\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\cdot [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\\]\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n\\[\n500 = 14n + 0.25n^2 - 0.25n\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n500 = 0.25n^2 + 13.75n\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate decimals, multiply the entire equation by 4:\n\n\\[\n2000 = n^2 + 55n\n\\]\n\nRearrange into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 55\\), and \\(c = -2000\\). Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\\]\n\nTake the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11025} = 105\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be positive:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of members in the club is 25. Verifying with the sum formula confirms this result.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out how many members are in the club. Let's see, the problem says that the ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. Hmm, I need to find the number of members.\n\nWait, arithmetic progression. Right, so the ages go like 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., because each term increases by 3 months, which is a quarter of a year. Or wait, no, 3 months is a third of a year, but maybe I should convert everything into months to make it easier. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to convert all ages into months to avoid dealing with fractions. So, the youngest is 7 years old, which is 7 * 12 = 84 months. The common difference is 3 months. So each member's age in months is 84, 87, 90, and so on.\n\nSo the ages are 84, 87, 90,... and so on. Now, the sum of these ages is 250 years. Wait, 250 years? That can't be right because if each member is at least 7 years old, 250 years would mean a lot of members. Oh wait, wait! No, the sum is 250 years? Or is it 250 months? Wait, the problem says the sum is 250. Hmm, the units aren't specified, but the ages are given in years. So perhaps the sum is in years. Wait, but 250 years for the sum of the ages of all the members? That seems extremely high. Like, if you have 25 members each about 10 years old, that's 250. But 250 years for the sum would mean a very large number of members. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 250 months. That makes more sense. Wait, but the problem says the sum of the ages is 250. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. \"The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" Hmm. So if the ages are in years, then the sum would be in years as well. But that's a lot. Let me think: if the club has 10 members, each around 25 years old, the sum would be 250. But that's possible. But the youngest is 7, and the common difference is 3 months. So it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum is 250 years, which would be a lot of members. Let me think about which approach makes more sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just proceed with the problem in months to avoid confusion. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nSo, converting everything into months:\n\n- Youngest age: 7 years = 7 * 12 = 84 months.\n- Common difference: 3 months.\n- Sum of all ages: 250 years. Wait, that would be 250 * 12 = 3000 months. Or is the sum in years? Wait, the problem says the sum is 250. Hmm, the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me look again: \"the sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\" Since the ages are given in years, perhaps the sum is in years. So the sum is 250 years.\n\nWait, but that's a huge sum. Let's see, if there are 25 members, each about 10 years old, the sum is 250. So 25 members each at 10 years. But in this case, the members start at 7 and increase by 3 months each. So their ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5,... up to some maximum. Let me think: the sum of an arithmetic series is n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, d is the common difference.\n\nWait, but wait, if I'm using years, the common difference is 0.25 years (since 3 months is a quarter of a year). So d = 0.25 years.\n\nSo, the sum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] = 250.\n\nSo, a = 7 years, d = 0.25 years.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n250 = (n/2) [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 14 + 0.25(n-1)\n\nSo,\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]\n250 = (n/2)(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500 = n (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nSo,\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again.\n\nWait, 0.25n\u00b2 *4= n\u00b2. 13.75n *4= 55n. 500*4=2000, but it's -500, so 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0 \u2192 multiply by 4: 4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2, 4*13.75n =55n, 4*(-500)= -2000. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2. 13.75n *4=55n. -500 *4= -2000. So equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] / 2.\n\nCompute discriminant: 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4*2000 is 8000, so discriminant is 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is 105, since 105^2=11025.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1 105]/2. Since n can't be negative, take the positive root: (105-55)/2 =50/2=25. So n=25.\n\nWait, but 25 is one of the options. Option C is 25. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me go back.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] =250.\n\na=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo,\n\nn/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)] =250.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nn [14 + 0.25n -0.25] =500.\n\nn [13.75 +0.25n] =500.\n\nExpanding,\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n =500.\n\nMultiply by 4,\n\nn\u00b2 +55n = 2000.\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nQuadratic formula: n = [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*2000)] /2.\n\nWhich is [-55 \u00b1 sqrt(3025 +8000)]/2.\n\nWhich is sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo [ (-55 +105)/2 ] = 50/2=25. So n=25.\n\nSo that would make option C)25 the answer. But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the units. Because another approach is to convert everything into months, which might give a different result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should redo the problem in months. Let me try that approach.\n\nYoungest age: 84 months. Common difference: 3 months. Sum of ages: 250 years. Wait, 250 years is 250*12=3000 months. So sum S=3000 months.\n\nSum of an AP in months: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d], where a=84, d=3, S=3000.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2) [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 168 +3(n-1) =168 +3n -3= 165 +3n.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2)(3n +165)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n6000 = n (3n +165)\n\n3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0.\n\nDivide all terms by 3:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nWait, same equation as before. So same solution: n=25.\n\nSo, whether I compute in years or months, I end up with the same quadratic equation and same solution. So the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if the sum is 250 years, then 25 members each averaging 10 years would sum to 250. But the ages start at 7 and go up by 3 months each time. So the average age is (first + last)/2. Hmm, but the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the average age. The average age would be sum divided by n. So 250/n years. The average of an AP is (a1 + an)/2. So 250/n = (7 + (7 + (n-1)*0.25 )) /2.\n\nHmm, let's compute that:\n\n250/n = [14 + (n-1)*0.25 ] /2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500/n =14 +0.25(n-1).\n\nMultiply both sides by n:\n\n500 =14n +0.25n(n-1).\n\nWhich is same as before: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nWhich leads to the same quadratic. So n=25.\n\nSo the answer should be 25, option C.\n",

So the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if the sum is 250 years, then 25 members each averaging 10 years would sum to 250. But the ages start at 7 and go up by 3 months each time. So the average age is (first + last)/2. Hmm, but the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the average age. The average age would be sum divided by n. So 250/n years. The average of an AP is (a1 + an)/2. So 250/n = (7 + (7 + (n-1)*0.25 )) /2.\n\nHmm, let's compute that:\n\n250/n = [14 + (n-1)*0.25 ] /2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n500/n =14 +0.25(n-1).\n\nMultiply both sides by n:\n\n500 =14n +0.25n(n-1).\n\nWhich is same as before: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0.\n\nWhich leads to the same quadratic. So n=25.\n\nSo the answer should be 25, option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we note that the ages of the club members form an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with the following parameters:\n\n- **First term (a):** The youngest member is 7 years old, so \\( a = 7 \\).\n- **Common difference (d):** The ages increase by 3 months, which is \\( 0.25 \\) years.\n- **Sum of ages (S):** The total sum of the ages is 250 years.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a + (n-1)d \\right]\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2(7) + (n-1)(0.25) \\right]\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25(n-1) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 \\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nExpand and rearrange:\n\n\\[\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\).

Hmm, let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of all the members' ages is 250. I need to find the number of members. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused because the common difference is in months and the ages are given in years. I should probably convert everything to the same unit to avoid mistakes. Let me think. Oh, right, 3 months is a quarter of a year, so that's 0.25 years. Or maybe I should work in months entirely. Hmm, maybe converting everything into months would be easier.\n\nWait, let's try it both ways. First, let me think in years. The youngest is 7 years, each subsequent member is 0.25 years older. So the A.P. would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, etc., each term increasing by 0.25.\n\nThe sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, S is 250 years. a is 7, d is 0.25. So plugging into the formula:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute that. 2*7 is 14. So the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nHmm, let's expand that. Let's compute the bracket first:\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nWhich is a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0.\n\nHmm, maybe multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nWait, let me check that. 0.25*4=1, 13.75*4=55, 500*4=2000.

The quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nCalculating the discriminant: 55\u00b2 is 3025, 4ac is 4*1*(-2000) = -8000. So discriminant is 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025 is 105, because 105*105=11025. So,\n\nn = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can discard the negative solution because number of members can't be negative. So,\n\nn = ( -55 +105 ) /2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nWait, 25 is one of the options, option C. Hmm, but I should double-check because sometimes I might have messed up the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try working in months to see if I get the same result. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe youngest is 7 years old, which is 7*12=84 months. The common difference is 3 months.\n\nSum of ages in months would be 250 years *12=3000 months.\n\nSo the A.P. is 84, 87, 90,... with d=3. Sum S =n/2 [2a + (n-1)d].\n\nHere, a=84, d=3, S=3000.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2) [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nCompute 2*84=168.\n\nSo,\n\n3000 = (n/2) [168 +3(n-1)]\n\n= (n/2) [168 +3n -3] = (n/2)(165 +3n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n6000 =n(165 +3n) =3n\u00b2 +165n.\n\nBring all terms to one side: 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0.\n\nDivide equation by 3: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nSame equation as before. So same solution, n=25.\n\nHmm, so that's consistent. So the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I get the sum correctly? The sum is 250 years.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members.\n\nAlright, so first, let's break down the information. The ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So each member is 3 months older than the previous one. The first term of this AP is the youngest member's age, which is 7 years. But wait, the common difference is in months, so I should convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think: 7 years is 84 months because 7 times 12 is 84. And 3 months is 3 months. So the first term a1 is 84 months, and the common difference d is 3 months.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. Wait, no, another formula I remember is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Oh right, and since an = a1 + (n-1)d, I can use either formula.\n\nSo the sum here is given as 250 years. Wait, wait! Wait a second, the sum is 250, but the units here are a bit tricky. Because the ages are in months in the AP, but the total sum is given in years. Hmm. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nLet me clarify: each age is in months, so the sum in the AP would be in months. But the problem says the sum is 250 years. So I should convert 250 years into months to match the units. Let me do that. 250 years times 12 months per year is 3000 months. So the sum of all the ages in months is 3000.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each member's age is in months, so adding them all would give the total in months. The problem states the sum is 250 years, which is 3000 months. So the sum S is 3000 months.\n\nSo now, I can use the sum formula. Let me write down the variables:\n\na1 = 84 months (youngest)\nd = 3 months\nS = 3000 months\nn = ?\n\nSo the formula is S = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n3000 = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nLet me compute 2*84 first. That's 168. So the equation becomes:\n\n3000 = (n/2) [168 + 3(n-1)]\n\nLet me simplify inside the brackets. 3(n-1) is 3n -3. So 168 +3n -3 = 165 +3n.\n\nSo now, equation is:\n\n3000 = (n/2)(165 + 3n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6000 = n (165 +3n)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let's see if I can simplify it. Let's divide all terms by 3:\n\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, 6000 divided by 3 is 2000, right? So equation becomes:\n\nn^2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nHmm, okay. Now I can try to solve this quadratic equation for n. Let's use the quadratic formula.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find the number of members.\n\nAlright, so first, let's break down the information. The ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So each member is 3 months older than the previous one. The first term of this AP is the youngest member's age, which is 7 years. But wait, the common difference is in months, so I should convert everything into the same units to avoid confusion. Let me think: 7 years is 84 months because 7 times 12 is 84. And 3 months is 3 months. So the first term a1 is 84 months, and the common difference d is 3 months.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2 * (2a1 + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. Wait, no, another formula I remember is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where an is the last term. Oh right, and since an = a1 + (n-1)d, I can use either formula.\n\nSo the sum here is given as 250 years. Wait, wait! Wait a second, the sum is 250, but the units here are a bit tricky. Because the ages are in months in the AP, but the total sum is given in years. Hmm. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.\n\nLet me clarify: each age is in months, so the sum in the AP would be in months. But the problem says the sum is 250 years. So I should convert 250 years into months to match the units. Let me do that. 250 years times 12 months per year is 3000 months. So the sum of all the ages in months is 3000.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because each member's age is in months, so adding them all would give the total in months. The problem states the sum is 250 years, which is 3000 months. So the sum S is 3000 months.\n\nSo now, I can use the sum formula. Let me write down the variables:\n\na1 = 84 months (youngest)\nd = 3 months\nS = 3000 months\nn = ?\n\nSo the formula is S = n/2 [2a1 + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n3000 = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nLet me compute 2*84 first. That's 168. So the equation becomes:\n\n3000 = (n/2) [168 + 3(n-1)]\n\nLet me simplify inside the brackets. 3(n-1) is 3n -3. So 168 +3n -3 = 165 +3n.\n\nSo now, equation is:\n\n3000 = (n/2)(165 + 3n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6000 = n (165 +3n)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let's see if I can simplify it. Let's divide all terms by 3:\n\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\nWait, 6000 divided by 3 is 2000, right? So equation becomes:\n\nn^2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nHmm, okay. Now I can try to solve this quadratic equation for n. Let's use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is of the form an^2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb^2 is 55^2=3025\n\n4ac is 4*1*(-2000) = -8000\n\nSo the discriminant is 3025 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025\n\nsqrt(11025) is 105, because 105^2 is 11025.\n\nSo,\n\nn = [-55 \u00b1 105 ]/(2*1)\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2 =25\n\nn = (-55 -105)/2 = (-160)/2= -80\n\nSince the number of members can't be negative, we take n=25. So the number of members is 25. Let me check the options: option C is 25.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

So discriminant is 3025 +8000 = 11025. sqrt(11025) is 105. Correct.\n\nThen, (-55 +105) is 50, divided by 2 is 25. Correct. So n=25 is the solution.\n\nLooking back at the options: option C is 25. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me confirm that when I converted the sum into months, I did it correctly. The sum is 250 years. 250 years *12 months/year=3000 months.

The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club.\n\nLet me think about the steps. First, I should probably write down what I know. The common difference is 3 months, but I'm more comfortable working in years. So 3 months is 0.25 years, right? Because 3 divided by 12 is 0.25.\n\nThe youngest age is 7 years. So if there are 'n' members, their ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, and so on, each time adding 0.25 years. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. So each term increases by 0.25.\n\nNow, the sum of an AP is given by the formula: S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, S is 250 years, a is 7, d is 0.25. So plugging into the formula:\n\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step. 2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n -0.25. So the bracket becomes 14 + 0.25n -0.25. Which simplifies to 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation now is 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding the right side: 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n\u00b2.\n\nLet's rearrange this into standard quadratic form: 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0.\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals might complicate things. Let me multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal. That gives:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. Because 0.25*4 is 1, 13.75*4 is 55, and 500*4 is 2000. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, 0.25n\u00b2 *4 is n\u00b2. 13.75n *4 is 55n. 500 *4 is 2000, but since it's -500, it becomes -2000.\n\nSo the quadratic equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for n. Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an\u00b2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (55)^2 -4*1*(-2000). 55 squared is 3025. 4*2000 is 8000. So D=3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nThe square root of 11025 is... let's see, 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nSo n is 25. Looking at the options, option C is 25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with the sum, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So each term is 0.25 years apart. So the first term is 7, the second is 7.25, third is 7.5, etc.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] = 250.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nn/2 [14 + (n-1)(0.25)] =250.\n\nWhich is the same as n/2 [14 + 0.25n -0.25] = n/2 [13.75 +0.25n] =250.\n\nSo the equation is correct. Then 500=0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n, which when multiplied by 4 becomes n\u00b2+55n-2000=0.\n\nSolving gives n=25. So the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n",

Let's try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is an\u00b2 + bn + c =0, so a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac = (55)^2 -4*1*(-2000). 55 squared is 3025. 4*2000 is 8000. So D=3025 +8000= 11025.\n\nThe square root of 11025 is... let's see, 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2=11025. So sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-55 \u00b1105]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because the number of members can't be negative. So:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 = (50)/2 =25.\n\nSo n is 25. Looking at the options, option C is 25.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with the sum, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, the ages are in AP with a common difference of 3 months. So each term is 0.25 years apart. So the first term is 7, the second is 7.25, third is 7.5, etc.\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d] = 250.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nn/2 [14 + (n-1)(0.25)] =250.\n\nWhich is the same as n/2 [14 + 0.25n -0.25] = n/2 [13.75 +0.25n] =250.\n\nSo the equation is correct. Then 500=0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n, which when multiplied by 4 becomes n\u00b2+55n-2000=0.\n\nSolving gives n=25. So the number of members is 25, which is option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves a club where the ages of members form an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference of 3 months (0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, and the total sum of all ages is 250 years. The goal is to determine the number of members in the club.\n\nThe sum of an AP is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2a + (n-1)d \\right]\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S = 250 \\) (total sum of ages),\n- \\( a = 7 \\) (age of the youngest member),\n- \\( d = 0.25 \\) (common difference in years),\n- \\( n \\) is the number of members.\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 2(7) + (n-1)(0.25) \\right]\n\\]\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n2(7) = 14, \\quad (n-1)(0.25) = 0.25n - 0.25\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 \\right]\n\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[ 13.75 + 0.25n \\right]\n\\]\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2\n\\]\n\nRearrange into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate decimals, multiply all terms by 4:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 55 \\), and \\( c = -2000 \\). Compute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4(1)(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025\n\\]\n\nThe square root of the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11025} = 105\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, take the positive solution:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 + 105}{2} = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of members in the club is 25, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Answer: C**",
