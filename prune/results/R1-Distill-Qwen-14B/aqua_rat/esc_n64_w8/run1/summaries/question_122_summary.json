      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a cyclist traveling at a certain speed, and I need to find out how long it takes to go a certain distance. Hmm, let me think. The cyclist's speed is 12 miles per hour, and the distance is 48 miles. The question asks for the time in minutes, right?\n\nWait, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. Yeah, the formula is time = distance / speed. So in this case, the distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. Let me plug those numbers in.\n\nSo time in hours would be 48 divided by 12. Let me do that division: 48 \u00f7 12 equals 4. So that's 4 hours. But the question wants the time in minutes. Oh, right, I need to convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nSo 4 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour. 4 times 60 is 240. So the time should be 240 minutes. Let me check the options. Option B is 240, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 12 miles per hour means the cyclist covers 12 miles in 60 minutes. So for 48 miles, how many 12-mile segments are there? 48 divided by 12 is 4. So 4 segments. Each segment takes 60 minutes. So 4 times 60 is 240 minutes. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the options are A)1, B)240, C)30, D)60, E)120. So the correct choice is B.\n",

But the question asks for minutes, not hours. Right, I have to convert hours into minutes.\n\nOne hour is 60 minutes. So 4 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour. Let me calculate that: 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Oh, that's a big number. Let me check the options.\n\nThe options are A)1, B)240, C)30, D)60, E)120. So B is 240, which matches my calculation. That makes sense because 12 mph for 48 miles would take 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.\n\nWait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. 12 miles per hour means in one hour, the cyclist goes 12 miles. So in two hours, 24; three, 36; four, 48. Yep, four hours. So 4 *60 is 240 minutes. So the correct answer must be B.\n\n\nTo determine how many minutes it takes for a cyclist traveling at 12 miles per hour to cover 48 miles, we use the formula for time:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{D}{S}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(D = 48 \\, \\text{miles}\\) and \\(S = 12 \\, \\text{mph}\\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{48}{12} = 4 \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[\n4 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 60 \\, \\text{minutes/hour} = 240 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **240 minutes**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, let's think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So the formula should be time = distance / speed. The distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So I'll plug those numbers in. \n\nCalculating that, 48 divided by 12 equals 4. Oh wait, that gives me hours, right? Because the speed is in hours. So the time is 4 hours. But the question asks for minutes. Oh right, I need to convert hours to minutes. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour. Let me do that math. 4 times 60 is 240. So the time in minutes is 240. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 240. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If the cyclist goes 12 mph, in one hour they do 12 miles. So in four hours, that's 12*4=48 miles. Yep, that makes sense. So 4 hours is 240 minutes. That seems right. No, I don't think I made any mistakes there. So the correct answer should be option B.\n",
