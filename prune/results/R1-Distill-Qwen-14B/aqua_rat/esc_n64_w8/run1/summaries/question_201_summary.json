      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe question says that the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I remember that the formula for simple interest is straightforward: S.I. = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. So in this case, S.I. would be 5000 * R * 2.\n\nCompound interest is a bit trickier. The formula for C.I. when compounded annually is P * (1 + R/100)^T - P. So for 2 years, it would be 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. But wait, since we're dealing with the difference between C.I. and S.I., maybe I can express that difference using the formulas.\n\nThe difference is given as Rs.72. So C.I. minus S.I. equals 72. Let me write that out:\n\nC.I. - S.I. = 72\n\nSubstituting the formulas:\n\n[5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000] - [5000*R*2] = 72\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out the 5000 to simplify. Let's see:\n\n5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 - 2R/100 ] = 72\n\nWait, because 5000*R*2 is 10000R, but when I factor 5000, it's 5000*(R*2) which is 5000*(2R/100) when expressed as a percentage. Wait, no, maybe I should expand the (1 + R/100)^2 term first.\n\nExpanding (1 + R/100)^2 gives 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So substituting that:\n\n5000 [ (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ) - 1 - (2R/100) ] =72\n\nSimplify inside the brackets. The 1 and -1 cancel. The 2*(R/100) and -2*(R/100) also cancel. So what's left is (R^2)/(10000).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n5000 * (R^2 / 10000) =72\n\nSimplify this. 5000 divided by 10000 is 0.5. So 0.5 * R^2 =72.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R^2 = 144.\n\nTaking the square root: R=12. Since rates are positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo the rate is 12%. Let me check the options. Option B is 12%, so that's the answer.\n",

The question says that the difference between simple interest and compound interest on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. The options given are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, but I'll try to work through it.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time, right? So for SI, it's P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. For compound interest, especially when it's compounded annually, it's P times (1 + R/100)^T minus P. But wait, since the time is 2 years here, I think the formula would be P*(1+R/100)^2 minus P, which gives the amount, and then subtract the principal to get the interest.\n\nWait, no. Actually, compound interest for 2 years would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Because the first year's interest is added to the principal for the second year's calculation. So the total amount after 2 years is that, and the CI is the amount minus principal.\n\nSo the SI for 2 years is P*R*T, which is 5000 * R * 2. And the CI is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. The difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So I can set up the equation: CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nCI = 5000 * ( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 )\nSI = 5000 * R * 2\n\nDifference = CI - SI = 72.\n\nSo substituting, 5000 * [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 - (2R/100) ] = 72.\n\nWait, let me think again. CI is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ), and SI is 5000*R*2. So when I subtract SI from CI, I get 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 - 2R/100 ) =72.\n\nLet me compute (1 + R/100)^2. Expanding that, it's 1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtracting 1 gives 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Then subtract 2R/100, so the expression inside the brackets becomes (2R/100 + R\u00b2/10000) - 2R/100, which simplifies to R\u00b2/(10000).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the entire equation becomes 5000 * ( R\u00b2 / (10000) ) =72.\n\nBecause the 2R/100 terms cancel out. So:\n\n5000 * (R\u00b2 / 10000) =72.\n\nSimplify 5000/10000: that's 0.5. So 0.5 * R\u00b2 =72.\n\nThen R squared is 72 /0.5, which is 144.\n\nSo R squared is 144, so R is 12 or -12. But since rate can't be negative, R is 12%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math because that seems straightforward. So R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12. So the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Another way to approach it is to compute SI and CI for each option and see which gives a difference of 72.\n\nLet's try option B: 12% rate.\n\nCompute SI for 2 years: 5000 *12 *2 /100 = 5000 *24/100 = 5000 *0.24 = 1200.\n\nCompute CI: 5000*(1.12)^2. Let's calculate 1.12 squared: 1.2544. So 5000 *1.2544 = 6272. So the CI is 6272 -5000= 1272.\n\nDifference is CI - SI = 1272 - 1200 =72. Yep, that matches. So the answer should be B)12%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the difference between simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I remember that the formula for simple interest is P*R*T/100, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. For compound interest, since it's compounded annually, I think the formula is P*(1 + R/100)^T - P.\n\nWait, right. So the difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72. So the formula would be: CI - SI = 72. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, let me compute both SI and CI.\n\nSI = (P * R * T)/100. Here, P is 5000, T is 2 years. So SI = (5000 * R * 2)/100. Simplifying that, it's (10000 R)/100, which is 100 R. So SI is 100 R.\n\nNow for CI. CI is calculated as P*( (1 + R/100)^T ) - P. So for 2 years, it's 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 ) - 5000. Let's expand that (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when you multiply by 5000, you get 5000 + 100 R + (5000*(R^2))/(10000). Wait, simplifying that, 5000*(R^2)/(10000) is (5000/10000)*R^2 = 0.5 R^2. So the CI is 5000 + 100 R + 0.5 R^2. Then subtracting the principal 5000, CI = 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo the difference between CI and SI is (100 R + 0.5 R^2) - (100 R) = 0.5 R^2. And this is equal to 72. So 0.5 R^2 = 72.\n\nWait, solving for R. Let's see: 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 \u2192 R\u00b2=144. So R is sqrt(144) =12. So the rate is 12%. \n\nLet me check the options. Option B is 12%, so that's the answer. Hmm, wait, is there any chance I made a mistake in the CI calculation? Because sometimes I mix up the formulas. Let me recheck.\n\nCI for 2 years is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Expanding that gives P*(1 + 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2) - P = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2). So that's (2PR/100) + (P R\u00b2)/(100)^2. \n\nIn this case, P is 5000. So substituting:\n\n2PR/100 = (2*5000*R)/100 = (10000 R)/100 = 100 R. \n\nThe other term is (5000 * R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2. Subtracting SI, which is 100 R, the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2. So yes, 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%. \n\nSo the correct option is B) 12%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the difference between simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. I remember that the formula for simple interest is P*R*T/100, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. For compound interest, since it's compounded annually, I think the formula is P*(1 + R/100)^T - P.\n\nWait, right. So the difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72. So the formula would be: CI - SI = 72. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst, let me compute both SI and CI.\n\nSI = (P * R * T)/100. Here, P is 5000, T is 2 years. So SI = (5000 * R * 2)/100. Simplifying that, it's (10000 R)/100, which is 100 R. So SI is 100 R.\n\nNow for CI. CI is calculated as P*( (1 + R/100)^T ) - P. So for 2 years, it's 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 ) - 5000. Let's expand that (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So when you multiply by 5000, you get 5000 + 100 R + (5000*(R^2))/(10000). Wait, simplifying that, 5000*(R^2)/(10000) is (5000/10000)*R^2 = 0.5 R^2. So the CI is 5000 + 100 R + 0.5 R^2. Then subtracting the principal 5000, CI = 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo the difference between CI and SI is (100 R + 0.5 R^2) - (100 R) = 0.5 R^2. And this is equal to 72. So 0.5 R^2 = 72.\n\nWait, solving for R. Let's see: 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 \u2192 R\u00b2=144. So R is sqrt(144) =12. So the rate is 12%. \n\nLet me check the options. Option B is 12%, so that's the answer. Hmm, wait, is there any chance I made a mistake in the CI calculation? Because sometimes I mix up the formulas. Let me recheck.\n\nCI for 2 years is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Expanding that gives P*(1 + 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2) - P = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2). So that's (2PR/100) + (P R\u00b2)/(100)^2. \n\nIn this case, P is 5000. So substituting:\n\n2PR/100 = (2*5000*R)/100 = (10000 R)/100 = 100 R. \n\nThe other term is (5000 * R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2. Subtracting SI, which is 100 R, the difference is 0.5 R\u00b2. So yes, 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%. \n\nSo the correct option is B) 12%.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the rate of interest \\( R \\) where the difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.\n\n1. **Simple Interest (SI):**  \n   The formula for SI is:  \n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100}\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( P = 5000 \\), \\( T = 2 \\):  \n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compound Interest (CI):**  \n   The formula for CI (compounded annually) is:  \n   \\[\n   CI = P \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^T - P\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( P = 5000 \\), \\( T = 2 \\):  \n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000\n   \\]  \n   Expanding \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 = 1 + 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\n   \\]  \n   Substituting back:  \n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{2R}{100} + \\frac{R^2}{10000}\\right) - 5000\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 + 100R + \\frac{0.5R^2}{1}\n   \\]  \n   Subtracting the principal \\( 5000 \\):  \n   \\[\n   CI = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Difference Between CI and SI:**  \n   The difference is given as Rs. 72:  \n   \\[\n   CI - SI = 72\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( CI = 100R + 0.5R^2 \\) and \\( SI = 100R \\):  \n   \\[\n   (100R + 0.5R^2) - 100R = 72\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 = 72\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( R \\):  \n   \\[\n   R^2 = \\frac{72}{0.5} = 144\n   \\]  \n   \\[\n   R = \\sqrt{144} = 12\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the rate of interest is **12%**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm. Let me think. The problem says the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time divided by 100, right? So the formula is S.I. = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100. For compound interest, especially when it's compounded annually, the formula is P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T minus P. So for two years, C.I. would be P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1).\n\nThe difference between C.I. and S.I. is given as Rs.72. So, C.I. minus S.I. equals 72. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, C.I. = 5000 \u00d7 [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]\nS.I. = (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2)/100 = (5000 \u00d7 2R)/100 = 100 R.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again. 5000 * R * 2 is 10,000 R. Divided by 100, that's 100 R. So S.I. is 100 R.\n\nThen C.I. is 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ].\n\nSo the difference is C.I. - S.I. = 72.\n\nSo, 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] - 100 R = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding that would help. Let me compute the C.I. term.\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtract 1, it becomes 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2).\n\nMultiply by 5000: 5000 * [ (2R/100) + (R\u00b2)/(10000) ) ].\n\nWhich is 5000*(2R/100) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5000 * 2R / 100 = 100 * 2R = 200 R.\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 / 10000 = (5000 / 10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. is 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (100 R) from that: 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 - 100 R = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThis equals 72. So the equation is:\n\n100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nLet me write that as 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R -72 =0. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 + 200 R - 144 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nWait, 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R =72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply each term by 2: R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, wait a second. That seems a bit off because looking at the options, the rate is probably a low percentage. Let me check my calculations again because getting a quadratic equation with R\u00b2 and 200 R seems a bit odd for this problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nLet me go back. The difference is C.I. - S.I. =72.\n\nC.I. is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 )\n\nS.I. is 5000*(R*2)/100 = 100 R.\n\nSo the difference is:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 100 R =72.\n\nExpanding (1 + R/100)^2: 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000).\n\nSo (1 + R/100)^2 -1 is 2*(R/100) + R\u00b2/(10000).\n\nMultiply by 5000:\n\n5000 * [ 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000) ] = 5000*(2R/100) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000).\n\nWhich is 5000 * (2R/100) = 100 * 2 R = 200 R.\n\nAnd 5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. is 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (100 R) \u2192 200 R +0.5 R\u00b2 - 100 R = 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSet equal to 72: 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo equation: 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because with options up to 12%, plugging R=12 gives:\n\nR\u00b2=144, 200 R=2400. So equation becomes 144 +2400 -144=2400 \u22600. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nC.I. - S.I. =72 \u2192 (200 R +0.5 R\u00b2) - (100 R) =72 \u2192 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nWait, correct. So 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72=0. Multiply by 2: R\u00b2 +200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, that's correct. Now, solving this quadratic equation. Quadratic formula: R = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ]/(2a), where a=1, b=200, c=-144.\n\nSo discriminant D = 200\u00b2 -4*1*(-144) =40000 +576=40576.\n\nsqrt(40576) is let's see. 200\u00b2 is 40000, so 201\u00b2 is 40401, 202\u00b2=40804. So 40576 is between 201 and 202. Let me compute 201.4\u00b2: 201\u00b2=40401, 201.4\u00b2= (201 +0.4)^2=201\u00b2 + 2*201*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2=40401 +160.8 +0.16=40561.96. Hmm, which is close to 40576. So maybe 201.42 or something. But perhaps it's exact.\n\nWait, 201.42 squared? Maybe I should compute 201.4\u00b2.\n\nWait, 201.4 * 201.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute 200 *200 =40000.\n\n200 *1.4=280, so 200*201.4=200*(200+1.4)=40000+280=40280.\n\n1.4 *200=280, 1.4*1.4=1.96.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: (200 +1.4)^2 = 200\u00b2 + 2*200*1.4 +1.4\u00b2=40000 +560 +1.96=40561.96.\n\nHmm, 40576 is 14 more than 40561.96. So perhaps the square is 201.4 + some decimals. But maybe the exact value is 201.424? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic equation can be factored. Let's see R\u00b2 +200 R -144=0.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -144 and add up to 200. Hmm, perhaps 202 and -0.8? Not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I should try the quadratic formula.\n\nSo R = [ -200 \u00b1 sqrt(40000 + 576) ] / 2 = [ -200 \u00b1 sqrt(40576) ] / 2.\n\nCompute sqrt(40576): Let me see, 201 *201=40401, 202\u00b2=40804. So 40576 is between them. Let me compute 201.4^2=40561.96 as before. 40576-40561.96=14.04. So to get 14.04 more, perhaps 201.4 + (14.04)/(2*201.4) \u2248 201.4 + ~0.035=201.435.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the discriminant again. D=200^2 +4*1*144=40000 +576=40576. Hmm, sqrt(40576) is 201.424 approximately.\n\nSo R= [ -200 + 201.424 ] /2 \u2192 (1.424)/2=0.712. So R\u22487.12%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the closest is 8% (option D). Or maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me go back. The equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0. So a=0.5, b=100, c=-72.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up earlier when I multiplied by 2. Let me re-express it.\n\nWait, the correct equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72=0. Let me write this as 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0. Multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0. No, that's correct. So a=1, b=200, c=-144.\n\nWait, but solving that gives R\u22487.12%, which isn't one of the options. The options are 10,12,6,8,4.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is S.I. - C.I. =72? No, the question says the difference between C.I. and S.I. is Rs.72. So C.I. is higher than S.I. by 72, which makes sense because C.I. grows faster.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me compute the difference again.\n\nC.I. for 2 years: P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P = P* (2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 )\n\nSo C.I. = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nS.I. is P*R*T/100 = 5000*R*2/100 = 100 R.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000)) -100 R = 5000*(2R/100) +5000*(R\u00b2/10000) -100 R.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5000*(2R/100) = 100 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 -100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait a minute! Oh! I think I see where I went wrong. Because 5000*(2R/100) is 5000*(2R)/100 = (5000/100)*2R =50*2R=100 R. Then subtract 100 R, so the 100 R terms cancel out. So the difference is just 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, so that's a much simpler equation. 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144 \u2192 R = sqrt(144) =12.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nOh! So I must have made a mistake earlier in the setup. I think I added the 100 R when I shouldn't have. Let me redo the difference.\n\nWait, C.I. is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) = 5000*( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) = 5000*( 2R/100 ) +5000*( R\u00b2/(10000) ) = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nS.I. is 100 R.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2=72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%.\n\nAh, that's it! So the correct answer is 12%, option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about simple interest and compound interest, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm. Let me think. The problem says the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time divided by 100, right? So the formula is S.I. = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100. For compound interest, especially when it's compounded annually, the formula is P \u00d7 (1 + R/100)^T minus P. So for two years, C.I. would be P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1).\n\nThe difference between C.I. and S.I. is given as Rs.72. So, C.I. minus S.I. equals 72. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, C.I. = 5000 \u00d7 [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]\nS.I. = (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2)/100 = (5000 \u00d7 2R)/100 = 100 R.\n\nWait, wait, let me compute that again. 5000 * R * 2 is 10,000 R. Divided by 100, that's 100 R. So S.I. is 100 R.\n\nThen C.I. is 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ].\n\nSo the difference is C.I. - S.I. = 72.\n\nSo, 5000 [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] - 100 R = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding that would help. Let me compute the C.I. term.\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtract 1, it becomes 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2).\n\nMultiply by 5000: 5000 * [ (2R/100) + (R\u00b2)/(10000) ) ].\n\nWhich is 5000*(2R/100) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5000 * 2R / 100 = 100 * 2R = 200 R.\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 / 10000 = (5000 / 10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. is 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (100 R) from that: 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 - 100 R = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThis equals 72. So the equation is:\n\n100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72.\n\nLet me write that as 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R -72 =0. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 + 200 R - 144 = 0.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nWait, 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R =72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2 + 100 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply each term by 2: R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, wait a second. That seems a bit off because looking at the options, the rate is probably a low percentage. Let me check my calculations again because getting a quadratic equation with R\u00b2 and 200 R seems a bit odd for this problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nLet me go back. The difference is C.I. - S.I. =72.\n\nC.I. is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 )\n\nS.I. is 5000*(R*2)/100 = 100 R.\n\nSo the difference is:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 100 R =72.\n\nExpanding (1 + R/100)^2: 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(10000).\n\nSo (1 + R/100)^2 -1 is 2*(R/100) + R\u00b2/(10000).\n\nMultiply by 5000:\n\n5000 * [ 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000) ] = 5000*(2R/100) + 5000*(R\u00b2/10000).\n\nWhich is 5000 * (2R/100) = 100 * 2 R = 200 R.\n\nAnd 5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. is 200 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (100 R) \u2192 200 R +0.5 R\u00b2 - 100 R = 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSet equal to 72: 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo equation: 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because with options up to 12%, plugging R=12 gives:\n\nR\u00b2=144, 200 R=2400. So equation becomes 144 +2400 -144=2400 \u22600. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me re-express the equation:\n\nC.I. - S.I. =72 \u2192 (200 R +0.5 R\u00b2) - (100 R) =72 \u2192 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nWait, correct. So 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72=0. Multiply by 2: R\u00b2 +200 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, that's correct. Now, solving this quadratic equation. Quadratic formula: R = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ]/(2a), where a=1, b=200, c=-144.\n\nSo discriminant D = 200\u00b2 -4*1*(-144) =40000 +576=40576.\n\nsqrt(40576) is let's see. 200\u00b2 is 40000, so 201\u00b2 is 40401, 202\u00b2=40804. So 40576 is between 201 and 202. Let me compute 201.4\u00b2: 201\u00b2=40401, 201.4\u00b2= (201 +0.4)^2=201\u00b2 + 2*201*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2=40401 +160.8 +0.16=40561.96. Hmm, which is close to 40576. So maybe 201.42 or something. But perhaps it's exact.\n\nWait, 201.42 squared? Maybe I should compute 201.4\u00b2.\n\nWait, 201.4 * 201.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute 200 *200 =40000.\n\n200 *1.4=280, so 200*201.4=200*(200+1.4)=40000+280=40280.\n\n1.4 *200=280, 1.4*1.4=1.96.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: (200 +1.4)^2 = 200\u00b2 + 2*200*1.4 +1.4\u00b2=40000 +560 +1.96=40561.96.\n\nHmm, 40576 is 14 more than 40561.96. So perhaps the square is 201.4 + some decimals. But maybe the exact value is 201.424? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic equation can be factored. Let's see R\u00b2 +200 R -144=0.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -144 and add up to 200. Hmm, perhaps 202 and -0.8? Not likely. Alternatively, perhaps I should try the quadratic formula.\n\nSo R = [ -200 \u00b1 sqrt(40000 + 576) ] / 2 = [ -200 \u00b1 sqrt(40576) ] / 2.\n\nCompute sqrt(40576): Let me see, 201 *201=40401, 202\u00b2=40804. So 40576 is between them. Let me compute 201.4^2=40561.96 as before. 40576-40561.96=14.04. So to get 14.04 more, perhaps 201.4 + (14.04)/(2*201.4) \u2248 201.4 + ~0.035=201.435.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the discriminant again. D=200^2 +4*1*144=40000 +576=40576. Hmm, sqrt(40576) is 201.424 approximately.\n\nSo R= [ -200 + 201.424 ] /2 \u2192 (1.424)/2=0.712. So R\u22487.12%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the closest is 8% (option D). Or maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me go back. The equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0. So a=0.5, b=100, c=-72.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, I think I messed up earlier when I multiplied by 2. Let me re-express it.\n\nWait, the correct equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72=0. Let me write this as 0.5 R\u00b2 +100 R -72 =0. Multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 + 200 R -144 =0. No, that's correct. So a=1, b=200, c=-144.\n\nWait, but solving that gives R\u22487.12%, which isn't one of the options. The options are 10,12,6,8,4.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is S.I. - C.I. =72? No, the question says the difference between C.I. and S.I. is Rs.72. So C.I. is higher than S.I. by 72, which makes sense because C.I. grows faster.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me compute the difference again.\n\nC.I. for 2 years: P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P = P* (2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 )\n\nSo C.I. = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nS.I. is P*R*T/100 = 5000*R*2/100 = 100 R.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000)) -100 R = 5000*(2R/100) +5000*(R\u00b2/10000) -100 R.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5000*(2R/100) = 100 R.\n\n5000*(R\u00b2/10000) = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 -100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait a minute! Oh! I think I see where I went wrong. Because 5000*(2R/100) is 5000*(2R)/100 = (5000/100)*2R =50*2R=100 R. Then subtract 100 R, so the 100 R terms cancel out. So the difference is just 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nWait, so that's a much simpler equation. 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144 \u2192 R = sqrt(144) =12.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\nOh! So I must have made a mistake earlier in the setup. I think I added the 100 R when I shouldn't have. Let me redo the difference.\n\nWait, C.I. is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) = 5000*( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) = 5000*( 2R/100 ) +5000*( R\u00b2/(10000) ) = 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nS.I. is 100 R.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. = (100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100 R = 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2=72 \u2192 R\u00b2=144 \u2192 R=12%.\n\nAh, that's it! So the correct answer is 12%, option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the rate of interest \\( R \\) where the difference between compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) on Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72. \n\n### Key Equations:\n1. **Simple Interest (S.I.):**\n   \\[\n   S.I. = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100} = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compound Interest (C.I.):**\n   \\[\n   C.I. = P \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 1 \\right)\n   \\]\n   Expanding \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 = 1 + 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Subtracting 1:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 1 = 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Multiplying by \\( P = 5000 \\):\n   \\[\n   C.I. = 5000 \\left( 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 \\right) = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Difference Between C.I. and S.I.:**\n   \\[\n   C.I. - S.I. = (100R + 0.5R^2) - 100R = 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n   Given that \\( C.I. - S.I. = 72 \\):\n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 = 72\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( R^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   R^2 = 144\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root:\n   \\[\n   R = \\sqrt{144} = 12\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe rate of interest is \\( 12\\% \\), which corresponds to **Option B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

I remember that the formula for simple interest is pretty straightforward: SI = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, and T is time in years. \n\nCompound interest is a bit different because it's calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods.

So the difference is 5000*(1 + 2R + R\u00b2 - 1) - 10000 R. Simplify that: 5000*(2R + R\u00b2) - 10000 R = 5000 R\u00b2 + 10000 R - 10000 R = 5000 R\u00b2. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo 5000 R\u00b2 = 72. R\u00b2 = 72/5000 = 0.0144. R = sqrt(0.0144) = 0.12, which is 12%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%, so that's the answer.\n\n\nThe difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is given as Rs.72. Using the formulas:\n\n- **Simple Interest (SI):**  \n  \\[\n  SI = P \\cdot R \\cdot T = 5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2 = 10000R\n  \\]\n\n- **Compound Interest (CI):**  \n  \\[\n  CI = P \\cdot \\left((1 + R)^2 - 1\\right) = 5000 \\cdot \\left(1 + 2R + R^2 - 1\\right) = 5000 \\cdot (2R + R^2)\n  \\]\n\nThe difference between CI and SI is:  \n\\[\nCI - SI = 5000 \\cdot (2R + R^2) - 10000R = 5000R^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that this difference is Rs.72:  \n\\[\n5000R^2 = 72 \\implies R^2 = \\frac{72}{5000} = 0.0144\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:  \n\\[\nR = \\sqrt{0.0144} = 0.12 \\implies R = 12\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the rate of interest is **12%**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question says the difference between simple interest (S.I.) and compound interest (C.I.) for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72. We need to find the rate of interest.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated as Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time, right? So the formula is S.I. = P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. And compound interest, especially for 2 years, I think it's P \u00d7 (1 + R)^T minus P. Oh wait, no, that gives the amount. So the C.I. would be Amount - Principal. Alternatively, C.I. = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1].\n\nSo the problem says the difference between C.I. and S.I. is Rs.72. Wait, which is bigger? Oh right, because compound interest earns interest on the interest, so C.I. is more than S.I. So the difference is C.I. minus S.I. equals 72.\n\nLet me write down the formulas. \n\nS.I. = P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T\nC.I. = P \u00d7 ( (1 + R/100)^T ) - P\nSo the difference is C.I. - S.I. = 72.\n\nGiven that P is 5000, T is 2 years. So substituting:\n\n5000 \u00d7 [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2 = 72.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can expand the (1 + R/100)^2 term. Let's see, (1 + x)^2 is 1 + 2x + x\u00b2, where x is R/100.\n\nSo, substituting that in:\n\n5000 \u00d7 [ (1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2) - 1 ] - 5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2 =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 1 cancels out, so we have 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo it becomes:\n\n5000 \u00d7 [ 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ] - 5000 \u00d7 2R =72.\n\nLet me factor that out. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5000 \u00d7 2(R/100) = 5000 * 2R /100 = 5000 * (R/50) = 100 R.\n\nSecond term: 5000 \u00d7 (R/100)^2 = 5000 * R\u00b2 / (10000) = (5000 R\u00b2) / 10000 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThird term: 5000 \u00d7 2R = 10000 R.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n[100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2] - 10000 R =72.\n\nWait, wait, because the first part is 5000 \u00d7 [...] which is 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2, and then subtract the S.I. which is 10000 R. So the equation is:\n\n100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 - 10000 R =72.\n\nCombine like terms: 100 R -10000 R is -9900 R. So,\n\n-9900 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the initial equation after substitution was:\n\n5000 \u00d7 [2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ] - (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2) =72.\n\nSo the first part is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/10000) which is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThen, subtract 5000\u00d72R=10000 R.\n\nSo 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 -10000 R =72.\n\nSo 100R -10000 R is indeed -9900 R. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72=0.\n\nBut wait, this quadratic seems a bit unwieldy because of the large coefficients. Maybe I should multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nMultiplying all terms by 2 gives:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, 0.5 R\u00b2 \u00d72 = R\u00b2, 9900 R \u00d72=19800 R, 72\u00d72=144. So the equation is R\u00b2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nThat's a big equation. Maybe I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic is R\u00b2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nSo a=1, b=-19800, c=-144.\n\nThe quadratic formula is R = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nR = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 -4*1*(-144) ) ] / 2.\n\nCompute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (19800)^2 + 4 *1*144.\n\nHmm, 19800 squared is a big number. Let me compute that.\n\n19800^2 = (20000 - 200)^2 = 20000\u00b2 - 2*20000*200 + 200\u00b2 = 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 + 40,000 = 392,040,000.\n\nWait, 20000^2 is 400,000,000. 2*20000*200 is 8,000,000. 200^2 is 40,000. So yes, 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 = 392,000,000, plus 40,000 is 392,040,000.\n\nSo D = 392,040,000 + 4*144 = 392,040,000 + 576 = 392,040,576.\n\nNow sqrt(392,040,576). Hmm, what's the square of 19800? Well, 19800^2 is 392,040,000 as we saw earlier. So sqrt(392,040,576) is a bit more than 19800.\n\nLet me compute 19800^2 = 392,040,000.\n\nSo 392,040,576 is 576 more. So sqrt(392,040,576) = 19800 + 576/(2*19800) approximately. Wait, but maybe it's a perfect square.\n\nWait, 19800^2 = 392,040,000. So 392,040,576 = 392,040,000 + 576.\n\nWhat's 19800 + x squared?\n\n(19800 + x)^2 = 19800^2 + 2*19800 x + x\u00b2.\n\nWe have 19800^2 + 2*19800 x + x\u00b2 = 392,040,000 + 576.\n\nSo 2*19800 x + x\u00b2 = 576.\n\nAssuming x is small, let's approximate x \u2248 576/(2*19800) = 576/(39600) = 576 \u00f7 39600.\n\nLet me compute that: 576 / 39600 = 576 / (396 * 100) = 576/(396) * 0.01.\n\n396 is 44 *9, 576 is 64 *9. So 576/396 = (64*9)/(44*9) )=64/44 =16/11\u22481.4545.\n\nSo 16/11 * 0.01 \u2248 0.014545.\n\nSo x\u22480.014545.\n\nSo sqrt(392,040,576) \u2248 19800 +0.014545 \u224819800.014545.\n\nSo R = [19800 \u00b119800.014545 ] / 2.\n\nWait, but we have R = [19800 \u00b1 (19800.014545)] / 2.\n\nWait, since the square root is positive, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. [19800 + 19800.014545 ] /2 \u2192 that would be a very large positive R, which doesn't make sense because interest rates aren't that high.\n\n2. [19800 -19800.014545 ] /2 \u2192 which is [ -0.014545 ] /2 = -0.0072725.\n\nNegative rate? That can't be right either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign when moving terms around. Let me re-examine the equation.\n\nThe original difference is C.I. - S.I. =72. So:\n\nC.I. = S.I. +72.\n\nBut when I set up the equation, I had C.I. - S.I. =72, so the equation should be correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me double-check the earlier steps.\n\nSo:\n\nC.I. = 5000*( (1+R/100)^2 -1 )\n\nS.I. = 5000 * R * 2.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. =72.\n\nSo:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 5000*2R =72.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 -1 = 2R/100 + (R/100)^2.\n\nMultiply by 5000:\n\n5000*(2R/100) = 5000 * 0.02 R =100 R.\n\n5000*(R/100)^2 =5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000)* R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. =100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (5000*2R=10000 R):\n\nSo 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 -10000 R =72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, wait a second. I think I missed a term in the equation. Because the equation is C.I. - S.I. =72, so:\n\n(100 R +0.5 R\u00b2) - (10000 R) =72.\n\nSo, 100 R -10000 R = -9900 R.\n\nSo equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but when I plug into quadratic formula, it's giving a negative R, which doesn't make sense. That suggests I might have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, maybe I should rearrange the equation as 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nWait, but when I plug into the quadratic formula, I get R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4*0.5*72 ) ] / (2*0.5).\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have multiplied by 2 earlier. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recast the equation correctly.\n\nWait, the equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R -144 =0.\n\nSo, a=1, b= -19800, c=-144.\n\nSo, applying the quadratic formula:\n\nR = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4*1*144 ) ] / (2*1).\n\nWhich is R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt(392,040,000 + 576)] / 2.\n\nWhich is R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt(392,040,576)] / 2.\n\nWe found that sqrt(392,040,576) is approximately 19800.014545.\n\nSo R = [19800 \u00b119800.014545 ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, adding:\n\n(19800 + 19800.014545) / 2 = (39600.014545)/2 = 19800.0072725.\n\nThat's a very high rate, which is impossible.\n\nSecond, subtracting:\n\n(19800 -19800.014545)/2 = (-0.014545)/2 = -0.0072725.\n\nNegative rate, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Maybe the difference is S.I. - C.I. instead of C.I. - S.I.?\n\nWait, the problem says the difference is Rs.72. But in reality, C.I. is greater than S.I. because of the interest on interest. So the difference should be C.I. minus S.I. equals 72. So my initial setup was correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a calculation error in expanding the terms. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me compute the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years.\n\nThe formula for the difference is:\n\nDifference = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 - 2*(R/100) )\n\nBecause C.I. for two years is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ), and S.I. is P*R*T = P*2*(R/100). So the difference is:\n\nP*( (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) -1 - 2*(R/100) )\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 -2(R/100) = (R/100)^2.\n\nSo the difference is P*( (R/100)^2 ).\n\nSo, difference = P*(R^2)/(100^2).\n\nGiven that P=5000, difference=72.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 * (R^2)/(10000) ) =72.\n\nSimplify:\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 /10000 =72 \u2192 (5000/10000)*R\u00b2=72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2=72.\n\nSo R\u00b2=72 * 2=144 \u2192 R= sqrt(144)=12.\n\nSo the rate is 12%. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 12%.\n\nOh wait! That's a much simpler approach. I think I overcomplicated it earlier by expanding the entire expression.\n\nSo the correct rate is 12%, option B.\n",

Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 5000 \u00d7 2(R/100) = 5000 * 2R /100 = 5000 * (R/50) = 100 R.\n\nSecond term: 5000 \u00d7 (R/100)^2 = 5000 * R\u00b2 / (10000) = (5000 R\u00b2) / 10000 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThird term: 5000 \u00d7 2R = 10000 R.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n[100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2] - 10000 R =72.\n\nWait, wait, because the first part is 5000 \u00d7 [...] which is 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2, and then subtract the S.I. which is 10000 R. So the equation is:\n\n100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 - 10000 R =72.\n\nCombine like terms: 100 R -10000 R is -9900 R. So,\n\n-9900 R + 0.5 R\u00b2 =72.\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the initial equation after substitution was:\n\n5000 \u00d7 [2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ] - (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d7 2) =72.\n\nSo the first part is 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/10000) which is 100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nThen, subtract 5000\u00d72R=10000 R.\n\nSo 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 -10000 R =72.\n\nSo 100R -10000 R is indeed -9900 R. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72=0.\n\nBut wait, this quadratic seems a bit unwieldy because of the large coefficients. Maybe I should multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the decimal.\n\nMultiplying all terms by 2 gives:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R -144 =0.\n\nWait, 0.5 R\u00b2 \u00d72 = R\u00b2, 9900 R \u00d72=19800 R, 72\u00d72=144. So the equation is R\u00b2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nThat's a big equation. Maybe I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic is R\u00b2 -19800 R -144 =0.\n\nSo a=1, b=-19800, c=-144.\n\nThe quadratic formula is R = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nR = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 -4*1*(-144) ) ] / 2.\n\nCompute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (19800)^2 + 4 *1*144.\n\nHmm, 19800 squared is a big number. Let me compute that.\n\n19800^2 = (20000 - 200)^2 = 20000\u00b2 - 2*20000*200 + 200\u00b2 = 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 + 40,000 = 392,040,000.\n\nWait, 20000^2 is 400,000,000. 2*20000*200 is 8,000,000. 200^2 is 40,000. So yes, 400,000,000 - 8,000,000 = 392,000,000, plus 40,000 is 392,040,000.\n\nSo D = 392,040,000 + 4*144 = 392,040,000 + 576 = 392,040,576.\n\nNow sqrt(392,040,576). Hmm, what's the square of 19800? Well, 19800^2 is 392,040,000 as we saw earlier. So sqrt(392,040,576) is a bit more than 19800.\n\nLet me compute 19800^2 = 392,040,000.\n\nSo 392,040,576 is 576 more. So sqrt(392,040,576) = 19800 + 576/(2*19800) approximately. Wait, but maybe it's a perfect square.\n\nWait, 19800^2 = 392,040,000. So 392,040,576 = 392,040,000 + 576.\n\nWhat's 19800 + x squared?\n\n(19800 + x)^2 = 19800^2 + 2*19800 x + x\u00b2.\n\nWe have 19800^2 + 2*19800 x + x\u00b2 = 392,040,000 + 576.\n\nSo 2*19800 x + x\u00b2 = 576.\n\nAssuming x is small, let's approximate x \u2248 576/(2*19800) = 576/(39600) = 576 \u00f7 39600.\n\nLet me compute that: 576 / 39600 = 576 / (396 * 100) = 576/(396) * 0.01.\n\n396 is 44 *9, 576 is 64 *9. So 576/396 = (64*9)/(44*9) )=64/44 =16/11\u22481.4545.\n\nSo 16/11 * 0.01 \u2248 0.014545.\n\nSo x\u22480.014545.\n\nSo sqrt(392,040,576) \u2248 19800 +0.014545 \u224819800.014545.\n\nSo R = [19800 \u00b119800.014545 ] / 2.\n\nWait, but we have R = [19800 \u00b1 (19800.014545)] / 2.\n\nWait, since the square root is positive, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. [19800 + 19800.014545 ] /2 \u2192 that would be a very large positive R, which doesn't make sense because interest rates aren't that high.\n\n2. [19800 -19800.014545 ] /2 \u2192 which is [ -0.014545 ] /2 = -0.0072725.\n\nNegative rate? That can't be right either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the sign when moving terms around. Let me re-examine the equation.\n\nThe original difference is C.I. - S.I. =72. So:\n\nC.I. = S.I. +72.\n\nBut when I set up the equation, I had C.I. - S.I. =72, so the equation should be correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me double-check the earlier steps.\n\nSo:\n\nC.I. = 5000*( (1+R/100)^2 -1 )\n\nS.I. = 5000 * R * 2.\n\nSo C.I. - S.I. =72.\n\nSo:\n\n5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) - 5000*2R =72.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2.\n\nSo inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 -1 = 2R/100 + (R/100)^2.\n\nMultiply by 5000:\n\n5000*(2R/100) = 5000 * 0.02 R =100 R.\n\n5000*(R/100)^2 =5000*(R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000)* R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSo C.I. =100 R + 0.5 R\u00b2.\n\nSubtract S.I. (5000*2R=10000 R):\n\nSo 100 R +0.5 R\u00b2 -10000 R =72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, wait a second. I think I missed a term in the equation. Because the equation is C.I. - S.I. =72, so:\n\n(100 R +0.5 R\u00b2) - (10000 R) =72.\n\nSo, 100 R -10000 R = -9900 R.\n\nSo equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R =72.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but when I plug into quadratic formula, it's giving a negative R, which doesn't make sense. That suggests I might have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, maybe I should rearrange the equation as 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nWait, but when I plug into the quadratic formula, I get R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4*0.5*72 ) ] / (2*0.5).\n\nWait, perhaps I should not have multiplied by 2 earlier. Let me re-express the equation.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recast the equation correctly.\n\nWait, the equation is 0.5 R\u00b2 -9900 R -72 =0.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nR\u00b2 - 19800 R -144 =0.\n\nSo, a=1, b= -19800, c=-144.\n\nSo, applying the quadratic formula:\n\nR = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt( (19800)^2 + 4*1*144 ) ] / (2*1).\n\nWhich is R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt(392,040,000 + 576)] / 2.\n\nWhich is R = [19800 \u00b1 sqrt(392,040,576)] / 2.\n\nWe found that sqrt(392,040,576) is approximately 19800.014545.\n\nSo R = [19800 \u00b119800.014545 ] / 2.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, adding:\n\n(19800 + 19800.014545) / 2 = (39600.014545)/2 = 19800.0072725.\n\nThat's a very high rate, which is impossible.\n\nSecond, subtracting:\n\n(19800 -19800.014545)/2 = (-0.014545)/2 = -0.0072725.\n\nNegative rate, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Maybe the difference is S.I. - C.I. instead of C.I. - S.I.?\n\nWait, the problem says the difference is Rs.72. But in reality, C.I. is greater than S.I. because of the interest on interest. So the difference should be C.I. minus S.I. equals 72. So my initial setup was correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a calculation error in expanding the terms. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me compute the difference between C.I. and S.I. for two years.\n\nThe formula for the difference is:\n\nDifference = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 - 2*(R/100) )\n\nBecause C.I. for two years is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ), and S.I. is P*R*T = P*2*(R/100). So the difference is:\n\nP*( (1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) -1 - 2*(R/100) )\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 2(R/100) + (R/100)^2 -1 -2(R/100) = (R/100)^2.\n\nSo the difference is P*( (R/100)^2 ).\n\nSo, difference = P*(R^2)/(100^2).\n\nGiven that P=5000, difference=72.\n\nSo:\n\n5000 * (R^2)/(10000) ) =72.\n\nSimplify:\n\n5000 * R\u00b2 /10000 =72 \u2192 (5000/10000)*R\u00b2=72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2=72.\n\nSo R\u00b2=72 * 2=144 \u2192 R= sqrt(144)=12.\n\nSo the rate is 12%. Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 12%.\n\nOh wait! That's a much simpler approach. I think I overcomplicated it earlier by expanding the entire expression.\n\nSo the correct rate is 12%, option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the rate of interest \\( R \\) when the difference between compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72. \n\n### Key Formulas:\n1. **Simple Interest (S.I.)**:  \n   \\[\n   S.I. = P \\times R \\times T\n   \\]\n   For \\( P = 5000 \\), \\( T = 2 \\), and rate \\( R \\),  \n   \\[\n   S.I. = 5000 \\times R \\times 2 = 10000R\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compound Interest (C.I.)**:  \n   \\[\n   C.I. = P \\times \\left[(1 + \\frac{R}{100})^T - 1\\right]\n   \\]\n   For \\( P = 5000 \\), \\( T = 2 \\), and rate \\( R \\),  \n   \\[\n   C.I. = 5000 \\times \\left[(1 + \\frac{R}{100})^2 - 1\\right]\n   \\]\n   Expanding \\((1 + \\frac{R}{100})^2\\):  \n   \\[\n   (1 + \\frac{R}{100})^2 = 1 + 2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting back:  \n   \\[\n   C.I. = 5000 \\times \\left[2\\frac{R}{100} + \\left(\\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\\right]\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   C.I. = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Difference Between C.I. and S.I.**:  \n   The difference is given as Rs. 72, so:  \n   \\[\n   C.I. - S.I. = 72\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions for \\( C.I. \\) and \\( S.I. \\):  \n   \\[\n   (100R + 0.5R^2) - (10000R) = 72\n   \\]\n   Simplify:  \n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 - 9900R = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation**:  \n   Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the decimal:  \n   \\[\n   R^2 - 19800R - 144 = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic equation of the form \\( aR^2 + bR + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -19800 \\), and \\( c = -144 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest. The question says the difference between the two for Rs.5000 over 2 years is Rs.72, and we need to find the rate of interest.\n\nWait, let me think. The formula for simple interest is SI = (P * R * T)/100. And compound interest for two years would be CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. The difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: CI - SI = 72. Plugging in the formulas, that would be [P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P] - (P*R*T)/100 = 72. Let me substitute P as 5000 and T as 2.\n\nWait, let's compute each part. CI for two years is P*(1 + R/100)^2. So that's 5000*(1 + R/100)^2. Subtracting the principal gives the interest part. So CI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ).\n\nThe simple interest SI is (5000 * R * 2)/100, which simplifies to 100 R.\n\nSo the difference CI - SI is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - 100 R = 72.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So, substituting back:\n\n5000*( [1 + (2R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)] - 1 ) - 100 R =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 1 cancels, so it becomes 2R/100 + R^2/(10000). Multiply by 5000:\n\n5000 * (2R/100) = 5000 * 0.02 R = 100 R.\n5000 * (R^2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R^2 = 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo CI part becomes 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nSubtracting SI (100 R) gives: 100 R + 0.5 R^2 - 100 R = 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo 0.5 R^2 = 72.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R^2 = 144. Taking square root, R = 12 or -12. Since rate can't be negative, R is 12%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option B is 12%, which is what I got. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the difference between CI and SI for two years is approximated as (P*(R/100)^2). Because for two years, the CI has an extra term of (R^2)/(10000) * P. So the difference is P*(R^2)/(10000). So in this case, 5000 * (R^2)/10000 = 72. Simplifying, 5000 R^2 = 72 *10000. R^2 = (72 * 10000)/5000 = (72*2) =144. So R=12% again. So same answer.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n",

Let me substitute P as 5000 and T as 2.\n\nWait, let's compute each part. CI for two years is P*(1 + R/100)^2. So that's 5000*(1 + R/100)^2. Subtracting the principal gives the interest part. So CI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ).\n\nThe simple interest SI is (5000 * R * 2)/100, which simplifies to 100 R.\n\nSo the difference CI - SI is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - 100 R = 72.\n\nLet me expand (1 + R/100)^2. That's 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So, substituting back:\n\n5000*( [1 + (2R/100) + (R^2)/(10000)] - 1 ) - 100 R =72.\n\nSimplify inside the brackets: 1 cancels, so it becomes 2R/100 + R^2/(10000). Multiply by 5000:\n\n5000 * (2R/100) = 5000 * 0.02 R = 100 R.\n5000 * (R^2/10000) = (5000/10000) * R^2 = 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo CI part becomes 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nSubtracting SI (100 R) gives: 100 R + 0.5 R^2 - 100 R = 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo 0.5 R^2 = 72.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: R^2 = 144. Taking square root, R = 12 or -12. Since rate can't be negative, R is 12%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. Option B is 12%, which is what I got. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the difference between CI and SI for two years is approximated as (P*(R/100)^2). Because for two years, the CI has an extra term of (R^2)/(10000) * P. So the difference is P*(R^2)/(10000). So in this case, 5000 * (R^2)/10000 = 72. Simplifying, 5000 R^2 = 72 *10000. R^2 = (72 * 10000)/5000 = (72*2) =144. So R=12% again. So same answer.\n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years at the same rate of interest, given that the difference is Rs. 72.\n\n1. **Formulas**:\n   - Simple Interest (SI):  \n     \\[\n     SI = \\frac{P \\cdot R \\cdot T}{100}\n     \\]\n   - Compound Interest (CI):  \n     \\[\n     CI = P \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^T - P\n     \\]\n   - Difference:  \n     \\[\n     CI - SI = 72\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute Values**:\n   - Principal (\\(P\\)) = 5000, Time (\\(T\\)) = 2, and \\(CI - SI = 72\\).\n\n3. **Expand CI**:\n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 - 5000\n   \\]\n   Expanding \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{100}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{2R}{100} + \\frac{R^2}{10000}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{2R}{100} + \\frac{R^2}{10000}\\right) - 5000\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   CI = 5000 \\cdot \\frac{2R}{100} + 5000 \\cdot \\frac{R^2}{10000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   CI = 100R + 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **SI Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   SI = \\frac{5000 \\cdot R \\cdot 2}{100} = 100R\n   \\]\n\n5. **Difference**:\n   \\[\n   CI - SI = (100R + 0.5R^2) - 100R = 0.5R^2\n   \\]\n   Given \\(CI - SI = 72\\):\n   \\[\n   0.5R^2 = 72\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\(R\\)**:\n   \\[\n   R^2 = 144 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R = \\sqrt{144} = 12\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the rate of interest is **12%**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest and compound interest. Hmm, the question is asking for the rate of interest when the difference between SI and CI on Rs.5000 for 2 years is Rs.72. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, whereas compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any accumulated interest from previous periods. So for two years, the CI would be calculated for the first year and then for the second year on the new amount.\n\nThe formula for simple interest is SI = (P * R * T)/100. For compound interest, since it's compounded annually for two years, the formula is CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T - P. Oh right, and the difference between CI and SI is given as Rs.72.\n\nSo, the principal P is 5000, time T is 2 years. The rate is R, which we need to find. The difference between CI and SI is 72. So, the equation would be CI - SI = 72.\n\nLet me write down the formulas:\n\nSI = (5000 * R * 2)/100 = (100R * 2) = 100 * R * 2 / 100? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me recalculate. 5000 * R is the first part, then multiplied by 2 (time), then divided by 100. So SI = (5000 * R * 2)/100 = (10000 R)/100 = 100 R. Oh, right, because 5000 * 2 is 10,000, multiplied by R gives 10,000 R, divided by 100 is 100 R. So SI is 100 R.\n\nFor CI, it's P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. So CI = 5000*(1 + R/100)^2 - 5000. Expanding that, 5000*(1 + 2R/100 + (R^2)/(10000)) ) - 5000. So that becomes 5000 + (5000 * 2R)/100 + (5000 R^2)/(10000) - 5000. Simplify: The 5000 cancels out, leaving (100 R) + (0.5 R^2).\n\nSo CI is 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nThe difference between CI and SI is CI - SI = (100 R + 0.5 R^2) - 100 R = 0.5 R^2. And this difference is given as 72.\n\nSo 0.5 R^2 = 72. Multiply both sides by 2: R^2 = 144. Taking square roots, R = 12 or R = -12. But since rate can't be negative, R is 12%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I might have messed up the CI calculation.\n\nWait, let's compute CI step by step. For the first year, the interest is 5000 * R/100 = 50 R. So amount after first year is 5000 + 50 R. Then, for the second year, it's (5000 +50 R) * R/100. So the interest for second year is (5000 R + 50 R^2)/100. So total interest is 50 R + (5000 R + 50 R^2)/100.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, CI for two years is P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. So 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ). Let me compute that.\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtracting 1, it's 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Multiply by 5000: 5000 * [ (2R/100) + (R^2)/(10000) ) ].\n\nCalculating that: 5000 * 2R/100 = 5000 * R * 2 /100 = 100 R. And 5000 * R^2/(10000) is (5000/10000) * R^2 = 0.5 R^2. So CI is 100 R + 0.5 R^2.\n\nSo difference is CI - SI = (100 R + 0.5 R^2) - 100 R = 0.5 R^2. So 0.5 R^2 =72 \u2192 R^2=144 \u2192 R=12%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12%. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me plug R=12 into the equations and see if the difference is indeed 72.\n\nCompute SI: (5000 * 12 * 2)/100 = (120000)/100= 1200.\n\nCompute CI: 5000*(1.12)^2 -5000. 1.12 squared is 1.2544. 5000 * 1.2544 = 6272. So CI is 6272 -5000=1272.\n\nDifference is 1272 - 1200=72. Yes, that matches. So R is 12%.\n",
