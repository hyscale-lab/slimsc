      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a wire that's bent into a rectangle and then rebent into a square. I need to find the length of each side of the square. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you bend a wire into a shape, the perimeter of that shape must be the same because the wire's length doesn't change. Oh right, the perimeter is the total length around the shape. So the wire's original shape is a rectangle, and after bending it, it becomes a square. The perimeters must be equal.\n\nThe rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth (width) of 17 cm. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, I think the formula is 2*(length + width). Let me calculate that. So plugging in the numbers: 2*(27 + 17). Let's see, 27 plus 17 is 44. Multiply by 2, that's 88 cm. So the perimeter is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when this wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. Since a square has four sides of equal length, each side should be the perimeter divided by 4. So 88 divided by 4. Let me do that division: 88 \u00f7 4 equals 22. So each side of the square is 22 cm.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The rectangle's perimeter calculation: 2*(27+17)=2*44=88 cm. Yes. Square's side is 88/4=22. Yep, that's right. So no mistake there.\n",

Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the correct answer should be C. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward: calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, use that as the perimeter for the square, then find the side length.\n\n\nThe wire is initially bent into a rectangle with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. Since the wire's length remains constant when reshaped, the perimeter of the rectangle equals the perimeter of the square formed after rebending.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of rectangle} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (27 + 17) = 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nFor the square, the perimeter is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of square} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\nLet the side length of the square be \\( s \\). Since the perimeter of the square is 88 cm:\n\n\\[\n4s = 88 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{88}{4} = 22 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) 22**\n\nAnswer: C",

Hmm, let me think. \n\nWait, the wire is in the shape of a rectangle. So the perimeter of the rectangle would be the same as the perimeter of the square because it's the same wire, just reshaped. Oh right, because the total length of the wire doesn't change when you bend it.\n\nSo first, I should calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth), right? The length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. Let me plug those numbers in.\n\nSo, 2*(27 + 17) = 2*(44) = 88 cm.

So to find the side length, I can take the perimeter and divide by 4. Let me calculate that. 88 divided by 4 is 22.
