      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and percentages. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a test where the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find out what percent of the class passed.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I remember that averages can be tricky because they depend on the number of students in each group. So, passing and failing students have different averages, and when combined, the overall average is 76. I think I'll need to set up some equations to solve this.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. The total number of students is then P + F. \n\nThe total marks for the passing students would be 83 multiplied by P, right? So that's 83P. Similarly, the total marks for failing students would be 55 multiplied by F, which is 55F.\n\nThe overall average is the total marks divided by the total number of students. So the equation would be:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76\n\nHmm, okay. Now I can rearrange this equation to find a relationship between P and F. Let's multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side gives:\n\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\nNow, let's subtract 76P and 55F from both sides to get the variables on one side:\n\n83P - 76P = 76F - 55F\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n7P = 21F\n\nWait, 83-76 is 7, and 76-55 is 21. So, 7P equals 21F. I can divide both sides by 7 to make it simpler:\n\nP = 3F\n\nOh, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. That means for every failing student, there are three passing ones. \n\nSo the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1. To find the percentage of the class that passed, I can think about the total number of students as P + F = 3F + F = 4F. So, out of 4F students, 3F passed. \n\nSo the percentage is (3F / 4F) * 100. The F cancels out, so it's (3/4)*100 = 75%. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 75%. But wait, that doesn't match the initial thought. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the ratio. Let me go back. \n\nWe had 7P = 21F. Dividing both sides by 7 gives P = 3F. So P is 3 times F. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That means, for every 4 students, 3 passed and 1 failed.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (3 / (3+1)) * 100 = 75%. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If the overall average is 76, which is closer to 55 than to 83, that suggests that there are more failing students, right? Because if more students failed, the average would be pulled down. So if the overall average is 76, which is closer to 55 (difference of 21) than to 83 (difference of 7), wait, no, 76 is 76-55=21 above 55 and 83-76=7 below 83. So the average is closer to 83, meaning more students passed, which would make sense if P is larger than F.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, P is 3F. So if F is 1, P is 3. So 3 passed and 1 failed, which makes 75% passed. So why does the average being closer to 83 make sense? Because 3 passed at 83 and 1 failed at 55. Let's compute the overall average.\n\nSo (3*83 + 1*55) /4 = (249 +55)/4 = 304/4=76. Oh right, that's correct. So 75% passed. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 75% and D is 72%. So I think I got it right. But wait, another way to approach this is using alligation.\n\nAlligation method is sometimes used for mixture problems. The idea is to find the ratio of the two groups based on their averages and the overall average.\n\nThe passing average is 83, failing is 55, overall is 76.\n\nSo, the distances are: from 55 to 76 is 21, and from 76 to 83 is 7. So the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. Wait, because the ratio is inversely proportional to the distances.\n\nWait, in alligation, the ratio of the quantities is inverse to the distances from the mean. So the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21, which is 1:3. So the number of failing students is 1 part, passing is 3 parts. So total parts are 4, so 3/4 passed, which is 75%. So that confirms it.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be E)75%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about averages and percentages. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. So, the question is: In a test, the students who passed had an average of 83, and those who failed had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find out what percentage of the class passed.\n\nWait, right, averages and weighted percentages. I think this involves some kind of weighted average calculation. Because the overall average depends on how many students passed and how many failed.\n\nLet me think. Suppose there are two groups: passers and failers. Let's say the number of passers is P, and the number of failers is F. The total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passers would be 83 * P, and for failers, it's 55 * F. The overall total marks would be the sum of these two. The overall average is the total marks divided by the total number of students. So, 76 = (83P + 55F) / (P + F).\n\nI can set up that equation. Let me write it down:\n\n76 = (83P + 55F) / (P + F)\n\nHmm, I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator.\n\n76(P + F) = 83P + 55F\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n76P + 76F = 83P + 55F\n\nNow, let me bring all terms to one side. Subtract 76P and 76F from both sides:\n\n0 = 83P + 55F -76P -76F\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n83P -76P =7P\n\n55F -76F= -21F\n\nSo, 0=7P -21F\n\nWhich can be rewritten as 7P =21F\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nP=3F\n\nSo, the number of passers is three times the number of failers. That means, for every one failing student, there are three passing students.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the percentage of the class that passed. So, the percentage is (P / (P + F)) * 100%.\n\nSince P=3F, let's substitute that into the equation.\n\nP/(P + F) = 3F/(3F + F) = 3F/(4F) = 3/4.\n\n3/4 is 0.75, so 75%. Wait, but that's not one of the options I'm seeing. Wait, looking at the options: E is 75%. But wait, I thought the options were A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nWait, but wait, that would make E correct. Hmm, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting that P=3F. So, for example, if F is 1, P is 3. So total students are 4. So, 3/4 passed, which is 75%. So E is 75%, which is the answer? But looking at the options, E is 75%. So why is the correct answer not E? Wait, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine my setup. Because maybe I set up the equation correctly, but perhaps I'm misapplying the concepts.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. The overall average is 76. The passers average 83, failers 55. So the equation is correct: 76(P + F) = 83P +55F.\n\nExpanding: 76P +76F =83P +55F.\n\nMoving all terms to left: 76P +76F -83P -55F =0.\n\n76P -83P = -7P.\n\n76F -55F=21F.\n\nSo, -7P +21F=0 \u2192 7P=21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nSo, the ratio of passers to failers is 3:1.\n\nSo, the fraction that passed is 3/(3+1) = 3/4 =75%.\n\nBut in the options, E is 75%, so that's the answer. But wait, the options given are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)66%\n\nC)68%\n\nD)72%\n\nE)75%\n\nSo, the correct answer should be E)75%. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember a similar problem where the answer was 72%, but perhaps that's a different problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage, but I used the ratio correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of weighted averages. Let me think about it another way. The difference between the passing average and the overall average, and the failing average and the overall average.\n\nThe idea is that the overall average is closer to the average of the group with more students. So, the difference between 83 and 76 is 7. The difference between 76 and 55 is 21.\n\nSo, the ratio of failers to passers is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So, that's the same as P=3F.\n\nSo, same conclusion: 75% passed. So, the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says the passing students had an average of 83, failing 55. The class average is 76. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging in some numbers to see.\n\nLet's say F=100 students failed. Then P=300 students passed.\n\nTotal marks: 300*83=24,900. 100*55=5,500. Total=24,900 +5,500=30,400.\n\nTotal students=400. Average=30,400 /400=76. Correct.\n\nSo, 300/400=75%. So, E is correct. So why is this not matching the options? Wait, no, the options do include E)75%. So, the answer must be E.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)75%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the answer was D)72%, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the class that passed, which is 75%, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider another approach. Let me think about the concept of alligation.\n\nThe alligation method is used to find the ratio of two groups when their individual averages and the overall average are known.\n\nSo, the difference between the passing average and the overall average is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between the overall average and the failing average is 76-55=21.\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of failing students to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3.\n\nSo, same as before. So the ratio is 1:3, meaning for every 4 students, 3 passed, so 75%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is E)75%.\n",

The difference between the passing average and the overall average, and the failing average and the overall average.\n\nThe idea is that the overall average is closer to the average of the group with more students. So, the difference between 83 and 76 is 7. The difference between 76 and 55 is 21.\n\nSo, the ratio of failers to passers is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So, that's the same as P=3F.\n\nSo, same conclusion: 75% passed. So, the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says the passing students had an average of 83, failing 55. The class average is 76. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try plugging in some numbers to see.\n\nLet's say F=100 students failed. Then P=300 students passed.\n\nTotal marks: 300*83=24,900. 100*55=5,500. Total=24,900 +5,500=30,400.\n\nTotal students=400. Average=30,400 /400=76. Correct.\n\nSo, 300/400=75%. So, E is correct. So why is this not matching the options? Wait, no, the options do include E)75%. So, the answer must be E.\n\nBut wait, wait, the options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)75%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the answer was D)72%, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the class that passed, which is 75%, so E is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider another approach. Let me think about the concept of alligation.\n\nThe alligation method is used to find the ratio of two groups when their individual averages and the overall average are known.\n\nSo, the difference between the passing average and the overall average is 83-76=7.\n\nThe difference between the overall average and the failing average is 76-55=21.\n\nSo, the ratio of the number of failing students to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3.\n\nSo, same as before. So the ratio is 1:3, meaning for every 4 students, 3 passed, so 75%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is E)75%.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the percentage of students who passed based on the given averages. Let the number of passing students be \\( P \\) and the number of failing students be \\( F \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F \\).\n\nThe total marks for passing students is \\( 83P \\), and for failing students, it is \\( 55F \\). The overall class average is given as 76, so we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n76 = \\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\( P + F \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n76(P + F) = 83P + 55F\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n76P + 76F = 83P + 55F\n\\]\n\n\\[\n76P - 83P + 76F - 55F = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-7P + 21F = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 3F\n\\]\n\nThis means the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). The fraction of students who passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} = \\frac{3F}{4F} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 100\\% = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, 75% of the class passed. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

The overall class average is 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. The options are from 44% to 75%. \n\nWait, I remember that averages can be weighted based on the number of students in each group. So the overall average is somewhere between 55 and 83. Since the overall is 76, which is closer to 83 than 55, maybe more students passed? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's say the number of passing students is P, and the number of failing students is F. The total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for passing students would be 83 * P, and for failing students, 55 * F. The overall total points would be 83P + 55F.\n\nThe overall average is given by (83P + 55F) divided by (P + F), and that equals 76.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76\n\nMultiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\nNow, subtract 76P from both sides:\n\n(83P -76P) +55F =76F\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n7P +55F =76F\n\nSubtract 55F from both sides:\n\n7P = 21F\n\nWait, because 76F minus 55F is 21F. So 7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nP =3F\n\nOh, so P is three times F. That means for every F, there are three Ps.\n\nSo the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That is, P is 3 parts and F is 1 part. So total parts are 4.\n\nSo the percentage of passing students is (3 /4)*100 =75%.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 75% as the first choice.

So for every F, there are three Ps. So P is 3 times F.\n\nSo the number of passing students is three times the failing. So the total students is P +F =3F +F=4F.\n\nSo the percentage of passing is (3F /4F)*100 =75%. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option E is 75%.

So, (83P + 55F) divided by (P + F) equals 76.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76\n\nI can multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator:\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\nNow, I can subtract 76P from both sides:\n83P -76P +55F = 76F\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n7P +55F =76F\n\nWait, wait. Let me do that again. Subtract 76P and 55F from both sides. Alternatively, subtract 76P from both sides and subtract 55F from both sides, but perhaps it's easier to collect like terms.\n\nWait, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F\n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides:\n83P -76P =76F -55F\n\nThat simplifies to:\n7P =21F\n\nOh, that's better. So 7P =21F.\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\nP =3F\n\nSo P is three times F. Which means the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students.\n\nWait, so if F is the number of failing students, then P is 3F. So the total number of students is P + F =3F + F=4F.\n\nSo the percentage of students who passed is (P)/(P + F) *100%.\n\nSince P is 3F and total is 4F, so (3F)/(4F) = 3/4 =0.75. So 75%.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options. The options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo the correct answer would be E)75%?\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check my equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nThe equation was 83P +55F =76(P + F). Expanding, 83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtract 76P: 7P +55F =76F.\n\nSubtract 55F:7P =21F. So P =3F. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the ratio of passed to failed is 3:1. So passed is 75% of the class.\n\nSo the answer is E)75%.\n",

The question says that the passing students had an average of 83, and the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76.

I think I remember that averages can be thought of in terms of weighted averages, like how much each group contributes to the total.\n\nWait, right, the class average is the total points divided by the number of students. But I don't know the number of students. Maybe I can use variables for that. Let me assign some variables.\n\nLet's say the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for the passing students would be 83 multiplied by P, so 83P. Similarly, the failing students contribute 55 multiplied by F, which is 55F. So the overall total points is 83P + 55F.\n\nThe overall class average is 76, so that's (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76.\n\nHmm, I can set up that equation. Let's write it out:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI need to solve for the percentage of students who passed, which would be (P / (P + F)) * 100%.

The failing average is 55, which is 21 points below 76.\n\nThe ratio of students would be inversely proportional to these differences.

The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. Hmm, right.\n\nI remember that averages are about total points divided by the number of people. So maybe I can set up some equations here. Let's think about variables. Let me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for the passing students would be 83 multiplied by P, right? And for the failing students, it's 55 multiplied by F. So the overall total points for the class is 83P + 55F.\n\nThe average for the entire class is given as 76. So that's the total points divided by the total number of students. So:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI think that's the key equation here. Now I need to solve for the ratio of P to F, or something like that, to find the percentage of passing students.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P + 76F.\n\nSo bringing everything to one side:\n\n83P + 55F -76P -76F = 0.\n\nSimplify the terms. 83P -76P is 7P. 55F -76F is -21F. So:\n\n7P -21F = 0.\n\nWait, that simplifies further. Let me factor out 7:\n\n7(P - 3F) = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: P -3F = 0. So P = 3F.\n\nOh, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That means for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing ones.\n\nSo the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F = 4F. So the fraction of students who passed is P / (P + F) = 3F /4F = 3/4. Which is 75%. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Oh wait, looking back at the options: E is 75%. So would that be the answer?\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. Because 3F is P, so the percentage would be (3F / (3F + F)) * 100 = (3/4)*100=75%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 75%, but the options given are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is there. Hmm, but I have a feeling I might have made a mistake because sometimes these problems can have tricky setups.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should approach it using weighted averages. The overall average is between 55 and 83, closer to which? 76 is 21 points above 55 and 7 points below 83. Wait, no, wait: 76-55=21, and 83-76=7. So the ratio of the weights (number of students) should be inverse to the distances. So the ratio of failing to passing students is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So again, failing is 1 part, passing is 3 parts. So total is 4 parts, so 3/4 passed, 75%. That's the same as before.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 75%, so why am I confused? Because in the problem statement, the passing average is higher, so more students should have passed to bring the average up. So 75% makes sense. But wait, wait, why is the option not among the given choices? Oh wait, the options do include E)75%, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do the ratio correctly? Because when you use the weighted average method, the ratio of the number of students is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average. So the distance from 55 to 76 is 21, and from 76 to 83 is 7. So the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3. So failing is 1, passing is 3. So passing is 3/4, which is 75%. So yes, E is correct.\n\nBut wait, why is the answer not matching the options? Because when I first thought, I thought maybe I made a mistake, but it seems correct. Let me double-check the initial equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 83P +55F =76(P +F). So 83P +55F=76P +76F. Subtract 76P and 55F from both sides: 7P =21F. So 7P=21F => P=3F. So yes, same as before. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 75%, which is what I got. So why did I think the options don't have it? No, the options do have E as 75%, so that's the correct answer. So the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages in a class. Let me read it again. The passing students had an average of 83, and the failing ones had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed. Hmm, right.\n\nI remember that averages are about total points divided by the number of people. So maybe I can set up some equations here. Let's think about variables. Let me denote the number of passing students as P and the number of failing students as F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total points for the passing students would be 83 multiplied by P, right? And for the failing students, it's 55 multiplied by F. So the overall total points for the class is 83P + 55F.\n\nThe average for the entire class is given as 76. So that's the total points divided by the total number of students. So:\n\n(83P + 55F) / (P + F) = 76.\n\nI think that's the key equation here. Now I need to solve for the ratio of P to F, or something like that, to find the percentage of passing students.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by (P + F):\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F).\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P + 76F.\n\nSo bringing everything to one side:\n\n83P + 55F -76P -76F = 0.\n\nSimplify the terms. 83P -76P is 7P. 55F -76F is -21F. So:\n\n7P -21F = 0.\n\nWait, that simplifies further. Let me factor out 7:\n\n7(P - 3F) = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 7: P -3F = 0. So P = 3F.\n\nOh, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That means for every 1 failing student, there are 3 passing ones.\n\nSo the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F = 4F. So the fraction of students who passed is P / (P + F) = 3F /4F = 3/4. Which is 75%. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Oh wait, looking back at the options: E is 75%. So would that be the answer?\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check. Because 3F is P, so the percentage would be (3F / (3F + F)) * 100 = (3/4)*100=75%.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, E is 75%, but the options given are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is there. Hmm, but I have a feeling I might have made a mistake because sometimes these problems can have tricky setups.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should approach it using weighted averages. The overall average is between 55 and 83, closer to which? 76 is 21 points above 55 and 7 points below 83. Wait, no, wait: 76-55=21, and 83-76=7. So the ratio of the weights (number of students) should be inverse to the distances. So the ratio of failing to passing students is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. So again, failing is 1 part, passing is 3 parts. So total is 4 parts, so 3/4 passed, 75%. That's the same as before.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 75%, so why am I confused? Because in the problem statement, the passing average is higher, so more students should have passed to bring the average up. So 75% makes sense. But wait, wait, why is the option not among the given choices? Oh wait, the options do include E)75%, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I do the ratio correctly? Because when you use the weighted average method, the ratio of the number of students is inversely proportional to the distances from the overall average. So the distance from 55 to 76 is 21, and from 76 to 83 is 7. So the ratio of the number of failing to passing students is 7:21, which is 1:3. So failing is 1, passing is 3. So passing is 3/4, which is 75%. So yes, E is correct.\n\nBut wait, why is the answer not matching the options? Because when I first thought, I thought maybe I made a mistake, but it seems correct. Let me double-check the initial equation.\n\nOriginal equation: 83P +55F =76(P +F). So 83P +55F=76P +76F. Subtract 76P and 55F from both sides: 7P =21F. So 7P=21F => P=3F. So yes, same as before. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 75%, which is what I got. So why did I think the options don't have it? No, the options do have E as 75%, so that's the correct answer. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by denoting the number of passing students as \\( P \\) and the number of failing students as \\( F \\). The total number of students is \\( P + F \\). The total points for the class can be expressed as \\( 83P + 55F \\), and the overall class average is given as 76. This leads to the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{83P + 55F}{P + F} = 76\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( P + F \\) gives:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n\\]\n\n\\[\n83P - 76P = 76F - 55F\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7P = 21F\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP = 3F\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the number of passing students is three times the number of failing students. The total number of students is \\( P + F = 3F + F = 4F \\). The fraction of students who passed is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{P + F} = \\frac{3F}{4F} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, 75% of the class passed.

I remember that averages can sometimes be tricky because they depend on the number of students in each group. \n\nThe problem states that passing students had an average of 83, and failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent of the class passed.\n\nI think I can model this with some variables. Let me say that the number of passing students is P and the number of failing students is F. So the total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe total marks for passing students would be 83 multiplied by P, right? Because each of those P students averaged 83. Similarly, the total marks for failing students would be 55 multiplied by F.\n\nThe overall average is 76, which is the total marks divided by the total number of students. So the total marks for the whole class would be 76 multiplied by (P + F).\n\nPutting it together: 83P + 55F = 76(P + F). Let me write that down.\n\nExpanding the right side: 76P + 76F. So the equation becomes:\n\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F.\n\nHmm, I can subtract 76P and 55F from both sides to get the terms together. Let's see:\n\n83P -76P = 76F -55F.\n\nThat simplifies to 7P = 21F. Because 83 minus 76 is 7, and 76 minus 55 is 21.\n\nSo 7P = 21F. Dividing both sides by 7, I get P = 3F. Oh wait, because 21 divided by 7 is 3. So P is three times F.\n\nSo the ratio of P to F is 3:1. That means for every 3 passing students, there's 1 failing student.\n\nWait, but I need the percentage of the class that passed. The class is P + F. If P is 3F, then total students is 3F + F = 4F.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (P / (P + F)) * 100. Substituting P = 3F, it becomes (3F / (4F)) * 100. The F cancels out, so 3/4 is 0.75, which is 75%. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Oh wait, looking back at the options: E is 75%. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me go through the steps again. The equation is 83P +55F =76(P + F). Subtracting 76P and 55F gives 7P =21F. So P=3F. So the ratio is 3:1. So total students 4 parts. 3 parts passed, so 3/4 is 75%. Hmm, but wait the options have E as 75%... but the options listed were A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 75% which is option E. But wait, the question says \"what percent of the class passed?\" So my calculation says 75% passed. So why is the option D 72%? Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the equation is correct. Let me recheck. 83P +55F =76(P +F). Subtract 76P and 55F: 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F. So yes, 3F. So the proportion passed is (3F)/(4F) =3/4 \u219275%. So why isn't that the answer? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Maybe the problem is that the averages are weighted. Let me think. No, I think the setup is correct. Let me try plugging numbers to check.\n\nSuppose F =100 students. Then P=300 students. Because P=3F.\n\nTotal marks: (300 *83) + (100*55) = 24900 +5500=30400. Total students=400.\n\nAverage =30400/400=76. Which matches. So the calculation is correct. So the percentage passed is 300/400=75%, which is option E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 75%, so that's correct. But the options given are:\n\nA)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E. But wait, why is the option D 72%? Did I make a mistake in the equation?\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think of the difference from the class average.\n\nThe passing students are 83, which is 83-76=7 points above the average.\n\nFailing students are 55, which is 76-55=21 points below the average.\n\nThe ratio of the number of students should be inversely proportional to the difference in points. So the ratio is 21:7, which is 3:1. Wait, wait, that's different from before.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, when dealing with weighted averages, the ratio is inversely proportional to the distances from the mean. So the number of passing students over the number of failing students equals the difference in failing's deviation to the passing's deviation.\n\nWait, the formula I remember is that if two groups have averages A and B, and the overall average is C, then the ratio of the number of students in each group is (C - B) : (A - C).\n\nSo in this case, A is 83 (passing), B is 55 (failing), C is76.\n\nSo the ratio is (76-55) : (83-76) \u2192 21 :7 \u2192 3:1.\n\nSo the number of passing students is 3 times the number of failing students. So P =3F.\n\nSo the percentage passed is (3F)/(3F + F) *100 \u2192 75%. So that's E.\n\nSo why is the option D 72%? Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage that passed, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the averages. Wait, no, the problem says the passing students had an average of 83, failing 55. The class average is 76.\n\nSo I think the setup is correct. So the answer should be E)75%.\n\nBut why is option E 75% present? Let me look back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the options given are:\n\nA)44%\n\nB)66%\n\nC)68%\n\nD)72%\n\nE)75%\n\nSo E is 75%, which is what I'm getting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me check.\n\nWait, 83P +55F =76(P + F).\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F.\n\nSubtracting 76P and 55F from both sides: 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way: Let me think of it as a weighted average.\n\nThe overall average is between 55 and 83, closer to which? 76 is closer to 83 than to 55. So the percentage of passing students should be higher than 50%. 75% is in the options, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe I was overcomplicating. So the correct answer is E)75%.\n",
