      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are A to E with numbers 10 to 14. \n\nHmm, I remember that when two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by another number, the difference between those two numbers is a multiple of the divisor. So, like, if a and b are divided by N and leave the same remainder r, then (a - b) is divisible by N. Oh wait, right! Because a = q1*N + r and b = q2*N + r, so a - b = (q1 - q2)*N. So N must be a divisor of (a - b).\n\nSo in this problem, the two numbers are 2272 and 875. Let me compute their difference. 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more is 1397. So 2272 - 875 = 1397. So N must be a 3-digit divisor of 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then find which one's digits add up to one of the given options. \n\nBut wait, what is the prime factorization of 1397? I should factorize 1397 to find all its divisors. Let me try dividing 1397 by small primes. \n\nFirst, check if it's even: 1397 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Sum of digits is 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 is out. Ends with 7, so not divisible by 5. Let me try 7: 1397 divided by 7. 7*199 is 1393, which is close. 1397 - 1393 is 4, so remainder 4. Not divisible by 7. \n\nNext, 11: Let's do the 11 test. Subtract the sum of the digits in odd positions from the even positions. For 1397: (1 + 9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) = 0. Oh wait, that means it is divisible by 11. So 1397 \u00f7 11. Let me compute that.\n\n11 times 127 is 1397? Let me check: 11*120=1320, 11*7=77, so 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 = 11 * 127.\n\nNow, wait, is 127 a prime? Let me think. 127 is a known prime number, yes. So the prime factors of 1397 are 11 and 127.\n\nSo the divisors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a 3-digit number, so possible candidates are 127 and 1397. Wait, 1397 is a 4-digit number, so it's out. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. \n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other divisors? Because 11 is a prime, and 127 is a prime, so the only divisors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So the only 3-digit possible N is 127. So N is 127.\n\nNow, what's the sum of the digits of N? Let's see: 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Oh, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 10. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait a second. Let me think again. Because 127 is a 3-digit number. So N is 127. So the sum is 1+2+7=10. So the answer should be A)10.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, the same remainder condition might have other possible Ns if there's more than one 3-digit divisor. But in this case, the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So yes, N must be 127.\n\nSo the sum of digits is 1+2+7=10. So the correct answer is option A.\n",

Wait, 2272 - 875. Let me do it step by step. 875 is 800 +75. 2272 - 800 is 1472. 1472 -75: 1472-70 is 1402, then minus 5 is 1397. So the difference is 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, so both divisions by N leave the same remainder. Let me recall what that implies. If two numbers, say a and b, when divided by N give the same remainder, then the difference between a and b should be divisible by N. Oh right, because when you subtract the two remainders, which are the same, the result is a multiple of N. So, in this case, 2272 minus 875 should be a multiple of N.\n\nLet me calculate that difference. 2272 minus 875... Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more. 1472 -75 is 1397. So, 1397 is divisible by N. That means N is a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and see which one fits the conditions.\n\nFirst, let me factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me think. Does 1397 divide by small primes? Let's try dividing by 11 first. 11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*127 is 1397? Let me check: 127*10 is 1270, plus 127 is 1397. Yes, that's correct. So 1397 factors into 11 and 127. Wait, are those primes?\n\nLet me check if 127 is a prime. 127 divided by 2 is no, 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 127/7 is about 18.14, no. 11? 11*11 is 121, 121 +6=127. 11*11.54, no. So 127 is a prime. So 1397 is 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a 3-digit number? No, it's 127 which is a 3-digit number, but 11 is only two digits. So the possible divisors of 1397 would be 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a 3-digit number, so 127 is a possible candidate, but 1397 is a 4-digit number, so we can't use that. Wait, wait, 127 is a 3-digit number. So N could be 127. Are there any other 3-digit divisors?\n\nWait, no. Because 1397 is 11 * 127, and both are primes. So the only divisors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So the only possible 3-digit divisor is 127.\n\nSo N must be 127. Now, let's find the sum of its digits. 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Wait, but 10 is one of the options, option A.\n\nWait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify that 2272 and 875 when divided by 127 give the same remainder.\n\nLet me calculate 2272 divided by 127. 127 times 17 is 2159 (127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 minus 2159 is 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see, 127*6=762, 127*7=889. 875 is between 6 and 7 times. 762 subtracted from 875 is 113. So yes, the remainder is 113 in both cases.

Let's see, 1397 divided by 7. 7 * 199 is 1393, which is less than 1397. 7*200 is 1400, which is 3 more. So 1397 is not divisible by 7. How about 13? 13*107 is 1391, 13*108=1404, which is more than 1397. So no. 17? 17*82=1394, 17*83=1411. 1397-1394=3, so no. So 1397 is indeed 11*127, both primes. So no other factors.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, so both divisions by N leave the same remainder. Let me recall what that implies. If two numbers, say a and b, when divided by N give the same remainder, then the difference between a and b should be divisible by N. Oh right, because when you subtract the two remainders, which are the same, the result is a multiple of N. So, in this case, 2272 minus 875 should be a multiple of N.\n\nLet me calculate that difference. 2272 minus 875... Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more. 1472 -75 is 1397. So, 1397 is divisible by N. That means N is a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and see which one fits the conditions.\n\nFirst, let me factorize 1397 to find its divisors. Let me think. Does 1397 divide by small primes? Let's try dividing by 11 first. 11 times 127 is 1397? Wait, 11*127 is 1397? Let me check: 127*10 is 1270, plus 127 is 1397. Yes, that's correct. So 1397 factors into 11 and 127. Wait, are those primes?\n\nLet me check if 127 is a prime. 127 divided by 2 is no, 3? 1+2+7=10, not divisible by 3. 5? Ends with 7, no. 7? 127/7 is about 18.14, no. 11? 11*11 is 121, 121 +6=127. 11*11.54, no. So 127 is a prime. So 1397 is 11 * 127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a 3-digit number? No, it's 127 which is a 3-digit number, but 11 is only two digits. So the possible divisors of 1397 would be 1, 11, 127, and 1397. But N is a 3-digit number, so 127 is a possible candidate, but 1397 is a 4-digit number, so we can't use that. Wait, wait, 127 is a 3-digit number. So N could be 127. Are there any other 3-digit divisors?\n\nWait, no. Because 1397 is 11 * 127, and both are primes. So the only divisors are 1, 11, 127, 1397. So the only possible 3-digit divisor is 127.\n\nSo N must be 127. Now, let's find the sum of its digits. 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Wait, but 10 is one of the options, option A.\n\nWait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify that 2272 and 875 when divided by 127 give the same remainder.\n\nLet me calculate 2272 divided by 127. 127 times 17 is 2159 (127*10=1270, 127*7=889; 1270+889=2159). 2272 minus 2159 is 113. So the remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see, 127*6=762, 127*7=889. 875 is between 6 and 7 times. 762 subtracted from 875 is 113. So yes, the remainder is 113 in both cases. So N=127 is correct.\n\nWait, but the sum of the digits is 1+2+7=10, which is option A. But looking at the options, the choices are A)10, B)11, C)12, etc.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A)10. But wait, let me think again. Did I miss any other 3-digit divisors of 1397?\n\nWait, 1397 divided by 127 is 11. So the only 3-digit divisor is 127. So N is 127, sum is 10.

Let me try 7 times 199 is 1393, which is less than 1397. 199 times 7 is 1393, so 1397 minus 1393 is 4. So 1397 divided by 7 is 199 with a remainder of 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, maybe 11? The rule for 11: subtract and add digits alternately. 1 -3 +9 -7 = 1 -3 is -2, +9 is 7, -7 is 0. So 0 is divisible by 11.

And then I have to find the sum of the digits of N from the options given. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers, say A and B, when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between A and B should be divisible by N. Because, like, A = qN + r and B = pN + r, so A - B = (q-p)N. So the difference is a multiple of N. That makes sense.\n\nSo, applying that here, 2272 minus 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 - 875 is... let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more is 1397. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it properly:\n\n2272\n- 875\n------\nLet me subtract digit by digit. 2 -5, can't do that, borrow. So 12 -5 is 7. Next digit: 6 (since we borrowed) minus 7? Can't do that either. Oh wait, wait, 2272 is 2 2 7 2. So when subtracting 875 (which is 0 8 7 5), it's:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n2 -5 \u2192 borrow 1 \u2192 12-5=7\nNext digit: 7 becomes 6 (after borrowing). 6 -7? Can't do, borrow again. 16 -7=9.\nNext digit: 2 becomes 1 (after borrowing). 1 -8? Can't do. Wait, the next digit is 2 in the thousands place, but 8 is in the hundreds. Wait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n2272 - 875:\nBreak it down: 2272 = 2000 + 200 + 70 +2\n875 = 800 +70 +5\n\nSubtracting each part:\n2000 -800 = 1200\n200-70 = 130\n70-70=0\n2-5 can't do, so I think I need to subtract the entire 875 from 2272 correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 2272 - 875:\n\n2272\n- 875\n= ?\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\nUnits place: 2 -5 \u2192 can't do, borrow from tens. So 12-5=7. Units digit is 7.\nTens place: 7 becomes 6 after borrowing. 6 -7 \u2192 can't do, borrow from hundreds. 16-7=9. Tens digit is 9.\nHundreds place: 2 becomes 1 after borrowing. 1 -8 \u2192 can't do, borrow from thousands. So 11 -8 =3. Hundreds digit is 3.\nThousands place: 2 becomes 1 after borrowing. 1 -0 =1. So thousands digit is 1.\n\nSo the result is 1397. So 2272 -875=1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut N is a three-digit number. So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397. Then, among them, find which one(s) when dividing both 2272 and 875 gives the same remainder.\n\nWait, but how? Because I'm not just looking for any divisor, but a specific one where the remainder is the same in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, since N is a three-digit number, let's find the factors of 1397 and see which are three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 1397.\n\nHmm, 1397. Let's check if it's divisible by small primes.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, ends with 7, so not divisible by 2.\n\nSum of digits: 1+3+9+7=20. 20 isn't divisible by 3, so 1397 isn't divisible by 3.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7: 1397 \u00f77. Let me calculate 7*199=1393. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nHow about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10)-(10) =0. So 1397 is divisible by 11. Let's see: 1397 \u00f711.\n\n11 \u00d7 127 is 1397? Let's see: 11 * 120=1320. 11*7=77. 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 =11 \u00d7127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, I think. Let me check. 127: it's not even, not divisible by 3 (1+2+7=10), not by 5 (ends with 7), 7? 7*18=126, 127-126=1. No. 11? 11*11=121, 127-121=6. No. So 127 is prime.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a three-digit number. So possible options are 11 (no, that's two-digit), 127 (three-digit), 1397 (four-digit). So the only three-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other three-digit factors? Because 11 \u00d7127=1397, so the factors are 1,11,127,1397. So no, only 127 is three-digit.\n\nWait, but let me think again. 1397 is 11 \u00d7127. So the only three-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127. Then the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10.

So 1270+889=2159. 2272-2159=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nWait, but 127 \u00d718 is 2286, which is larger than 2272. So 17 times.\n\nWait, 127 \u00d717 = 2159, as above. 2272 -2159=113.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a three-digit number N. When you divide 2272 and 875 by N, you get the same remainder each time. And then I have to find the sum of the digits of N from the options given. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers, say A and B, when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between A and B should be divisible by N. Because, like, A = qN + r and B = pN + r, so A - B = (q-p)N. So the difference is a multiple of N. That makes sense.\n\nSo, applying that here, 2272 minus 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 - 875 is... let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, then minus 75 more is 1397. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it properly:\n\n2272\n- 875\n------\nLet me subtract digit by digit. 2 -5, can't do that, borrow. So 12 -5 is 7. Next digit: 6 (since we borrowed) minus 7? Can't do that either. Oh wait, wait, 2272 is 2 2 7 2. So when subtracting 875 (which is 0 8 7 5), it's:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n2 -5 \u2192 borrow 1 \u2192 12-5=7\nNext digit: 7 becomes 6 (after borrowing). 6 -7? Can't do, borrow again. 16 -7=9.\nNext digit: 2 becomes 1 (after borrowing). 1 -8? Can't do. Wait, the next digit is 2 in the thousands place, but 8 is in the hundreds. Wait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n2272 - 875:\nBreak it down: 2272 = 2000 + 200 + 70 +2\n875 = 800 +70 +5\n\nSubtracting each part:\n2000 -800 = 1200\n200-70 = 130\n70-70=0\n2-5 can't do, so I think I need to subtract the entire 875 from 2272 correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 2272 - 875:\n\n2272\n- 875\n= ?\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\nUnits place: 2 -5 \u2192 can't do, borrow from tens. So 12-5=7. Units digit is 7.\nTens place: 7 becomes 6 after borrowing. 6 -7 \u2192 can't do, borrow from hundreds. 16-7=9. Tens digit is 9.\nHundreds place: 2 becomes 1 after borrowing. 1 -8 \u2192 can't do, borrow from thousands. So 11 -8 =3. Hundreds digit is 3.\nThousands place: 2 becomes 1 after borrowing. 1 -0 =1. So thousands digit is 1.\n\nSo the result is 1397. So 2272 -875=1397. So N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut N is a three-digit number. So I need to find all the three-digit divisors of 1397. Then, among them, find which one(s) when dividing both 2272 and 875 gives the same remainder.\n\nWait, but how? Because I'm not just looking for any divisor, but a specific one where the remainder is the same in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, since N is a three-digit number, let's find the factors of 1397 and see which are three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 1397.\n\nHmm, 1397. Let's check if it's divisible by small primes.\n\nIs 1397 even? No, ends with 7, so not divisible by 2.\n\nSum of digits: 1+3+9+7=20. 20 isn't divisible by 3, so 1397 isn't divisible by 3.\n\nCheck divisibility by 7: 1397 \u00f77. Let me calculate 7*199=1393. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nHow about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits. (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10)-(10) =0. So 1397 is divisible by 11. Let's see: 1397 \u00f711.\n\n11 \u00d7 127 is 1397? Let's see: 11 * 120=1320. 11*7=77. 1320+77=1397. Yes! So 1397 =11 \u00d7127.\n\nWait, but 127 is a prime number, I think. Let me check. 127: it's not even, not divisible by 3 (1+2+7=10), not by 5 (ends with 7), 7? 7*18=126, 127-126=1. No. 11? 11*11=121, 127-121=6. No. So 127 is prime.\n\nSo the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, and 1397.\n\nBut N is a three-digit number. So possible options are 11 (no, that's two-digit), 127 (three-digit), 1397 (four-digit). So the only three-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there any other three-digit factors? Because 11 \u00d7127=1397, so the factors are 1,11,127,1397. So no, only 127 is three-digit.\n\nWait, but let me think again. 1397 is 11 \u00d7127. So the only three-digit divisor is 127. So N must be 127. Then the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10. So option A)10.\n\nBut wait, I should verify that dividing 2272 and 875 by 127 gives the same remainder.\n\nLet me compute 2272 \u00f7127.\n\n127 \u00d717 is 127*10=1270, 127*7=889. So 1270+889=2159. 2272-2159=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nWait, but 127 \u00d718 is 2286, which is larger than 2272. So 17 times.\n\nWait, 127 \u00d717 = 2159, as above. 2272 -2159=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nNow 875 \u00f7127. Let's see how many times 127 goes into 875.\n\n127 \u00d76=762. 127\u00d77=889. 889 is larger than 875, so 6 times.\n\nSo 6\u00d7127=762. 875-762=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nSo both give remainder 113 when divided by 127. So yes, N is 127.\n\nThus, the sum of its digits is 1+2+7=10, so option A.\n\n\nWhen dividing 2272 and 875 by a three-digit number \\( N \\), the same remainder is obtained. This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875, which is \\( 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\), must be divisible by \\( N \\).

For 2272, \\( 127 \\times 17 = 2159 \\), and \\( 2272 - 2159 = 113 \\), so the remainder is 113. For 875, \\( 127 \\times 6 = 762 \\), and \\( 875 - 762 = 113 \\), so the remainder is also 113.

I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from A to E, with sums 10 to 14. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by N. So, the difference between 2272 and 875 is 2272 - 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, and then minus 75 is 1397. Wait, no, wait, 2272-875: let me do it properly. 875 plus 1000 is 1875. 2272 minus 1875 is 397. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right because 875 is less than 2272, so 2272-875 should be 1397. Let me check: 875 + 1397 = 2272. Yes, because 800+1300=2100, 75+97=172, 2100+172=2272. So yes, 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397. Also, N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then check which one fits the conditions.\n\nWait, but how do I find the divisors of 1397? I guess I should factorize 1397. Let me try dividing 1397 by small primes to see if it's a prime or composite.\n\nFirst, is it even? 1397 is odd, so no. Sum of digits: 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it. Let's try 5: ends with 7, so no. Next, 7: 1397 divided by 7. Let me calculate 7*199 is 1393. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nNext prime is 11: Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11. Subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum in even positions. (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10) - (10) =0. So yes, 11 divides 1397. So 11 is a factor.\n\nSo 1397 divided by 11. Let me do that: 11*127=1397? Let's see: 127*10=1270, 127*11=1270+127=1397. Yes, correct. So 1397=11*127. Now, is 127 a prime number? Let me check. 127 is a known prime, yes. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So possible N's are 127 and 11. Wait, 11 is a two-digit number, so only 127 is a 3-digit divisor? Because 1397 is a 4-digit number, but the other factors are 11 and 127. So N must be 127, since it's the only 3-digit divisor.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. 11 is 2-digit, 127 is 3-digit. 1397 is 4-digit, which is larger than 3-digit, so N can't be 1397. So only N=127 is a possible 3-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of the digits of N. 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 10. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused because the options have 10 as A, 11 as B, etc.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that 127 is indeed the correct N. Because I need to confirm that when 2272 and 875 are divided by 127, they leave the same remainder.\n\nLet me compute 2272 divided by 127. How many times does 127 go into 2272?\n\n127*17 is 2159 (127*10=1270, 127*7=889, 1270+889=2159). 2272-2159=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is 113. So yes, same remainder. So N is 127, sum of digits is 1+2+7=10. So the answer is A)10.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other possible 3-digit divisors of 1397. Because maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, 1397 is 11*127, and both are primes. So the only factors are 1,11,127,1397. So yes, 127 is the only 3-digit number possible. So the sum is 10, option A.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm looking at the options and option A is 10. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you divide 2272 and 875 by N, the same remainder is obtained. So, the remainder when 2272 is divided by N is r, and same for 875. So, 2272 = N * q1 + r, and 875 = N * q2 + r. Subtracting these, 2272 -875 = N*(q1 - q2). So, 1397 = N * (q1 - q2). So N must be a divisor of 1397, and as 1397 is 11*127, which are primes, the possible N's are 11, 127, etc.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number, so only 127. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum is 1+2+7=10. So the correct answer is A)10.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where when I divide 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, I get the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are from A to E, with sums 10 to 14. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if two numbers when divided by N leave the same remainder, then the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by N. So, the difference between 2272 and 875 is 2272 - 875. Let me calculate that. 2272 minus 800 is 1472, and then minus 75 is 1397. Wait, no, wait, 2272-875: let me do it properly. 875 plus 1000 is 1875. 2272 minus 1875 is 397. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right because 875 is less than 2272, so 2272-875 should be 1397. Let me check: 875 + 1397 = 2272. Yes, because 800+1300=2100, 75+97=172, 2100+172=2272. So yes, 1397.\n\nSo N must be a divisor of 1397. Also, N is a 3-digit number. So I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then check which one fits the conditions.\n\nWait, but how do I find the divisors of 1397? I guess I should factorize 1397. Let me try dividing 1397 by small primes to see if it's a prime or composite.\n\nFirst, is it even? 1397 is odd, so no. Sum of digits: 1+3+9+7=20, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 doesn't divide it. Let's try 5: ends with 7, so no. Next, 7: 1397 divided by 7. Let me calculate 7*199 is 1393. 1397-1393=4, so remainder 4. So not divisible by 7.\n\nNext prime is 11: Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11. Subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum in even positions. (1 +9) - (3+7) = (10) - (10) =0. So yes, 11 divides 1397. So 11 is a factor.\n\nSo 1397 divided by 11. Let me do that: 11*127=1397? Let's see: 127*10=1270, 127*11=1270+127=1397. Yes, correct. So 1397=11*127. Now, is 127 a prime number? Let me check. 127 is a known prime, yes. So the factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, 1397.\n\nWait, but N is a 3-digit number. So possible N's are 127 and 11. Wait, 11 is a two-digit number, so only 127 is a 3-digit divisor? Because 1397 is a 4-digit number, but the other factors are 11 and 127. So N must be 127, since it's the only 3-digit divisor.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. 11 is 2-digit, 127 is 3-digit. 1397 is 4-digit, which is larger than 3-digit, so N can't be 1397. So only N=127 is a possible 3-digit divisor.\n\nSo N is 127. Now, the sum of the digits of N. 1 + 2 +7 = 10. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 10. But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused because the options have 10 as A, 11 as B, etc.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure that 127 is indeed the correct N. Because I need to confirm that when 2272 and 875 are divided by 127, they leave the same remainder.\n\nLet me compute 2272 divided by 127. How many times does 127 go into 2272?\n\n127*17 is 2159 (127*10=1270, 127*7=889, 1270+889=2159). 2272-2159=113. So remainder is 113.\n\nNow, 875 divided by 127. Let's see: 127*6=762. 875-762=113. So the remainder is 113. So yes, same remainder. So N is 127, sum of digits is 1+2+7=10. So the answer is A)10.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other possible 3-digit divisors of 1397. Because maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, 1397 is 11*127, and both are primes. So the only factors are 1,11,127,1397. So yes, 127 is the only 3-digit number possible. So the sum is 10, option A.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm looking at the options and option A is 10. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you divide 2272 and 875 by N, the same remainder is obtained. So, the remainder when 2272 is divided by N is r, and same for 875. So, 2272 = N * q1 + r, and 875 = N * q2 + r. Subtracting these, 2272 -875 = N*(q1 - q2). So, 1397 = N * (q1 - q2). So N must be a divisor of 1397, and as 1397 is 11*127, which are primes, the possible N's are 11, 127, etc.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number, so only 127. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum is 1+2+7=10. So the correct answer is A)10.\n\n\nWhen dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number \\( N \\), the same remainder is obtained. This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875, which is \\( 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\), must be divisible by \\( N \\). Therefore, \\( N \\) is a 3-digit divisor of 1397.\n\nTo factorize 1397, we check its divisibility by small primes. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Using the divisibility rule for 11, we find that 1397 is divisible by 11:  \n\\[\n1397 \\div 11 = 127.\n\\]  \nThus, \\( 1397 = 11 \\times 127 \\).

Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says that when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, they leave the same remainder. I need to find the sum of the digits of N, and the options are given as A)10, B)11, etc.\n\nHmm. I remember that when two numbers are divided by the same divisor and leave the same remainder, the difference between those two numbers should be divisible by the divisor. So, let me think about that. \n\nSo, if 2272 divided by N leaves remainder R, and 875 divided by N also leaves R, then (2272 - R) must be a multiple of N, and (875 - R) must also be a multiple of N. Therefore, the difference between 2272 and 875 should be a multiple of N. \n\nWait, wait. Let me write that down. 2272 = N * q1 + R, and 875 = N * q2 + R. Subtracting these two equations, 2272 - 875 = N*(q1 - q2). So, 2272 - 875 equals N multiplied by some integer (q1 - q2). \n\nCalculating 2272 minus 875: Let's see, 2272 - 800 is 1472, then subtract 75 more, which brings us to 1397. So, 2272 - 875 = 1397. So, 1397 is equal to N multiplied by (q1 - q2). That means N must be a divisor of 1397.\n\nBut wait, N is a 3-digit number. So, I need to find all the 3-digit divisors of 1397 and then compute the sum of their digits.\n\nFirst, I should factorize 1397 to find its divisors.

Next, 5: ends with 7, so no. 7? Let's try dividing 1397 by 7.\n\n7 into 1397: 7*199 is 1393. So 7*199=1393. 1397 minus 1393 is 4, so 1397=7*199 +4. So remainder 4, not divisible by 7.\n\nNext, 11. Using the divisibility rule for 11: (1 +9) - (3 +7) = (10) - (10) =0. So 1397 is divisible by 11. \n\nSo, 1397 \u00f7 11. Let's compute that. 11*127 is 1397 because 11*120=1320, 11*7=77, so 1320+77=1397. So 11 * 127 =1397.\n\nWait, 127 is a prime number, I think. Let me check: 127 is known as a prime. Yes, because it's not divisible by any primes up to its square root (which is around 11.27). So, factors of 1397 are 1, 11, 127, 1397.\n\nBut N is a 3-digit number. So the possible Ns are 11 and 127.

Yes, 127 is a three-digit number.\n\nSo N must be 127. Then, the sum of its digits is 1 + 2 +7 =10. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 10.
