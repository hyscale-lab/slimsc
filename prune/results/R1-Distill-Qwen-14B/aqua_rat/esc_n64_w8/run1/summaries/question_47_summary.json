      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. One is going 12 mph, the other 13 mph. I need to find out how long it takes for them to meet. Hmm.\n\nWait, so both cars are moving towards each other. Right, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Oh right, that's because their speeds add up since they're approaching each other. So the combined speed would be 12 + 13, which is 25 mph.\n\nThe total distance between them initially is 50 miles. So the time it takes for them to meet would be the distance divided by their combined speed. Time equals distance over speed. So time t = 50 / 25. Let me do that math. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Oh wait, that's 2 hours. But wait, let me think again. 25 mph for 2 hours would cover 50 miles, right? Because 25 * 2 = 50. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 2. So the answer should be E. But wait, did I make any mistakes in my reasoning? Let me double-check. Both cars start at the same time from opposite ends, moving towards each other.
