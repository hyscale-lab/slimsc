      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see, a man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 and a half percent of his income. I need to find his monthly income. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, so he saves 12.5% of his income. That means the rest must be his expenditure, right? Because income is either spent or saved. So if he saves 12.5%, he must be spending the remaining percentage.\n\nWhat's 12.5% as a decimal? Oh right, 12.5% is 0.125 in decimal form. So, the percentage he spends would be 100% minus 12.5%, which is 87.5%. So he's spending 87.5% of his income.\n\nHe spends Rs. 3500, which is 87.5% of his income. So I can set up an equation where 87.5% of his income equals 3500. Let me write that down.\n\nLet his income be I. So, 87.5% of I is 3500. In math terms, that's 0.875 * I = 3500.\n\nTo find I, I can divide both sides by 0.875. So I = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Maybe I can think of it as 3500 divided by 7/8 because 0.875 is 7/8. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 3500 * (8/7).\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Because 7 times 500 is 3500. Then, 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. So I = 4000.\n\nSo his income is Rs. 4000. Let me check the options. Option C is 4000, so that must be the answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If his income is 4000, 12.5% of that is 500. Because 4000 * 0.125 is 500. So he saves 500, and spends 3500. 3500 plus 500 is 4000, which adds up. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is option C.\n",

The question is asking what his monthly income is. The options are A) Rs. 4400, B) Rs. 4270, C) Rs. 4000, D) Rs. 3937.50, and E) None of these.\n\nHmm, I think I need to figure out his total income based on what he saves and spends. So, the key points are his expenditure, the savings percentage, and from that, find his income.\n\nWait, let's break it down. He spends Rs. 3500 per month. So, the money he doesn't spend is his savings. His savings are 12.5% of his income. So, the amount he saves plus what he spends should equal his total income.\n\nLet me denote his income as I. So, his savings would be 12.5% of I, which is 0.125 * I. And his expenditure is Rs. 3500. So, the sum of his savings and expenditure equals his income. So, the equation would be:\n\nSavings + Expenditure = Income\n0.125I + 3500 = I\n\nWait, that makes sense because he's not saving the entire amount, just a portion. So, the part he saves plus what he uses for other expenses (spends) adds up to his total income.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Subtract 0.125I from both sides:\n\n3500 = I - 0.125I\n3500 = 0.875I\n\nOh right, because I minus 0.125I is 0.875I. So, now I can solve for I.\n\nSo, I = 3500 / 0.875\n\nWait, let me calculate that. What's 3500 divided by 0.875? Hmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8, right? Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So, dividing by 0.875 is the same as multiplying by 8/7.\n\nSo, 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Because 7 times 500 is 3500. Then multiply by 8: 500 *8 = 4000. So, I is 4000.\n\nWait, so his income is Rs. 4000 per month. Let me check the options. Option C is 4000, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Let me compute 3500 / 0.875 another way. Let's think in terms of money. 0.875 is 875 paise, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, perhaps using fractions.\n\n0.875 = 7/8. So, 3500 divided by 7/8 is 3500 * 8/7 = (3500 /7) *8 = 500 *8 = 4000. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, his income is Rs. 4000. Looking back at the options, option C is 4000, so that's the correct choice.\n",

And the rest of his income is what he spends, right? So if he saves 12.5%, then he must be spending the remaining percentage.\n\nLet me calculate the percentage he spends. 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%. So he's spending 87.5% of his income each month. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if he saves 12.5%, that's out of his total income. So his spending is the total income minus the savings.\n\nSo the formula should be: Savings = (12.5/100)*Income. And his spending is Income minus Savings, which would be (100 -12.5)% = 87.5% of the income. So his spending is 87.5% of his income.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends Rs. 3500. So that Rs. 3500 is equal to 87.5% of his income. So I can set up the equation: 3500 = (87.5/100) * Income.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as: Savings are 12.5% of income, so spending is 87.5% of income. So 87.5% of income is 3500. To find income, I can rearrange that.\n\nSo, 87.5% as a decimal is 0.875. So 0.875 * Income = 3500. Therefore, Income = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Wait, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7. So 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute 3500 divided by 7 first. 3500 /7 is 500. Because 7*500 is 3500. Then multiply by 8: 500 *8 is 4000. So the income is 4000 Rs. So looking at the options, option C is 4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approach. Another way to think: Let's say his income is I. He saves 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100)*I = (1/8)*I. So his savings are I/8. His spending is I - I/8 = (7I)/8. And this spending is 3500.\n\nSo (7I)/8 = 3500. Multiply both sides by 8: 7I = 28000. Divide by 7: I = 4000. Yep, same result.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem where a man spends Rs. 3500 each month and saves 12.5% of his income. The question is asking for his monthly income. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, so he saves 12.5% of his income. That means the amount he saves is 12.5% of his total income. And the rest of his income is what he spends, right? So if he saves 12.5%, then he must be spending the remaining percentage.\n\nLet me calculate the percentage he spends. 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%. So he's spending 87.5% of his income each month. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if he saves 12.5%, that's out of his total income. So his spending is the total income minus the savings.\n\nSo the formula should be: Savings = (12.5/100)*Income. And his spending is Income minus Savings, which would be (100 -12.5)% = 87.5% of the income. So his spending is 87.5% of his income.\n\nWait, but the problem says he spends Rs. 3500. So that Rs. 3500 is equal to 87.5% of his income. So I can set up the equation: 3500 = (87.5/100) * Income.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as: Savings are 12.5% of income, so spending is 87.5% of income. So 87.5% of income is 3500. To find income, I can rearrange that.\n\nSo, 87.5% as a decimal is 0.875. So 0.875 * Income = 3500. Therefore, Income = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Wait, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7. So 3500 * (8/7) = ?\n\nLet me compute 3500 divided by 7 first. 3500 /7 is 500. Because 7*500 is 3500. Then multiply by 8: 500 *8 is 4000. So the income is 4000 Rs. So looking at the options, option C is 4000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approach. Another way to think: Let's say his income is I. He saves 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100)*I = (1/8)*I. So his savings are I/8. His spending is I - I/8 = (7I)/8. And this spending is 3500.\n\nSo (7I)/8 = 3500. Multiply both sides by 8: 7I = 28000. Divide by 7: I = 4000. Yep, same result. So the answer should be C) Rs. 4000.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C is 4000, which matches. So I think that's correct.\n\n\nThe man spends Rs. 3500 per month, which represents 87.5% of his income (since he saves 12.5%). To find his monthly income, we use the equation:\n\n\\[\n3500 = 0.875 \\times \\text{Income}\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Income} = \\frac{3500}{0.875}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(0.875 = \\frac{7}{8}\\), dividing by \\(0.875\\) is equivalent to multiplying by \\(\\frac{8}{7}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Income} = 3500 \\times \\frac{8}{7} = 4000\n\\]\n\nThus, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. We need to find his monthly income. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me break this down. So the man has an income, part of which he spends, and the rest he saves. The saving percentage is given, which is 12.5%. So 12.5% is the same as 12 1/2%. Oh right, that's 12.5%.\n\nSo, his savings are 12.5% of his income, and the amount he spends is Rs. 3500. So, his total income is the sum of what he spends and what he saves. That makes sense.\n\nLet me denote his monthly income as 'I'. So, his savings would be 12.5% of I, which is (12.5/100)*I.

So,\n\nI*(1 - 0.125) = 3500.\n\nCalculating 1 - 0.125 gives 0.875. So,\n\nI * 0.875 = 3500.\n\nTo find I, divide both sides by 0.875.\n\nI = 3500 / 0.875.\n\nLet me compute that.

So, 12.5% is 1/8, so the remaining is 7/8. If 7/8 of his income is 3500, then the total income is 3500 * (8/7) which is 4000. Yep, that's correct.\n",

So we can write:\n\n(87.5/100) * I = 3500.\n\nTo find I, we can rearrange this equation. I = 3500 * (100/87.5).\n\nLet me compute that. First, 100 divided by 87.5. Hmm, 87.5 is 700/8, or wait, 87.5 is 7/8 of 100. Wait, no, 87.5 is 7/8 of 100? No, wait, 7/8 is 0.875, which is 87.5%. So 87.5% is 7/8. So 100/87.5 is the same as 100/(7/8) which is 100 * (8/7). Oh, right, because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\nSo 100 * (8/7) is 800/7. Let me compute that: 7 goes into 800 how many times? 7*114 is 798, so 114 with a remainder of 2. So 800/7 is approximately 114.2857.\n\nSo I = 3500 * (800/7) ? Wait, wait, no.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a man spends Rs. 3500 each month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. I need to find out his monthly income. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that saving a percentage of income means that's the part he doesn't spend. So if he saves 12.5%, then the rest is what he spends. Right, because 12 1/2% is the same as 12.5%, which is like 1/8 in fraction terms.\n\nSo, his monthly income is the total he earns. Let's denote his income as I. He saves 12.5% of I, which means he spends the remaining 87.5% of I. Because 100% minus 12.5% is 87.5%.\n\nThe problem states that he spends Rs. 3500. So, 87.5% of his income equals 3500. So mathematically, that's 0.875 * I = 3500.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait a second, maybe I got that mixed up. Because sometimes people confuse saving and spending. So let me double-check. If he saves 12.5%, then his spending would be 100% minus 12.5%, which is 87.5% of his income. So yeah, 0.875 * I = 3500.\n\nSo to find I, I can rearrange the equation. I equals 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. I can do this division. Alternatively, since 0.875 is the same as 7/8, maybe that's easier. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875.\n\nSo if 7/8 of I is 3500, then I is 3500 multiplied by 8/7. Let me compute that.\n\n3500 * 8 = 28000. Then 28000 divided by 7 is 4000. So I is 4000. So his monthly income is Rs. 4000.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is Rs. 4000. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I correctly interpret the problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the saving part. He saves 12.5% of his income, which is equal to saving 1/8. So the amount he saves is I * 12.5% = I * (1/8). But wait, no, because the problem says he spends 3500 and saves 12.5% of his income. So the 3500 is the amount he spends, which is 87.5% of his income.\n\nWait, another way to think: Let's say his income is I. He saves 12.5% of I, so his savings are (12.5/100)*I. Then his spending is I minus that saving, which is I - (12.5/100)*I = (87.5/100)*I. And that equals 3500.\n\nSo (87.5/100) * I = 3500. Multiply both sides by 100 to get 87.5I = 350000. Then divide both sides by 87.5.\n\nSo 350000 / 87.5 equals I. Let me compute that. 87.5 times what is 350000.\n\nAlternatively, 350000 divided by 87.5. Let me think: 87.5 * 4000 = 350,000 because 87.5 * 4000. Because 87.5 times 100 is 8750, so 8750 * 40 is 350,000. Oh right, so yes, 4000 is the income.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C, Rs. 4000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the man's monthly income, we know he spends Rs. 3500 and saves 12.5% of his income.

Oh right, because income minus savings equals expenditure. So if I can find out what percentage he's spending, maybe I can calculate his total income.\n\nWait, 12.5% is the same as 1/8, right? Because 12.5 multiplied by 8 is 100. So 12.5% is 1/8.
