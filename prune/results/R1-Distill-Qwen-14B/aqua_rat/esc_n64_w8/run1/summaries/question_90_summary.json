      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a book being sold and calculating profit or loss percentages. Let me try to work through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the first part says the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. I need to find out the cost price, right? Because once I have that, I can see what happens if it's sold for a different price, like Rs 25.75.\n\nSo, profit is always calculated on the cost price, right? So the selling price is cost price plus 10% of cost price. Let me write that down. \n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So, the selling price (SP) when there's a 10% profit would be SP = CP + 10% of CP. That can be written as SP = CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nWe know the SP in this case is 27.50. So, 27.50 = 1.1 * CP. To find CP, I can divide both sides by 1.1. \n\nLet me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 27.5 divided by 1.1. Well, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5 because 25 times 1 is 25 and 25 times 0.1 is 2.5, so 25+2.5=27.5. So CP is 25. Oh wait, wait, 27.50 divided by 1.1. Let me do it more accurately. 27.50 /1.1 is 25, yes. Because 1.1 * 25 is 27.5. So CP is Rs 25.\n\nNow, the second part of the question says if the book was sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage. So, the new selling price is 25.75. We need to compare this to the cost price, which is 25.\n\nSo, the selling price is less than the cost price? Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25. Oh wait, 25.75 is more than 25. So the selling price is higher than CP. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25? Wait, 25 is 25, and 25.75 is 25 and 3/4, which is 25.75. So it's higher than 25. So, if the selling price is higher than cost price, that's a profit. Wait, but wait a minute, because the cost price is 25, and selling it for 25.75 would give a profit. So, why are the options including loss? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The initial selling price was 27.50, which was a 10% profit, so CP is 25. Now, if the book is sold for 25.75, which is higher than 25, so profit. So the profit amount is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So the profit is 0.75.\n\nNow, the profit percentage is (Profit / CP) * 100. So (0.75 / 25) *100. Let me compute that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So profit is 3%. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, but option D is 3% loss. Wait, but in this case, selling price is higher than cost, so profit. So the answer should be 3% profit, which is option B. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, wait, no! Wait, I'm getting confused. Because 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25, so that's a profit. So the profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So the correct answer would be option B, 3% profit. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. So that's the answer. But wait, wait, the question says \"then would have been percentage of profit and loss\". So perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, wait a second. Did I mix up the numbers? Because 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit. So 3% profit. So the correct option is B. But wait, let me see what the options are again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)2% Profit\n\nB)3% Profit\n\nC)2% Loss\n\nD)3% Loss\n\nE)4% Loss.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is B, 3% profit. But wait, the initial problem statement says when sold for 27.50, it's a 10% profit. So the cost price is 25. Now, if it's sold for 25.75, which is higher than 25, so profit. So profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So yes, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. 25.75 is the selling price. So, the cost price is 25, so 25.75 is 0.75 more. So profit is 0.75, which is 3% of cost. So 3% profit. So option B.\n\nWait, but I'm looking at the options, and the options given in the problem are A to E, with B being 3% profit. So that's the correct choice. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, another thought. Did I calculate correctly? Let me recheck the numbers. \n\nFirst, cost price is 25, as 27.50 is 10% profit. So 25 * 1.1 = 27.50. Correct. Now, selling price is 25.75. So the difference is 25.75 -25 = 0.75. So profit is 0.75. \n\nProfit percentage is (0.75 /25)*100 = 3%. So yes, 3% profit. So the correct answer is B.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Wait, the problem says, \"if it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So, is 25.75 more than cost price? Yes, so profit. So 3% profit, which is option B.\n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of cost price. Let me double-check that. \n\nWe have SP = 27.50, profit 10%. So, SP = CP * (1+10/100) \u2192 27.50 = CP * 1.1 \u2192 CP = 27.50 /1.1 = 25. Correct. So yes, CP is 25.\n\nSo, when sold for 25.75, which is higher than 25, it's a profit. So profit amount is 0.75. So percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So the answer is B, 3% profit.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but why is option E 4% loss? Maybe I confused the numbers. Let me think again. Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so profit. So no loss. So options C, D, E are loss, which can't be correct. So the answer must be A or B. Since 3% is higher, B is correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. Profit is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price (SP) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{100}) = \\text{CP} \\times 1.1\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\text{SP} = 27.50\\), we can solve for \\(\\text{CP}\\):\n\n\\[\n27.50 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.1 \\implies \\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.\n\nNext, we consider the second scenario where the book is sold for Rs. 25.75. To determine the profit or loss, we compare this selling price to the cost price. The difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{SP} - \\text{CP} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75\n\\]\n\nThe profit percentage is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{0.75}{25}\\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price is higher than the cost price, this represents a profit.

The options are given as A to E, with some profit and some loss options.\n\nHmm, I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So first, I need to find out the cost price of the book. Since selling it at 27.50 gave a 10% profit, that means 27.50 is 110% of the cost price. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 10% profit implies selling price is 110% of cost price. Let me denote the cost price as CP. So, 110% of CP = 27.50. I can write this as 1.10 * CP = 27.50. To find CP, I'll divide both sides by 1.10.\n\nCP = 27.50 / 1.10. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1. Well, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, so 27.50 /1.1 is 25. So, the cost price is Rs 25. Oh wait, that's convenient.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem says the book was sold for Rs 25.75. I need to find if this is a profit or loss compared to the cost price. So, let's see: the selling price (SP) is 25.75, and the cost price is 25.\n\nWait, so if SP is 25.75 and CP is 25, then the profit is 25.75 -25 = 0.75 Rs. Oh, but wait, wait. No, wait a second. If the selling price is less than the cost price, that's a loss. Because in the first case, 27.50 was higher than 25, so profit. Now, 25.75 is higher than 25, right? No, wait, 25.75 is higher than 25? Because 25 is 25.00, and 25.75 is 25 and 75 paise. Oh, so 25.75 is higher than 25. So that would be a profit, not a loss. Wait, but looking at the options, some are profit, some are loss. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so selling at 25.75 would be a profit. But wait, the first selling price was 27.50 with 10% profit. So, the cost is 25. Selling at 25.75 would be 25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. So profit amount is 0.75.\n\nWait, but the options don't have a 3% profit or something. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss. So I have to calculate the percentage based on the cost price.\n\nSo the formula for profit percentage is (Profit / CP) *100. Here, profit is 0.75, CP is 25. So (0.75 /25)*100. Let's calculate that.\n\n0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So the profit is 3%. So the answer should be B)3% Profit. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up profit and loss.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because the second selling price is 25.75, which is higher than CP 25. So that's a profit. So profit amount is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So yeah, 3% profit. So the correct option is B.\n\nWait a second, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, the first time, 27.50 is 10% profit. So that's correct. Now, the second time, selling price is 25.75. Oh wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, but higher than 25. So it's a profit but less than 10%. Let me recheck the numbers.\n\nCost price is 25. Selling at 25.75 gives a profit of 0.75. 0.75 /25 is 0.03, which is 3% profit. So option B is correct.\n",

So that's correct. Now, the second time, selling price is 25.75. Oh wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, but higher than 25. So it's a profit but less than 10%. Let me recheck the numbers.\n\nCost price is 25. Selling at 25.75 gives a profit of 0.75. 0.75 /25 is 0.03, which is 3% profit. So option B is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the cost price (CP) of the book. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, meaning the selling price is 110% of the CP. Let the CP be denoted as \\( CP \\). Using the formula:\n\n\\[\n1.10 \\times CP = 27.50\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( CP \\):\n\n\\[\nCP = \\frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the second scenario where the book is sold for Rs 25.75. The selling price (SP) is now 25.75, and the CP is 25. Since SP > CP, this results in a profit. The profit amount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \\, \\text{Rs}\n\\]\n\nTo calculate the profit percentage, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{CP} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.75}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, selling the book for Rs 25.75 results in a 3% profit. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**B) 3% Profit**\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, I need to figure out what the percentage would be if the price were changed.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. So first, I think I should find out the cost price of the book. Because once I know that, I can see what happens when it's sold for Rs 25.75.\n\nWait, right. Profit is calculated on the cost price. So if selling price is 27.50 and that's after a 10% profit, then the cost price must be less than 27.50. How do I calculate that?\n\nI remember that selling price (SP) is equal to cost price (CP) plus profit. Profit is 10% of CP. So SP = CP + (10% of CP) which is the same as SP = CP * (1 + 0.10) = 1.10 * CP.\n\nSo, to find CP, I can rearrange that: CP = SP / 1.10. Plugging in the numbers, CP = 27.50 / 1.10.\n\nLet me do that division. 27.5 divided by 1.1... Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5 because 1.1 * 25 = 27.5. Oh right, so CP is 25 rupees. Got it.\n\nNow, the second part. If the book is sold for 25.75, what's the profit or loss? Well, the cost price is 25, and the selling price is 25.75. Wait, that's higher than the cost? No, wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, but is it more or less than the cost?\n\nWait, the cost is 25. So 25.75 is higher than 25. So selling at 25.75 would be a profit, right? Because SP > CP.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 25.75 is more than 25, yes. So it's a profit. So the profit amount would be 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 rupees.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. No, wait. If the cost is 25, and it's sold for 25.75, that's a profit of 0.75. So profit percentage is (profit / CP) * 100.\n\nSo, profit is 0.75, so (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let me calculate that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So that would be a 3% profit. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because 25.75 is less than the original selling price of 27.50. Wait, but the cost is 25, so 25.75 is higher than cost, so profit. Oh, I think I'm right.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the options are about whether it's a profit or loss. So the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, so according to my calculation, the profit is 3%. So option B)3% Profit.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because the selling price went down from 27.50 to 25.75. So the selling price decreased. But compared to the cost, which is 25, 25.75 is higher. So it's still a profit, but a smaller one than before.\n\nWait, the original profit was 10%, which was 2.50 (because 25*0.10=2.50). Now, the new profit is 0.75. So 0.75 is 3% of 25. So yeah, the answer should be 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure. Because sometimes, when the price is lower, but still above cost, it's a profit. So in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit. The percentage is 3% as I calculated.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have E as a profit. Wait, looking again: options are A, B, C, D, E. A is 2% profit, B 3% profit, C is 2% loss, D 3% loss, E 4% loss.\n\nWait, so according to my calculation, it's a 3% profit. So the correct option is B.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. Because if the cost is 25, and the selling price is 25.75, the profit is 0.75. So 0.75 /25 = 0.03, 3%. So yes, 3% profit.\n\nWait, but another way to think: the difference between 27.50 and 25.75 is 1.75. But that's not directly relevant because that's the change in selling price. But in terms of cost, the profit is based on the cost.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me double-check. The initial SP is 27.50, which is 110% of CP. So CP is 27.50 / 1.10 = 25. That's correct.\n\nSo when SP is 25.75, which is 25.75, which is 25.75 -25=0.75 profit. So 0.75 /25 = 3% profit. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but why is there an option E which is 4% loss? Did I miscalculate something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I mixed up profit and loss. Let me see. If the selling price is lower than cost, that's a loss. But in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so it's a profit.\n\nSo no, the answer is B. 3% profit.\n",

I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So, I need to find the cost price first.\n\nWait, right, profit is calculated on the cost price. So if the selling price is Rs 27.50 and that includes a 10% profit, then the cost price must be less than 27.50. Let's see, how do I find the cost price?\n\nOh right, the formula for selling price is Cost Price plus Profit. And Profit is 10% of the Cost Price. So the selling price (SP) is equal to Cost Price (CP) plus 10% of CP. So SP = CP * (1 + 10/100) which simplifies to SP = CP * 1.1.\n\nSo I can rearrange that to find CP. CP = SP / 1.1. Let me plug in the numbers. SP is 27.50, so CP = 27.50 / 1.1. Hmm, what's 27.5 divided by 1.1? Let me think, 27.5 divided by 1.1 is the same as 275 divided by 11. 11 times 25 is 275, so 275/11 is 25. So CP is Rs 25.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 10% of 25 is 2.5, so adding that gives 27.50. Yep, that checks out.\n\nNow the second part of the question says if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage. So the new selling price is 25.75, which is less than the cost price of 25. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, 25.75 is more than 25, so wait, maybe not. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25? No, wait, 25.75 is actually 25 and 3/4, which is 25.75, but 25.75 is more than 25, right? Because 25.75 is like 25 plus 0.75, so that's higher than 25. So wait, selling at 25.75 would be a profit, not a loss. Or did I get that wrong?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Because the cost price is 25. So if I sell it for 25.75, that's higher than the cost, so it's a profit. So the profit is 25.75 minus 25, which is 0.75. Then, to find the profit percentage, I take (Profit / Cost Price) * 100.\n\nSo profit is 0.75, cost is 25. So (0.75 /25) *100. Let me compute that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100, that's 3%. So that's a 3% profit.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options have both profit and loss options. So if the new selling price is 25.75, which is higher than CP, so profit, right? So the options are A) 2% profit, B)3% profit, etc.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way: sometimes I get confused between profit on cost and selling price, but no, profit percentage is always based on cost. So the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me recheck the initial calculation. The first selling price was 27.50 with 10% profit. So CP is 25. Then, if I sold it for 25.75, which is 25 + 0.75, so profit is 0.75. So 0.75 /25 *100 is 3% profit. So the correct answer is B) 3% profit.

So the answer should be a profit. So B is 3% profit. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe I miscalculated the cost price. Let me re-calculate that.\n\nFirst part: SP is 27.50, which includes 10% profit. So SP = CP * 1.1. So CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. So that's correct.\n\nSecond part: New SP is 25.75. So profit is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So that's a 3% profit, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. But wait, wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So the question is, what would be the profit or loss percentage in that case.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, 25.75 is more than the cost price of 25, so it's a profit, not a loss. So the options A and B are profit options, C-D-E are loss.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B) 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. Because sometimes when I see these problems, sometimes the SP is lower than cost, leading to loss. But in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, the answer is 3% profit, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me calculate the percentage again. 0.75 is the profit. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. 0.03 times 100 is 3%. Yes.\n\nHmm, but wait, looking back at the problem statement. The first SP is 27.50, which is with a 10% profit. So that makes the CP 25. The second SP is 25.75, which is higher than 25, so profit. So the profit is 0.75 on 25, which is 3%.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

Let me recheck the initial calculation. The first selling price was 27.50 with 10% profit. So CP is 25. Then, if I sold it for 25.75, which is 25 + 0.75, so profit is 0.75. So 0.75 /25 *100 is 3% profit. So the correct answer is B) 3% profit. But wait, the options given in the question are:\n\nOptions:\nA)2% Profit\nB)3% Profit\nC)2% Loss\nD)3% Loss\nE)4% Loss\n\nWait, but I thought the second selling price is 25.75, which is higher than CP. So the answer should be a profit. So B is 3% profit. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe I miscalculated the cost price. Let me re-calculate that.\n\nFirst part: SP is 27.50, which includes 10% profit. So SP = CP * 1.1. So CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. So that's correct.\n\nSecond part: New SP is 25.75. So profit is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So that's a 3% profit, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. But wait, wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So the question is, what would be the profit or loss percentage in that case.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Wait, 25.75 is more than the cost price of 25, so it's a profit, not a loss. So the options A and B are profit options, C-D-E are loss.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B) 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. Because sometimes when I see these problems, sometimes the SP is lower than cost, leading to loss. But in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit.\n\nSo the calculation is correct, the answer is 3% profit, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me calculate the percentage again. 0.75 is the profit. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. 0.03 times 100 is 3%. Yes.\n\nHmm, but wait, looking back at the problem statement. The first SP is 27.50, which is with a 10% profit. So that makes the CP 25. The second SP is 25.75, which is higher than 25, so profit. So the profit is 0.75 on 25, which is 3%.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. To find the cost price (CP), we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Selling Price (SP)} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\text{Profit Percentage})\n\\]\n\nGiven the profit percentage is 10%, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\n27.50 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.1\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nNext, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, the profit would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{New SP} - \\text{CP} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75\n\\]\n\nThe profit percentage is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{0.75}{25}\\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the new selling price is higher than the cost price, this represents a profit. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. So the selling price is higher than the cost price by 10%. I think I should find out the cost price first.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the cost price when I know the selling price and the profit percentage? Oh right, the formula is:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + Profit Percentage)\n\nSo the profit percentage is 10%, which is 0.1 in decimal. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\n27.50 = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + 0.10)\n27.50 = Cost Price \u00d7 1.10\n\nSo to find the cost price, I can divide 27.50 by 1.10. Let me do that.\n\n27.50 \u00f7 1.10 = 25. So the cost price is Rs 25. Oh wait, that's interesting because the second selling price is Rs 25.75. Oh, but wait, no, the second selling price is 25.75? Or is that the same as the cost price? Wait, no, the problem says if it were sold for Rs 25.75. So wait, the cost price is 25, and the selling price is 25.75. Hmm, so let me see.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake. So 25 multiplied by 1.1 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1.1 is 27.5. So yes, the cost price is 25. \n\nNow, the second scenario is selling the book for Rs 25.75. So I need to see if this is a profit or a loss compared to the cost price. The cost price is 25, and the selling price is 25.75.\n\nWait, 25.75 is higher than 25. So that would be a profit, right? Because selling price is more than cost. But wait, wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the cost is 25, and the new selling price is 25.75, which is higher than 25. So profit, right? But wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit. But wait, the options include both profit and loss options.\n\nWait, but let me calculate the exact profit or loss. So the selling price is 25.75, cost price is 25. So profit is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. \n\nNow, to find the percentage profit, the formula is (Profit / Cost Price) \u00d7 100. So (0.75 / 25) \u00d7 100. Let me compute that.\n\n0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. So that's a 3% profit. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, and option D is 3% loss. Hmm. Wait, but why would the second selling price be a loss?

So option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Wait, is the second selling price lower than the cost price? Because if the cost is 25, and the new selling price is 25.75, that's higher, so profit. So the answer should be B)3% Profit.\n\nWait, but wait, that's not matching the options given. Let me look again. Oh no, wait, the problem says if it were sold for Rs 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss. Wait, 25.75 is higher than cost price 25, so it's a profit. So the profit is 0.75, which is 3% as I computed. So the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, why am I confused? Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So original selling price is 27.50, which is 10% profit on cost price 25. Now, if sold for 25.75, which is higher than cost, so profit. So profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25.

Or wait, how do we calculate percentage profit or loss?\n\nProfit percentage is calculated as (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So the profit is 25.75 -25 = 0.75. So profit is 0.75. Then, 0.75 / 25 *100 is (0.75/25)*100. Let's compute that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, multiplied by 100 gives 3%. So that's a 3% profit. But wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because 25.75 is lower than the original selling price of 27.50, which was a 10% profit. So selling it for 25.75 is lower than the 10% profit price, but higher than cost, so it's still a profit, just less than before.\n\nWait, but the options include both profit and loss options. The options are:\n\nA)2% Profit\nB)3% Profit\nC)2% Loss\nD)3% Loss\nE)4% Loss\n\nSo according to my calculation, the profit is 3%, so option B. But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because I think I made a mistake. Because 25.75 is 25.75, which is less than the original selling price of 27.50. So compared to the original selling price, but the question is about profit or loss, which is based on cost. So let's double-check.\n\nCost price is 25, correct. Selling price is 25.75. So profit is 0.75. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, which is 3% profit. So that's option B.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A to E, and B is 3% Profit. So the answer would be B.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.\n\n25.75 -25 = 0.75. Profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So yes, 3% profit. So the answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. If the cost is 25, and I sell it for 25.75, that's a profit. But if I had sold it for 25.75 instead of the original 27.50, what's the difference? Oh, wait, the question is asking, \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So, I think the question is asking, compared to the cost, what is the profit or loss percentage when sold at 25.75.\n\nSo that's 3% profit, as I calculated earlier. So the correct answer is B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit. So that's the right choice.\n\n\nTo determine the profit or loss percentage when the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we first need to calculate the cost price (CP). The book was initially sold for Rs. 27.50 with a 10% profit. Since the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{CP} \\times 1.10\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given SP:\n\n\\[\n27.50 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.10\n\\]\n\nSolving for CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.\n\nNext, we consider the new selling price of Rs. 25.75. The profit or loss is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit or Loss} = \\text{New SP} - \\text{CP}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit or Loss} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75\n\\]\n\nSince the new SP is higher than the CP, there is a profit of Rs. 0.75. The profit percentage is then calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.75}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, there would be a 3% profit.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nThe book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. Wait, so the selling price is Rs 27.50, and that includes a 10% profit. I think I need to find the cost price first. Because once I know the cost price, I can see what the profit or loss would be if it's sold for Rs 25.75 instead.\n\nRight, profit is calculated on the cost price, I remember that. So if the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price (CP), because 10% profit. So SP = CP + 10% of CP, which is 1.10 * CP.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: 27.50 = 1.10 * CP. To find CP, I'll divide both sides by 1.10. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.10. Hmm, 27.5 divided by 1.1. Well, 27.5 divided by 1.1 is like 25, because 1.1 times 25 is 27.5. So the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 1.1 times 25 is 27.5. Yep, that's right.\n\nNow, the question says if it were sold for Rs 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage. So the new selling price is 25.75. Let me compare that to the cost price.\n\nSo, cost price is 25, and new SP is 25.75. Wait, so 25.75 is higher than 25? Oh wait, no, 25.75 is less than 27.50 but more than 25? Wait, 25.75 is 25 and 3/4, which is 25.75. So compared to CP of 25, the SP is 25.75. Wait, that's higher than CP. So would that mean a profit or loss?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, if the cost price is 25, and the SP is 25.75, then the selling price is higher than cost. So profit, right? Because selling price is above cost.\n\nWait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the original selling price was 27.50, which was a 10% profit. So the CP is 25. Now, if it's sold for 25.75, that's higher than CP. So that's a profit. But wait, wait, no. Wait, 25.75 is less than 27.50, but higher than 25. So yes, it's a profit, but less than the original 10% profit.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me calculate the difference between SP and CP.\n\nNew SP is 25.75, CP is 25. So profit is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So profit is 0.75. Now, to find the percentage profit, it's (Profit / CP) * 100. So (0.75 / 25) * 100.\n\nCalculating that: 0.75 divided by 25. Let's see, 25 times 0.03 is 0.75. So 3% profit. So the answer would be a 3% profit. So looking at the options, option B is 3% Profit. But wait, wait, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nWait, but wait, wait a minute. Another possibility: maybe I got the cost price wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal SP is 27.50, which is 110% of CP. So CP is 27.50 / 1.10 = 25. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo when sold for 25.75, which is higher than CP, profit. Profit amount is 0.75, so 0.75 / 25 = 0.03, which is 3%. So that would be option B.\n\nBut wait, the options include a 3% loss option, D. Did I make a mistake here? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because 25.75 is more than the cost price, so it's a profit. So the answer must be either A or B.\n\nWait, let me think again. 25.75 is 25.75, CP is 25. So 25.75 is 0.75 above CP. So profit is 0.75.\n\nSo profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So that's a 3% profit. So the correct option is B.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original selling price was higher than 25.75. So in the second scenario, the selling price is lower than the original, but higher than CP. So overall, it's a profit, but smaller than the original 10% profit.\n\nBut the options don't have a 3% profit as an option. Wait, no, option B is 3% profit. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me make a table.\n\nScenario 1:\nCP = 25\nSP = 27.50\nProfit = 2.50 (27.50 -25)\nProfit % = (2.50 /25)*100 = 10%. Which matches the given condition.\n\nScenario 2:\nSP = 25.75\nCP =25\nSo profit is 0.75. Profit % = 3%.\n\nSo the answer should be option B: 3% profit.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm looking at the options again, and the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, etc. So yes, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes profit and loss can be tricky. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when the selling price is lower than the cost, it's a loss. If it's higher, it's a profit. So in this case, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit. So the percentage is 3%.\n\nSo the answer is option B: 3% profit.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a book being sold with a certain profit, and then I need to figure out what would happen if the selling price were different. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. So first, I think I need to find out the cost price of the book. Because without knowing the cost price, I can't figure out what the profit or loss would be in the second scenario.\n\nWait, profit is calculated on the cost price, right? So if selling price is 27.50 and that's after a 10% profit, then the cost price must be less than 27.50. Let me jot this down.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So the selling price (SP) is CP plus 10% of CP. So SP = CP + (10% of CP). Alternatively, SP = CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nSo rearranging that, CP = SP / 1.1. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 27.50 divided by 1.1. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1... Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1 =25, 25 * 0.1 =2.5, together 27.5. So CP is 25 Rs.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that division. 27.50 / 1.1. Another way: 27.50 \u00f7 1.1 = (27.50 * 10) / 11 = 275 /11 = 25. Yeah, that's correct. So cost price is 25 Rs.\n\nNow, the second part says if it were sold for 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage. So the new selling price is 25.75. Comparing that to the cost price of 25, let's see if it's a profit or loss.\n\nSo the cost is 25, and the new SP is 25.75. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25, so that would be a profit, right? But wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So that's a profit. But wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 25.75 is only 0.75 above 25, which is a 3% increase. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, the original cost is 25. The first selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit. Now, if the book is sold for 25.75, which is less than 27.50 but more than 25. So that's a selling price between cost and the original selling price. So the profit would be 0.75 on the cost of 25. So the profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Wait a second, because 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let me calculate that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, times 100 is 3%. So that would be a 3% profit. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, and option C is 2% loss, etc.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, wait. No, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the selling price is 25.75. The cost price is 25. So the profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100=3%. So that would be a 3% profit, which is option B. But wait, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait, I'm getting confused. Because the original selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit. The new selling price is 25.75, which is less than the original selling price but more than the cost price. So that's a profit, but lower than the original profit.\n\nWait, but I thought the cost was 25, so 25.75 is 0.75 above cost. So 0.75 is 3% of 25. So that's a 3% profit. So the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit over cost price. So SP = CP * 1.1. So CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct. So cost price is 25.\n\nNew SP is 25.75. So 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So profit of 0.75. Profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100=3%.\n\nSo the answer should be B)3% Profit. But wait, looking at the options, I see that the options don't include 3% profit as correct. Or do they? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA)2% Profit\n\nB)3% Profit\n\nC)2% Loss\n\nD)3% Loss\n\nE)4% Loss\n\nSo option B is 3% profit. So according to my calculation, that's the answer. But wait, the problem says \"would have been percentage of profit and loss\". So if the SP is 25.75, which is higher than CP, it's a profit.\n\nBut wait, wait, I think I might have a mistake here. Because wait, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So 3% profit.\n\nBut wait, the options have D and E as loss. So maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, SP is 27.50 with a 10% profit. So CP = SP / (1 + profit%). So 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct. So CP is 25.\n\nIf the new SP is 25.75, then the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of CP. So 3% profit, option B.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Maybe the question is the other way around. What if the 25.75 is a loss? Because 25.75 is less than 27.50, but more than 25. So it's a profit.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is more than 25, so profit. So 3% profit is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is asking what if it's sold for 25.75, which is lower than 27.50, so the profit would be less. So perhaps I should calculate the profit based on the new selling price compared to the cost.\n\nWait, no, profit is always calculated on cost price. So the profit percentage is (SP - CP)/CP *100.\n\nSo (25.75 -25)/25 *100 = (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So 3% profit.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)3% Profit. But wait, looking at the options again, I see that option B is 3% Profit, which matches.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the answer would be a loss. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So it's a profit. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\"\n\nSo it's asking what the profit or loss percentage would be when sold at 25.75. Since 25.75 is higher than 25, it's a profit. So 3% profit. So option B.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think if I can approach it another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Find the cost price first.\n\nSP1 = 27.50, profit =10%.\n\nSo SP1 = CP * 1.1 \u2192 CP=27.50/1.1=25.\n\nNow, if SP2 is 25.75, then:\n\nProfit = SP2 - CP =25.75-25=0.75.\n\nProfit percentage = (0.75 /25)*100 =3%.\n\nSo yes, 3% profit, option B.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because the options also include loss percentages. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether 25.75 is a profit or loss.\n\nWait, no. 25.75 is more than the cost price, so it's a profit. So the answer must be a profit of 3%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 3% profit, so that should be correct.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the profit or loss percentage if a book is sold for Rs. 25.75, given that it was originally sold for Rs. 27.50 with a 10% profit. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Cost Price (CP)\nThe selling price (SP) of Rs. 27.50 includes a 10% profit. Profit is calculated on the cost price, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{SP} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\text{Profit \\%})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n27.50 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{CP} = \\frac{27.50}{1.1} = 25 \\, \\text{Rs.}\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Profit or Loss for the New Selling Price (SP)\nThe new selling price is Rs. 25.75. To find the profit or loss, compare this new SP to the CP:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{New SP} - \\text{CP} = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75 \\, \\text{Rs.}\n\\]\n\nSince the new SP is higher than the CP, it results in a profit.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Profit Percentage\nProfit percentage is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit \\%} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{CP}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit \\%} = \\left( \\frac{0.75}{25} \\right) \\times 100 = 3\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIf the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, the profit percentage is **3%**.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a book being sold with a certain profit, and then I need to figure out what would happen if the selling price were different. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. So first, I think I need to find out the cost price of the book. Because without knowing the cost price, I can't figure out what the profit or loss would be in the second scenario.\n\nWait, profit is calculated on the cost price, right? So if selling price is 27.50 and that's after a 10% profit, then the cost price must be less than 27.50. Let me jot this down.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. So the selling price (SP) is CP plus 10% of CP. So SP = CP + (10% of CP). Alternatively, SP = CP * (1 + 10/100) = CP * 1.1.\n\nSo rearranging that, CP = SP / 1.1. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 27.50 divided by 1.1. Let me calculate that. 27.50 divided by 1.1... Hmm, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1 =25, 25 * 0.1 =2.5, together 27.5. So CP is 25 Rs.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that division. 27.50 / 1.1. Another way: 27.50 \u00f7 1.1 = (27.50 * 10) / 11 = 275 /11 = 25. Yeah, that's correct. So cost price is 25 Rs.\n\nNow, the second part says if it were sold for 25.75, what would be the profit or loss percentage. So the new selling price is 25.75. Comparing that to the cost price of 25, let's see if it's a profit or loss.\n\nSo the cost is 25, and the new SP is 25.75. Wait, 25.75 is higher than 25, so that would be a profit, right? But wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So that's a profit. But wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 25.75 is only 0.75 above 25, which is a 3% increase. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, the original cost is 25. The first selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit. Now, if the book is sold for 25.75, which is less than 27.50 but more than 25. So that's a selling price between cost and the original selling price. So the profit would be 0.75 on the cost of 25. So the profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Wait a second, because 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75 / 25) * 100. Let me calculate that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, times 100 is 3%. So that would be a 3% profit. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% profit, and option C is 2% loss, etc.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, wait. No, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the selling price is 25.75. The cost price is 25. So the profit is 0.75. So profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100=3%. So that would be a 3% profit, which is option B. But wait, the options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait, I'm getting confused. Because the original selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit. The new selling price is 25.75, which is less than the original selling price but more than the cost price. So that's a profit, but lower than the original profit.\n\nWait, but I thought the cost was 25, so 25.75 is 0.75 above cost. So 0.75 is 3% of 25. So that's a 3% profit. So the answer would be option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me go back.\n\nOriginal selling price is 27.50, which is a 10% profit over cost price. So SP = CP * 1.1. So CP = 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct. So cost price is 25.\n\nNew SP is 25.75. So 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. So profit of 0.75. Profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100=3%.\n\nSo the answer should be B)3% Profit. But wait, looking at the options, I see that the options don't include 3% profit as correct. Or do they? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, the options are:\n\nA)2% Profit\n\nB)3% Profit\n\nC)2% Loss\n\nD)3% Loss\n\nE)4% Loss\n\nSo option B is 3% profit. So according to my calculation, that's the answer. But wait, the problem says \"would have been percentage of profit and loss\". So if the SP is 25.75, which is higher than CP, it's a profit.\n\nBut wait, wait, I think I might have a mistake here. Because wait, 25.75 is higher than 25, so profit is 0.75, which is 3% of 25. So 3% profit.\n\nBut wait, the options have D and E as loss. So maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the cost price. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, SP is 27.50 with a 10% profit. So CP = SP / (1 + profit%). So 27.50 / 1.1 = 25. Correct. So CP is 25.\n\nIf the new SP is 25.75, then the profit is 0.75, which is 3% of CP. So 3% profit, option B.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Maybe the question is the other way around. What if the 25.75 is a loss? Because 25.75 is less than 27.50, but more than 25. So it's a profit.\n\nWait, no, 25.75 is more than 25, so profit. So 3% profit is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe the question is asking what if it's sold for 25.75, which is lower than 27.50, so the profit would be less. So perhaps I should calculate the profit based on the new selling price compared to the cost.\n\nWait, no, profit is always calculated on cost price. So the profit percentage is (SP - CP)/CP *100.\n\nSo (25.75 -25)/25 *100 = (0.75/25)*100 = 3%. So 3% profit.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)3% Profit. But wait, looking at the options again, I see that option B is 3% Profit, which matches.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the answer would be a loss. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because 25.75 is higher than the cost price of 25. So it's a profit. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\"\n\nSo it's asking what the profit or loss percentage would be when sold at 25.75. Since 25.75 is higher than 25, it's a profit. So 3% profit. So option B.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think if I can approach it another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Find the cost price first.\n\nSP1 = 27.50, profit =10%.\n\nSo SP1 = CP * 1.1 \u2192 CP=27.50/1.1=25.\n\nNow, if SP2 is 25.75, then:\n\nProfit = SP2 - CP =25.75-25=0.75.\n\nProfit percentage = (0.75 /25)*100 =3%.\n\nSo yes, 3% profit, option B.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because the options also include loss percentages. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether 25.75 is a profit or loss.\n\nWait, no. 25.75 is more than the cost price, so it's a profit. So the answer must be a profit of 3%, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 3% profit, so that should be correct.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the profit or loss percentage if a book is sold for Rs. 25.75, given that it was originally sold for Rs. 27.50 with a 10% profit. \n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Cost Price (CP)\nThe selling price (SP) of Rs. 27.50 includes a 10% profit.
