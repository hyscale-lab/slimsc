      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a pen company. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. So, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% of them are defective and rejected. They have a deal to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. They're estimating a 25% overall profit on all the pens they make. The question is asking for the manufactured cost of each pen. The options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, I think I need to figure out how many pens the company actually manufactures because some are defective. So, if 10% are defective, that means 90% are good and are delivered. Wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, the company is delivering 7200 pens. But that's after rejecting the defective ones. So, the 7200 pens are the non-defective ones. So, the number of pens they actually make is more than 7200 because some are defective.\n\nLet me think: if 10% are defective, then 90% are good. So, if G is the number of good pens, then G = 0.9 * Total produced. So, Total produced = G / 0.9. In this case, G is 7200. So, Total produced = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So, they produce 8000 pens in total.\n\nWait, but wait. Because the 7200 pens are what they deliver. So, the 7200 is 90% of the total produced. So, total produced is 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. Got it.\n\nNext, the company sells these 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So, the revenue they get is 7200 * 10. Let me compute that: 7200 *10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nNow, the company's overall profit is estimated to be 25%. Hmm. So, they make a 25% profit on all the manufactured pens. Wait, but wait\u2014do they mean profit on cost or selling price? I think usually, profit is calculated on cost. So, if the cost is C per pen, then total cost is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 25% of the cost, so profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C). Then, the selling price would be cost plus profit. But wait, in this case, the selling price is for the 7200 pens, right? So, the revenue is 72,000. So, that revenue should equal the total cost plus the profit.\n\nAlternatively, profit is 25% on the total cost, so selling price is 125% of the total cost. Let me think:\n\nTotal Revenue = Total Cost + Profit.\n\nProfit is 25% of Total Cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = Total Cost + 0.25 Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because the revenue is from selling 7200 pens, which is 10 each. But the cost is for all 8000 pens. Because the defective ones are part of the production cost but aren't sold. So, the total cost is for 8000 pens.\n\nSo, putting it into equation:\n\nRevenue = 72,000 = 1.25 * (Total Cost)\n\nTotal Cost = (8000 * C). So,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me compute that. 8000 * C is the total cost, multiplied by 1.25 equals 72,000.\n\nWait, let me compute 8000 * C * 1.25 = 72,000.\n\nSo, 8000 * C = 72,000 / 1.25.\n\nWhat's 72,000 divided by 1.25? Let me compute. 72,000 / 1.25 = 57,600.\n\nSo, 8000 * C = 57,600.\n\nThen, C = 57,600 / 8000.\n\nCalculating that: 57,600 divided by 8000.\n\nWell, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? 8000 *7=56,000. 57,600-56,000=1,600. 8000 *0.2=1600. So, 7.2.\n\nSo, C is 7.2. So, the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, the total cost is 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. The profit is 25% of that, which is 14,400. So, the total revenue should be 57,600 +14,400=72,000. Which matches the 7200 pens sold at 10 each, so 72,000. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the cost per pen is 7.2 Rs. Looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So, the answer should be B.\n",

I need to find out the cost to manufacture each pen.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the company sells 7200 pens, but because 10% are defective, they must have produced more than 7200 pens. Because 10% are rejected, only 90% are good and make it to the wholesaler. So, the number of pens actually produced is higher than 7200.\n\nLet me calculate how many pens were actually produced. Let's say the number of pens produced is P. Then 90% of P is 7200. So 0.9 * P = 7200. To find P, I can divide 7200 by 0.9. Let me do that: 7200 / 0.9 equals 8000. So the company produced 8000 pens, but 10% (which is 800 pens) were defective and rejected.\n\nNext, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe company's overall profit is 25%. Profit is calculated on the cost of manufacturing all the pens, right? So the profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let me denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So total manufacturing cost is 8000 * C.\n\nWait, but the profit is based on the total cost. So profit = revenue - cost. And this profit is 25% of the cost. So:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nBut Profit = 0.25 * Cost\n\nSo putting it together:\n0.25 * Cost = Revenue - Cost\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n0.25 * Cost = (72000) - (8000 * C)\n\nLet me solve for C.\n\n0.25 * (8000 C) = 72000 - 8000 C\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Let me correct that. The cost is 8000 * C, and the profit is 25% of that cost. So:\n\nProfit = 0.25 * (8000 * C)\nBut Profit is also equal to Revenue minus Cost. So:\n\n0.25 * (8000 C) = 72000 - (8000 C)\n\nLet me compute 0.25 * 8000. 0.25 is a quarter, so 8000 /4 is 2000. So:\n\n2000 C = 72000 - 8000 C\n\nNow, let's bring all terms with C to one side. So I'll add 8000 C to both sides:\n\n2000 C + 8000 C = 72000\n10000 C = 72000\n\nSo, C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2\n\nWait, that gives C as 7.2. But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake. \n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The cost is 8000 * C, right? The profit is 25% of that cost, so 0.25 * (8000 C).

Looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the profit is 25% on the selling price? No, the question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.\" So profit is on cost. So my initial approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think: Let's denote total cost as TC. TC = 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is 25% of TC. So Profit = 0.25 * TC.\n\nRevenue is 7200 * 10 = 72000.\n\nProfit is Revenue - TC, so:\n\n0.25 * TC = 72000 - TC\n\nAdding TC to both sides:\n\n1.25 TC = 72000\n\nSo TC = 72000 / 1.25 = 57600.\n\nThen, since TC is 8000 * C,\n\n57600 = 8000 C => C = 57600 /8000 = 7.2.\n\nYes, same result.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a pen company's costs and profits. Hmm, I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected. So, if they make a certain number of pens, only 90% are good and can be sold. They have a contract to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler. Each pen is sold at Rs. 10. Their overall profit is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think about the profit part. Profit is usually calculated based on the cost price, right? So, if their profit is 25%, that means they make 25% profit on the cost price for each pen, or maybe on the total cost?\n\nHmm, the problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So, it's probably the total profit over the total cost. So, the total revenue minus total cost equals 25% of the total cost.\n\nBut wait, the revenue comes from the pens they sell, not the ones they produce. Because 10% are defective, so they only get revenue from 90% of the total produced pens.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the company produces N pens in total.\n- Out of these, 10% are defective, so 0.1*N are rejected. That leaves 0.9*N pens that are sold.\n- They have to deliver 7200 pens, which I think is the number of pens they actually sell. So 0.9*N = 7200. So I can solve for N.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the wholesaler is getting 7200 pens, which are the good ones. So, the number of pens produced is higher because 10% are defective.\n\nSo, solving for N: N = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. So they produce 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nNow, the profit is 25% on the total cost. Let's denote the cost price per pen as C. So the total cost for producing all pens is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is calculated as (Revenue - Total Cost) = 25% of Total Cost. So,\n\nRevenue - Total Cost = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = Total Cost + 0.25 * Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nWe know Revenue is 72,000. So,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. 8000 * C is 8000C.\n\nSo,\n\n72,000 = 1.25 * 8000 C.\n\nCompute 1.25 * 8000. 8000 * 1 is 8000, 8000 * 0.25 is 2000, so total 10,000. So,\n\n72,000 = 10,000 C.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 1.25 * 8000 = 10,000? Let me double-check. 8000 multiplied by 1.25. 8000 * 1 is 8000, 8000 * 0.25 is 2000. Adding gives 10,000. Oh, right, that's correct.\n\nSo, 72,000 = 10,000 * C.\n\nSo, solving for C: C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2.\n\nWait, that would be 7.2 per pen. So the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nTotal pens produced: N=8000 (since 0.9*N=7200).\n\nTotal cost: 8000 * C.\n\nRevenue: 7200 * 10 = 72,000.\n\nProfit is 25% on total cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * (8000 C).\n\nThen, Profit = Revenue - Total Cost.\n\nSo,\n\n0.25 * 8000 C = 72,000 - 8000 C.\n\nLet me compute 0.25 *8000: that's 2000.\n\nSo,\n\n2000 C = 72,000 - 8000 C.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2000 C +8000 C =72,000.\n\n10,000 C =72,000.\n\nC=72,000/10,000=7.2.\n\nYes, same result.

So, the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nThe company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. Wait, the profit is on the cost of all the manufactured pens. So, the profit is 25% of the total cost. Let me denote the cost per pen as 'C'. So, the total cost for 8000 pens is 8000 * C.\n\nProfit is calculated as (Revenue - Total Cost) = Profit. And the profit is 25% of the total cost. So, Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nPutting it into an equation: Revenue - Total Cost = 0.25 * Total Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = Total Cost + 0.25 * Total Cost \u2192 Revenue = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nWait, let me write that out. 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C).\n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. 8000C is the total cost. So, 1.25 * 8000C = 72,000.\n\nCalculating 1.25 * 8000C: 1.25 * 8000 is 10,000. So, 10,000 * C = 72,000.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 1.25 times 8000 is 10,000? Let me check. 8000 * 1.25: 1.25 is 5/4, so 8000 * 5/4 = 10,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 10,000C = 72,000 \u2192 C = 72,000 / 10,000 \u2192 C = 7.2.\n\nWait, that's Rs. 7.2 per pen. Looking at the options, option B is Rs. 7.2. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes profit is calculated on cost price or selling price. Oh, in this case, the problem says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". So, profit is on the cost of manufacturing. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, total cost is 8000 * 7.2 = 57,600. Profit is 25% of 57,600, which is 14,400. So, total revenue should be 57,600 + 14,400 = 72,000. Which matches the revenue we calculated earlier. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2, which is option B.\n",

Let me see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and get rejected. So, that means 90% of the pens are good and make it to the wholesaler. The company sells 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the revenue from that sale must be 7200 multiplied by 10, which is 72,000 Rs.\n\nWait, but wait. The company's revenue is only from the 7200 pens they delivered. But since 10% are defective, they must have produced more pens than that. Let me think. If 90% of the produced pens are acceptable, then the 7200 pens represent 90% of the total produced. So, how many total pens did they make?\n\nHmm, math time. Let me denote the total produced pens as T. So, 90% of T is 7200. So, 0.9 * T = 7200. To find T, I can divide 7200 by 0.9. Let me calculate that: 7200 / 0.9 equals 8000. So, they produced 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company's revenue is from selling 7200 pens at Rs.10 each, which is 72,000 Rs. But wait, the question mentions their overall profit on all manufactured pens is 25%. So, they make a 25% profit on the total cost of manufacturing all the pens, including the defective ones.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The profit is calculated based on the total cost, including the cost of all 8000 pens, not just the 7200 that were sold. So, the selling price is only from 7200 pens, but the cost is for all 8000.\n\nLet me denote the cost of manufacturing each pen as C. So, the total manufacturing cost would be 8000 * C. The company's revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs.\n\nThe profit is 25% of the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C). \n\nBut profit is also equal to revenue minus total cost.

Let me add 8000 C to both sides:\n\n2000 C + 8000 C = 72000\n\nWhich gives 10,000 C = 72,000\n\nSo, C = 72,000 / 10,000 = 7.2 Rs.\n\nWait, so the cost per pen is Rs.7.2? Let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal produced pens: 8000. Cost per pen: 7.2. So total cost is 8000 *7.2 = 57,600 Rs.\n\nRevenue is 72,000 Rs. So profit is 72,000 -57,600 =14,400 Rs.\n\nNow, profit is 25% of total cost. 25% of 57,600 is 0.25 *57,600=14,400. Yes, that matches.

But wait, wait. The 7200 pens are the ones they're delivering. But because 10% are defective, the actual number they produce must be more than 7200. Because for every 100 pens they make, 10 are bad, so 90 are good. So, the number they need to produce to end up with 7200 good ones is 7200 divided by 0.9, right? Let me calculate that: 7200 / 0.9 is 8000. So they make 8000 pens, but only 7200 are good and sold.\n\nThe company sells each pen for Rs. 10. So, the total revenue from the sale would be 7200 pens multiplied by 10 rupees. Let's compute that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 rupees. \n\nNow, the company's overall profit is 25%. Profit is calculated on the cost, I think. So, the profit is 25% of the total cost. That means the selling price is 125% of the cost. But wait, are we considering the cost per pen or the total cost? Let me think.\n\nLet's denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So, the total manufacturing cost for all pens (including the defective ones) would be 8000 * C. The company's total revenue is 72,000, which gives a profit of 25% on the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * total cost. \n\nAlternatively, the selling price is cost plus 25% profit. So, total revenue equals total cost plus 25% of total cost. That is, revenue = 1.25 * total cost. \n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). Let me write that equation: 72000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). \n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. 8000*C multiplied by 1.25 equals 72,000. So, 8000*C = 72000 / 1.25. Let's calculate that. 72000 divided by 1.25 is the same as 72000 * (4/5), since 1.25 is 5/4. 72000 * 4 is 288000, divided by 5 is 57,600. So, 8000*C = 57,600. \n\nThen, solving for C, we divide both sides by 8000. 57,600 / 8000. Let me see: 57600 divided by 8000. 8000 goes into 57600 how many times? 8000 *7 is 56,000. 57,600 minus 56,000 is 1,600. 8000 *0.2 is 1,600. So, 7.2. So, C is 7.2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, if the cost per pen is 7.2, then the total cost for 8000 pens is 8000 *7.2= 57,600. The revenue is 72,000. So, profit is 72,000 -57,600=14,400. The profit percentage is (14,400 /57,600)*100% = 25%. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the cost per pen is 7.2, which is option B.\n",

Because for every 100 pens they make, 10 are bad, so 90 are good. So, the number they need to produce to end up with 7200 good ones is 7200 divided by 0.9, right? Let me calculate that: 7200 / 0.9 is 8000. So they make 8000 pens, but only 7200 are good and sold.\n\nThe company sells each pen for Rs. 10. So, the total revenue from the sale would be 7200 pens multiplied by 10 rupees. Let's compute that: 7200 * 10 = 72,000 rupees. \n\nNow, the company's overall profit is 25%. Profit is calculated on the cost, I think. So, the profit is 25% of the total cost. That means the selling price is 125% of the cost. But wait, are we considering the cost per pen or the total cost? Let me think.\n\nLet's denote the manufacturing cost per pen as C. So, the total manufacturing cost for all pens (including the defective ones) would be 8000 * C. The company's total revenue is 72,000, which gives a profit of 25% on the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * total cost. \n\nAlternatively, the selling price is cost plus 25% profit. So, total revenue equals total cost plus 25% of total cost. That is, revenue = 1.25 * total cost. \n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). Let me write that equation: 72000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C). \n\nLet me compute 8000 * C first. 8000*C multiplied by 1.25 equals 72,000. So, 8000*C = 72000 / 1.25. Let's calculate that. 72000 divided by 1.25 is the same as 72000 * (4/5), since 1.25 is 5/4. 72000 * 4 is 288000, divided by 5 is 57,600. So, 8000*C = 57,600. \n\nThen, solving for C, we divide both sides by 8000. 57,600 / 8000. Let me see: 57600 divided by 8000. 8000 goes into 57600 how many times? 8000 *7 is 56,000. 57,600 minus 56,000 is 1,600. 8000 *0.2 is 1,600. So, 7.2. So, C is 7.2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, if the cost per pen is 7.2, then the total cost for 8000 pens is 8000 *7.2= 57,600. The revenue is 72,000. So, profit is 72,000 -57,600=14,400. The profit percentage is (14,400 /57,600)*100% = 25%. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the cost per pen is 7.2, which is option B.\n\n\nThe company produces pens with a 10% defect rate, meaning only 90% of the pens are good. To deliver 7200 good pens, the total number of pens produced must be \\( \\frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \\). Each pen is sold for Rs. 10, so the total revenue is \\( 7200 \\times 10 = 72,000 \\) rupees. The company's profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost, which means the selling price is 125% of the total cost. \n\nLet the manufacturing cost per pen be \\( C \\). The total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is \\( 8000 \\times C \\). The revenue equation becomes:\n\\[\n72,000 = 1.25 \\times (8000 \\times C)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n8000 \\times C = \\frac{72,000}{1.25} = 57,600\n\\]\n\\[\nC = \\frac{57,600}{8000} = 7.2\n\\]\nThus, the manufacturing cost per pen is Rs. 7.2. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a pen company. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the company produces pens, and on average, 10% are defective and rejected. They deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The company's overall profit is estimated to be 25%. I need to find the manufactured cost of each pen.\n\nWait, so the first thing I should probably figure out is how many pens the company actually produces because not all of them make it to the wholesaler. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% are good. So, if they're delivering 7200 pens, that's the number of good pens. So the total produced must be higher. Let me calculate that.\n\nLet me denote the total produced pens as P. Since 90% are good, 0.9 * P = 7200. So, P = 7200 / 0.9. Let's compute that: 7200 divided by 0.9. Hmm, 7200 / 0.9 is the same as 7200 * (10/9) which is 8000. So they produce 8000 pens in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says the company delivers 7200 pens, which are the non-defective ones. So the total number they make is 8000.\n\nNow, the company sells these 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the revenue from sales is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000.\n\nBut the company's overall profit is 25%. Hmm, wait, what does that mean? Profit is calculated on the cost price. So the profit is 25% of the total cost. So, profit = 0.25 * total cost. Therefore, the selling price is equal to the cost plus 25% of the cost, which is 1.25 * cost.\n\nWait, but wait. The selling price they have is Rs. 72,000, but that's just the revenue. The total cost would be the cost to produce all the pens, including the defective ones, right? Because the defective pens are part of the production cost.\n\nSo, let me denote the cost per pen as C. So the total cost for producing 8000 pens is 8000 * C.\n\nThe selling price is Rs. 72,000, which is their revenue. Their cost is 8000 * C. Their profit is 25% on the cost, so profit = 0.25 * (8000 * C). \n\nSo, the selling price should be equal to cost plus profit. So:\n\nSelling Price = Cost + Profit\n72000 = (8000 * C) + (0.25 * 8000 * C)\n72000 = 8000 * C * (1 + 0.25)\n72000 = 8000 * C * 1.25\n\nWait, let me compute that. 8000 * 1.25 is 10,000. So 72000 = 10000 * C. So, C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2. So the cost per pen is Rs. 7.2. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If each pen costs Rs.7.2, then 8000 pens cost 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. Their revenue is 72,000, so profit is 72,000 -57,600 = 14,400. Now, 14,400 divided by 57,600 is 0.25, which is 25%. That checks out.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way: the profit is 25% on all manufactured pens. So, the selling price is 125% of the cost. So, total selling price is 1.25 * total cost.\n\nSo, 72,000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C) \u2192 72,000 /1.25 = 8000 * C \u2192 57,600 = 8000 * C \u2192 C =57,600 /8000=7.2. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, looking at the options, option B is 7.2. So the answer should be B.\n",
