      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains leaving from the same station, Mumbai Central, heading to Lucknow. I need to find out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, let's see.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, but faster at 72 kmph. They're on the same route, so I guess they're on the same tracks moving in the same direction. Wait, but if they're moving in the same direction, the faster one will catch up to the slower one. So, the question is, when does that happen?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, maybe they're moving towards each other? No, the question says same route, so same direction. So Train B is behind Train A but faster. So it's a case of catching up.\n\nBut first, I need to figure out how much distance Train A has covered by the time Train B starts moving. Because Train A has a two-hour head start.\n\nSo, the time between 11 am and 2 pm is 3 hours, right? Wait no, 11 to 12 is one hour, 12 to 2 is two, so total 3 hours. So Train A has been moving for 3 hours before Train B starts.\n\nSo in those 3 hours, how far does Train A go? Speed is 40 kmph, so distance = speed * time. So 40 * 3 = 120 km. So Train A is 120 km ahead when Train B starts.\n\nNow, Train B is going faster. The relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds because they're moving in the same direction. So relative speed = 72 - 40 = 32 kmph. That means every hour, Train B closes the gap by 32 km.\n\nSo the distance to cover is 120 km. Time taken to cover that distance at relative speed is time = distance / speed. So 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 32 times 3 is 96, 32 times 3.75 is 120, because 3.75 *32= (3 *32) + (0.75*32)=96 +24=120. So time is 3.75 hours.\n\nWait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So when does Train B start? At 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes to that. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, then plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm. So they meet at 5:45 pm.\n\nBut let me check the options. The options are:\n\nA)12 am next day\nB)5 am next day\nC)5 pm next day\nD)2 pm next day\nE)None of these\n\nWait, 5:45 pm is not an option. The closest is option C, which is 5 pm. So that's 5 pm on the next day? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the next day? Because the meeting happens after 2 pm on the same day, right?\n\nWait, the trains leave on the same day. So 2 pm plus 3.75 hours is same day 5:45 pm. So that's same day, not next day. So the options don't have 5:45 pm. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate. So the head start is 3 hours, so 40 * 3=120 km. Then, the relative speed is 72-40=32 kmph. So time is 120/32=3.75 hours, which is 3h45m. So 2 pm +3h45m is 5:45 pm on the same day. So the options don't include this time. The option C is 5 pm on the next day, which is wrong because it's same day. So the answer is E) None of these.\n",

So Train A has been moving for 3 hours before Train B starts.\n\nSo in those 3 hours, how far does Train A go? Speed is 40 kmph, so distance = speed * time. So 40 * 3 = 120 km. So Train A is 120 km ahead when Train B starts.\n\nNow, Train B is going faster. The relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds because they're moving in the same direction. So relative speed = 72 - 40 = 32 kmph. That means every hour, Train B closes the gap by 32 km.\n\nSo the distance to cover is 120 km. Time taken to cover that distance at relative speed is time = distance / speed. So 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 32 times 3 is 96, 32 times 3.75 is 120, because 3.75 *32= (3 *32) + (0.75*32)=96 +24=120. So time is 3.75 hours.\n\nWait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So when does Train B start? At 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes to that. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, then plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm. So they meet at 5:45 pm.\n\nBut let me check the options.

So that's 5 pm on the next day? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the next day? Because the meeting happens after 2 pm on the same day, right?\n\nWait, the trains leave on the same day. So 2 pm plus 3.75 hours is same day 5:45 pm. So that's same day, not next day. So the options don't have 5:45 pm. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate. So the head start is 3 hours, so 40 * 3=120 km.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving from the same station on the same route, and I need to find out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's read the question again. Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am going to Lucknow at 40 kmph. Train B leaves the same station at 2 pm on the same day, going the same way, but at a faster speed of 72 kmph. I need to find when they'll meet.\n\nWait, so both trains are going in the same direction. That probably means that since B is faster, it will catch up to A eventually. But how do I calculate the time they meet?\n\nI remember that when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So the relative speed here would be 72 kmph minus 40 kmph, which is 32 kmph. That makes sense because B is faster, so it's gaining on A at 32 km every hour.\n\nBut wait, I need to account for the head start that Train A has. Since A left at 11 am and B leaves at 2 pm, that's a 3-hour difference. So in those 3 hours, how far ahead is Train A?\n\nLet me calculate that. Train A's speed is 40 kmph, so in 3 hours, it would have traveled 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when B starts at 2 pm, A is already 120 km away.\n\nNow, the problem becomes how long it takes for B to cover that 120 km gap, moving at a relative speed of 32 kmph. Oh right, because B is moving faster, so the time taken would be the distance divided by the relative speed.\n\nSo time = distance / speed = 120 km / 32 kmph. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 32 is... Hmm, 32 goes into 120 three times because 3*32 is 96. That leaves 24. 24 divided by 32 is 0.75, so 3.75 hours in total. Wait, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. So 3 hours and 45 minutes is the time it takes for B to catch up.\n\nNow, when does that happen? Since B starts at 2 pm, adding 3 hours and 45 minutes to that. Let's see, 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, and then plus 45 minutes makes it 5:45 pm. So they meet at 5:45 pm.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A)12 am next day, B)5 am, C)5 pm, D)2 pm next day, E)none.\n\nOh, wait, option C is 5 pm, but my calculation says 5:45 pm. So 5 pm is the closest option, but is it exactly 5 pm? Or does the time fall somewhere else?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the relative speed approach. Let me think again. Another way to approach it is to set up equations for the distance each train has traveled until they meet.\n\nLet\u2019s let t be the time in hours after 2 pm that train B has been traveling when they meet. Then, during that same time, train A has been traveling for t + 3 hours (since it left 3 hours earlier).\n\nThe distance covered by A is 40*(t+3) km.\n\nThe distance covered by B is 72*t km.\n\nSince they meet at the same point, these distances should be equal. So:\n\n40(t + 3) = 72t\n\nExpanding that: 40t + 120 = 72t\n\nSubtract 40t from both sides: 120 = 32t\n\nSo t = 120 /32 = 3.75 hours. So 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo adding that to 2 pm: 2 pm + 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm.\n\nBut the options don't have 5:45 pm. The closest is option C)5 pm. But wait, maybe I'm supposed to round or perhaps the options are approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question is considering that both are leaving for the same destination, so maybe the meeting point is somewhere along the route, but the time would still be when B catches up.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 5:45 pm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, which would make option E the correct choice.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up the relative speed approach.\n\nWait, the relative speed approach: B is moving at 72, A at 40, so the relative speed is 32. The distance between them when B starts is 120 km. So time to catch up is 120 /32 = 3.75 hours. That's 3h45m. So B starts at 2 pm, so 2 pm plus 3h45m is 5:45 pm. So that's 5:45 pm same day, not next day.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5 pm, which is 30 minutes earlier. So 5:45 isn't an option. Therefore, the correct answer isn't among the options, so the answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try the equation approach again. Maybe I set the equations correctly.\n\nSo, for train A: time is t+3 hours, speed 40, so distance 40(t+3).\n\nTrain B: time is t, speed 72, distance 72t.\n\nSet equal:\n\n40(t+3) =72t \u2192 40t +120 =72t \u2192 120=32t \u2192 t=3.75.\n\nSo yes, 3.75 hours is correct.\n\nSo the meeting time is 2 pm + 3h45m = 5:45 pm. Since none of the options match, the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is 5 pm. So if the meeting time is 5:45 pm, then 5 pm is earlier. But that's not the correct time. So the correct answer is E, none of these.\n",

So the correct answer is E, none of these.\n\n\nTo determine when Train \u2018B\u2019 will catch up to Train \u2018A\u2019, we calculate the relative speed and the time it takes for Train \u2018B\u2019 to close the distance gap created by Train \u2018A\u2019s head start.\n\n1. **Head Start of Train \u2018A\u2019:**  \n   Train \u2018A\u2019 leaves at 11 am, and Train \u2018B\u2019 leaves at 2 pm, giving Train \u2018A\u2019 a 3-hour head start.  \n   Since Train \u2018A\u2019 travels at 40 km/h, the distance it covers in 3 hours is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 40 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 3 \\, \\text{h} = 120 \\, \\text{km}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relative Speed:**  \n   Train \u2018B\u2019 travels at 72 km/h, and Train \u2018A\u2019 travels at 40 km/h. Since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of Train \u2018B\u2019 with respect to Train \u2018A\u2019 is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Relative Speed} = 72 \\, \\text{km/h} - 40 \\, \\text{km/h} = 32 \\, \\text{km/h}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time to Catch Up:**  \n   The time it takes for Train \u2018B\u2019 to close the 120 km gap at a relative speed of 32 km/h is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{km}}{32 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 3.75 \\, \\text{hours} = 3 \\, \\text{hours} \\, 45 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Meeting Time:**  \n   Train \u2018B\u2019 starts at 2 pm.

I need to figure out when they'll meet each other. \n\nAlright, the first thing I remember is that when two objects are moving towards the same destination, the time when they meet depends on their speeds and the head start one has over the other. \n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, and it's faster, going 72 kmph. So, by the time B starts, A has already been traveling for a few hours. I should calculate how much distance A has covered before B starts.\n\nWait, from 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. So in those 3 hours, how far does A go? Let's see, speed is distance over time, so distance equals speed multiplied by time. 40 km/h * 3 h = 120 km. So A is 120 km ahead when B starts.\n\nNow, after 2 pm, both are moving towards Lucknow. But since B is faster, it will catch up. I need to find out how long it takes for B to cover the distance between them, considering their relative speeds.\n\nWait, relative speed. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So B is going 72 km/h and A is 40 km/h. So the relative speed is 72 - 40 = 32 km/h. That makes sense because B is catching up at 32 km every hour.\n\nThe distance to cover is 120 km, right? So time = distance / speed. Time = 120 km / 32 km/h. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 32. Hmm, 32 times 3 is 96, and 32 times 3.75 is 120 because 0.75 *32 is 24, so 96+24=120. So time is 3.75 hours.\n\nWait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So B starts at 2 pm, and adds 3 hours 45 minutes to that. Let me add that up. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm. Then 45 minutes more makes it 5:45 pm. So the trains meet at 5:45 pm. \n\nLooking at the options, I don't see 5:45 pm. The options are 5 pm or 5 am on the next day, etc. So maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, did I miscalculate the time? Let me double-check. 32 km/h, 120 km. 120 /32 is 3.75 hours. That's correct. So 3.75 hours is indeed 3h45m. So 2 pm plus 3h45m is 5:45 pm on the same day, not the next. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5 pm on the next day, which is incorrect. Option E is none of these, which might be the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the direction. Oh wait, both are going towards Lucknow. So yes, same direction. So the relative speed is correct.\n\nSo the meeting time is 5:45 pm on the same day. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C, which is 5 pm, but that's 15 minutes earlier than the actual time. So the correct answer isn't in the options, so the answer should be E) None of these.\n",

So I guess since B is faster, it will catch up to A somewhere on the way.\n\nWait, but when B starts, A has already been traveling for a few hours. Let me calculate how much distance A has covered by the time B starts.\n\nFrom 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. So in those 3 hours, how far does A go? Speed is 40 kmph, so distance = speed \u00d7 time. So 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when B starts at 2 pm, A is already 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed between B and A is the difference in their speeds. Because when two objects move in the same direction, the relative speed is the faster minus the slower. So 72 - 40 = 32 kmph. That means B is catching up to A at 32 kmph.\n\nThe distance between them when B starts is 120 km. So time taken for B to catch up is the distance divided by the relative speed. So time = 120 / 32. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 32 is 3.75 hours. Oh wait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo B starts at 2 pm, and it takes 3 hours and 45 minutes to catch up.

So maybe the answer isn't exactly an option, but let's check if I did everything right.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to think about the time when they meet. Let's denote the time after 2 pm as t hours. In that time, B travels 72t km. A, which started 3 hours earlier, has been traveling for t + 3 hours, so it goes 40(t+3) km.\n\nSince they meet at the same point, their distances from Mumbai Central should be equal. So:\n\n40(t + 3) = 72t\n\nExpanding that: 40t + 120 =72t\n\nSubtract 40t from both sides: 120 = 32t\n\nSo t = 120 /32 = 3.75 hours, same as before. So that's 3h45m.

That makes sense because the faster train is catching up at that rate.\n\nBut wait, Train B starts at 2 pm, which is three hours after Train A left at 11 am. So in those three hours, how far has Train A traveled? Let me calculate that. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 40 kmph times 3 hours is 120 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is already 120 km ahead on the route.\n\nNow, the distance between them at 2 pm is 120 km, and the relative speed is 32 kmph. To find out how long it takes for Train B to catch up, I can use the formula: time = distance / speed. So time equals 120 km divided by 32 kmph. Let me compute that.\n\n120 divided by 32 is... let's see, 32 times 3 is 96, 32 times 3.75 is 120 because 32 * 3 =96, 32*0.75=24, 96+24=120. So that's 3.75 hours. Oh wait, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. So 3 hours and 45 minutes after 2 pm.\n\nAdding 3 hours and 45 minutes to 2 pm. Let's see: 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes makes it 5:45 pm. So they should meet at 5:45 pm. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see that exact time. The options are 5 pm and 5 am the next day. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. 32 kmph for 120 km. Time is 120/32 = 3.75 hours. Which is 3 hours and 45 minutes. So starting at 2 pm, adding 3 hours brings us to 5 pm. Then 45 minutes more makes 5:45 pm. But the options don't have that. So the closest option is 5 pm, option C, but that's 5 pm on the same day, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the options list the times as \"on the next day\" for some. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 12 am next day\nB)5 am next day\nC)5 pm next day\nD)2 pm next day\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, so option C is 5 pm on the next day. But according to my calculation, the meeting time is 5:45 pm on the same day as departure, which is the day they left. So 5 pm same day would be option C only if the meeting is at 5 pm. But according to my calculation, it's 5:45 pm same day, which isn't one of the options. So then the answer must be E, none of these.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the relative speed correctly? Because both trains are moving in the same direction, so yes, the relative speed is 72-40=32 kmph. That part seems right.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the time each train has been traveling when they meet. Let me denote the time after 2 pm as t hours. So, Train B has been traveling for t hours, and Train A has been traveling for t + 3 hours (since it left three hours earlier).\n\nThe distance covered by Train A is 40*(t +3). The distance by Train B is 72*t. They meet when these distances are equal, so:\n\n40(t +3) = 72 t\n40t +120 =72 t\n120 = 32 t\nt=120/32 = 3.75 hours.\n\nSo that's 3 hours and 45 minutes after 2 pm. So 2 pm plus 3h45m is 5:45 pm. So same conclusion as before.\n\nSo the meeting time is 5:45 pm on the same day, which isn't one of the options provided. So the correct answer must be E) None of these.\n",

Hmm, let's see.\n\nTrain A leaves at 11 am, going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, and it's faster\u201472 kmph. So, A has a head start because it left earlier. I think I need to calculate the time each has traveled until they meet.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Maybe find out how much distance A covers before B starts, then figure out how long until they meet after that. Oh right, because while B is catching up, A is still moving forward.\n\nFirst, let's find the time difference between when A and B leave. From 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. So in those 3 hours, A is already moving. At 40 kmph, in 3 hours, A would cover 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when B starts at 2 pm, A is 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, both trains are on the same route, so their speeds are towards each other? Wait, no. They're going in the same direction, right? So B is trying to catch up to A. So the relative speed is the difference between their speeds.\n\nWait, relative speed when moving in the same direction is the faster speed minus the slower one. So 72 - 40 = 32 kmph. That's the speed at which B is closing the gap between them.\n\nSo the initial distance between them when B starts is 120 km. The rate at which B is catching up is 32 kmph. Time taken to meet would be the distance divided by the relative speed.\n\nTime = 120 km / 32 kmph. Let's calculate that. 120 divided by 32 is 3.75 hours. Hmm, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes to that. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm. Plus 45 minutes makes it 5:45 pm.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving Mumbai Central for Lucknow. Let's see, I need to figure out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, okay, I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, Train A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, and it's faster, going 72 kmph. Both are on the same route, so they'll be moving in the same direction, right? Or wait, no, actually, the problem says they leave for the same destination, so maybe they are on the same track, moving in the same direction. So, Train B is chasing Train A.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, if they're both going from Mumbai Central to Lucknow, they're moving in the same direction. So Train B is behind Train A, and it's faster, so it will catch up. But I need to find the time when they meet.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start Train A has. Since it leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, that's a 3-hour difference. So in those 3 hours, how far ahead is Train A?\n\nTrain A's speed is 40 km/h. So in 3 hours, it would have covered 40 * 3 = 120 km. So the distance between them when Train B starts is 120 km.\n\nNow, Train B is going faster. So the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is 72 - 40 = 32 km/h. So every hour, Train B is closing the gap by 32 km.\n\nSo the distance to cover is 120 km at a relative speed of 32 km/h. Time taken would be distance divided by speed: 120 / 32. Let me calculate that.\n\n120 divided by 32. Hmm, 32 times 3 is 96, 32 times 3.75 is 120 because 32*3=96, 32*0.75=24, 96+24=120. So 3.75 hours. Wait, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. So 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes to 2 pm would be 5:45 pm. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C)5 pm on the next day. Wait, no.

So the answer isn't among them. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nTime taken for B to catch up: 120 km / (72-40) km/h = 120 /32 = 3.75 hours, which is 3 hours 45 minutes. So Train B leaves at 2 pm, so adding 3h45m: 2 pm +3h is 5 pm, plus 45m is 5:45 pm. So the meeting time is 5:45 pm same day. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, looking again, the options are:\n\nA)12 am next day \u2192 same as midnight, so 12 hours later.\n\nB)5 am next day \u2192 5 am is 17 hours after 11 am.\n\nWait, no, the start time for Train A is 11 am, so 5 am next day would be 16 hours later, but perhaps I should calculate from when each starts.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me model the positions of both trains over time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 2 pm (when Train B starts). Then:\n\nPosition of Train B is 72 * t.\n\nPosition of Train A is 40*(t + 3) because it left 3 hours earlier.\n\nThey meet when positions are equal: 72t = 40(t+3).\n\nSo 72t = 40t + 120 \u2192 32t = 120 \u2192 t=3.75 hours \u2192 3h45m.\n\nSo at 2 pm +3h45m=5:45 pm same day.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about two trains leaving Mumbai Central for Lucknow. Let's see, I need to figure out when they'll meet each other. Hmm, okay, I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, Train A leaves at 11 am going at 40 kmph. Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, and it's faster, going 72 kmph. Both are on the same route, so they'll be moving in the same direction, right? Or wait, no, actually, the problem says they leave for the same destination, so maybe they are on the same track, moving in the same direction. So, Train B is chasing Train A.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, if they're both going from Mumbai Central to Lucknow, they're moving in the same direction. So Train B is behind Train A, and it's faster, so it will catch up. But I need to find the time when they meet.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start Train A has. Since it leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, that's a 3-hour difference. So in those 3 hours, how far ahead is Train A?\n\nTrain A's speed is 40 km/h. So in 3 hours, it would have covered 40 * 3 = 120 km. So the distance between them when Train B starts is 120 km.\n\nNow, Train B is going faster. So the relative speed between them is the difference in their speeds. Because they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed is 72 - 40 = 32 km/h. So every hour, Train B is closing the gap by 32 km.\n\nSo the distance to cover is 120 km at a relative speed of 32 km/h. Time taken would be distance divided by speed: 120 / 32. Let me calculate that.\n\n120 divided by 32. Hmm, 32 times 3 is 96, 32 times 3.75 is 120 because 32*3=96, 32*0.75=24, 96+24=120. So 3.75 hours. Wait, 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. So 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSo Train B starts at 2 pm. Adding 3 hours 45 minutes to 2 pm would be 5:45 pm. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C)5 pm on the next day. Wait, no. Wait, 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm same day, plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm same day. But the options don't have 5:45 pm. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)12 am next day\nB)5 am next day\nC)5 pm next day\nD)2 pm next day\nE)None of these\n\nWait, the options given don't include 5:45 pm same day. So the answer isn't among them. So the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nTime taken for B to catch up: 120 km / (72-40) km/h = 120 /32 = 3.75 hours, which is 3 hours 45 minutes. So Train B leaves at 2 pm, so adding 3h45m: 2 pm +3h is 5 pm, plus 45m is 5:45 pm. So the meeting time is 5:45 pm same day. But the options don't have that.\n\nWait, looking again, the options are:\n\nA)12 am next day \u2192 same as midnight, so 12 hours later.\n\nB)5 am next day \u2192 5 am is 17 hours after 11 am.\n\nWait, no, the start time for Train A is 11 am, so 5 am next day would be 16 hours later, but perhaps I should calculate from when each starts.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me model the positions of both trains over time.\n\nLet t be the time in hours after 2 pm (when Train B starts). Then:\n\nPosition of Train B is 72 * t.\n\nPosition of Train A is 40*(t + 3) because it left 3 hours earlier.\n\nThey meet when positions are equal: 72t = 40(t+3).\n\nSo 72t = 40t + 120 \u2192 32t = 120 \u2192 t=3.75 hours \u2192 3h45m.\n\nSo at 2 pm +3h45m=5:45 pm same day. So the time is 5:45 pm. But the options don't have this. So E is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but option C is 5 pm next day. No, same day. So the correct answer is E) None of these.\n\n\nTo determine when Train \u2018B\u2019 will catch up to Train \u2018A\u2019, we analyze their speeds and the head start of Train \u2018A\u2019.

I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. But wait, in this case, both trains are going to the same destination, Lucknow, so are they moving in the same direction? Oh, right! So if they're on the same route and moving in the same direction, the faster one is behind the slower one. So the faster one will catch up. \n\nWait, the problem says Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B at 2 pm. So Train A has a two-hour head start. Oh right, because from 11 am to 2 pm is three hours? Wait no, wait. 11 to 12 is one hour, 12 to 2 is two hours. So 11 to 2 is three hours. So Train A has a three-hour head start. \n\nSo Train A is going at 40 km/h. So in those three hours, how far has it gone? Let me calculate. 40 km/h times 3 hours is 120 km. So Train A is 120 km ahead when Train B starts at 2 pm.\n\nNow, Train B is faster. Its speed is 72 km/h. So the relative speed between Train B and Train A is the difference, because they're moving in the same direction. So 72 - 40 = 32 km/h. That's the speed at which Train B is catching up to Train A.\n\nThe distance between them when Train B starts is 120 km. So the time it takes for Train B to catch up is the distance divided by the relative speed. So 120 km divided by 32 km/h. Let me do that division. 120 / 32 is equal to... let me think. 32 times 3 is 96, and 32 times 3.75 is 120, because 32 * 3 is 96, 32 * 0.75 is 24, adding up to 120. So 3.75 hours.\n\nHmm, 3.75 hours is equal to 3 hours and 45 minutes. So from when Train B starts at 2 pm, adding 3 hours 45 minutes. Let's see: 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes brings us to 5:45 pm. Wait, but let me double-check. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm. 45 minutes more is 5:45 pm. So the time they meet is 5:45 pm.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 5:45. Let me check the options again. The options are A) 12 am, B)5 am, C)5 pm, D)2 pm, E)None. So 5:45 pm isn't an option. So the closest is option C)5 pm, but wait, that's only 3.75 hours. Or is there a mistake in my calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the relative speed. Oh, wait no, same direction, so subtract the speeds. 72-40=32. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the time is 3.75 hours after 2 pm. 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes is 5:45 pm. So the answer isn't among the options. So then the correct answer would be E) None of these.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the distance or time. Let me double-check. Train A's head start: from 11 am to 2 pm is 3 hours. 40 km/h * 3 = 120 km. Correct. Relative speed: 72-40=32 km/h. Correct. Time to catch up: 120/32=3.75 hours. Correct. So 3.75 hours after 2 pm is indeed 5:45 pm. So none of the options match, so the answer must be E.\n",
