      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. Hmm. It says that an electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then, we need to find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. The options are A)21, B)22, C)20, D)23, E)24.\n\nWait, similar conditions probably mean the same time of day, so the sun's angle is the same. So, the triangles formed by the pole and its shadow, and the tree and its shadow, should be similar triangles. Oh right, similar triangles have proportional sides.\n\nSo, if the pole is 14m and the shadow is 10m, the ratio of height to shadow length is 14:10. That simplifies to... let me think, 14 divided by 2 is 7, 10 divided by 2 is 5. So 7:5. So the ratio is 7/5.\n\nNow, the tree's shadow is 15m. Let me call the tree's height h. So the ratio of h to 15 should be the same as 14:10, which is 7:5. So h/15 = 7/5. To solve for h, I can cross-multiply. 5h = 7 *15. 7 times 15 is... 105. So 5h = 105. Then h = 105 /5. 105 divided by 5 is 21. So h is 21 meters. So the answer should be A)21.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If 14m pole gives 10m shadow, the ratio is 14/10 = 1.4. For the tree, shadow is 15m, so height is 15 *1.4. 15 times 1 is 15, 15 times 0.4 is 6, so total 21. Yep, same answer. So the correct option is A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles from math class. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then it asks for the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. Oh right, similar conditions probably mean the same time of day, so the sun's angle is the same for both, which makes the triangles similar.\n\nSo, I think I can set up a proportion here. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow should be the same as the ratio of the tree's height to its shadow. \n\nLet me write that down. The pole's height is 14 meters and its shadow is 10 meters. So the ratio is 14/10. The tree's shadow is 15 meters, so I can set up the equation 14/10 = tree_height/15.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I get the ratios right. It's height divided by shadow length. So yes, 14/10 equals tree_height/15. \n\nNow, solving for tree_height. I can cross-multiply: 14 * 15 = 10 * tree_height. Let's calculate that. 14 *15 is... 14 times 10 is 140, plus 14 times 5 is 70, so 140+70=210. So 210 = 10 * tree_height. \n\nDivide both sides by 10: tree_height = 210 /10 =21. So the tree is 21 meters tall. \n\nWait, but the options are A)21, B)22, etc. So the answer should be A)21. But wait, let me double-check my math. Because sometimes I might mix up the ratios.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if 14 meters gives 10 meters shadow, then for 15 meters shadow, the tree must be taller than 14 meters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no\u2014because when the shadow is longer, the object's height would be proportionally taller or shorter? Let me think. Since the sun's angle is the same, as the shadow lengthens, the object must be taller. So the tree is taller than the pole. \n\nWait, the pole is 14m for 10m shadow. The tree is 15m shadow, which is longer than 10m, so the tree should be taller than 14m. So when I calculated 21, that's longer than 14, which makes sense. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when the shadow is longer, the object is taller? Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Let me think of it this way: if the shadow is longer, the object must be taller because the sun is lower in the sky. No, wait, actually, no. Wait, no, the sun's angle is the same, so for a given height, a longer shadow would mean a lower sun (more towards the horizon), but in this problem, the conditions are similar, so the angle is the same. So the ratio of height to shadow length is the same. So if the shadow is longer, the object is taller. \n\nSo, if the pole's height is 14 for a shadow of 10, and the tree has a shadow of 15, then the tree's height would be 14*(15/10) = 14 *1.5 =21. So yes, 21 is correct. So the answer is A)21. \n\nWait, but let me check the cross multiplication again. 14/10 = tree_height/15 \u2192 tree_height = (14*15)/10 \u2192 (210)/10=21.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about electric poles and trees casting shadows. Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles from math class. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then it asks for the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. Oh right, similar conditions probably mean the same time of day, so the sun's angle is the same for both, which makes the triangles similar.\n\nSo, I think I can set up a proportion here. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow should be the same as the ratio of the tree's height to its shadow. \n\nLet me write that down. The pole's height is 14 meters and its shadow is 10 meters. So the ratio is 14/10. The tree's shadow is 15 meters, so I can set up the equation 14/10 = tree_height/15.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I get the ratios right. It's height divided by shadow length. So yes, 14/10 equals tree_height/15. \n\nNow, solving for tree_height. I can cross-multiply: 14 * 15 = 10 * tree_height. Let's calculate that. 14 *15 is... 14 times 10 is 140, plus 14 times 5 is 70, so 140+70=210. So 210 = 10 * tree_height. \n\nDivide both sides by 10: tree_height = 210 /10 =21. So the tree is 21 meters tall. \n\nWait, but the options are A)21, B)22, etc. So the answer should be A)21. But wait, let me double-check my math. Because sometimes I might mix up the ratios.\n\nAnother way to think about it: if 14 meters gives 10 meters shadow, then for 15 meters shadow, the tree must be taller than 14 meters. Wait, no, wait.
