      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about figuring out the age of my brother now that I'm 60. Hmm, when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Wait, so when I was 2, he was 1, right? Because half of 2 is 1. \n\nBut wait, that was when I was 2. So how much older am I than my brother? Let me think. If I was 2 and he was 1, that means I'm one year older than him. So the age difference between us is one year. So every year that passes, both of us get older by the same amount. So the age difference remains the same.\n\nNow, I'm 60. So if I'm one year older, my brother must be 60 minus 1, which is 59. Oh, wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the ages. \n\nWait, when I was 2, he was 1. So the age difference is 1 year, right. So if I'm now 60, he's 60 minus the age difference. So 60 minus 1 is 59. That would make him 59 now. Looking at the options, option A is 59. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it. Let me set up some equations to double-check. Let's say my current age is I, and my brother's current age is B. The age difference between us is always the same, so I - B = D (a constant). \n\nWhen I was 2, my brother's age was half of mine. So when I was 2, I = 2, and B = 1. So the difference D is 2 - 1 = 1. So D is 1. \n\nNow, I am 60. So B = I - D = 60 - 1 = 59. Yep, that's the same as before. So the answer is A) 59.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. Did I account for the correct time when I was 2? Yes, because when I was 2, he was 1. So the age difference is 1. So regardless of how old I am now, he's always one year younger. So 60 minus 1 is 59. That makes sense.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\" The options are A)59, B)69, C)79, D)89, E)99.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, the key points are the ages when the speaker was 2 and now. I need to find the brother's current age.\n\nFirst, when the speaker was 2 years old, the brother was half their age. So, if I'm 2, my brother is 1. Because half of 2 is 1. That makes sense. So, the age difference between them is 1 year. Because I was 2, he was 1. So, the brother is always 1 year younger than the speaker.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. If I was 2 and he was half my age, that's 1. So the age difference is 2 - 1 = 1 year. So the brother is 1 year younger than me. So when I'm 60, he's 59? Because 60 minus 1 is 59. So that would make option A the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm not so sure. Let me check my reasoning again. So, if I'm 2 now, he's 1. So he's always one year younger. So when I'm 60, he's 59. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about it another way. Let's denote the speaker's age as S and the brother's age as B. So, when S was 2, B was 1. So, the age difference between them is S - B = 2 - 1 = 1. So, the speaker is always 1 year older than the brother.\n\nSo, now, when the speaker is 60, the brother's age would be 60 -1 =59. So, the answer should be A)59.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's say the time when the speaker was 2 years old is in the past. Now, how many years have passed since then? Well, the speaker is now 60, so 60 -2 =58 years ago. So, 58 years have passed.\n\nAt that time, the brother was 1. So now, 58 years later, the brother would be 1 +58 =59. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, both methods give me 59. So, the answer should be A)59.\n\nWait, but why are the other options so much higher? Let me see. The options go up to 99. Maybe I'm making a mistake in calculating the age difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with variables to be precise. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the speaker's current age as S =60, brother's age as B.\n\nAt the time when the speaker was 2, the brother was (2/2) =1. So, the difference in their ages is S_t past - B_t past. Let me think in terms of the age difference.\n\nThe age difference between the two is always constant. So, the difference between speaker and brother is 2-1=1. So, the speaker is always 1 year older than the brother.\n\nSo, currently, when the speaker is 60, the brother is 60 -1=59. So, yeah, 59.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. Let's say the speaker is S years old now, and the brother is B years old now. The age difference is S - B =1.\n\nWhen the speaker was 2, that was S-2 years ago. So, the brother's age at that time was B - (S-2) =1 (because the brother was half the speaker's age, which was 2, so 1).\n\nSo, B - (S-2) =1.\n\nBut we also know that S - B =1. So, S = B +1.\n\nSubstituting S into the first equation:\n\nB - ( (B +1) - 2 ) =1.\n\nSimplify the denominator: (B+1) -2 = B -1.\n\nSo, B - (B-1) =1 \u2192 B - B +1 =1 \u2192 1=1.\n\nHmm, that's an identity, which means the equations are consistent, but it doesn't directly give me B's value. But since S is given as 60, S =60.\n\nSo, from S = B +1 \u2192 60 = B +1 \u2192 B=59.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer must be A)59.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nWhen the speaker was 2 years old, the brother was half their age, meaning the brother was 1 year old at that time.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\" The options are A)59, B)69, C)79, D)89, E)99.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, the key points are the ages when the speaker was 2 and now. I need to find the brother's current age.\n\nFirst, when the speaker was 2 years old, the brother was half their age. So, if I'm 2, my brother is 1. Because half of 2 is 1. That makes sense. So, the age difference between them is 1 year. Because I was 2, he was 1. So, the brother is always 1 year younger than the speaker.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. If I was 2 and he was half my age, that's 1. So the age difference is 2 - 1 = 1 year. So the brother is 1 year younger than me. So when I'm 60, he's 59? Because 60 minus 1 is 59. So that would make option A the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm not so sure. Let me check my reasoning again. So, if I'm 2 now, he's 1. So he's always one year younger. So when I'm 60, he's 59. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about it another way. Let's denote the speaker's age as S and the brother's age as B. So, when S was 2, B was 1. So, the age difference between them is S - B = 2 - 1 = 1. So, the speaker is always 1 year older than the brother.\n\nSo, now, when the speaker is 60, the brother's age would be 60 -1 =59. So, the answer should be A)59.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's say the time when the speaker was 2 years old is in the past. Now, how many years have passed since then? Well, the speaker is now 60, so 60 -2 =58 years ago. So, 58 years have passed.\n\nAt that time, the brother was 1. So now, 58 years later, the brother would be 1 +58 =59. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, both methods give me 59. So, the answer should be A)59.\n\nWait, but why are the other options so much higher? Let me see. The options go up to 99. Maybe I'm making a mistake in calculating the age difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this with variables to be precise. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the speaker's current age as S =60, brother's age as B.\n\nAt the time when the speaker was 2, the brother was (2/2) =1. So, the difference in their ages is S_t past - B_t past. Let me think in terms of the age difference.\n\nThe age difference between the two is always constant. So, the difference between speaker and brother is 2-1=1. So, the speaker is always 1 year older than the brother.\n\nSo, currently, when the speaker is 60, the brother is 60 -1=59. So, yeah, 59.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way. Let's say the speaker is S years old now, and the brother is B years old now. The age difference is S - B =1.\n\nWhen the speaker was 2, that was S-2 years ago. So, the brother's age at that time was B - (S-2) =1 (because the brother was half the speaker's age, which was 2, so 1).\n\nSo, B - (S-2) =1.\n\nBut we also know that S - B =1. So, S = B +1.\n\nSubstituting S into the first equation:\n\nB - ( (B +1) - 2 ) =1.\n\nSimplify the denominator: (B+1) -2 = B -1.\n\nSo, B - (B-1) =1 \u2192 B - B +1 =1 \u2192 1=1.\n\nHmm, that's an identity, which means the equations are consistent, but it doesn't directly give me B's value. But since S is given as 60, S =60.\n\nSo, from S = B +1 \u2192 60 = B +1 \u2192 B=59.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the answer must be A)59.\n\n\nWhen the speaker was 2 years old, the brother was half their age, meaning the brother was 1 year old at that time. The age difference between the speaker and the brother is therefore 1 year, with the speaker being older. \n\nNow, the speaker is 60 years old. Since the age difference remains constant, the brother's current age is \\( 60 - 1 = 59 \\). \n\nTo confirm, the age difference is always 1 year, and when the speaker was 2, 58 years had passed since the brother was 1.
