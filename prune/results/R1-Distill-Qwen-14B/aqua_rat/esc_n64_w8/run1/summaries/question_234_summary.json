      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about simple interest, and I need to figure out the rate of interest per annum. Let me see... I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. \n\nThe problem says that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university. So, the principal P is 5000. The interest they got after 3 years is Rs. 300. So, I is 300. The time T is 3 years. I need to find R, the rate of interest.\n\nWait, the formula is I = P * R * T. So rearranging that to solve for R, it would be R = I / (P * T). Right, because I can divide both sides by P*T to get R by itself.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, I is 300, P is 5000, T is 3. So R = 300 / (5000 * 3). Let me calculate that denominator first: 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15,000. Then 300 divided by 15,000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15k is 0.02. Oh wait, 0.02 is 2%, because to get percentage you multiply by 100. So 0.02 * 100 is 2%. \n\nLet me double-check the calculation. 5000 * 3 is 15,000. 300 divided by 15,000 is indeed 0.02. So that's 2%. Looking at the options, option A is 2%, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, did I get the formula right?

They paid back after 3 years and the interest was Rs. 300. I need to find the annual rate of interest. The options are given, but I'll try to solve it without guessing.\n\nWait, simple interest. Oh right, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time in years.\n\nSo, I know I is 300, P is 5000, T is 3 years. I need to find R. So rearranging the formula, R = I / (P*T). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. I is 300, P is 5000, T is 3. So R = 300 / (5000 *3). Let me calculate the denominator first: 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15000. So 300 divided by 15000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15000 equals... let me think. Well, 15000 divided by 300 is 50, so 300/15000 is 1/50. Oh wait, 1/50 is 0.02. \n\nSo R is 0.02, which is 2%. So the rate is 2% per annum. Looking at the options, option A is 2%, so that should be the answer. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't mix up anything. The formula I used is correct for simple interest, right? Yeah, because simple interest is just principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. So I think I did it right. \n\nAnother way to check: if the rate is 2%, then each year's interest is 5000 * 0.02 = 100. Over 3 years, that's 3 * 100 = 300, which matches the given interest. So yeah, that makes sense.\n",

So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my calculations because 2% seems a bit low, but maybe it's correct. Let me see: 5000 at 2% for 3 years.\n\nCalculating the interest: 5000 * 2/100 = 100 per year. So over 3 years, that's 100 *3 = 300. Yes, that matches. So the rate is indeed 2%, which is option A.\n\nI think I did that right. No mistakes in the calculations. So the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the rate of interest per annum, we use the formula for simple interest:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \\frac{\\text{Principal (P)} \\times \\text{Rate (R)} \\times \\text{Time (T)}}{100}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Principal (\\(P\\)) = Rs. 5000\n- Time (\\(T\\)) = 3 years\n- Simple Interest (\\(SI\\)) = Rs. 300\n\nSubstituting the known values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n300 = \\frac{5000 \\times R \\times 3}{100}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n300 = \\frac{15,000 \\times R}{100}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 = 150 \\times R\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(R\\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{300}{150} = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the rate of interest per annum is \\(2\\%\\). Verifying the calculation: at \\(2\\%\\), the interest for 3 years would be \\(5000 \\times 0.02 \\times 3 = 300\\), which matches the given interest. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",
