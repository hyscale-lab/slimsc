      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The question is: What is the units digit of 9^3 minus 7? And there are multiple-choice options provided. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with units digits, especially in exponents, there are patterns that repeat. So maybe I can find a pattern for 9 raised to different powers and then subtract 7 to find the units digit.\n\nLet me start by calculating 9^3. 9 cubed is 9 multiplied by itself three times. So 9 times 9 is 81, and then 81 multiplied by 9. Let me do that. 81 times 9: 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 720 plus 9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729.\n\nNow, the problem says 9^3 minus 7. So I subtract 7 from 729. Let's calculate that. 729 minus 7 is 722. So the number we're looking at is 722.\n\nThe question asks for the units digit of this result. The units digit is the digit in the one's place, which is the last digit of the number. So looking at 722, the last digit is 2. Therefore, the units digit is 2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes, especially with exponents, it's easier to find the units digit without calculating the entire number. Maybe I can do this by looking at the pattern of the units digit of powers of 9.\n\nI remember that 9 to any power has a units digit that cycles every 2. Let me check:\n\n9^1 is 9. Units digit is 9.\n9^2 is 81. Units digit is 1.\n9^3 would then be 9^2 times 9, so 81 * 9. The units digit here is 1 *9, which is 9. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 81 times 9 is 729. So units digit is 9 again? Wait, no, 9^3 is 729, which ends with 9, but 9^2 is 81, which ends with 1. So the pattern is 9,1,9,1... every even exponent ends with 1, odd with 9? So for 9^3, which is an odd exponent, units digit is 9.\n\nSo, 9^3 has a units digit of 9. Then, subtracting 7 from that. But wait, I'm not sure if I can subtract 7 from the units digit directly. Let me think. Because 9^3 is 729, which ends with 9. So subtracting 7, the units digit would be 9 minus 7, which is 2. So the units digit is 2. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering the units digit of each operation separately. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 9^3 -7.\n\nFirst, find the units digit of 9^3. As I determined earlier, it's 9. Then, subtract 7 from that. So 9 minus 7 is 2. So the units digit is 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be 2. Looking back at the options, option D is 2. So the correct answer is D.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Is there a case where subtracting 7 could cause a borrow from the tens place? Because if the units digit is less than 7, you'd have to borrow, which could change things. But in this case, the units digit is 9, which is greater than 7, so no borrowing is needed. So 9 minus 7 is indeed 2. So the units digit remains 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the problem as (9^3) mod 10, then subtract 7 mod 10, and then take mod 10 again. Let me try that approach.\n\n9 mod 10 is 9. 9^1 mod10 is 9. 9^2 is 81, mod10 is 1. 9^3 is 9^2 *9, so (1 *9) mod10 is 9. So 9^3 mod10 is 9. Then subtract 7: 9 -7 is 2. So mod10, it's 2.\n\nSo that's another way to arrive at the same answer. So I'm confident now that the units digit is 2, which is option D.\n",

So the units digit is 2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I compute 9^3 correctly? Let me double-check. 9*9 is 81, right. 81*9: 80*9 is 720, 1*9 is 9, adding gives 729.

So when you subtract two numbers, the units digit of the result depends only on the units digits of the original numbers. That's because higher digits don't affect the last digit when subtracting, right?\n\nSo, let's start by calculating 9 cubed. 9^3 means 9 multiplied by itself three times. Wait, no, actually, 9^3 is 9 multiplied by 9 multiplied by 9. Let me compute that. \n\n9 times 9 is 81. Then, 81 times 9. Let's see, 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9. Adding those together, 720 +9 is 729. So 9^3 equals 729. \n\nNow, the problem is 9^3 minus 7, which is 729 minus 7. Subtracting 7 from 729. Let's do that: 729 minus 7. Well, 729 minus 1 is 728, so subtracting another 6 (since 7 is 1+6) would take us to 722. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 729 minus 7 is 722? No, wait, 729 minus 7 is 722? Wait, no, wait: 700 plus 29 is 729. Subtract 7, so 729 -7 is 722. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, 722. The units digit is the last digit, which is 2. So looking at the options, option D is 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shortcut. Since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe I don't need to compute the entire 9^3. Let's think: 9 to any power cycles its units digit. Let me remember, 9^1 is 9, 9^2 is 81 (units digit 1), 9^3 is 729 (units digit 9 again?), wait no, wait 9^3 is 729, units digit is 9. So 9^3's units digit is 9.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Wait, 9^1 is 9, units digit 9. 9^2 is 81, units digit 1. 9^3 is 9 * 81 = 729, units digit 9 again. So the pattern is 9,1,9,1,... for each power. So 9^3 has units digit 9. \n\nSo, if 9^3 is 729, units digit 9, then 729 minus 7 is 722, units digit 2. So the answer is 2, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, I could have just focused on the units digit of 9^3, which is 9, and then subtract 7 from that. So 9 minus 7 is 2. So the units digit is 2. That's a quicker way without calculating the entire number. Oh, that's smarter. So regardless of the higher digits, since we're only concerned with the units digit, it's just 9 -7 = 2. \n\nWait, but what if the subtraction causes a borrow? Like, if the units digit after subtraction is less than zero. For example, if it was 3 minus 7, you would have to borrow. But in this case, 9 minus 7 is 2, so no problem.

So when you subtract two numbers, the units digit of the result depends only on the units digits of the original numbers. That's because higher digits don't affect the last digit when subtracting, right?\n\nSo, let's start by calculating 9 cubed. 9^3 means 9 multiplied by itself three times. Wait, no, actually, 9^3 is 9 multiplied by 9 multiplied by 9. Let me compute that. \n\n9 times 9 is 81. Then, 81 times 9. Let's see, 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9. Adding those together, 720 +9 is 729. So 9^3 equals 729. \n\nNow, the problem is 9^3 minus 7, which is 729 minus 7. Subtracting 7 from 729. Let's do that: 729 minus 7. Well, 729 minus 1 is 728, so subtracting another 6 (since 7 is 1+6) would take us to 722. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 729 minus 7 is 722? No, wait, 729 minus 7 is 722? Wait, no, wait: 700 plus 29 is 729. Subtract 7, so 729 -7 is 722. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, 722. The units digit is the last digit, which is 2. So looking at the options, option D is 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shortcut. Since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe I don't need to compute the entire 9^3. Let's think: 9 to any power cycles its units digit. Let me remember, 9^1 is 9, 9^2 is 81 (units digit 1), 9^3 is 729 (units digit 9 again?), wait no, wait 9^3 is 729, units digit is 9. So 9^3's units digit is 9.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Wait, 9^1 is 9, units digit 9. 9^2 is 81, units digit 1. 9^3 is 9 * 81 = 729, units digit 9 again. So the pattern is 9,1,9,1,... for each power. So 9^3 has units digit 9. \n\nSo, if 9^3 is 729, units digit 9, then 729 minus 7 is 722, units digit 2. So the answer is 2, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, I could have just focused on the units digit of 9^3, which is 9, and then subtract 7 from that. So 9 minus 7 is 2. So the units digit is 2. That's a quicker way without calculating the entire number. Oh, that's smarter. So regardless of the higher digits, since we're only concerned with the units digit, it's just 9 -7 = 2. \n\nWait, but what if the subtraction causes a borrow? Like, if the units digit after subtraction is less than zero. For example, if it was 3 minus 7, you would have to borrow. But in this case, 9 minus 7 is 2, so no problem. So the units digit is indeed 2.\n\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(9^3 - 7\\), we can focus on the units digits of the numbers involved, as the units digit of a result depends only on the units digits of the operands.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(9^3\\):**  \n   \\(9^3 = 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729\\).  \n   The units digit of \\(9^3\\) is the last digit of 729, which is **9**.\n\n2. **Subtract 7 from the units digit of \\(9^3\\):**  \n   The units digit of \\(9^3\\) is 9. Subtracting 7 from 9 gives:  \n   \\(9 - 7 = 2\\).  \n   Therefore, the units digit of \\(9^3 - 7\\) is **2**.\n\n3. **Verify with the full subtraction:**  \n   \\(9^3 - 7 = 729 - 7 = 722\\).  \n   The units digit of 722 is indeed **2**.\n\nThus, the units digit of \\(9^3 - 7\\) is **2**, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",
