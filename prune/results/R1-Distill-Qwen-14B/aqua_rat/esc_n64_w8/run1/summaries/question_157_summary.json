      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe problem says: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed?\n\nHmm, okay. So each student picks 2 songs, and each of these 10 songs was selected 5 times. I need to find the number of students. \n\nWait, let me break it down. Each student chooses 2 songs. So for each student, two song selections are made. So if I think about the total number of song selections across all students, that would be 2 multiplied by the number of students. Let me denote the number of students as S. So total selections would be 2S.\n\nNow, each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, right? So each of the 10 songs has 5 selections. So the total number of selections is 10 * 5 = 50. \n\nWait, so 2S equals 50? Because the total selections from all students is 2S, and each song's total is 5, so 10*5=50. So 2S = 50. \n\nOh wait, that makes sense. So solving for S, I divide both sides by 2. So S = 50 / 2 = 25. \n\nSo the number of students would be 25. Looking at the options, option D is 25. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. Each student picks 2 songs. Each song is picked 5 times. 10 songs, so 10*5=50 total picks. Since each student contributes 2 picks, the number of students is 50/2=25. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes there.\n",

So 10 *5=50 selections in total.\n\nSo if each student makes 2 selections, the number of students would be total selections divided by 2.\n\nSo 50 selections divided by 2 per student is 25 students.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 25. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again.\n\nEach student selects 2 songs. So each student adds 2 to the total selection count. So total selections = 2 * number of students.\n\nEach song is selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, so total selections are 10 *5=50.\n\nSo number of students is 50 /2 =25. That's D.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be D)25.\n\n\nTo determine the number of students surveyed, we start by noting that each student selects 2 songs, contributing 2 \"selections\" per student. Since there are 10 songs and each song was selected 5 times, the total number of selections is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\, \\text{songs} \\times 5 \\, \\text{selections per song} = 50 \\, \\text{selections}.\n\\]\n\nSince each student contributes 2 selections, the number of students is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50 \\, \\text{selections}}{2 \\, \\text{selections per student}} = 25 \\, \\text{students}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of students surveyed is **25**, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about a survey where each student picks two songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times, and I need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nWait, so each student selects exactly 2 songs, right? So for each student, they contribute 2 selections. Now, all the songs were each selected 5 times. Oh, so each song was chosen by 5 different students. But wait, each student picks two songs, so each student contributes two 'selections' to the total count.\n\nSo, let me think about the total number of song selections. There are 10 songs, each selected 5 times. So the total number of song selections is 10 multiplied by 5. That's 50, right? Because 10 *5=50.\n\nNow, each student makes 2 selections. So if I have a total of 50 selections, how many students are there? Well, each student contributes 2, so the number of students is 50 divided by 2. 50 /2 is 25. So that would be 25 students.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Each song is chosen 5 times, so each of the 10 songs is picked 5 times. So that's 5 times 10, which is 50. Each student contributes 2 to this total. So 50 divided by 2 is 25. That makes sense. So the answer should be 25, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to look at it? Like, maybe some song selections are overlapping in a way that affects the count? Hmm, no, I don't think so. Because each selection is independent. Each time a student picks a song, it's one of their two choices. So the total across all students is 2 per student.\n\nSo yeah, 50 total song selections, each student contributes 2, so 25 students. So the answer is D)25.\n",
