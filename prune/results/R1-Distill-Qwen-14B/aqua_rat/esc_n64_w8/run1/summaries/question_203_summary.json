      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where a father is dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their ages are 23 and 24, respectively. The goal is to split the amount such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, both will have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons will be receiving their shares now, right? Then, each amount will be invested at 4% compound interest. After three years (because 26 minus 23 is 3 for Mohan, and 26 minus 24 is 2 for Sohan?), wait, no. Wait, Sohan is 24 now, so in two years, he'll be 26. And Mohan is 23, so in three years, he'll be 26. So the time periods are different for each son's investment.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the shares are invested, and they'll receive equal amounts on attaining 26. So when each reaches 26, the investment will have grown, and the amounts should be equal.\n\nSo, the father is dividing 5100 into two parts, say P and Q, where P is Mohan's share and Q is Sohan's. Then, P will be invested for three years, Q for two years, at 4% compound interest. The future values should be equal.\n\nSo, the formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^n, where r is the rate (4%, or 0.04) and n is the number of years.\n\nSo, for Mohan: A1 = P*(1.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A2 = Q*(1.04)^2\nAnd A1 should equal A2.\n\nAlso, P + Q = 5100.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1) P*(1.04)^3 = Q*(1.04)^2\n2) P + Q = 5100\n\nWe can solve for P and Q.\n\nLet me rearrange the first equation. Divide both sides by (1.04)^2.\n\nP*(1.04) = Q\n\nSo, P = Q / 1.04\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. If I have P*(1.04)^3 = Q*(1.04)^2, then dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives P*(1.04) = Q. So Q = P * 1.04.\n\nAlternatively, P = Q / 1.04.\n\nSince P + Q = 5100, substitute Q as 1.04*P into the equation.\n\nSo, P + 1.04 P = 5100\nWhich is 2.04 P = 5100\nSo, P = 5100 / 2.04\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n2.04 * 2500 is 5100, because 2 *2500 is 5000, 0.04*2500 is 100, so 5000 +100=5100. So P would be 2500.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again.\n\nIf P is 2500, then Q is 1.04 * 2500 = 2600. So 2500 + 2600 = 5100. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo, Mohan's share is P = 2500, Sohan's is 2600.\n\nBut wait, I thought the time periods were different. So, Mohan is getting P, which will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's Q is invested for 2 years. But their future values are equal.\n\nWait, let me plug in the numbers.\n\nP = 2500, invested for 3 years at 4%:\n\nA1 = 2500 * (1.04)^3.\n\nLet me compute (1.04)^3.\n\n1.04^1 = 1.04\n1.04^2 = 1.0816\n1.04^3 = 1.124864\n\nSo, A1 = 2500 * 1.124864 \u2248 2500 * 1.124864.\n\n2500 * 1.12 is 2800, 2500 * 0.004864 is 12.16. So total is approximately 2812.16.\n\nFor Sohan, Q=2600, invested for 2 years:\n\nA2 = 2600 * (1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\nSo, 2600 * 1.0816.\n\n2600 * 1.08 = 2808, and 2600 * 0.0016=4.16. So total is 2808 +4.16=2812.16.\n\nYes, that matches. So the future amounts are equal.\n\nSo, according to this, P is 2500, which is option B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2500. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where a father wants to divide 5100 rupees between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The father wants to split the money in such a way that when each son invests their share at 4% compound interest, they'll have the same amount when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the key here is that both shares, when invested, should yield the same amount when they're 26. So the time each amount is invested for will differ because Sohan is older.\n\nWait, right. Mohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. So each will have their money invested for a different number of years, but the future amounts should be equal.\n\nSo I need to set up an equation where the future value of Mohan's share after 3 years equals the future value of Sohan's share after 2 years. Both are at 4% compound interest.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe future value formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where P is principal, r is rate, and t is time.\n\nSo for Mohan: A_mohan = M*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A_sohan = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSince these are equal, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWait, I can simplify this. Let me rearrange it. M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Oh wait, that's (1.04)^(2-3) = 1.04^(-1) which is 1/(1.04).\n\nSo M/S = 1/1.04. Which means M = S/(1.04).\n\nAlternatively, M = S*(1/1.04) \u2248 S*0.9615.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute M in terms of S.\n\nSo, S*0.9615 + S = 5100.\n\nCombining terms, S*(1 + 0.9615) = 5100 \u2192 S*(1.9615) = 5100.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Because M = S/(1.04), so M + S = 5100 \u2192 S/(1.04) + S = 5100.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me write S/(1.04) + S = 5100.\n\nFactor S: S [1/(1.04) + 1] = 5100.\n\nCompute 1/(1.04): that's approximately 0.9615. So 0.9615 + 1 = 1.9615.\n\nSo S = 5100 / 1.9615.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. Hmm, 5100 divided by approximately 1.9615.\n\nLet me do it step by step. 5100 \u00f7 1.9615 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 1.9615 is approximately 2, so 5100/2 is 2550. But since 1.9615 is slightly less than 2, the result will be a bit higher than 2550.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 1.04 squared and cubed to get exact multipliers.\n\nWait, 1.04^2 is 1.0816, and 1.04^3 is 1.124864.\n\nWait, so M*(1.124864) = S*(1.0816).\n\nSo M/S = 1.0816 / 1.124864.\n\nLet me compute that ratio.\n\n1.0816 divided by 1.124864.\n\nWell, 1.0816 \u00f7 1.124864 \u2248 0.9615.\n\nWhich matches the previous approximation.\n\nSo M = 0.9615 * S.\n\nSo substituting into M + S =5100:\n\n0.9615 S + S = 5100 \u2192 1.9615 S =5100 \u2192 S =5100 / 1.9615.\n\nCalculating 5100 \u00f7 1.9615.\n\nLet me compute 1.9615 \u00d7 2500 = 1.9615 \u00d7 2500.\n\nWait, 2500 * 2 = 5000. 2500 * 0.9615 = ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should compute 5100 \u00f7 1.9615.\n\nLet me try dividing 5100 by 1.9615.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = ?\n\nWell, 1.9615 \u00d7 2000 = 3923.\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 600 = 1176.9.\n\nAdding them gives 3923 + 1176.9 = 5100. (Wow, exactly 5100? Let me check:\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = 1.9615 * 26 * 100.\n\n1.9615 *26: Let's compute 2 *26=52, 0.9615 *26=24.999.\n\nSo 52 +24.999=76.999, so 76.999 \u00d7100=7699.9. Hmm, that's way higher than 5100.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I messed up the decimal points. Wait, 1.9615 \u00d72600 = (1.9615 *26) *100.\n\n1.9615 *26: Let me compute 26 *1 =26, 26*0.9615=25. (Because 0.9615 is approx 0.96, 26 *0.96=24.96). So 26 +24.96=50.96.\n\nMultiply by 100 gives 5096. So 1.9615 \u00d72600 =5096, which is close to 5100. So 5100 is 5096 +4, so 2600 + (4/1.9615) \u22482600 + 2.04=2602.04.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find S=5100/1.9615.\n\nSo 5100 \u00f71.9615 \u22482600.\n\nWait, because 1.9615 \u00d72600\u22485096, which is 4 less than 5100.\n\nSo the actual S is approximately 2600 + (4 /1.9615) \u22482600 + 2.04=2602.04.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute 5100 /1.9615.\n\nLet me use a calculator approach.\n\nLet me think: 1.9615 \u00d72600 =5096.\n\nSo 5100 is 4 more than 5096. So how much more do I need to add to 2600 to get 4 more?\n\nSo, 4 =1.9615 * x \u2192 x =4/1.9615 \u22482.04.\n\nSo S\u22482600 +2.04\u22482602.04.\n\nSo S\u22482602.04, and M = 5100 -2602.04\u22482497.96.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let S be the amount for Sohan, so M =5100 - S.\n\nThen, the equation is (5100 - S)*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2, we get:\n\n(5100 - S)*(1.04) = S.\n\nExpanding, 5100 *1.04 - S *1.04 = S.\n\n5100 *1.04 = S + S*1.04 = S*(1 +1.04) = S*2.04.\n\nSo S = (5100 *1.04)/2.04.\n\nCompute numerator:5100 *1.04.\n\n5100 *1=5100, 5100 *0.04=204 \u2192 total 5304.\n\nSo S =5304 /2.04.\n\nLet me compute that: 5304 \u00f72.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 * 2600=5304. Because 2.04 *2000=4080, 2.04*600=1224 \u21924080+1224=5304.\n\nSo S=2600.\n\nSo Sohan's share is 2600, which makes Mohan's share 5100-2600=2500.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me confirm.\n\nSo S=2600.\n\nMohan's share M=5100 -2600=2500.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the condition.\n\nCompute future values.\n\nMohan's amount: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\n1.04^3=1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 *1.124864 =2500 *1.124864.\n\n2500 *1=2500.\n\n2500 *0.124864= 312.16.\n\nSo total is 2500 +312.16=2812.16.\n\nSohan's amount:2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n1.04^2=1.0816.\n\n2600 *1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816.\n\n2600 *1 =2600.\n\n2600 *0.0816=212.16.\n\nSo total is 2600 +212.16=2812.16.\n\nYes, both future amounts are equal. So the correct shares are 2500 and 2600.\n\nWait, but the question asks for Mohan's share. So Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are:\n\nA)2400\n\nB)2500\n\nC)2600\n\nD)2700\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B)2500.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where a father wants to divide 5100 rupees between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. The father wants to split the money in such a way that when each son invests their share at 4% compound interest, they'll have the same amount when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the key here is that both shares, when invested, should yield the same amount when they're 26. So the time each amount is invested for will differ because Sohan is older.\n\nWait, right. Mohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. So each will have their money invested for a different number of years, but the future amounts should be equal.\n\nSo I need to set up an equation where the future value of Mohan's share after 3 years equals the future value of Sohan's share after 2 years. Both are at 4% compound interest.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe future value formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where P is principal, r is rate, and t is time.\n\nSo for Mohan: A_mohan = M*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A_sohan = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nSince these are equal, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWait, I can simplify this. Let me rearrange it. M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3. Oh wait, that's (1.04)^(2-3) = 1.04^(-1) which is 1/(1.04).\n\nSo M/S = 1/1.04. Which means M = S/(1.04).\n\nAlternatively, M = S*(1/1.04) \u2248 S*0.9615.\n\nBut since M + S = 5100, I can substitute M in terms of S.\n\nSo, S*0.9615 + S = 5100.\n\nCombining terms, S*(1 + 0.9615) = 5100 \u2192 S*(1.9615) = 5100.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Because M = S/(1.04), so M + S = 5100 \u2192 S/(1.04) + S = 5100.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me write S/(1.04) + S = 5100.\n\nFactor S: S [1/(1.04) + 1] = 5100.\n\nCompute 1/(1.04): that's approximately 0.9615. So 0.9615 + 1 = 1.9615.\n\nSo S = 5100 / 1.9615.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. Hmm, 5100 divided by approximately 1.9615.\n\nLet me do it step by step. 5100 \u00f7 1.9615 \u2248 ?\n\nWell, 1.9615 is approximately 2, so 5100/2 is 2550. But since 1.9615 is slightly less than 2, the result will be a bit higher than 2550.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 1.04 squared and cubed to get exact multipliers.\n\nWait, 1.04^2 is 1.0816, and 1.04^3 is 1.124864.\n\nWait, so M*(1.124864) = S*(1.0816).\n\nSo M/S = 1.0816 / 1.124864.\n\nLet me compute that ratio.\n\n1.0816 divided by 1.124864.\n\nWell, 1.0816 \u00f7 1.124864 \u2248 0.9615.\n\nWhich matches the previous approximation.\n\nSo M = 0.9615 * S.\n\nSo substituting into M + S =5100:\n\n0.9615 S + S = 5100 \u2192 1.9615 S =5100 \u2192 S =5100 / 1.9615.\n\nCalculating 5100 \u00f7 1.9615.\n\nLet me compute 1.9615 \u00d7 2500 = 1.9615 \u00d7 2500.\n\nWait, 2500 * 2 = 5000. 2500 * 0.9615 = ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should compute 5100 \u00f7 1.9615.\n\nLet me try dividing 5100 by 1.9615.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = ?\n\nWell, 1.9615 \u00d7 2000 = 3923.\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 600 = 1176.9.\n\nAdding them gives 3923 + 1176.9 = 5100. (Wow, exactly 5100? Let me check:\n\n1.9615 \u00d7 2600 = 1.9615 * 26 * 100.\n\n1.9615 *26: Let's compute 2 *26=52, 0.9615 *26=24.999.\n\nSo 52 +24.999=76.999, so 76.999 \u00d7100=7699.9. Hmm, that's way higher than 5100.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I messed up the decimal points. Wait, 1.9615 \u00d72600 = (1.9615 *26) *100.\n\n1.9615 *26: Let me compute 26 *1 =26, 26*0.9615=25. (Because 0.9615 is approx 0.96, 26 *0.96=24.96). So 26 +24.96=50.96.\n\nMultiply by 100 gives 5096. So 1.9615 \u00d72600 =5096, which is close to 5100. So 5100 is 5096 +4, so 2600 + (4/1.9615) \u22482600 + 2.04=2602.04.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find S=5100/1.9615.\n\nSo 5100 \u00f71.9615 \u22482600.\n\nWait, because 1.9615 \u00d72600\u22485096, which is 4 less than 5100.\n\nSo the actual S is approximately 2600 + (4 /1.9615) \u22482600 + 2.04=2602.04.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute more accurately.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute 5100 /1.9615.\n\nLet me use a calculator approach.\n\nLet me think: 1.9615 \u00d72600 =5096.\n\nSo 5100 is 4 more than 5096. So how much more do I need to add to 2600 to get 4 more?\n\nSo, 4 =1.9615 * x \u2192 x =4/1.9615 \u22482.04.\n\nSo S\u22482600 +2.04\u22482602.04.\n\nSo S\u22482602.04, and M = 5100 -2602.04\u22482497.96.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let S be the amount for Sohan, so M =5100 - S.\n\nThen, the equation is (5100 - S)*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2, we get:\n\n(5100 - S)*(1.04) = S.\n\nExpanding, 5100 *1.04 - S *1.04 = S.\n\n5100 *1.04 = S + S*1.04 = S*(1 +1.04) = S*2.04.\n\nSo S = (5100 *1.04)/2.04.\n\nCompute numerator:5100 *1.04.\n\n5100 *1=5100, 5100 *0.04=204 \u2192 total 5304.\n\nSo S =5304 /2.04.\n\nLet me compute that: 5304 \u00f72.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 * 2600=5304. Because 2.04 *2000=4080, 2.04*600=1224 \u21924080+1224=5304.\n\nSo S=2600.\n\nSo Sohan's share is 2600, which makes Mohan's share 5100-2600=2500.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me confirm.\n\nSo S=2600.\n\nMohan's share M=5100 -2600=2500.\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the condition.\n\nCompute future values.\n\nMohan's amount: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\n1.04^3=1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 *1.124864 =2500 *1.124864.\n\n2500 *1=2500.\n\n2500 *0.124864= 312.16.\n\nSo total is 2500 +312.16=2812.16.\n\nSohan's amount:2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n1.04^2=1.0816.\n\n2600 *1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816.\n\n2600 *1 =2600.\n\n2600 *0.0816=212.16.\n\nSo total is 2600 +212.16=2812.16.\n\nYes, both future amounts are equal. So the correct shares are 2500 and 2600.\n\nWait, but the question asks for Mohan's share. So Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are:\n\nA)2400\n\nB)2500\n\nC)2600\n\nD)2700\n\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option B)2500.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. Mohan is currently 23 (will be 26 in 3 years), and Sohan is currently 24 (will be 26 in 2 years). \n\n### Step 1: Future Value Equality\nThe future value of an investment at compound interest is given by:\n\\[\nA = P \\times (1 + r)^t\n\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the principal, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate, and \\(t\\) is the time in years.\n\nLet \\(M\\) be Mohan's share and \\(S\\) be Sohan's share.

The division is such that when their shares are invested at 4% per annum compound interest, they'll get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out what Mohan's share is.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the key here is that both shares, when invested, should yield the same amount when they're 26. So, I should probably use the concept of compound interest to find the future value of each son's share and set them equal.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. So, their investment periods are different: Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. We know that M + S = 5100. \n\nThe future value for Mohan's investment after 3 years at 4% would be M multiplied by (1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan, it's S multiplied by (1 + 0.04)^2. And these two should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to express M in terms of S or vice versa. Let's solve for M.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\nM * (1.04) = S.\n\nSo, M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the math. Oh wait, no, wait. Let's re-express the equation properly.\n\nThe equation is:\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives:\nM * 1.04 = S.\n\nSo, S = M * 1.04.\n\nAlternatively, since M + S = 5100, substituting S gives:\nM + M*1.04 = 5100.\n\nWait, no. Because S is equal to M * 1.04, so M + 1.04 M = 5100?\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.04 M would make S larger than M, but wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Sohan is older and will get his money for a shorter time. So perhaps his share needs to be larger to compensate for the shorter investment period. So, if M is invested for 3 years, S for 2, but they yield the same amount, then S must be less than M because the interest is compounding for fewer years. Wait, no, no. Because if you have more principal, even for a shorter time, you can get the same future value as a smaller principal over a longer time. So perhaps Sohan's share is larger than Mohan's because he's getting it for less time, so he needs a bigger amount now to match the future value.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let me imagine numbers. Suppose M is 1000 and S is 1000. But since M is invested for 3 years, its future value would be higher than S's, which is only 2 years. So to have equal future values, S must be larger than M. So in the problem, S should be larger than M because it's invested for a shorter time.\n\nWait, so going back to the equation:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2.\n\nSo, S = M * (1.04)^(3-2) = M * 1.04.\n\nSo S is 4% more than M.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo, S = M * 1.04.\n\nSo, S is 4% larger than M. So, the total is M + S = M + 1.04 M = 2.04 M = 5100.\n\nSo, M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nWait, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2500 * 2 is 5000, 2500 * 0.04 is 100, so 5000+100=5100. So M would be 2500? Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So M is 2500, and S would be 2500 *1.04 = 2600.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 2500 +2600=5100. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the shares are M=2500 and S=2600.\n\nSo, the question asks for Mohan's share, which is 2500. So the correct option is B)2500.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, M =5100 / (1 + 1.04) = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the future value for M is 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute that.\n\n(1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864.\n\n2500 * 1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nFor S, 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 *1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816.\n\nLet me compute 2600 *1.08: 2600*1=2600, 2600*0.08=208, total 2808. Then 2600 *0.0016 is 4.16, so total 2808 +4.16= 2812.16. So yes, they are equal.\n\nSo, the answer is B)2500.\n",

So perhaps Sohan's share is larger than Mohan's because he's getting it for less time, so he needs a bigger amount now to match the future value.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. Let me imagine numbers. Suppose M is 1000 and S is 1000. But since M is invested for 3 years, its future value would be higher than S's, which is only 2 years. So to have equal future values, S must be larger than M. So in the problem, S should be larger than M because it's invested for a shorter time.\n\nWait, so going back to the equation:\n\nM * (1.04)^3 = S * (1.04)^2.\n\nSo, S = M * (1.04)^(3-2) = M * 1.04.\n\nSo S is 4% more than M.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo, S = M * 1.04.\n\nSo, S is 4% larger than M. So, the total is M + S = M + 1.04 M = 2.04 M = 5100.\n\nSo, M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nWait, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2500 * 2 is 5000, 2500 * 0.04 is 100, so 5000+100=5100. So M would be 2500? Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So M is 2500, and S would be 2500 *1.04 = 2600.\n\nWait, but that adds up to 2500 +2600=5100. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, the shares are M=2500 and S=2600.\n\nSo, the question asks for Mohan's share, which is 2500. So the correct option is B)2500.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, M =5100 / (1 + 1.04) = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the future value for M is 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute that.\n\n(1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864.\n\n2500 * 1.124864 = 2812.16.\n\nFor S, 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\n(1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\n2600 *1.0816 = 2600 *1.0816.\n\nLet me compute 2600 *1.08: 2600*1=2600, 2600*0.08=208, total 2808. Then 2600 *0.0016 is 4.16, so total 2808 +4.16= 2812.16. So yes, they are equal.\n\nSo, the answer is B)2500.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. \n\n### Key Information:\n- Mohan is 23 years old and will receive his share for **3 years** until he turns 26.\n- Sohan is 24 years old and will receive his share for **2 years** until he turns 26.\n- The total amount to be divided is **Rs. 5100**.\n\nLet:\n- \\( M \\) = Mohan's share.\n- \\( S \\) = Sohan's share.\n\nThe future value of Mohan's share after 3 years is:\n\\[\nM \\times (1 + 0.04)^3\n\\]\nThe future value of Sohan's share after 2 years is:\n\\[\nS \\times (1 + 0.04)^2\n\\]\nSince these future values are equal:\n\\[\nM \\times (1.04)^3 = S \\times (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\nDivide both sides by \\((1.04)^2\\):\n\\[\nM \\times 1.04 = S\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nS = M \\times 1.04\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the total amount\nThe total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\). Substituting \\( S = M \\times 1.04 \\):\n\\[\nM + M \\times 1.04 = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM \\times (1 + 1.04) = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM \\times 2.04 = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( M \\)\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the result\n- Mohan's share: \\( M = 2500 \\)\n- Sohan's share: \\( S = 2500 \\times 1.04 = 2600 \\)\n- Total: \\( 2500 + 2600 = 5100 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nCheck future values:\n- Mohan's future value: \\( 2500 \\times (1.04)^3 = 2500 \\times 1.124864 = 2812.16 \\)\n- Sohan's future value: \\( 2600 \\times (1.04)^2 = 2600 \\times 1.0816 = 2812.16 \\)\n\nBoth future values are equal, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nMohan's share is **Rs. 2500**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to compound interest, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are currently 23 and 24 years old. The division is such that if their shares are invested at 4% per annum compound interest, both will get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, so the key here is that the money each son gets now, when invested, should yield the same amount when they're 26. Since they're currently 23 and 24, that means in 3 years and 2 years respectively, they'll reach 26.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify: Sohan is 24 now. So in 2 years, he'll be 26. Mohan is 23 now, so in 3 years, he'll be 26. So each has a different time period for their investment to grow.\n\nSo the father is dividing the Rs.5100 into two parts: one for Mohan (let's call that M) and one for Sohan (which would be 5100 - M). Each of these amounts will be invested at 4% compound interest, but for different durations.\n\nThe goal is that after their respective investment periods, the amounts they get will be equal. So when Mohan is 26, his investment will have grown for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years. The future values should be the same.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, and t is time in years.\n\nSo, for Mohan, the future amount would be M*(1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan, it's (5100 - M)*(1 + 0.04)^2. And these two should be equal.\n\nSo I can set up the equation:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2\n\nHmm, let me compute the values of (1.04)^3 and (1.04)^2.\n\nCalculating (1.04)^2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816\nCalculating (1.04)^3: 1.04 * 1.0816 = let's see, 1.04 *1 is 1.04, 1.04 *0.08 is 0.0832, 1.04 *0.0016 is 0.001664. Adding them together: 1.04 + 0.0832 is 1.1232, plus 0.001664 is 1.124864. So approximately 1.124864.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me think: 1.04^3 is (1.04)^2 *1.04. So 1.0816 * 1.04.\n\n1.0816 * 1.04: Let's compute:\n\n1.0816 * 1 = 1.0816\n1.0816 * 0.04 = 0.043264\nAdding together: 1.0816 + 0.043264 = 1.124864. So that's correct.\n\nSo putting back into the equation:\n\nM * 1.124864 = (5100 - M) * 1.0816\n\nLet me write that equation clearly:\n\n1.124864 * M = 1.0816 * (5100 - M)\n\nI can expand the right side:\n\n1.124864 M = 1.0816 *5100 - 1.0816 M\n\nLet me bring all terms with M to one side.\n\n1.124864 M + 1.0816 M = 1.0816 *5100\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's subtract 1.0816 M from both sides.\n\n1.124864 M + 1.0816 M = 1.0816 *5100 ?\n\nNo, wait. Let me re-arrange:\n\n1.124864 M + 1.0816 M = 1.0816 *5100\n\nWait, perhaps I should subtract 1.0816 M from both sides.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in moving terms. Let me re-do the steps.\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n1.124864 M = (5100 - M) * 1.0816\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n=5100 *1.0816 - M *1.0816\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n1.124864 M = 5100 *1.0816 - 1.0816 M\n\nNow, bring the M terms to the left:\n\n1.124864 M + 1.0816 M = 5100 *1.0816\n\nAdding the coefficients:\n\n(1.124864 + 1.0816) M = 5100 *1.0816\n\nCalculating 1.124864 + 1.0816:\n\nLet's see: 1.124864 + 1.0816.\n\n1.124864\n+1.081600\n= 2.206464\n\nSo:\n\n2.206464 M = 5100 *1.0816\n\nNow compute 5100 * 1.0816.\n\nLet me compute 5100 *1.0816.\n\nFirst, 5100 *1 =5100.\n\n5100 *0.08 = 408.\n\n5100 *0.0016 = 8.16.\n\nSo adding them: 5100 + 408 = 5508; 5508 +8.16 = 5516.16.\n\nSo right side is 5516.16.\n\nSo 2.206464 M = 5516.16\n\nTherefore, M = 5516.16 / 2.206464\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute 5516.16 divided by 2.206464.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can approximate.\n\nLet me see: 2.206464 \u2248 2.2065.\n\nSo 5516.16 / 2.2065 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 2.2065 * 2500 = ?\n\n2.2065 *2500 = 2.2065 * 2.5e3 = 5516.25. Oh wait, that's very close to 5516.16.\n\nBecause 2.2065 *2500 = (2 + 0.2065)*2500 = 2*2500=5000, 0.2065*2500=516.25. So 5000+516.25=5516.25.\n\nBut the numerator is 5516.16, which is 5516.25 - 0.09.\n\nSo M would be approximately 2500 - (0.09 / 2.2065). Let's see, 0.09 /2.2065 is approximately 0.0408.\n\nSo M \u2248 2500 - 0.0408 \u2248 2499.96, which is roughly 2500.\n\nWait, but wait, 2.2065 *2500=5516.25. But our numerator is 5516.16, which is 0.09 less.\n\nSo M = (5516.16) /2.206464 = 2500 - (0.09 /2.206464)\n\nWait, perhaps a more precise way is to compute 5516.16 /2.206464.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, 2.206464 times M is 5516.16, so M = 5516.16 / 2.206464.\n\nLet me compute this division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor out 5100 from the equation.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way to compute this without so much decimal work.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of using the approximate decimal values, I can represent the equation in fractions.\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)*(1.04)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2:\n\nM*(1.04) = 5100 - M\n\nSo, 1.04 M + M = 5100\n\n(1.04 + 1) M =5100\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, no, if I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, then:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 / (1.04)^2 = (5100 - M) * (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^2\n\nWhich simplifies to M*(1.04) = 5100 - M\n\nAh, that's a much simpler approach! I should have thought of that earlier.\n\nSo, M*1.04 = 5100 - M\n\nBring all M terms to one side:\n\nM*1.04 + M =5100\n\nFactor M:\n\nM*(1.04 +1) =5100\n\n1.04 +1 is 2.04.\n\nSo M =5100 /2.04\n\nCompute 5100 /2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 * 2500 = 5100, right?\n\nBecause 2 *2500=5000, 0.04*2500=100, so total 5100.\n\nWait, yes, 2.04 *2500= (2 +0.04)*2500 = 5000 +100=5100.\n\nSo M =2500.\n\nWait, that's a much better way. I should have simplified the equation earlier.\n\nSo, M is 2500. Therefore, the share of Mohan is 2500.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2500. So the correct answer is B.\n",

I should have thought of that earlier.\n\nSo, M*1.04 = 5100 - M\n\nBring all M terms to one side:\n\nM*1.04 + M =5100\n\nFactor M:\n\nM*(1.04 +1) =5100\n\n1.04 +1 is 2.04.\n\nSo M =5100 /2.04\n\nCompute 5100 /2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 * 2500 = 5100, right?\n\nBecause 2 *2500=5000, 0.04*2500=100, so total 5100.\n\nWait, yes, 2.04 *2500= (2 +0.04)*2500 = 5000 +100=5100.\n\nSo M =2500.\n\nWait, that's a much better way. I should have simplified the equation earlier.\n\nSo, M is 2500. Therefore, the share of Mohan is 2500.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 2500. So the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old), such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. Mohan's share will grow for 3 years, while Sohan's share will grow for 2 years. \n\nUsing the compound interest formula \\( A = P(1 + r)^t \\), the future values of their shares must be equal:\n\\[\nM(1.04)^3 = (5100 - M)(1.04)^2\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\( (1.04)^2 \\):\n\\[\nM(1.04) = 5100 - M\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\nM(1.04 + 1) = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM(2.04) = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.\n\nAnswer: B",

The division is such that if their shares are invested at a 4% compound annual interest, they'll get equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Both sons are receiving a share now, which will be invested. When they reach 26, the amount each has grown will be equal. So, I think I need to calculate the future value of each son's share and set them equal.\n\nWait, how old will they be in three years? Oh right, because 26 minus 23 is 3 years for Mohan, and 26 minus 24 is 2 years for Sohan. So Mohan's share will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years.\n\nCompound interest formula is A = P*(1 + r/100)^t, where A is the amount, P principal, r rate, t time.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100.\n\nThe future values should be equal. So, for Mohan: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. Because his investment grows for 3 years, Sohan's for 2.\n\nWait, that's right. So the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find a relation between M and S. Let's see, M/S = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 = 1/(1.04). So M/S = 1/(1.04) \u2248 0.9615. Or, M = S/(1.04).\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to express in terms of S.\n\nWait, let's think again. The equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2, we get M*(1.04) = S. So S = M*1.04.\n\nWait, that's the same as M = S/1.04.\n\nBut since M + S =5100, I can substitute S from one equation into the other.\n\nIf S = 1.04*M, then M + 1.04*M =5100.\n\nThat's 2.04*M =5100.\n\nSo M =5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2 *2500=5000, and 0.04*2500=100. So 5000+100=5100. So 2.04*2500=5100. So M=2500.\n\nWait, so M is 2500? Let me check.\n\nIf M=2500, then S=5100-2500=2600.\n\nNow, let's compute their future values.\n\nMohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's after 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute these.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 \u2248 2500 *1.124864 \u2248 2812.16.\n\nSohan's: 2600 * (1.04)^2. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816 = 2600*1.0816.\n\nLet's compute 2600 *1.0816. 2600 *1=2600. 2600 *0.08=208. 2600 *0.0016=4.16. So total is 2600 +208=2808 +4.16=2812.16.\n\nOh, that matches!

The equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nDividing both sides by (1.04)^2, we get M*(1.04) = S. So S = M*1.04.\n\nWait, that's the same as M = S/1.04.\n\nBut since M + S =5100, I can substitute S from one equation into the other.\n\nIf S = 1.04*M, then M + 1.04*M =5100.\n\nThat's 2.04*M =5100.\n\nSo M =5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Hmm.\n\nWell, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, because 2 *2500=5000, and 0.04*2500=100. So 5000+100=5100. So 2.04*2500=5100. So M=2500.\n\nWait, so M is 2500? Let me check.\n\nIf M=2500, then S=5100-2500=2600.\n\nNow, let's compute their future values.\n\nMohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3.\n\nSohan's after 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2.\n\nLet me compute these.\n\nFirst, (1.04)^3 is approximately 1.124864. So 2500 *1.124864 \u2248 2500 *1.124864 \u2248 2812.16.\n\nSohan's: 2600 * (1.04)^2. (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816 = 2600*1.0816.\n\nLet's compute 2600 *1.0816. 2600 *1=2600. 2600 *0.08=208. 2600 *0.0016=4.16. So total is 2600 +208=2808 +4.16=2812.16.\n\nOh, that matches! So both will have 2812.16 when they turn 26. So the calculations are correct.\n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound annual interest, yield equal amounts when they turn 26. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the time periods\n- Mohan is currently 23 and will turn 26 in 3 years.\n- Sohan is currently 24 and will turn 26 in 2 years.\n\n### Step 2: Set up the compound interest formula\nThe future value of an investment is given by:\n\\[\nA = P \\cdot (1 + r)^t\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the future value, \\(P\\) is the principal, \\(r\\) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and \\(t\\) is the time in years.\n\nLet \\(M\\) be Mohan's share and \\(S\\) be Sohan's share. The total amount is:\n\\[\nM + S = 5100\n\\]\n\nThe future values of their shares must be equal:\n\\[\nM \\cdot (1.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Relate \\(M\\) and \\(S\\)\nDividing both sides of the equation by \\((1.04)^2\\), we get:\n\\[\nM \\cdot 1.04 = S\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nS = 1.04 \\cdot M\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute \\(S\\) into the total amount equation\nSubstituting \\(S = 1.04 \\cdot M\\) into \\(M + S = 5100\\), we get:\n\\[\nM + 1.04 \\cdot M = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\n2.04 \\cdot M = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\(M\\)\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the solution\nIf \\(M = 2500\\), then \\(S = 5100 - 2500 = 2600\\).\n\n- Future value of Mohan's share after 3 years:\n\\[\n2500 \\cdot (1.04)^3 \\approx 2500 \\cdot 1.124864 \\approx 2812.16\n\\]\n\n- Future value of Sohan's share after 2 years:\n\\[\n2600 \\cdot (1.04)^2 \\approx 2600 \\cdot 1.0816 \\approx 2812.16\n\\]\n\nBoth future values are equal, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nMohan's share is Rs. 2500.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan, who are currently 23 and 24 years old respectively. The goal is to split the amount such that when each share is invested at a 4% annual compound interest rate, both will have equal amounts when they reach 26. I need to find out Mohan's share.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, both sons are getting some amount now, which they'll invest. The money grows with compound interest, and when they turn 26, the amounts they have should be equal.\n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. That means the time each amount is invested is different. So, I think I need to calculate the future value of each son's share after their respective investment periods and set them equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100. \n\nThe future value for Mohan's investment after 3 years would be M multiplied by (1 + 4%)^3. Similarly, Sohan's investment after 2 years would be S multiplied by (1 + 4%)^2. These two future values should be equal.\n\nSo, the equation is M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this equation to express S in terms of M or vice versa. Let me solve for S first. \n\nFrom M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2, I can divide both sides by (1.04)^2. That gives M*(1.04) = S. So, S equals M multiplied by 1.04.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that math. (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is (1.04)^(3-2) = 1.04^1, which is 1.04. So yes, S = M * 1.04.\n\nNow, since M + S = 5100, and S is 1.04*M, I can substitute S in the equation.\n\nSo, M + 1.04*M = 5100. That simplifies to M*(1 + 1.04) = 5100. Wait, wait, no. Wait, M + (1.04 M) equals 5100. So, that's M*(1 + 1.04) = 5100? Wait, no. Wait, 1.04 is the multiplier, not 1.04 times M. Oh no, wait, no, 1.04 is a factor. Let me see: M + 1.04 M = (1 + 1.04) * M. So that's 2.04 * M = 5100.\n\nWait, wait, that's not right. Let me think again. M + S = 5100, and S = 1.04*M. So substituting, M + 1.04*M = 5100. That's 2.04 * M = 5100? No, wait, M + 1.04 M is (1 + 1.04) M. Wait, no, that's (1 + 1.04) times M. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1 + 1.04 is 2.04, so 2.04*M = 5100. So M would be 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's see, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100 because 2*2500 is 5000, and 0.04*2500 is 100. So 5000 + 100 is 5100. So 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So M is 2500, and S is 1.04*2500 = 2600.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for Mohan's share, which is M. So that would be 2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recheck the equations.\n\nSo, M is Mohan's present amount. He'll get it now, invest it, and in 3 years, it becomes M*(1.04)^3.\n\nS is Sohan's present amount, which is 1.04*M. He'll invest that for 2 years, so the future value is S*(1.04)^2 = (1.04*M)*(1.04)^2 = M*(1.04)^3, same as Mohan's future value. So yes, they are equal. That checks out.\n\nAnd the total is M + S = M + 1.04 M = 2.04 M = 5100. So M is 5100 / 2.04 = 2500.\n\nSo the correct answer is B) 2500.\n",

The father wants to split the money such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, both will get equal amounts when they reach 26. I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So both sons are getting some amount now, and when they turn 26, the money they've invested will grow to the same amount. So the key here is that the future value of each son's share, when compounded, should be equal.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. Mohan is 23 now; he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now; he'll be 26 in 2 years. So each of them will have their principal invested for different periods.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since it's annual and compounded once a year, n is 1. So A = P*(1 + r)^t.\n\nWait, but in this case, each son's investment period is different. So Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years. And the future values should be equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. We know that M + S = 5100 because that's the total amount the father is dividing.\n\nSo, for Mohan: A_mohan = M*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A_sohan = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nAnd we want A_mohan = A_sohan.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find the ratio of M to S.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, or wait, let me think again. Let me write it as M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. Dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*1.04 = S. So S = M * 1.04.\n\nSo, S is 1.04 times M. That makes sense because Sohan's investment grows for a shorter time, so his initial amount should be higher to have the same future value as Mohan's.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. M + S = 5100\n2. S = 1.04 * M\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nM + 1.04*M = 5100\nThat's 2.04*M = 5100.\n\nWait, 2.04*M? Let me double-check that math. M + 1.04M is (1 + 1.04) M = 2.04 M.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 is 204/100. So 5100 * (100/204) = ?\n\nWait, 204 times 25 is 5100. Because 204*25 = (200*25)+(4*25)=5000 +100=5100.\n\nSo 5100 divided by 204 is 25. So 5100 divided by 2.04 is 25 * (100/100) )= 25 *1=25? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, 2.04 is 204/100. So 5100 / (204/100) = 5100 * (100/204) = (5100 * 100)/204.\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 204 is 25, because 204 *25=5100.\n\nSo 5100 *100 is 510000. Divided by 204 is 510000 /204= 2500. Because 204 *2500=510000.\n\nSo M is 2500.\n\nWait, but that's a lot. So if M is 2500, then S is 1.04 *2500= 2600. So 2500 +2600=5100. That adds up.\n\nSo the options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B)2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWe found S =1.04 M.\n\nSo M +1.04 M =5100 \u2192 2.04 M =5100 \u2192 M=5100/2.04.\n\nLet me compute 5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\n2.04 \u00d7 2500 = ?\n\n2.04 \u00d72500 = 2.04 *25 *100.\n\n2.04 *25= (2*25)+(0.04*25)=50 +1=51.\n\nSo 51 *100=5100.

I need to find out how much Mohan gets.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So both sons are getting some amount now, and when they turn 26, the money they've invested will grow to the same amount. So the key here is that the future value of each son's share, when compounded, should be equal.\n\nLet me think about the timeline. Mohan is 23 now; he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24 now; he'll be 26 in 2 years. So each of them will have their principal invested for different periods.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since it's annual and compounded once a year, n is 1. So A = P*(1 + r)^t.\n\nWait, but in this case, each son's investment period is different. So Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years. And the future values should be equal.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. We know that M + S = 5100 because that's the total amount the father is dividing.\n\nSo, for Mohan: A_mohan = M*(1 + 0.04)^3\nFor Sohan: A_sohan = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nAnd we want A_mohan = A_sohan.\n\nSo, M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nI can rearrange this to find the ratio of M to S.\n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2: M*(1.04) = S.\n\nSo M = S / 1.04.\n\nWait, or wait, let me think again. Let me write it as M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. Dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*1.04 = S. So S = M * 1.04.\n\nSo, S is 1.04 times M. That makes sense because Sohan's investment grows for a shorter time, so his initial amount should be higher to have the same future value as Mohan's.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. M + S = 5100\n2. S = 1.04 * M\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nM + 1.04*M = 5100\nThat's 2.04*M = 5100.\n\nWait, 2.04*M? Let me double-check that math. M + 1.04M is (1 + 1.04) M = 2.04 M.\n\nSo M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. 5100 divided by 2.04.\n\nHmm, 2.04 is 204/100. So 5100 * (100/204) = ?\n\nWait, 204 times 25 is 5100. Because 204*25 = (200*25)+(4*25)=5000 +100=5100.\n\nSo 5100 divided by 204 is 25. So 5100 divided by 2.04 is 25 * (100/100) )= 25 *1=25? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, 2.04 is 204/100. So 5100 / (204/100) = 5100 * (100/204) = (5100 * 100)/204.\n\nWait, 5100 divided by 204 is 25, because 204 *25=5100.\n\nSo 5100 *100 is 510000. Divided by 204 is 510000 /204= 2500. Because 204 *2500=510000.\n\nSo M is 2500.\n\nWait, but that's a lot. So if M is 2500, then S is 1.04 *2500= 2600. So 2500 +2600=5100. That adds up.\n\nSo the options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B)2500, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2.\n\nWe found S =1.04 M.\n\nSo M +1.04 M =5100 \u2192 2.04 M =5100 \u2192 M=5100/2.04.\n\nLet me compute 5100 \u00f7 2.04.\n\n2.04 \u00d7 2500 = ?\n\n2.04 \u00d72500 = 2.04 *25 *100.\n\n2.04 *25= (2*25)+(0.04*25)=50 +1=51.\n\nSo 51 *100=5100. Yes, correct.\n\nSo yes, M is 2500, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to divide Rs. 5100 between Mohan and Sohan such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, yield equal amounts when they reach the age of 26. \n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\n- Let Mohan's share be \\( M \\) and Sohan's share be \\( S \\).\n- The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Future Value Equations\n- Mohan is 23 now and will be 26 in 3 years. His future value is:\n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{Mohan}} = M \\cdot (1 + 0.04)^3\n  \\]\n- Sohan is 24 now and will be 26 in 2 years. His future value is:\n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{Sohan}} = S \\cdot (1 + 0.04)^2\n  \\]\n- Since the future values are equal:\n  \\[\n  M \\cdot (1.04)^3 = S \\cdot (1.04)^2\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( S \\) in Terms of \\( M \\)\nDivide both sides by \\( (1.04)^2 \\):\n\\[\nM \\cdot 1.04 = S\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nS = 1.04 \\cdot M\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute \\( S \\) into the Total Amount Equation\nSubstitute \\( S = 1.04 \\cdot M \\) into \\( M + S = 5100 \\):\n\\[\nM + 1.04 \\cdot M = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\n2.04 \\cdot M = 5100\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( M \\)\n\\[\nM = \\frac{5100}{2.04}\n\\]\nPerform the division:\n\\[\nM = 2500\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Solution\nIf \\( M = 2500 \\), then:\n\\[\nS = 1.04 \\cdot 2500 = 2600\n\\]\nCheck the total:\n\\[\nM + S = 2500 + 2600 = 5100\n\\]\nThe values satisfy the conditions, so Mohan's share is \\( 2500 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct option is **B) 2500**.\n\nAnswer: B",
