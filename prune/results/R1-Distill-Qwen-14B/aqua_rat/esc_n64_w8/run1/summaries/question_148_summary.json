Because 2 times 2 is 4. So that means log2(4) should be 2. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. Sometimes I confuse log base 10 and natural logs, but here the base is clearly 2.\n\nLet me think of another way to verify. Logarithms can be tricky, but the definition is pretty straightforward. If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So applying that here, b is 2, a is 4. So 2^c =4. What's c? Oh yeah, 2 because 2^2=4. So that definitely points to the answer being 2.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2. So that should be the correct answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option B is 4, but that would mean 2^4=16, which is way bigger than 4. Option C is 6, which would be 2^6=64, even larger. So none of the others fit. \n\nWait, wait, maybe I should think about logarithm properties just to be thorough. Like, log_b(b) is always 1, right? Because b^1 =b. So log2(2) is 1. And since 4 is 2 squared, log2(4) should be 2. That aligns with what I thought earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using the change of base formula. Log2(4) equals ln(4)/ln(2). I know that ln(4) is the natural log of 4, which is about 1.386, and ln(2) is about 0.693. So dividing those gives approximately 2. Yep, that's another confirmation.\n\nSo, no matter how I approach it, the answer seems to be 2. I don't think I'm missing anything here. The options don't have any other numbers that fit, so I can confidently go with option A.\n\n\nThe question asks for the value of log\u2082(4). By definition, a logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. Here, b = 2 and a = 4, so we need to find c such that 2^c = 4. Since 2^2 = 4, c = 2. This confirms that log\u2082(4) = 2. \n\nTo verify, other options can be ruled out:  \n- Option B (4) would imply 2^4 = 16, which is incorrect.  \n- Option C (6) would imply 2^6 = 64, which is also incorrect.  \n- Options D (8) and E (12) similarly do not satisfy 2^c = 4.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is 2, corresponding to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
