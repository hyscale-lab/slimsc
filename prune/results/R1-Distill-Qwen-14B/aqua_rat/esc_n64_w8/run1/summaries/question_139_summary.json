      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cars and their speeds. Hmm, I remember that speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. Right, the basic formula is speed equals distance over time. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe question says Car X covers 320 kilometers in 8 hours. So, for Car X, the speed would be 320 km divided by 8 hours. Let me calculate that. 320 divided by 8... let's see, 8 times 40 is 320, so that's 40 km/h. Got it, so Car X's speed is 40 km per hour.\n\nNow, Car Y covers 415 kilometers in 5 hours. So for Car Y, the speed is 415 km divided by 5 hours. Let me do that division. 415 divided by 5. Well, 5 times 80 is 400, and then there's 15 left. 15 divided by 5 is 3, so that makes 83. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nWait, that seems pretty fast, but okay, maybe it's a sports car. So the problem asks for the difference in speed between the two cars. So I need to subtract the smaller speed from the larger one. Car Y is faster than Car X, so 83 minus 40. Let me compute that. 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/h. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor Car X: 320/8 = 40. Yep, that's correct. Car Y: 415/5. Let me see, 5 times 80 is 400, plus 3 is 83. Yep, that's right. So 83 minus 40 is indeed 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nSo the correct option is C. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So I'm confident the answer is C.\n",

Right, speed is distance divided by time, so I'll calculate each car's speed separately and then subtract them.\n\nStarting with Car X. The distance is 320 km, and the time is 8 hours.

So Car Y is going 83 km/h.\n\nNow, I need to find the difference in their speeds. So subtract Car X's speed from Car Y's. That would be 83 minus 40. Let's see, 80 minus 40 is 40, plus 3 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/h.

Let me do the division again. 8 into 32 is 4, so 40. Yep, that's correct.\n\nCar Y: 415 divided by 5. 5 into 415. 5 into 4 is 0, carry down. 5 into 41 is 8 (5*8=40), remainder 1.

The question is asking for the difference in the speed of two cars, X and Y. \n\nFirst, I remember that speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. So for each car, I need to find their individual speeds and then subtract them to find the difference. \n\nLet's start with Car X. The problem says it covers 320 km in 8 hours. So, the speed of Car X should be 320 divided by 8. Let me do that calculation. 320 divided by 8 equals 40. Oh wait, no, wait, 8 times 40 is 320, right? So that's correct. So Car X's speed is 40 km/h.\n\nNext, Car Y covers 415 km in 5 hours. So, its speed is 415 divided by 5. Let me compute that. 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. 15 divided by 5 is 3. So 80 plus 3 is 83. Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, wait, 5 times 83 is 415. Oh, right, because 80 times 5 is 400, and 3 times 5 is 15, so 400 plus 15 is 415.
