      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014answering a question on an exam. Each of them has a different probability of getting it right, and I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me break down the information. Alan is just randomly guessing, so his probability of getting it right is 1/5. Roger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him, so his chance is 2/3. Peter is doing the work properly, so he has a 5/6 chance of being correct.\n\nWait, the question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Oh right, so that means we want the cases where the correct answer is given, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, who are the non-cheaters here? Alan and Peter. So, I think I need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right via cheating, that's the case we don't want.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was given, but not through Roger's cheating. So, we want the probability that someone other than Roger got it right. But wait, can multiple people get it right? Or is it that the question is answered correctly by someone, but not via cheating?\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that only one person is answering, but that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is about the overall correctness, but without the cheating method being the reason. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The problem says the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the events we're interested in are (Alan correct and Roger incorrect and Peter correct?) No, wait, wait. Or is it that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not?\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not from Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the question was answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating (so only Alan and Peter's success counts, but not Roger's).\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct or not.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's model all the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, each person has their own probability of answering correctly. But in the context of this problem, are all three answering the same question? Or are they each answering independently? I think it's the latter\u2014each of them is answering the same question, but their correctness is independent of each other.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not Roger. Or perhaps it's answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer can be given by either Alan, Roger, or Peter. But the condition is that it's not via cheating, which implies that Roger's method (cheating) isn't the reason. So, we're only considering the cases where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but each of them can answer correctly independently. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, no\u2014because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because if the question is answered correctly by someone, and that someone is not Roger, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, minus the probability that Roger is correct and the others are incorrect, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nWait, no, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the scenario is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not Roger who provided it through cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, is the question considering that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger?\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that the question is answered correctly, but not via the cheating method. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not due to Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, that can't be right because the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone (Alan or Peter), and Roger's answer is irrelevant in this scenario. Or perhaps, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of events:\n\n- The question is answered correctly by Alan: P(A) = 1/5.\n- The question is answered correctly by Roger: P(R) = 2/3.\n- The question is answered correctly by Peter: P(P) = 5/6.\n\nBut the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, 'not via cheating' implies that the correct answer isn't achieved through Roger's method. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but each of them could have answered correctly independently. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method used isn't cheating.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe the question is that the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have given the correct answer.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer is given, but via cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we exclude. So, the correct answer being given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem as the correct answer being given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. But wait, each of them could have the correct answer, and perhaps the question is answered correctly if any of them gets it right.\n\nWait, but the question is about the overall correctness, not individual. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of them, but that correct answer wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not both? No, I think it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what the others do.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that? Because the events are independent. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. No, because the problem says \"but not via cheating,\" which implies that Roger's method isn't the one used. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, how do we model this? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, and the way it's given is not via cheating (i.e., it's either Alan's guess or Peter's correct calculation).\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but Roger is also correct? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct), but not considering Roger's correctness. But I think that's not the case because the problem states that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the probability of the correct answer being given by either Alan or Peter?\n\nLet me think: the correct answer is given by either Alan, Roger, or Peter. The probability that it's given by Alan is 1/5, by Roger is 2/3, and by Peter is 5/6.\n\nBut wait, these are individual probabilities. Are we assuming that only one of them answers the question, or that all of them are answering the same question and the correct answer is given by someone?\n\nWait, perhaps all three are answering the same question, and the correct answer is given by at least one of them. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if all three are answering the same question, and the correct answer is given by someone, it could be any of them. But the problem is that we want the correct answer to be given without cheating, meaning that it's not Roger who provided it.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being given, regardless of who, but without involving cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the fact that if the correct answer is given by someone, it could be by multiple people. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given by at least one of the three, but without considering the cheating method. No, that can't be. Because the question is about the method.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the events we're considering are:\n\n- Alan is correct (A) with P(A) = 1/5.\n- Roger is correct (R) with P(R) = 2/3.\n- Peter is correct (P) with P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct) but not via cheating. So, not via cheating implies that Roger is not the one who answered correctly. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then even if Roger didn't get it, the correct answer is given without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and it's not Roger who answered it. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate that? Because the events are independent.\n\nWait, another approach: the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but Roger is also correct. No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, considering their individual probabilities.\n\nWait, but since the events are independent, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Because if we just add them, we'd be double-counting the cases where both are correct.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)*P(P). Because A and P are independent.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them: 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333.\n\nSubtract (1/5)(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) )= 5/(30) )= 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.1667 = 0.8666, which is 5/6 +1/5 - 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute it exactly in fractions.\n\n1/5 + 5/6 = (6 + 25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nThen, subtract (1/5 *5/6) = (5)/(30) )=1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) )=26/30 =13/15.\n\nSo, P(A or P) =13/15.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, that's 13/15, but looking at the options, the options are much smaller. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being given by exactly one of them, and not via cheating. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about all three attempting to answer, and the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut the way the problem is worded is a bit unclear. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nSo, the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of cheating (i.e., not by Roger). So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's status.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, which is the same as the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct.\n\nBut wait, in reality, all three are answering the same question. So, the correct answer is given by someone, and we want the probability that it's given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the correct answer is given by exactly one of them. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, considering that only one person is correct. But that's not necessarily the case because all three could be correct, but that's unlikely given their probabilities.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is given by at least one of them. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger, that's still a correct answer not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the probability that both are correct and Roger is also correct. No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan, or by Peter, or by both, but not by Roger.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but since the correct answer is given by someone, and we want the cases where that someone is Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nBut that's not correct because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is:\n\nThe question is answered correctly, so at least one of them is correct. We want the probability that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe correct answer is given by at least one of the three.\n\nWe want the cases where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger, that's still a correct answer not via cheating.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, it's the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct) AND Roger is not correct.\n\nBecause if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but in reality, the correct answer is given if at least one of them is correct. So, the probability that the correct answer is given is 1 - P(none are correct).\n\nBut since we're interested in the cases where the correct answer is given, but not via cheating, we need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, but not given by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of it as the correct answer being given by someone, and that someone is either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, divided by the probability that the correct answer is given by someone (regardless of who).\n\nWait, that's an alternative approach. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by someone other than Roger, given that the correct answer was given.\n\nBut that's a conditional probability. So, P(not via cheating) = P(Alan or Peter correct) / P(anyone correct).\n\nBut wait, the question is not phrased as a conditional probability. It's phrased as the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the joint probability that the correct answer is given and it's not via cheating.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given, the probability that it's via Alan or Peter is what we're after.\n\nBut the question isn't phrased as a conditional probability. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's given by Roger or not.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, and also by Roger, then that's a case where the correct answer is given via cheating (Roger) as well as non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, we need to include those cases where the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe events:\n\nA: Alan correct.\n\nR: Roger correct.\n\nP: Peter correct.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of A, R, P is true) but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is given via cheating if Roger is correct. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the event we're looking for is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 (\u00acR). Because the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is given via cheating as well, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct, but we want the correct answer to be given by someone other than Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not correct, because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, the event that the correct answer is given via cheating is when R is true, regardless of A and P. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if R is true, and not via cheating if R is false.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is given (so at least one of A, R, P is true) and R is false.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given via cheating if R is true, regardless of whether A or P are true. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if R is correct, and via non-cheating if R is not correct and at least one of A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nSo, now we can compute this.\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( A \u2228 P ) * P( \u00acR ) ??? No, wait, that's only if A, P, and R are independent, which they are. Because each person's correctness is independent.\n\nWait, no, because the events A, P, and R are independent. So, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no. Because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not necessarily independent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, since R is independent of A and P, we can compute it as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) only if the events are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute it using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2227 \u00acR) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBecause (A \u2227 \u00acR) and (P \u2227 \u00acR) might overlap when both A and P are true and R is false.\n\nSo, let's compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) = 5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1*5)/(5*6*3) )= (5)/(90) )= 1/18.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute each term in fractions with a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 15, 18, and 18. Let's find a common denominator. 15 factors into 3*5, 18 is 2*3^2. So, LCM is 2*3^2*5 = 90.\n\nConvert each term to 90 denominator:\n\n1/15 = 6/90.\n\n5/18 = 25/90.\n\n1/18 =5/90.\n\nSo,\n\nP = (6/90) + (25/90) - (5/90) = (6 +25 -5)/90 =26/90 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\n1/15 is 6/90.\n\n5/18 is 25/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo,\n\n6 +25 =31 \u2192 31-5=26 \u2192 26/90 \u2192 simplifies to 13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is phrased as the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, this calculation gives us the probability that the correct answer is given, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating, which is 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is option E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014answering a question on an exam. Each of them has a different probability of getting it right, and I need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me break down the information. Alan is just randomly guessing, so his probability of getting it right is 1/5. Roger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him, so his chance is 2/3. Peter is doing the work properly, so he has a 5/6 chance of being correct.\n\nWait, the question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Oh right, so that means we want the cases where the correct answer is given, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, who are the non-cheaters here? Alan and Peter. So, I think I need to find the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right via cheating, that's the case we don't want.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was given, but not through Roger's cheating. So, we want the probability that someone other than Roger got it right. But wait, can multiple people get it right? Or is it that the question is answered correctly by someone, but not via cheating?\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that only one person is answering, but that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is about the overall correctness, but without the cheating method being the reason. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The problem says the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the events we're interested in are (Alan correct and Roger incorrect and Peter correct?) No, wait, wait. Or is it that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not?\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not from Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the question was answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating (so only Alan and Peter's success counts, but not Roger's).\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer was given, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Or maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct or not.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's model all the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, each person has their own probability of answering correctly. But in the context of this problem, are all three answering the same question? Or are they each answering independently? I think it's the latter\u2014each of them is answering the same question, but their correctness is independent of each other.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone is not Roger. Or perhaps it's answered correctly by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer can be given by either Alan, Roger, or Peter. But the condition is that it's not via cheating, which implies that Roger's method (cheating) isn't the reason. So, we're only considering the cases where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but each of them can answer correctly independently. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, no\u2014because if Roger is correct, that's via cheating, so we don't want that. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because if the question is answered correctly by someone, and that someone is not Roger, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, minus the probability that Roger is correct and the others are incorrect, but that's not what the question is asking.\n\nWait, no, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the scenario is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not Roger who provided it through cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Or wait, is the question considering that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger?\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is that the question is answered correctly, but not via the cheating method. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not due to Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be given by Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, that can't be right because the question is about the correct answer being given without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone (Alan or Peter), and Roger's answer is irrelevant in this scenario. Or perhaps, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of events:\n\n- The question is answered correctly by Alan: P(A) = 1/5.\n- The question is answered correctly by Roger: P(R) = 2/3.\n- The question is answered correctly by Peter: P(P) = 5/6.\n\nBut the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, 'not via cheating' implies that the correct answer isn't achieved through Roger's method. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but each of them could have answered correctly independently. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method used isn't cheating.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe the question is that the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have given the correct answer.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer is given, but via cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by Roger, that's via cheating, which we exclude. So, the correct answer being given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the problem as the correct answer being given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. But wait, each of them could have the correct answer, and perhaps the question is answered correctly if any of them gets it right.\n\nWait, but the question is about the overall correctness, not individual. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by at least one of them, but that correct answer wasn't via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not both? No, I think it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what the others do.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that? Because the events are independent. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. No, because the problem says \"but not via cheating,\" which implies that Roger's method isn't the one used. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, how do we model this? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is given, and the way it's given is not via cheating (i.e., it's either Alan's guess or Peter's correct calculation).\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but Roger is also correct? Hmm, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct), but not considering Roger's correctness. But I think that's not the case because the problem states that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the probability of the correct answer being given by either Alan or Peter?\n\nLet me think: the correct answer is given by either Alan, Roger, or Peter. The probability that it's given by Alan is 1/5, by Roger is 2/3, and by Peter is 5/6.\n\nBut wait, these are individual probabilities. Are we assuming that only one of them answers the question, or that all of them are answering the same question and the correct answer is given by someone?\n\nWait, perhaps all three are answering the same question, and the correct answer is given by at least one of them. But the question is about the probability that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if all three are answering the same question, and the correct answer is given by someone, it could be any of them. But the problem is that we want the correct answer to be given without cheating, meaning that it's not Roger who provided it.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being given, regardless of who, but without involving cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's not considering the fact that if the correct answer is given by someone, it could be by multiple people. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given by at least one of the three, but without considering the cheating method. No, that can't be. Because the question is about the method.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the events we're considering are:\n\n- Alan is correct (A) with P(A) = 1/5.\n- Roger is correct (R) with P(R) = 2/3.\n- Peter is correct (P) with P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (i.e., at least one of them is correct) but not via cheating. So, not via cheating implies that Roger is not the one who answered correctly. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then even if Roger didn't get it, the correct answer is given without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly, and it's not Roger who answered it. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate that? Because the events are independent.\n\nWait, another approach: the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the cases where both are correct but Roger is also correct. No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. So, the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, considering their individual probabilities.\n\nWait, but since the events are independent, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Because if we just add them, we'd be double-counting the cases where both are correct.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)*P(P). Because A and P are independent.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nAdding them: 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333.\n\nSubtract (1/5)(5/6) = (1*5)/(5*6) )= 5/(30) )= 1/6 \u2248 0.1667.\n\nSo, 1.0333 - 0.1667 = 0.8666, which is 5/6 +1/5 - 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, let's compute it exactly in fractions.\n\n1/5 + 5/6 = (6 + 25)/30 = 31/30.\n\nThen, subtract (1/5 *5/6) = (5)/(30) )=1/6.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 1/6 = (31/30) - (5/30) )=26/30 =13/15.\n\nSo, P(A or P) =13/15.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, that's 13/15, but looking at the options, the options are much smaller. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being given by exactly one of them, and not via cheating. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about all three attempting to answer, and the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut the way the problem is worded is a bit unclear. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nSo, the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not because of cheating (i.e., not by Roger). So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's via either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's status.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, which is the same as the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct.\n\nBut wait, in reality, all three are answering the same question. So, the correct answer is given by someone, and we want the probability that it's given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is phrased, perhaps the correct answer is given by exactly one of them. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, considering that only one person is correct. But that's not necessarily the case because all three could be correct, but that's unlikely given their probabilities.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the question is answered correctly. So, the correct answer is given by at least one of them. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by at least one of Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger, that's still a correct answer not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nSo, the probability would be the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, minus the probability that both are correct and Roger is also correct. No, perhaps not.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by Alan, or by Peter, or by both, but not by Roger.\n\nBut how do we calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given by someone, and that someone is not Roger. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but since the correct answer is given by someone, and we want the cases where that someone is Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nBut that's not correct because the correct answer could be given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to model this is:\n\nThe question is answered correctly, so at least one of them is correct. We want the probability that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe correct answer is given by at least one of the three.\n\nWe want the cases where the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, but not by Roger, that's still a correct answer not via cheating.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, it's the probability that (Alan is correct OR Peter is correct) AND Roger is not correct.\n\nBecause if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but in reality, the correct answer is given if at least one of them is correct. So, the probability that the correct answer is given is 1 - P(none are correct).\n\nBut since we're interested in the cases where the correct answer is given, but not via cheating, we need to find the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan OR Peter, but not given by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of it as the correct answer being given by someone, and that someone is either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, divided by the probability that the correct answer is given by someone (regardless of who).\n\nWait, that's an alternative approach. So, the probability that the correct answer is given by someone other than Roger, given that the correct answer was given.\n\nBut that's a conditional probability. So, P(not via cheating) = P(Alan or Peter correct) / P(anyone correct).\n\nBut wait, the question is not phrased as a conditional probability. It's phrased as the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the joint probability that the correct answer is given and it's not via cheating.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given, the probability that it's via Alan or Peter is what we're after.\n\nBut the question isn't phrased as a conditional probability. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's given by Roger or not.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, and also by Roger, then that's a case where the correct answer is given via cheating (Roger) as well as non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, we need to include those cases where the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also given by Roger.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe events:\n\nA: Alan correct.\n\nR: Roger correct.\n\nP: Peter correct.\n\nWe want the probability that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of A, R, P is true) but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is given via cheating if Roger is correct. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the event we're looking for is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 (\u00acR). Because the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is given via cheating as well, which we don't want. So, we need the correct answer to be given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct, but we want the correct answer to be given by someone other than Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nBut wait, no. Because if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer must be given by either Alan or Peter, and not given by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not correct, because the correct answer is given if any of them is correct. So, the event that the correct answer is given via cheating is when R is true, regardless of A and P. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if R is true, and not via cheating if R is false.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is equal to the probability that the correct answer is given (so at least one of A, R, P is true) and R is false.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given via cheating if R is true, regardless of whether A or P are true. So, the correct answer is given via cheating if R is correct, and via non-cheating if R is not correct and at least one of A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given but not via cheating is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nSo, now we can compute this.\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( A \u2228 P ) * P( \u00acR ) ??? No, wait, that's only if A, P, and R are independent, which they are. Because each person's correctness is independent.\n\nWait, no, because the events A, P, and R are independent. So, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no. Because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not necessarily independent. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, since R is independent of A and P, we can compute it as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) only if the events are independent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute it using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2227 \u00acR) \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acR) )\n\nWhich is equal to P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBecause (A \u2227 \u00acR) and (P \u2227 \u00acR) might overlap when both A and P are true and R is false.\n\nSo, let's compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) = 5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) = (1*5)/(5*6*3) )= (5)/(90) )= 1/18.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute each term in fractions with a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 15, 18, and 18. Let's find a common denominator. 15 factors into 3*5, 18 is 2*3^2. So, LCM is 2*3^2*5 = 90.\n\nConvert each term to 90 denominator:\n\n1/15 = 6/90.\n\n5/18 = 25/90.\n\n1/18 =5/90.\n\nSo,\n\nP = (6/90) + (25/90) - (5/90) = (6 +25 -5)/90 =26/90 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.\n\n1/15 is 6/90.\n\n5/18 is 25/90.\n\n1/18 is 5/90.\n\nSo,\n\n6 +25 =31 \u2192 31-5=26 \u2192 26/90 \u2192 simplifies to 13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is phrased as the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, this calculation gives us the probability that the correct answer is given, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating, which is 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the given probabilities:\n\n- **Alan** (random guessing) has a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\[\n  P(A) = \\frac{1}{5}\n  \\]\n- **Roger** (cheating) has a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\[\n  P(R) = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n- **Peter** (dutifully performing calculations) has a probability of answering correctly:  \n  \\[\n  P(P) = \\frac{5}{6}\n  \\]\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. To compute this, we calculate the probability of the event \\((A \\vee P) \\wedge \\neg R\\), where \\(\\neg R\\) ensures that Roger does not answer correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Compute individual probabilities\n- Probability that Roger does not answer correctly:  \n  \\[\n  P(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n- Probability that Alan answers correctly and Roger does not:  \n  \\[\n  P(A \\wedge \\neg R) = P(A) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{15}\n  \\]\n- Probability that Peter answers correctly and Roger does not:  \n  \\[\n  P(P \\wedge \\neg R) = P(P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{18}\n  \\]\n- Probability that both Alan and Peter answer correctly and Roger does not:  \n  \\[\n  P(A \\wedge P \\wedge \\neg R) = P(A) \\cdot P(P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{18}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply inclusion-exclusion principle\nThe probability of \\((A \\vee P) \\wedge \\neg R\\) is given by:  \n\\[\nP((A \\vee P) \\wedge \\neg R) = P(A \\wedge \\neg R) + P(P \\wedge \\neg R) - P(A \\wedge P \\wedge \\neg R)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\nP((A \\vee P) \\wedge \\neg R) = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{5}{18} - \\frac{1}{18}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the fractions\nConvert all terms to a common denominator of 90:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{6}{90}, \\quad \\frac{5}{18} = \\frac{25}{90}, \\quad \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{5}{90}\n\\]\nSubstitute and simplify:  \n\\[\nP((A \\vee P) \\wedge \\neg R) = \\frac{6}{90} + \\frac{25}{90} - \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{26}{90} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is answering a question on an exam, but they're doing it in different ways. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that the answer is correct, but the method wasn't cheating.\n\nLet me break down each person's situation:\n\n1. Alan is guessing randomly. His probability of getting it right is 1/5. So, he's like a shot in the dark, 20% chance.\n\n2. Roger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him. His probability is 2/3. So, about 66.67% chance he gets it right. Wait, but the question is about not via cheating, so I guess Roger's correct answers would count as cheating, so we might need to exclude his success in the 'non-cheating' correct answers.\n\n3. Peter is doing the work properly, so his probability is 5/6. That's about 83.33% chance.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, I think this means that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. Wait, no, wait. The question is about the overall probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Or wait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that someone answered correctly, but it wasn't through cheating (i.e., not Roger). So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, we need to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to think about all possible ways the question can be correctly answered, but the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others might have also gotten it right via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as: what's the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, I'm looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, that would be cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did. But that might not be the case because the question says \"but not via cheating,\" which could imply that the method wasn't cheating, not necessarily that the answer isn't via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved through either Alan's guessing or Peter's calculations, not through Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then it was via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the overall correct answer via non-cheating would be when either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't.\n\nWait, but no. Because if all three are answering, and the question is about the overall outcome. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer could be via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, we need the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus any other possibilities where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three friends are answering the same question, and the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, that's not exactly right because if Roger's answer is correct via cheating, that's another way the question is answered correctly, but via cheating. So, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone didn't cheat.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to model all possible correct answers, and then subtract the ones that came from cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, that's not correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is asking for the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone did not cheat. So, it's the probability that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that that someone didn't cheat. So, that would be the sum of the probabilities that Alan is correct, Roger is incorrect, and Peter is correct, Roger is incorrect, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly the case. Because the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so if any of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, then that's a correct answer not via cheating. But if only Roger got it right, then it's via cheating. If both Alan and Roger got it right, then the correct answer was achieved both via cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter), regardless of whether the cheater (Roger) got it right. But that might not be the case because the problem says \"but not via cheating.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that the method was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's status. But wait, no, because if the question is answered correctly by someone, and that someone is via cheating, then that's not the case we want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the problem is about the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others got it right via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not a cheater. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct. But that's not quite right because the question is about the correct answer not being via cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating (Alan or Peter) and not via cheating (Roger). So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's also achieved by Roger via cheating.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model it step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends has their own probability of answering correctly. So, their events are independent, I assume. So, the probability that Alan is correct is 1/5, Roger is 2/3, Peter is 5/6.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is that the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. But in that case, the events would be overlapping. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. Or is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that that someone did not cheat. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if both Alan and Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but no. Because if the question is answered correctly via someone who cheated, then it's via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, then the method wasn't cheating. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, then it's correct via non-cheating methods. But if it's answered correctly by Alan and Roger, then it's correct via both cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is asking for the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating, so we need to consider all cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether others also got it right via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the events where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of Roger's correctness. Because if either of them is correct, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. But if only Roger is correct, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the overall probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Wait, no, because if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) as well as non-cheating (Alan). So, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter), regardless of whether the cheater (Roger) got it right. Because if the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, then it's achieved via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would include any case where Alan or Peter is correct, even if Roger is also correct. Because if the correct answer was achieved by either of them, then it's a correct answer via non-cheating.\n\nBut I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think of the problem differently. We need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nSo, the correct approach would be to calculate the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both. But wait, that would include cases where Roger is correct as well. But in that case, the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the problem is about the correct answer being achieved via non-cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's status.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(Alan correct OR Peter correct). But since these are independent events, the probability would be P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P), where P(A) is Alan's probability, P(P) is Peter's, and P(A and P) is the probability both are correct.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nP(P) =5/6 \u22480.8333\n\nP(A and P) = P(A) * P(P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6 \u22480.1667\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) = 13/15 \u22480.8667.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the options don't have 13/15. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, 13/15 isn't one of the options, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, it's the probability that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the formula would be: P(A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because we want the cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not, but the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Hmm, but if the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, then it's achieved via non-cheating. So, the overall probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, that's what I did earlier and got 13/15, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which means that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not both. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not via Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which means that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. So, the formula would be P(A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect).\n\nBut wait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, then it's correct via non-cheating, regardless of whether Roger got it right. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not achieved via cheating (i.e., Roger didn't get it right). So, the correct approach is to compute P( (A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect) ).\n\nWait, but that would give us the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So, that's the scenario where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, and not via cheating. So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute P(R incorrect) = 1 - P(R correct) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute P(A correct OR P correct) = 1 - P(A incorrect AND P incorrect) = 1 - ( (4/5) * (1/6) ) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, no, wait. Alternatively, P(A correct OR P correct) is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) = (31/30 -5/30) =26/30=13/15.\n\nSo, P( (A OR P) AND R incorrect ) = P(A OR P) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent, right? So, the events A, P, and R are independent. So, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not occur is P(A or P) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, because if (A or P) and R incorrect, it's the probability that (A or P) is true, and R is false. So, since the events are independent, P( (A OR P) AND R incorrect ) = P(A OR P) * P(R incorrect).\n\nSo, P(A OR P) is 13/15, P(R incorrect) is 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45 \u22480.2889.\n\nWait, 13/45 is one of the options. Option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because if the question is answered correctly via non-cheating, it's when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, and not via cheating. So, the scenario where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, which is the case where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, and not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and the method was not cheating. So, that would include cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's a different scenario. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So, P(A correct OR P correct) = 13/15. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, and that no one who cheated got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula would be P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect ).\n\nWhich, as computed earlier, is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which could be either Alan or Peter. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others also achieved it via cheating. So, it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and that Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, then it's correct via non-cheating. If it's achieved by Peter, same thing. If it's achieved by both, then it's correct via non-cheating. But if it's achieved only by Roger, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario we want is when the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that's the same as P(A correct OR P correct), which is 13/15. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which would be when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect).\n\nBut wait, no, because the events are independent, so it's P(A correct OR P correct) multiplied by P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if you have (A correct OR P correct) and R incorrect, it's the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to compute P(A correct AND R incorrect) + P(P correct AND R incorrect) - P(A correct AND P correct AND R incorrect).\n\nBecause the events where A is correct and R is incorrect, plus the events where P is correct and R is incorrect, minus the overlap where both A and P are correct and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nP(A correct) = 1/5.\n\nP(R incorrect) = 1/3.\n\nP(A correct AND R incorrect) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nSimilarly, P(P correct) =5/6.\n\nP(P correct AND R incorrect) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A correct AND P correct AND R incorrect) = (1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) *1/3 = (1/6) *1/3 =1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute 1/15 +5/18 -1/18 = 1/15 +4/18 = 1/15 +2/9.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 =3/45.\n\n2/9 =10/45.\n\n3/45 +10/45=13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is13/45, which is option E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter, as cheating is excluded.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each of them is answering a question on an exam, but they're doing it in different ways. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that the answer is correct, but the method wasn't cheating.\n\nLet me break down each person's situation:\n\n1. Alan is guessing randomly. His probability of getting it right is 1/5. So, he's like a shot in the dark, 20% chance.\n\n2. Roger is cheating by looking at the paper in front of him. His probability is 2/3. So, about 66.67% chance he gets it right. Wait, but the question is about not via cheating, so I guess Roger's correct answers would count as cheating, so we might need to exclude his success in the 'non-cheating' correct answers.\n\n3. Peter is doing the work properly, so his probability is 5/6. That's about 83.33% chance.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, I think this means that either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. Wait, no, wait. The question is about the overall probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Or wait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that someone answered correctly, but it wasn't through cheating (i.e., not Roger). So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, we need to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to think about all possible ways the question can be correctly answered, but the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others might have also gotten it right via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as: what's the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, I'm looking for the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, that would be cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of whether Roger did. But that might not be the case because the question says \"but not via cheating,\" which could imply that the method wasn't cheating, not necessarily that the answer isn't via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is: the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved through either Alan's guessing or Peter's calculations, not through Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then it was via cheating, which we want to exclude. So, the overall correct answer via non-cheating would be when either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't.\n\nWait, but no. Because if all three are answering, and the question is about the overall outcome. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer could be via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, maybe the question is that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, we need the probability that either Alan is correct and Roger is incorrect, or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus any other possibilities where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three friends are answering the same question, and the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, that's not exactly right because if Roger's answer is correct via cheating, that's another way the question is answered correctly, but via cheating. So, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that someone didn't cheat.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to model all possible correct answers, and then subtract the ones that came from cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, that's not correct because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer is via both cheating and non-cheating. But the question is asking for the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone did not cheat. So, it's the probability that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that that someone didn't cheat. So, that would be the sum of the probabilities that Alan is correct, Roger is incorrect, and Peter is correct, Roger is incorrect, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly the case. Because the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so if any of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, then that's a correct answer not via cheating. But if only Roger got it right, then it's via cheating. If both Alan and Roger got it right, then the correct answer was achieved both via cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter), regardless of whether the cheater (Roger) got it right. But that might not be the case because the problem says \"but not via cheating.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that the method was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's status. But wait, no, because if the question is answered correctly by someone, and that someone is via cheating, then that's not the case we want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't get it right. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the problem is about the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others got it right via cheating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not a cheater. So, it's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct. But that's not quite right because the question is about the correct answer not being via cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating (Alan or Peter) and not via cheating (Roger). So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's also achieved by Roger via cheating.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model it step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends has their own probability of answering correctly. So, their events are independent, I assume. So, the probability that Alan is correct is 1/5, Roger is 2/3, Peter is 5/6.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is that the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. But in that case, the events would be overlapping. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not achieve it via cheating. Or is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that that someone did not cheat. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because if both Alan and Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nWait, but no. Because if the question is answered correctly via someone who cheated, then it's via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, then the method wasn't cheating. So, the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, and that Roger didn't answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we are excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if the question is answered correctly by both Alan and Peter, then it's correct via non-cheating methods. But if it's answered correctly by Alan and Roger, then it's correct via both cheating and non-cheating. But the problem is asking for the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating, so we need to consider all cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether others also got it right via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the events where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, irrespective of Roger's correctness. Because if either of them is correct, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating. But if only Roger is correct, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the overall probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Wait, no, because if both Alan and Roger are correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) as well as non-cheating (Alan). So, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter), regardless of whether the cheater (Roger) got it right. Because if the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, then it's achieved via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the problem is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which would include any case where Alan or Peter is correct, even if Roger is also correct. Because if the correct answer was achieved by either of them, then it's a correct answer via non-cheating.\n\nBut I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think of the problem differently. We need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's correctness.\n\nSo, the correct approach would be to calculate the probability that either Alan is correct, or Peter is correct, or both. But wait, that would include cases where Roger is correct as well. But in that case, the correct answer was achieved via both methods. But the problem is about the correct answer being achieved via non-cheating. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's status.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others achieved it via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nSo, the formula would be P(Alan correct OR Peter correct). But since these are independent events, the probability would be P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P), where P(A) is Alan's probability, P(P) is Peter's, and P(A and P) is the probability both are correct.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nP(A) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nP(P) =5/6 \u22480.8333\n\nP(A and P) = P(A) * P(P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6 \u22480.1667\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) = 13/15 \u22480.8667.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the options don't have 13/15. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, 13/15 isn't one of the options, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, it's the probability that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nSo, the formula would be: P(A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because we want the cases where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. So, if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not, but the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating. Hmm, but if the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, then it's achieved via non-cheating. So, the overall probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, that's what I did earlier and got 13/15, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which means that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not both. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not via Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which means that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. So, the formula would be P(A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect).\n\nBut wait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, then it's correct via non-cheating, regardless of whether Roger got it right. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that the correct answer is not achieved via cheating (i.e., Roger didn't get it right). So, the correct approach is to compute P( (A correct OR P correct) AND (R incorrect) ).\n\nWait, but that would give us the cases where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So, that's the scenario where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, and not via cheating. So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute P(R incorrect) = 1 - P(R correct) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThen, compute P(A correct OR P correct) = 1 - P(A incorrect AND P incorrect) = 1 - ( (4/5) * (1/6) ) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, no, wait. Alternatively, P(A correct OR P correct) is P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5 *5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) = (31/30 -5/30) =26/30=13/15.\n\nSo, P( (A OR P) AND R incorrect ) = P(A OR P) * P(R incorrect) ?\n\nWait, no, because the events are independent, right? So, the events A, P, and R are independent. So, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not occur is P(A or P) * P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, because if (A or P) and R incorrect, it's the probability that (A or P) is true, and R is false. So, since the events are independent, P( (A OR P) AND R incorrect ) = P(A OR P) * P(R incorrect).\n\nSo, P(A OR P) is 13/15, P(R incorrect) is 1/3.\n\nSo, 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45 \u22480.2889.\n\nWait, 13/45 is one of the options. Option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because if the question is answered correctly via non-cheating, it's when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, and not via cheating. So, the scenario where either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, which is the case where the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, and not via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, regardless of whether it's also achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and the method was not cheating. So, that would include cases where both Alan and Peter are correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's a different scenario. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So, P(A correct OR P correct) = 13/15. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, and that no one who cheated got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the formula would be P( (A correct OR P correct) AND R incorrect ).\n\nWhich, as computed earlier, is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating, which could be either Alan or Peter. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, regardless of whether others also achieved it via cheating. So, it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and that Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, then it's correct via non-cheating. If it's achieved by Peter, same thing. If it's achieved by both, then it's correct via non-cheating. But if it's achieved only by Roger, then it's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the scenario we want is when the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but that's the same as P(A correct OR P correct), which is 13/15. But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods, which would be when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A correct OR P correct) * P(R incorrect).\n\nBut wait, no, because the events are independent, so it's P(A correct OR P correct) multiplied by P(R incorrect).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because if you have (A correct OR P correct) and R incorrect, it's the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct way is to compute P(A correct AND R incorrect) + P(P correct AND R incorrect) - P(A correct AND P correct AND R incorrect).\n\nBecause the events where A is correct and R is incorrect, plus the events where P is correct and R is incorrect, minus the overlap where both A and P are correct and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nP(A correct) = 1/5.\n\nP(R incorrect) = 1/3.\n\nP(A correct AND R incorrect) = (1/5) * (1/3) = 1/15.\n\nSimilarly, P(P correct) =5/6.\n\nP(P correct AND R incorrect) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A correct AND P correct AND R incorrect) = (1/5) * (5/6) * (1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) *1/3 = (1/6) *1/3 =1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/15) + (5/18) - (1/18).\n\nCompute 1/15 +5/18 -1/18 = 1/15 +4/18 = 1/15 +2/9.\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 45.\n\n1/15 =3/45.\n\n2/9 =10/45.\n\n3/45 +10/45=13/45.\n\nSo, the probability is13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter, as cheating is excluded. The events are independent, so we calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly, and Roger does not answer correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Define probabilities\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering incorrectly**: \\( P(R^c) = 1 - P(R) = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of either Alan or Peter answering correctly\nUsing the formula for the union of two independent events:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ OR } P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) \\cdot P(P)\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ OR } P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ OR } P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ OR } P) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Roger answers incorrectly\n\\[\nP(R^c) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the probabilities\nWe want the probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly **and** Roger answers incorrectly. Since the events are independent:\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ OR } P) \\text{ AND } R^c) = P(A \\text{ OR } P) \\cdot P(R^c)\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ OR } P) \\text{ AND } R^c) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ OR } P) \\text{ AND } R^c) = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014answering a question on an exam. Each of them has a different probability of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that at least one of them gets it right, but without considering the cases where Roger cheats. Wait, no, the wording says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think it's about the probability that the correct answer happens through either Alan or Peter, not through Roger's cheating method.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not through cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't use cheating? Or maybe that the correct answer came through either Alan or Peter. Hmm, I think I need to clarify what the event is.\n\nWait, the way the question is phrased: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the question is correct, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter's methods, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but how do the three friends' probabilities factor into this? Are they all answering the question, and we want the probability that at least one of them got it right, but without considering Roger's cheating? Or perhaps that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger? Hmm, maybe I should model each of their probabilities.\n\nLet me restate the problem. Alan has a 1/5 chance of being correct. Roger, by cheating, has a 2/3 chance. Peter, who does the work, has a 5/6 chance. We need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps that means the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not through Roger. Wait, but wait, the way the problem is structured, each of them is answering the question. So, the question will be answered correctly if at least one of them gets it right. But we need the probability that it's correct, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's method.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the question being answered correctly is an event. But the way it's answered correctly could be via cheating (Roger) or not (Alan or Peter). So, the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Or maybe that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is about the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nSo, each of the three friends is answering the question. The question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That is, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter. But wait, maybe the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not both. Or perhaps it's the case where the correct answer is achieved without considering Roger's cheating, meaning that the correct answer is either Alan's or Peter's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is correctly answered by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger's cheating. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, but it wasn't Roger who did the cheating. Or maybe that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating methods (so Alan or Peter) and not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, another approach: the correct answer is achieved through either Alan's method (random guess, 1/5) or Peter's method (dutifully working, 5/6). But we need to find the probability that the question is correct, but not because of cheating (which is Roger's method, 2/3). So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and regardless of whether Roger did or not.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is answered correctly if any of them got it right. So, the overall probability of the question being correct is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter got it right. But the problem wants the probability that the question is correct, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via cheating. Wait, no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter, not through Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of events. Let me denote the events:\n\n- A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. Alternatively, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or, more accurately, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the event we're interested in is that the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to that correctness. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by both, and not by Roger. Or perhaps the question is answered correctly, but not through Roger's method. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the question is correct if either Alan or Peter got it right. So, the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But wait, because if both are correct, that's still a correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the way to interpret this is that the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question isn't about who answered it, but whether the correct answer was achieved. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, meaning that the correct answer is achieved through their methods, not through Roger's.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the question is about the overall correctness of the answer, regardless of who provided it. Hmm, maybe I should model the events as the union of Alan and Peter being correct, and then subtract any overlap. But wait, the problem says \"but not via cheating,\" which implies that Roger's correct answer via cheating shouldn't be considered.\n\nWait, maybe the question is answered correctly via cheating (Roger) or via non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but regardless of R, but perhaps R's correctness is independent.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the events are independent. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating (so Alan or Peter), but not through cheating (Roger). So, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but how can the correct answer be via both? Because all three are answering the same question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them, but we're only considering the cases where it's achieved by Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, the question being correctly answered by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, minus any overlap where Roger's cheating also contributed. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter's methods.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to compute this is to calculate the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via cheating. So, P(correct) is 1 minus the probability that all three are wrong. Then, P(not via cheating) would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWait, let me think again. The probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. So, P(correct) = 1 - P(all wrong). P(all wrong) is (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (4 * 1 * 1)/(5 *3 *6) )= 4/(90) = 2/45. So, P(correct) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\n\nBut that's the overall probability that the question is correct. But the problem wants the probability that the question is correct but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via Roger.\n\nWait, but how to calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer could have been achieved via Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's a bit tricky. Let me model it as the probability that the question is correct (by Alan or Peter), but not because of Roger's correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up events.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is answered correctly, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could come from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the event is that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R). But wait, no, because the events are independent. So, the correct way is to calculate the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur. Or perhaps, the probability that the question is correct via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that would be P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). But since the events are independent, we can compute this as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). But wait, no, because if R is \u00acR, then it's not necessarily independent.\n\nWait, no, all three events are independent. So, the probability that the question is correct via A or P, but not via R is the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur.\n\nBut wait, the question being correct is the event that at least one of A, R, or P is correct. So, if we want the question to be correct, but not via R, that would be the probability that the question is correct and R is not correct. Because if R is correct, then the question is correct via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is (A \u2228 P \u2228 R) \u2227 \u00acR. But that's equivalent to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Because if R is \u00acR, then the event is A \u2228 P being correct, and R being incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nSince A, R, P are independent, this can be written as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not independent. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute it as P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR).\n\nSo, let's compute P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR) = P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). Since A and P are independent of R, perhaps we can expand this.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) only if (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are independent, which they might not be. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) only if (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are independent. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute P(A \u2228 P). Since A and P are independent, P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. Then subtract the overlap, which is (1/5)(5/6) =5/30. So, 31/30 -5/30 =26/30=13/15. So, P(A \u2228 P)=13/15.\n\nNow, the probability that R is incorrect is P(\u00acR) =1 -2/3=1/3.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )=13/45.\n\nWait, but that would be 13/45. Let me check the options. Option E is 13/45. So, that's an option.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that the question is correct via A or P, but not via R. But wait, another way is to compute the probability that the question is correct, and R is not correct. Because if R is correct, then the question is correct via cheating. So, the probability that the question is correct but not via cheating is P(correct) * P(R is incorrect | correct).\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is correct and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Which simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), which is 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let's think about all possibilities.\n\nThe probability that the question is correct via A or P, and R is incorrect is 13/45. So, the options are:\n\nA)1/18 \u2248 0.0556\n\nB)1/9\u22480.1111\n\nC)23/90\u22480.2556\n\nD)5/18\u22480.2778\n\nE)13/45\u22480.2889\n\nHmm, 13/45 is the highest, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is given by either A or P, but R doesn't contribute. So, the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating is the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )=13/45.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute it differently. Let's compute the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods as the sum of the probabilities that either A is correct and R is not, plus the probability that P is correct and R is not, minus the probability that both A and P are correct and R is not.\n\nWait, that might be more accurate.\n\nSo, P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBecause when both A and P are correct, we subtract the overlap.\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1/3) =1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) )= (1*5)/(5*6*3) )= (5)/(90)=1/18.\n\nSo, the total is 1/15 +5/18 -1/18.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1/15 is 12/180.\n\n5/18 is 50/180.\n\n1/18 is 10/180.\n\nSo, 12/180 +50/180 -10/180 = (12 +50 -10)/180 =52/180 =26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before. So, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that's the same as the correct answer being achieved by non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) and not via cheating (Roger). So, the calculation we did gives 13/45, which is option E. So, the correct answer should be E.\n",

Or perhaps that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not Roger? Hmm, maybe I should model each of their probabilities.\n\nLet me restate the problem. Alan has a 1/5 chance of being correct. Roger, by cheating, has a 2/3 chance. Peter, who does the work, has a 5/6 chance. We need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps that means the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not through Roger. Wait, but wait, the way the problem is structured, each of them is answering the question. So, the question will be answered correctly if at least one of them gets it right. But we need the probability that it's correct, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's method.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the question being answered correctly is an event. But the way it's answered correctly could be via cheating (Roger) or not (Alan or Peter). So, the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Or maybe that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is about the probability that the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nSo, each of the three friends is answering the question. The question is answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That is, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter. But wait, maybe the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not both. Or perhaps it's the case where the correct answer is achieved without considering Roger's cheating, meaning that the correct answer is either Alan's or Peter's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the question is correctly answered by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is looking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger's cheating. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, but it wasn't Roger who did the cheating. Or maybe that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating methods (so Alan or Peter) and not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, another approach: the correct answer is achieved through either Alan's method (random guess, 1/5) or Peter's method (dutifully working, 5/6). But we need to find the probability that the question is correct, but not because of cheating (which is Roger's method, 2/3). So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and regardless of whether Roger did or not.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is answered correctly if any of them got it right. So, the overall probability of the question being correct is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter got it right. But the problem wants the probability that the question is correct, but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via cheating. Wait, no, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter, not through Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via non-cheating methods. So, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter. So, that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think in terms of events. Let me denote the events:\n\n- A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. Alternatively, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or, more accurately, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the event we're interested in is that the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to that correctness. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by both, and not by Roger. Or perhaps the question is answered correctly, but not through Roger's method. So, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the question is correct if either Alan or Peter got it right. So, the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. But wait, because if both are correct, that's still a correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the way to interpret this is that the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question isn't about who answered it, but whether the correct answer was achieved. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, meaning that the correct answer is achieved through their methods, not through Roger's.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the question is about the overall correctness of the answer, regardless of who provided it. Hmm, maybe I should model the events as the union of Alan and Peter being correct, and then subtract any overlap. But wait, the problem says \"but not via cheating,\" which implies that Roger's correct answer via cheating shouldn't be considered.\n\nWait, maybe the question is answered correctly via cheating (Roger) or via non-cheating (Alan and Peter). So, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods. So, it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Wait, no, because if the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but regardless of R, but perhaps R's correctness is independent.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the events are independent. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating (so Alan or Peter), but not through cheating (Roger). So, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but how can the correct answer be via both? Because all three are answering the same question. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of them, but we're only considering the cases where it's achieved by Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, the question being correctly answered by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, minus any overlap where Roger's cheating also contributed. Wait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not by Roger's cheating. So, the question is correct, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter's methods.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to compute this is to calculate the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via cheating. So, P(correct) is 1 minus the probability that all three are wrong. Then, P(not via cheating) would be P(correct) minus P(correct via cheating).\n\nWait, let me think again. The probability that the question is answered correctly is the probability that at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct. So, P(correct) = 1 - P(all wrong). P(all wrong) is (1 - 1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (4 * 1 * 1)/(5 *3 *6) )= 4/(90) = 2/45. So, P(correct) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\n\nBut that's the overall probability that the question is correct. But the problem wants the probability that the question is correct but not via cheating. So, that would be the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, not by Roger. So, perhaps it's the probability that the question is correct, minus the probability that it was correct via Roger.\n\nWait, but how to calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer could have been achieved via Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger's answer is correct or not.\n\nWait, but that's a bit tricky. Let me model it as the probability that the question is correct (by Alan or Peter), but not because of Roger's correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up events.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is answered correctly, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could come from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the event is that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability would be P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R). But wait, no, because the events are independent. So, the correct way is to calculate the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur. Or perhaps, the probability that the question is correct via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that would be P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). But since the events are independent, we can compute this as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). But wait, no, because if R is \u00acR, then it's not necessarily independent.\n\nWait, no, all three events are independent. So, the probability that the question is correct via A or P, but not via R is the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not occur.\n\nBut wait, the question being correct is the event that at least one of A, R, or P is correct. So, if we want the question to be correct, but not via R, that would be the probability that the question is correct and R is not correct. Because if R is correct, then the question is correct via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is (A \u2228 P \u2228 R) \u2227 \u00acR. But that's equivalent to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Because if R is \u00acR, then the event is A \u2228 P being correct, and R being incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nSince A, R, P are independent, this can be written as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nWait, but wait, is that correct? Because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not independent. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute it as P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR).\n\nSo, let's compute P(A \u2228 P and \u00acR) = P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ). Since A and P are independent of R, perhaps we can expand this.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it as P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) only if (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are independent, which they might not be. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) only if (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are independent. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is incorrect.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute P(A \u2228 P). Since A and P are independent, P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30) - (5/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30. So, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. Then subtract the overlap, which is (1/5)(5/6) =5/30. So, 31/30 -5/30 =26/30=13/15. So, P(A \u2228 P)=13/15.\n\nNow, the probability that R is incorrect is P(\u00acR) =1 -2/3=1/3.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the probability that (A \u2228 P) occurs and R does not is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )=13/45.\n\nWait, but that would be 13/45. Let me check the options. Option E is 13/45. So, that's an option.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the probability that the question is correct via A or P, but not via R. But wait, another way is to compute the probability that the question is correct, and R is not correct. Because if R is correct, then the question is correct via cheating. So, the probability that the question is correct but not via cheating is P(correct) * P(R is incorrect | correct).\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is correct and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. Which simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR), which is 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let's think about all possibilities.\n\nThe probability that the question is correct via A or P, and R is incorrect is 13/45. So, the options are:\n\nA)1/18 \u2248 0.0556\n\nB)1/9\u22480.1111\n\nC)23/90\u22480.2556\n\nD)5/18\u22480.2778\n\nE)13/45\u22480.2889\n\nHmm, 13/45 is the highest, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: the question is answered correctly via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer is given by either A or P, but R doesn't contribute. So, the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating is the probability that either A or P is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) )=13/45.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should compute it differently. Let's compute the probability that the question is correct via non-cheating methods as the sum of the probabilities that either A is correct and R is not, plus the probability that P is correct and R is not, minus the probability that both A and P are correct and R is not.\n\nWait, that might be more accurate.\n\nSo, P(A \u2227 \u00acR) + P(P \u2227 \u00acR) - P(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR).\n\nBecause when both A and P are correct, we subtract the overlap.\n\nLet's compute each term.\n\nP(A \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5) * (1/3) =1/15.\n\nP(P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (5/6) * (1/3) =5/18.\n\nP(A \u2227 P \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A) * P(P) * P(\u00acR) = (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) )= (1*5)/(5*6*3) )= (5)/(90)=1/18.\n\nSo, the total is 1/15 +5/18 -1/18.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1/15 is 12/180.\n\n5/18 is 50/180.\n\n1/18 is 10/180.\n\nSo, 12/180 +50/180 -10/180 = (12 +50 -10)/180 =52/180 =26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before. So, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that's the same as the correct answer being achieved by non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) and not via cheating (Roger). So, the calculation we did gives 13/45, which is option E. So, the correct answer should be E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly (cheating)**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Approach:\nWe are tasked with finding the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so that means we want the correct answer, but it shouldn't be because Roger cheated. So, only Alan and Peter's correct answers count towards the desired probability.\n\nLet me break down each person's probability:\n\n- Alan guesses randomly. His chance of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3.\n- Peter does the work, so his probability is 5/6.\n\nBut wait, wait. The way the problem is phrased, each friend is attempting to answer the question. So, are they all answering independently? I think so, because it says each of them attempts to answer. So each of them has their own probability of being correct, and we need to find the cases where at least one of them is correct, but Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, no, the question is phrased as: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that could mean that the question is correct, but Roger's answer (the cheating one) isn't the one that's correct. Or, perhaps, the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. Hmm, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps, the question is answered correctly, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the scenario where the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating methods. So, the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to it via cheating. Wait, no, because each person is answering on their own. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them gets it right. But the 'but not via cheating' part probably means that we don't want the scenario where Roger is the one who got it right. So, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think that refers to the method of answering. So, if the question is correct, but it wasn't because of cheating (i.e., Roger's answer isn't correct, but someone else's is). Alternatively, the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer didn't come from Roger's cheating. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me rephrase the question. We need the probability that the question is correct, but Roger's method (cheating) wasn't the cause. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan's guessing or Peter's work, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, in other words, the event we're interested in is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, but no, because if the question is answered correctly, that could be through any of the three, but we don't want it to be because of Roger's cheating. So, we want the probability that the question is correct, but not because of Roger. So, the question is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is correct, it's because at least one of them answered correctly. So, the scenario where the question is correct, but Roger didn't answer correctly, so the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the question is correct (at least one of them correct) minus the probability that Roger is the one who answered correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. So, that the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, and Roger is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the question is answered correctly in the sense that it's correct, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute to the correctness. Wait, but in reality, each of them is answering the question on their own. So, if the question is correct, it's because at least one of them is correct. But we don't want the case where Roger is correct, because that's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps we're to find the probability that the question is correct, but Roger did not answer it correctly. Because if the question is correct, it's because at least one person got it right. But if Roger's method is cheating, we don't want his contribution to the correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the question is correct, but Roger's answer is wrong.\n\nWait, I think that's the correct approach. So, the event we're interested in is: the question is correct (i.e., at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because if the question is correct, it's because at least one of the three is correct. But we don't want the case where Roger is correct. So, the correct probability is the probability that the question is correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can find the probability that the question is correct (i.e., at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct) minus the probability that the question is correct and Roger is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is correct via Alan or Peter (i.e., the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is correct, it's because at least one of the three is correct. But if we're only considering cases where the question is correct via Alan or Peter, then Roger is incorrect. So, that's exactly what we want.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, since all three are independent, we can compute it as [1 - P(Roger correct)] multiplied by [P(Alan correct OR Peter correct)].\n\nWait, no, because if we condition on Roger being incorrect, then the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is the same as 1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter is correct).\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me model this as independent events.\n\nLet A = event Alan is correct.\n\nR = event Roger is correct.\n\nP = event Peter is correct.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is correct (A OR R OR P is true) but not via cheating. Hmm, perhaps via cheating refers to Roger's method, so we don't want R to be the cause. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that either A or P is correct, but R is not.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, that would be the probability that the question is correct, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the question is correct, and R is false.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A OR R OR P) minus P(R AND (A OR P OR not R) )? Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is correct (i.e., at least one of A, R, or P is correct) and R is not correct. So, the event is (A OR R OR P) AND NOT R. Which simplifies to (A OR P) AND NOT R.\n\nWait, yes. Because if R is not correct, then the question being correct must be because A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P( (A OR P) AND NOT R ).\n\nSince all events are independent, because each person's correctness is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nP( (A OR P) AND NOT R ) = P(A OR P) * P(NOT R), because A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no, because (A OR P) is not independent of R. Wait, no, because the events A, R, P are independent. So, the events (A OR P) and R are independent as well. So, P( (A OR P) AND NOT R ) = P(A OR P) * P(NOT R).\n\nSo, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, P(NOT R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNext, P(A OR P) is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A OR P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P)=5/6.\n\nP(A OR P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6).\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5 is 12/60, 5/6 is 50/60. Sum is 62/60. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6) = 5/30 = 1/6 = 10/60.\n\nSo, 62/60 - 10/60 = 52/60 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(NOT R) = 1/3.\n\nMultiply these together: (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/(45).\n\nWait, 13/45 is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because the event is (A OR P) AND (NOT R). So, the question is correct because either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to it. So, the question is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct is 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nP(all incorrect) = P(not A) * P(not R) * P(not P).\n\nSo, P(all incorrect) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 4/(5*3*6) = 4/90 = 2/45.\n\nSo, P(question correct) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\n\nBut then, we need to subtract the cases where Roger is correct, because we don't want the cheating method.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of cheating (i.e., Roger is not correct).\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct and Roger is not correct.\n\nWhich is P(A OR P OR R) AND NOT R.\n\nWhich simplifies to P(A OR P) AND NOT R, because if R is not correct, then the question being correct is because A or P is correct.\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, so according to that, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to compute it is to find the probability that the question is correct (so at least one of A, R, P is correct) and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, P( (A OR P OR R) AND NOT R ) = P( (A OR P) AND NOT R ), which is the same as before.\n\nSo, that's 13/45.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA)1/18 \u22480.0556\n\nB)1/9\u22480.1111\n\nC)23/90\u22480.2556\n\nD)5/18\u22480.2778\n\nE)13/45\u22480.2889\n\nHmm. So, 13/45 is option E.\n\nBut let me think again. Another approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the sum of the probabilities that only Alan is correct, only Peter is correct, and both Alan and Peter are correct, with Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, the events are:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, each of these three scenarios contributes to the desired probability.\n\nLet's calculate each scenario.\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1*1*1)/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\nProbability: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4 *1 *5)/(5*3*6) = (20)/(90) = 2/9.\n\nWait, 4/5 *1/3 is 4/(15), multiplied by 5/6 is (4*5)/(15*6) = 20/(90) = 2/9.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1*1*5)/(5*3*6) = 5/(90) = 1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nConvert all to 90 denominators:\n\n1/90 = 1/90.\n\n2/9 = 20/90.\n\n1/18 = 5/90.\n\nAdding them up: 1 +20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.\n\nSo, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so that means we want the correct answer, but it shouldn't be because Roger cheated. So, only Alan and Peter's correct answers count towards the desired probability.\n\nLet me break down each person's probability:\n\n- Alan guesses randomly. His chance of being correct is 1/5.\n- Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3.\n- Peter does the work, so his probability is 5/6.\n\nBut wait, wait. The way the problem is phrased, each friend is attempting to answer the question. So, are they all answering independently? I think so, because it says each of them attempts to answer. So each of them has their own probability of being correct, and we need to find the cases where at least one of them is correct, but Roger is not the one who answered correctly.\n\nWait, no, the question is phrased as: the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that could mean that the question is correct, but Roger's answer (the cheating one) isn't the one that's correct. Or, perhaps, the question is correctly answered, but the method wasn't cheating. Hmm, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or perhaps, the question is answered correctly, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the scenario where the correct answer is achieved through non-cheating methods. So, the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to it via cheating. Wait, no, because each person is answering on their own. So, the question is answered correctly if at least one of them gets it right. But the 'but not via cheating' part probably means that we don't want the scenario where Roger is the one who got it right. So, the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think that refers to the method of answering. So, if the question is correct, but it wasn't because of cheating (i.e., Roger's answer isn't correct, but someone else's is). Alternatively, the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer didn't come from Roger's cheating. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me rephrase the question. We need the probability that the question is correct, but Roger's method (cheating) wasn't the cause. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan's guessing or Peter's work, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So, in other words, the event we're interested in is (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nWait, but no, because if the question is answered correctly, that could be through any of the three, but we don't want it to be because of Roger's cheating. So, we want the probability that the question is correct, but not because of Roger. So, the question is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is correct, it's because at least one of them answered correctly. So, the scenario where the question is correct, but Roger didn't answer correctly, so the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the question is correct (at least one of them correct) minus the probability that Roger is the one who answered correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger didn't. So, that the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter, and Roger is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the question is answered correctly in the sense that it's correct, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute to the correctness. Wait, but in reality, each of them is answering the question on their own. So, if the question is correct, it's because at least one of them is correct. But we don't want the case where Roger is correct, because that's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps we're to find the probability that the question is correct, but Roger did not answer it correctly. Because if the question is correct, it's because at least one person got it right. But if Roger's method is cheating, we don't want his contribution to the correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the question is correct, but Roger's answer is wrong.\n\nWait, I think that's the correct approach. So, the event we're interested in is: the question is correct (i.e., at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because if the question is correct, it's because at least one of the three is correct. But we don't want the case where Roger is correct. So, the correct probability is the probability that the question is correct and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute this, we can find the probability that the question is correct (i.e., at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter is correct) minus the probability that the question is correct and Roger is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the question is correct via Alan or Peter (i.e., the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if the question is correct, it's because at least one of the three is correct. But if we're only considering cases where the question is correct via Alan or Peter, then Roger is incorrect. So, that's exactly what we want.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, since all three are independent, we can compute it as [1 - P(Roger correct)] multiplied by [P(Alan correct OR Peter correct)].\n\nWait, no, because if we condition on Roger being incorrect, then the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct is the same as 1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter is correct).\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me model this as independent events.\n\nLet A = event Alan is correct.\n\nR = event Roger is correct.\n\nP = event Peter is correct.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is correct (A OR R OR P is true) but not via cheating. Hmm, perhaps via cheating refers to Roger's method, so we don't want R to be the cause. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that either A or P is correct, but R is not.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, that would be the probability that the question is correct, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the question is correct, and R is false.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A OR R OR P) minus P(R AND (A OR P OR not R) )? Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the question is correct (i.e., at least one of A, R, or P is correct) and R is not correct. So, the event is (A OR R OR P) AND NOT R. Which simplifies to (A OR P) AND NOT R.\n\nWait, yes. Because if R is not correct, then the question being correct must be because A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P( (A OR P) AND NOT R ).\n\nSince all events are independent, because each person's correctness is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nP( (A OR P) AND NOT R ) = P(A OR P) * P(NOT R), because A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no, because (A OR P) is not independent of R. Wait, no, because the events A, R, P are independent. So, the events (A OR P) and R are independent as well. So, P( (A OR P) AND NOT R ) = P(A OR P) * P(NOT R).\n\nSo, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, P(NOT R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNext, P(A OR P) is the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, or both.\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A OR P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P)=5/6.\n\nP(A OR P) = 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6).\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/5 is 12/60, 5/6 is 50/60. Sum is 62/60. Then subtract (1/5)(5/6) = 5/30 = 1/6 = 10/60.\n\nSo, 62/60 - 10/60 = 52/60 = 13/15.\n\nSo, P(A OR P) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(NOT R) = 1/3.\n\nMultiply these together: (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/(45).\n\nWait, 13/45 is option E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because the event is (A OR P) AND (NOT R). So, the question is correct because either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is correct, but Roger didn't contribute to it. So, the question is correct, but Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct is 1 - P(all incorrect).\n\nP(all incorrect) = P(not A) * P(not R) * P(not P).\n\nSo, P(all incorrect) = (4/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (4/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 4/(5*3*6) = 4/90 = 2/45.\n\nSo, P(question correct) = 1 - 2/45 = 43/45.\n\nBut then, we need to subtract the cases where Roger is correct, because we don't want the cheating method.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the question is correct, but it's not because of cheating (i.e., Roger is not correct).\n\nSo, the probability that the question is correct and Roger is not correct.\n\nWhich is P(A OR P OR R) AND NOT R.\n\nWhich simplifies to P(A OR P) AND NOT R, because if R is not correct, then the question being correct is because A or P is correct.\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, so according to that, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me think again.

Another approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, would be the sum of the probabilities that only Alan is correct, only Peter is correct, and both Alan and Peter are correct, with Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, the events are:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nSo, each of these three scenarios contributes to the desired probability.\n\nLet's calculate each scenario.\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger incorrect, Peter incorrect.\n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1*1*1)/(5*3*6) = 1/90.\n\n2. Peter correct, Roger incorrect, Alan incorrect.\n\nProbability: (4/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (4 *1 *5)/(5*3*6) = (20)/(90) = 2/9.\n\nWait, 4/5 *1/3 is 4/(15), multiplied by 5/6 is (4*5)/(15*6) = 20/(90) = 2/9.\n\n3. Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (5/6) = (1*1*5)/(5*3*6) = 5/(90) = 1/18.\n\nSo, the total probability is 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nConvert all to 90 denominators:\n\n1/90 = 1/90.\n\n2/9 = 20/90.\n\n1/18 = 5/90.\n\nAdding them up: 1 +20 +5 =26 \u2192 26/90 =13/45.\n\nSo, same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 13/45, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter, while excluding Roger's cheating.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read through it carefully again.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014each trying to answer a question on an exam. Each has a different probability of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that someone besides Roger (the cheater) answers correctly. Wait, but wait\u2014does that mean that only one person answers correctly, and it's not Roger? Or does it mean that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, regardless of how many people got it right?\n\nI think the problem is saying that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that person isn't Roger. Because cheating is Roger's method. So we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter gets it right, but Roger doesn't. Or maybe even all three could be right, but as long as Roger isn't the one who got it right. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So if Peter or Alan got it right, regardless of whether others did, as long as the correct answer is achieved without cheating (i.e., not Roger). Or wait, maybe the correct answer is achieved, and the method used wasn't cheating. So perhaps the scenario is that the question is answered correctly, but it's not because Roger cheated. So the correct answer could be due to Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, let me parse the question again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So the event we're interested in is the question being correct, and Roger didn't contribute to it. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter. Hmm, maybe the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating, regardless of whether others also got it right. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the one who answered it correctly didn't cheat. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. But the way the question is phrased, I think it's about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. Or perhaps it's that the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat, and the cheater (Roger) didn't contribute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but Roger didn't answer correctly. Wait, no, because the question says \"not via cheating.\" So maybe the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. Wait, no, because the question is about the answer being correct regardless of who answered it. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who did it. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So if either Alan or Peter gets it right, that counts, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the question is answered correctly. So the event is that the correct answer is given. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not Roger who answered it. So the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but in reality, all three are answering the same question. So if Alan or Peter get it right, the question is correctly answered, and if Roger also got it right, but via cheating, that's a different scenario. So the problem is probably asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via Roger's cheating. So the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Wait, no, because if all three get it right, then the correct answer is achieved, but it's also via Roger. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who answered it. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because the question is about the answer being correct, regardless of who did it. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer was achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it differently. The question is, what's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, if Alan or Peter got it right, that's acceptable, but if Roger got it right, that's not. But wait, if the question is answered correctly, it's possible that one or more of them got it right. So the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, but it's not Roger who provided it. Or perhaps, that the correct answer is given, and the person who got it right did so without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that the question is correctly answered by someone, and that person is either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that the correct answer is achieved, and it's because Alan or Peter got it right, and not because of Roger. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger's cheating. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the correct answer is given, and it's not Roger who got it right. So the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible approaches. Maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by someone other than Roger.\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about the exact wording: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter's methods, not Roger's. So, if the correct answer is given, it's because either Alan or Peter answered correctly, not because Roger did.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who got it right. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the problem is that all three are answering the same question, so it's possible that multiple people got it right. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and whether or not Roger got it right is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by someone, regardless of whether others also got it right, then the correct answer is achieved if at least one of the three got it right. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via cheating, i.e., Roger got it right. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if all three get it right, then the correct answer is achieved by all three, including Roger. But we want the correct answer to be achieved, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) didn't involve cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model all possible scenarios and see which ones meet the condition.\n\nLet me break down the possibilities:\n\nEach person can either answer correctly or not. So, for each, we have two possibilities.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8, but since each has their own probability, it's not equally likely.\n\nThe question is about the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not Roger who provided it.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given, but the way it's given (i.e., via cheating or not) is the concern. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to achieve it was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan's guessing or Peter's calculations, not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is achieved, and it's via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, and the person who got it right didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't answer correctly. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is given, and the person who gave it wasn't Roger.\n\nWait, but the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, but not because of cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, if the correct answer is given by someone, the question is correct. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, no, because the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right. So, the correct answer is given if any of the three got it right. But the problem wants the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, but the method used was not cheating, which would mean that it's Alan or Peter who answered correctly.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given, and it's by someone else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the event we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but Roger did not answer correctly. So, the correct answer is given, and Roger didn't contribute to it. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the correct answer could have been given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not achieved via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's okay. The problem is just that it's not via Roger.\n\nHmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to model this with probabilities.\n\nLet me denote the events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the question is correctly answered, but not via R's method (cheating). So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either A or P.\n\nWait, but the question is about the answer being correct, regardless of who answered it, as long as it's not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by A or P, that's acceptable. If the correct answer is achieved by R, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. So, the correct answer is given, but not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, but not by R.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, but it's not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone else (A or P).\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, but not by R. Or perhaps, the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to get it wasn't cheating, which would be the case if A or P answered correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that it was answered correctly by either A or P, regardless of R.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered it correctly) wasn't cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via A or P. So, the event is that the correct answer is given by A or P, and perhaps R did not contribute.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by A, then regardless of R's answer, the question is correct. Similarly for P. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, and it's not achieved via cheating, so the correct answer is given by either A or P.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R also got it right, then the correct answer is given, but it's not via R's cheating.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's given by either A or P, but not by R.\n\nWait, no, because if all three are correct, then the correct answer is given, and it's via A, P, and R. But the problem is about whether it's not via cheating, which would be the case if A or P got it right. So, as long as the correct answer is given, regardless of whether R got it right, as long as at least one of A or P got it right.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R's cheating, which would mean that either A or P got it right.\n\nBut wait, the problem could be considering that the correct answer is given, but the method used to get it was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is given if at least one of A, R, or P got it right. So, the event that the correct answer is given is A \u2228 R \u2228 P. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R). So, that simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if R is true, then the correct answer is given via cheating. So, the event we want is the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to model the probability that the correct answer is given, but the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R did not contribute.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. Let me model all possible scenarios where the correct answer is given, and it's not via R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's via A or P. So, the probability that A or P answered correctly, and regardless of R.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R also got it right, then the correct answer is still given, and it's via A or P. So, the event is that either A or P answered correctly, regardless of R.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P). But wait, that's not quite right, because if R is the only one who answered correctly, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P, not by R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and not by R.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the correct answer is given by A or P, but R didn't get it right. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because if R also got it right, then the correct answer is given, but via R. So, we want the correct answer to be given, but it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer. Because if the correct answer is given by A or P, even if R also got it right, it's still given via A or P, so it's acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is given by R alone, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be given by multiple people. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and at least one of A or P got it right.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that the correct answer is given only by R. But wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R, it's acceptable. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P). But we need to be careful because if R is the only one who got it right, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of whether R got it right.\n\nWait, but if R got it right, and A or P didn't, then the correct answer is given via R, which we don't want. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that R is the only one who got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P).

So, the probability that the correct answer is given is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P).\n\nBut we want the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R). Which simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. So, the correct answer is given, and R did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if R didn't get it right, then the correct answer must have been given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) and R is wrong. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R did not answer correctly. So, the correct answer is given, and R is wrong.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and R is wrong. Because if R is wrong, then the correct answer must have been given by A or P.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) given that R is wrong.\n\nWait, no, because if R is wrong, then the correct answer could have been given by A or P. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and R is wrong.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P \u2227 \u00acR). Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and R is not the one who got it right.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but if R is not correct, then the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and R didn't get it right. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by either A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and R is not the one who got it right.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R is also correct, then the correct answer is given via both A/P and R. So, in that case, the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not given via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this? Because the correct answer is given if A, R, or P is correct. So, the event that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R, is the event that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's a bit abstract. Let me try to model it with probabilities.\n\nThe correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). Wait, no, because the events are not independent. Wait, no, the correctness of A, R, and P are independent events.\n\nWait, because each person's answer is independent of the others. So, the probability that R is incorrect is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3.\n\nThe probability that A or P is correct is P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, P(\u00acA) = 4/5, P(\u00acP) = 1/6. So, P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that A or P is correct is 13/15.\n\nThe probability that R is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the joint probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given, and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R didn't get it right.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because another way to think about it is that the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15. But this includes cases where R is correct or not. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via R.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by R, then the method was cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut since A, R, and P are independent, the joint probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)13/45.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read through it carefully again.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014each trying to answer a question on an exam. Each has a different probability of getting the answer right. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that someone besides Roger (the cheater) answers correctly. Wait, but wait\u2014does that mean that only one person answers correctly, and it's not Roger? Or does it mean that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, regardless of how many people got it right?\n\nI think the problem is saying that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that person isn't Roger. Because cheating is Roger's method. So we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter gets it right, but Roger doesn't. Or maybe even all three could be right, but as long as Roger isn't the one who got it right. Wait, no\u2014the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So if Peter or Alan got it right, regardless of whether others did, as long as the correct answer is achieved without cheating (i.e., not Roger). Or wait, maybe the correct answer is achieved, and the method used wasn't cheating. So perhaps the scenario is that the question is answered correctly, but it's not because Roger cheated. So the correct answer could be due to Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, let me parse the question again: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So the event we're interested in is the question being correct, and Roger didn't contribute to it. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter. Hmm, maybe the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating, regardless of whether others also got it right. Or perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the one who answered it correctly didn't cheat. Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. But the way the question is phrased, I think it's about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. Or perhaps it's that the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat, and the cheater (Roger) didn't contribute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but Roger didn't answer correctly. Wait, no, because the question says \"not via cheating.\" So maybe the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't. Wait, no, because the question is about the answer being correct regardless of who answered it. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who did it. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is achieved by someone who isn't cheating. So if either Alan or Peter gets it right, that counts, regardless of what Roger does.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the question is answered correctly. So the event is that the correct answer is given. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So perhaps, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not Roger who answered it. So the correct answer could have been given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but in reality, all three are answering the same question. So if Alan or Peter get it right, the question is correctly answered, and if Roger also got it right, but via cheating, that's a different scenario. So the problem is probably asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via Roger's cheating. So the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Wait, no, because if all three get it right, then the correct answer is achieved, but it's also via Roger. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who answered it. So the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because the question is about the answer being correct, regardless of who did it. So perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer was achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it differently. The question is, what's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, in other words, the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, if Alan or Peter got it right, that's acceptable, but if Roger got it right, that's not. But wait, if the question is answered correctly, it's possible that one or more of them got it right. So the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, but it's not Roger who provided it. Or perhaps, that the correct answer is given, and the person who got it right did so without cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the probability that the question is correctly answered by someone, and that person is either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to look at it is that the correct answer is achieved, and it's because Alan or Peter got it right, and not because of Roger. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger's cheating. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the correct answer is given, and it's not Roger who got it right. So the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible approaches. Maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by someone other than Roger.\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about the exact wording: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved through Alan or Peter's methods, not Roger's. So, if the correct answer is given, it's because either Alan or Peter answered correctly, not because Roger did.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability that the correct answer is achieved, and it's not Roger who got it right. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but the problem is that all three are answering the same question, so it's possible that multiple people got it right. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and whether or not Roger got it right is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by someone, regardless of whether others also got it right, then the correct answer is achieved if at least one of the three got it right. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via cheating, i.e., Roger got it right. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because if all three get it right, then the correct answer is achieved by all three, including Roger. But we want the correct answer to be achieved, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) didn't involve cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model all possible scenarios and see which ones meet the condition.\n\nLet me break down the possibilities:\n\nEach person can either answer correctly or not. So, for each, we have two possibilities.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8, but since each has their own probability, it's not equally likely.\n\nThe question is about the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not Roger who provided it.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is given, but the way it's given (i.e., via cheating or not) is the concern. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to achieve it was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan's guessing or Peter's calculations, not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is achieved, and it's via either Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is achieved, and the person who got it right didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't answer correctly. Or, perhaps, the correct answer is given, and the person who gave it wasn't Roger.\n\nWait, but the question says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, but not because of cheating, meaning that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But wait, if the correct answer is given by someone, the question is correct. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, no, because the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right. So, the correct answer is given if any of the three got it right. But the problem wants the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is given, but the method used was not cheating, which would mean that it's Alan or Peter who answered correctly.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given, and it's by someone else, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's not because of Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the event we're interested in is that the question is answered correctly, but Roger did not answer correctly. So, the correct answer is given, and Roger didn't contribute to it. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the correct answer could have been given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and the correct answer was achieved without cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not achieved via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by both Alan and Peter, then it's okay. The problem is just that it's not via Roger.\n\nHmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to model this with probabilities.\n\nLet me denote the events:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the question is correctly answered, but not via R's method (cheating). So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either A or P.\n\nWait, but the question is about the answer being correct, regardless of who answered it, as long as it's not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved by A or P, that's acceptable. If the correct answer is achieved by R, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people. So, the correct answer is given, but not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, but not by R.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, but it's not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by someone else (A or P).\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, but not by R. Or perhaps, the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct answer is given, and the method used to get it wasn't cheating, which would be the case if A or P answered correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that it was answered correctly by either A or P, regardless of R.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered it correctly) wasn't cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved via A or P. So, the event is that the correct answer is given by A or P, and perhaps R did not contribute.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is given by A, then regardless of R's answer, the question is correct. Similarly for P. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, and it's not achieved via cheating, so the correct answer is given by either A or P.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer is given, and the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R also got it right, then the correct answer is given, but it's not via R's cheating.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is given, and it's given by either A or P, but not by R.\n\nWait, no, because if all three are correct, then the correct answer is given, and it's via A, P, and R. But the problem is about whether it's not via cheating, which would be the case if A or P got it right. So, as long as the correct answer is given, regardless of whether R got it right, as long as at least one of A or P got it right.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via R's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R's cheating, which would mean that either A or P got it right.\n\nBut wait, the problem could be considering that the correct answer is given, but the method used to get it was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is given if at least one of A, R, or P got it right. So, the event that the correct answer is given is A \u2228 R \u2228 P. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R). So, that simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R).\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if R is true, then the correct answer is given via cheating. So, the event we want is the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to model the probability that the correct answer is given, but the method used (i.e., the person who answered correctly) was not cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R did not contribute.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach. Let me model all possible scenarios where the correct answer is given, and it's not via R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and it's via A or P. So, the probability that A or P answered correctly, and regardless of R.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R also got it right, then the correct answer is still given, and it's via A or P. So, the event is that either A or P answered correctly, regardless of R.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P). But wait, that's not quite right, because if R is the only one who answered correctly, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P, not by R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and not by R.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the correct answer is given by A or P, but R didn't get it right. So, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because if R also got it right, then the correct answer is given, but via R. So, we want the correct answer to be given, but it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer. Because if the correct answer is given by A or P, even if R also got it right, it's still given via A or P, so it's acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R's answer, that's acceptable. But if the correct answer is given by R alone, that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be given by multiple people. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and at least one of A or P got it right.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that the correct answer is given only by R. But wait, no, because if the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of R, it's acceptable. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P, regardless of R's answer.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P). But we need to be careful because if R is the only one who got it right, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, but it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, regardless of whether R got it right.\n\nWait, but if R got it right, and A or P didn't, then the correct answer is given via R, which we don't want. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that R is the only one who got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by at least one of A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P). But wait, that's the probability that either A or P got it right, regardless of R. But the correct answer is given if any of them got it right. So, the probability that the correct answer is given is P(A \u2228 R \u2228 P).\n\nBut we want the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the event is (A \u2228 R \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00ac(R). Which simplifies to (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR. So, the correct answer is given, and R did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if R didn't get it right, then the correct answer must have been given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) and R is wrong. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R did not answer correctly. So, the correct answer is given, and R is wrong.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and R is wrong. Because if R is wrong, then the correct answer must have been given by A or P.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the probability we're looking for is P(A \u2228 P) given that R is wrong.\n\nWait, no, because if R is wrong, then the correct answer could have been given by A or P. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and R is wrong.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P \u2227 \u00acR). Hmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and R is not the one who got it right.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but if R is not correct, then the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want. So, the event is that the correct answer is given, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given, and R didn't get it right. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given, and it's given by either A or P. So, the correct answer is given, and R is not the one who got it right.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if the correct answer is given by A or P, but R is also correct, then the correct answer is given via both A/P and R. So, in that case, the correct answer is given via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is given, and it's not given via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but how do we compute this? Because the correct answer is given if A, R, or P is correct. So, the event that the correct answer is given, and it's not via R, is the event that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nWait, but that's a bit abstract. Let me try to model it with probabilities.\n\nThe correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR). Wait, no, because the events are not independent. Wait, no, the correctness of A, R, and P are independent events.\n\nWait, because each person's answer is independent of the others. So, the probability that R is incorrect is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3.\n\nThe probability that A or P is correct is P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, P(\u00acA) = 4/5, P(\u00acP) = 1/6. So, P(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acP) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo, the probability that A or P is correct is 13/15.\n\nThe probability that R is incorrect is 1/3.\n\nBut wait, the events are independent, so the joint probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but that's the probability that A or P is correct and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given, and R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R didn't get it right.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because another way to think about it is that the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given, and R didn't get it right.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer is E)13/45.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the correct answer is given, and it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given by A or P.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15. But this includes cases where R is correct or not. But we need to exclude the cases where the correct answer is given via R.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer is given by R, then the method was cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is given, but not via R. So, the correct answer is given by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nBut since A, R, and P are independent, the joint probability is P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)13/45.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. \n\n### Key Information:\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Correct Answer via Alan or Peter**: The probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   P(A \\cup P) = 1 - P(\\neg A \\cap \\neg P)\n   \\]\n   Since Alan and Peter's answers are independent:\n   \\[\n   P(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = \\frac{4}{5}, \\quad P(\\neg P) = 1 - P(P) = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(\\neg A \\cap \\neg P) = P(\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg P) = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(A \\cup P) = 1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Roger's Probability of Being Incorrect**: The probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined Probability**: The probability that the correct answer is given by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect, is:\n   \\[\n   P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nSo, there are three friends: Alan, Roger, and Peter. They each have different probabilities of answering a question correctly. But the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, let me break this down. Each of them attempts to answer the question, right? So all three are trying, but each has their own way. Alan is just guessing, Roger is cheating, and Peter is working honestly.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, that means either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't use cheating to get it right. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think it's the probability that the correct answer was given, but it wasn't due to cheating. So, it could have been Alan's guess or Peter's correct calculation, but Roger didn't cheat to get it right. Or maybe the question is that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning either Alan or Peter got it, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. Hmm, I need to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the event where the question is correct, but the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly or Peter doing it right, but not by Roger cheating. So, the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is given, but it's either Alan or Peter who did it, not Roger through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger's cheating method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the question is correctly answered, but the correct answer isn't obtained through cheating. So, we have to find the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or, maybe the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right by cheating.\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\"\n\nAh, so we want the cases where the answer is correct, but it wasn't because Roger cheated. So, the correct answer is achieved through either Alan or Peter, not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, no. Because all three are trying to answer. So, the question is answered correctly by at least one of them. But we want the cases where it's correct, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is given, but it's not via Roger's cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Or, the correct answer is given, and it's not Roger who got it through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it via cheating.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved, and the method used wasn't cheating. So, that would mean that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But wait, if Roger uses cheating, he could have a higher chance, but if he didn't cheat, he might have a lower chance. Wait, but the problem says that Roger cheats, which gives him a 2/3 chance. So, perhaps in this scenario, we're considering that Roger did cheat, but we don't want the correct answer to be due to his cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's correct via either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, no, because the question is about the correctness of the answer, regardless of who got it. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly, or Peter working correctly, but not by Roger cheating.\n\nWait, but all three are attempting the question. So, the question being answered correctly could be because any of them got it right. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased, it's about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because all three are answering, so the question can be answered correctly in several ways. The correct answer is achieved if at least one of them got it right. But we're to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via cheating, i.e., Roger's method. So, the correct answer was achieved either by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, what if both Alan and Roger got it right? Then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well as via guessing. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we need to exclude that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me outline all possible scenarios.\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter gets it right. But we want the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, to calculate this, we can compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, minus the cases where it's achieved by both Alan and Roger, or both Peter and Roger, because in those cases, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger's method) as well.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger, then it's correct without cheating.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by any of them. So, the correct answer is achieved, and we want to exclude the cases where it was achieved by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the events.\n\nLet me define:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly (cheating). P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but that's a bit ambiguous. Another interpretation is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, so either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. But wait, if Roger also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is achieved if any of them gets it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan, or by Roger, or by Peter. But we're to exclude the cases where it was achieved by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if both Alan and Roger got it right, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the correct answer is achieved if at least one of them is correct. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by any of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others cheated or not. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But no, because if Roger also gets it right, that's via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it is achieved by either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it right, then it's not via cheating. Because if Roger got it right, then it's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right. So, the probability that (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because even if Roger didn't get it right, if Alan or Peter did, the correct answer is achieved. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. But the condition is that the correct answer is achieved without involving Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be achieved by all three, but we don't want it to be achieved by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is achieved if any of them gets it right. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A, R, or P is true. But we want the correct answer to be achieved, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of R's status. But wait, if R is also correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, minus the cases where it's achieved by all three (A, R, and P). But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of R's status. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not necessarily excluding cases where R also got it right. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via at least one of A or P, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right.\n\nNo, because if R also got it right, the correct answer was achieved via R as well, which is cheating. So, to ensure that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating, we must have that the correct answer was achieved by either A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nAlternatively, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not achieve it.\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, P(A) = 1/5, P(R) = 2/3, P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe can model the events as independent, I assume, since each person's answer is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let's compute P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nWhich is equal to P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P( \u00acR ), since R and the others are independent? Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not independent. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as P( (A \u2228 P) and not R ).\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's model it as:\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) only if A, P, and R are independent, which I think they are.\n\nWait, but wait, are the events A, P, R independent? The problem says that each person answers independently, so yes. So, A and P are independent of R.\n\nSo, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not is equal to P(A or P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A and P are independent of R, the events (A or P) and \u00acR are independent.\n\nSo, let's compute P(A or P) first.\n\nP(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A and P) = P(A) * P(P) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = (6/30 + 25/30 - 5/30) )= (26/30) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A or P) and \u00acR ) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/(15*3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but that's 13/45, which is one of the options (option E).\n\nBut wait, is that the correct approach? Because the problem is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either A or P, and R didn't give it.\n\nWait, but that's what I just calculated. So, 13/45 is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose that the correct answer is achieved by all three. So, A, R, and P are all correct. Then, the correct answer is achieved, but it was achieved via cheating (R), so we shouldn't include that scenario. But in my calculation, I'm including the cases where A or P are correct, regardless of R. So, if R is correct, but A or P are also correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, in that case, even though A or P got it right, the correct answer was also achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should exclude the cases where R is correct. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so it's not what we're looking for. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating only if R is incorrect, and the correct answer is achieved by A or P.\n\nWait, that's what I did. Because I calculated the probability that (A or P) are correct, and R is incorrect. So, that should give us the correct scenario.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via A or P, not via R. So, that's the scenario we're looking for.\n\nSo, according to that calculation, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to compute all possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That would be the cases where R is incorrect, and either A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved without cheating when:\n\n- R is incorrect, and A is correct (regardless of P), or\n\n- R is incorrect, and P is correct (regardless of A), or\n\n- R is incorrect, and both A and P are correct.\n\nSo, the total probability is P(R incorrect) multiplied by [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)].\n\nWhich is (1/3) * [ (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) ) ]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1, which can't be right. Wait, no. Because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.833. So, 0.2 + 0.833 is about 1.033. But since the events are not mutually exclusive, that's possible. Wait, but when you add probabilities, it's okay for them to sum to more than one if they are not mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because when you have P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P), which for independent events is 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30 -5/30 )=26/30=13/15.\n\nSo, the same as before.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/3) * (13/15) =13/45.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. What is the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating? So, the correct answer is achieved via either A or P.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved if A is correct, or P is correct, or both. But we don't want the correct answer to be achieved via R. So, the correct answer is achieved via A or P, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but if R also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, which we don't want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via A or P, and not via R. But wait, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via A or P. So, regardless of whether R got it right, as long as the correct answer was achieved by A or P, we count it. But that would include cases where R also got it right, but the correct answer was achieved via A or P.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via cheating. So, regardless of whether others cheated, the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, if A or P got it right, regardless of R's result, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but then if R also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want to count. So, we have to exclude the cases where R got it right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it was not achieved through cheating. So, it's given via A or P, but not via R. So, in cases where R got it right, even if A or P got it right, it's via cheating, so we don't count those cases.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if A got it right and R didn't, then the correct answer was achieved via A, which is non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via non-cheating.\n\nBut if A and R both got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (R's method), so we don't want to count that scenario.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the cases where the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right. So, that's the same as P( (A or P) and not R ).\n\nWhich is what I computed earlier as 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be E)13/45.\n",

Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, let me break this down. Each of them attempts to answer the question, right? So all three are trying, but each has their own way.

So, that means either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't use cheating to get it right. Or wait, no. Wait, the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, I think it's the probability that the correct answer was given, but it wasn't due to cheating. So, it could have been Alan's guess or Peter's correct calculation, but Roger didn't cheat to get it right. Or maybe the question is that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning either Alan or Peter got it, but Roger didn't. Or perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating. Hmm, I need to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the event where the question is correct, but the method isn't cheating.

But wait, if Roger uses cheating, he could have a higher chance, but if he didn't cheat, he might have a lower chance. Wait, but the problem says that Roger cheats, which gives him a 2/3 chance. So, perhaps in this scenario, we're considering that Roger did cheat, but we don't want the correct answer to be due to his cheating.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the method wasn't cheating. So, it's correct via either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, no, because the question is about the correctness of the answer, regardless of who got it. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan guessing correctly, or Peter working correctly, but not by Roger cheating.\n\nWait, but all three are attempting the question. So, the question being answered correctly could be because any of them got it right. But we want the probability that the correct answer is given, but not through Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased, it's about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because all three are answering, so the question can be answered correctly in several ways. The correct answer is achieved if at least one of them got it right. But we're to exclude the cases where the correct answer was achieved via cheating, i.e., Roger's method. So, the correct answer was achieved either by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, what if both Alan and Roger got it right? Then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well as via guessing. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so we need to exclude that scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the method used wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer was given by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is given, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me outline all possible scenarios.\n\nThe question is answered correctly if at least one of Alan, Roger, or Peter gets it right. But we want the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, to calculate this, we can compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, minus the cases where it's achieved by both Alan and Roger, or both Peter and Roger, because in those cases, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger's method) as well.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger, then it's correct without cheating.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by any of them. So, the correct answer is achieved, and we want to exclude the cases where it was achieved by Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the events.\n\nLet me define:\n\nA: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n\nR: Roger answers correctly (cheating). P(R) = 2/3.\n\nP: Peter answers correctly. P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe are to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but that's a bit ambiguous. Another interpretation is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, so either Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved, but the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. But wait, if Roger also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the question is whether the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is achieved if any of them gets it right. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan, or by Roger, or by Peter. But we're to exclude the cases where it was achieved by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if both Alan and Roger got it right, then the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because the correct answer is achieved if at least one of them is correct. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by any of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of whether others cheated or not. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger does. But no, because if Roger also gets it right, that's via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and it is achieved by either Alan or Peter, not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but Roger didn't get it right, then it's not via cheating. Because if Roger got it right, then it's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right. So, the probability that (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but Roger didn't get it right.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because even if Roger didn't get it right, if Alan or Peter did, the correct answer is achieved. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. But the condition is that the correct answer is achieved without involving Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nWe need the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan OR Peter, but not by Roger. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be achieved by all three, but we don't want it to be achieved by Roger.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer is achieved if any of them gets it right. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A, R, or P is true. But we want the correct answer to be achieved, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of R's status. But wait, if R is also correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, minus the cases where it's achieved by all three (A, R, and P). But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by A or P, regardless of R's status. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not necessarily excluding cases where R also got it right. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved via at least one of A or P, but not via R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right.\n\nNo, because if R also got it right, the correct answer was achieved via R as well, which is cheating. So, to ensure that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating, we must have that the correct answer was achieved by either A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability we're looking for is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nAlternatively, it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not achieve it.\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, P(A) = 1/5, P(R) = 2/3, P(P) =5/6.\n\nWe can model the events as independent, I assume, since each person's answer is independent of the others.\n\nSo, let's compute P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ).\n\nWhich is equal to P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P( \u00acR ), since R and the others are independent? Wait, no, because (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR are not independent. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as P( (A \u2228 P) and not R ).\n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's model it as:\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) and \u00acR ) = P( (A \u2228 P) ) * P(\u00acR) only if A, P, and R are independent, which I think they are.\n\nWait, but wait, are the events A, P, R independent? The problem says that each person answers independently, so yes. So, A and P are independent of R.\n\nSo, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not is equal to P(A or P) * P(\u00acR).\n\nBecause A and P are independent of R, the events (A or P) and \u00acR are independent.\n\nSo, let's compute P(A or P) first.\n\nP(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P).\n\nSince A and P are independent, P(A and P) = P(A) * P(P) = (1/5)(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/6) = (6/30 + 25/30 - 5/30) )= (26/30) = 13/15.\n\nThen, P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A or P) and \u00acR ) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/(15*3) =13/45.\n\nWait, but that's 13/45, which is one of the options (option E).\n\nBut wait, is that the correct approach? Because the problem is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is given, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer is given by either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer is given by either A or P, and R didn't give it.\n\nWait, but that's what I just calculated. So, 13/45 is option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose that the correct answer is achieved by all three. So, A, R, and P are all correct. Then, the correct answer is achieved, but it was achieved via cheating (R), so we shouldn't include that scenario. But in my calculation, I'm including the cases where A or P are correct, regardless of R. So, if R is correct, but A or P are also correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, in that case, even though A or P got it right, the correct answer was also achieved via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should exclude the cases where R is correct. Because if R is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, so it's not what we're looking for. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating only if R is incorrect, and the correct answer is achieved by A or P.\n\nWait, that's what I did. Because I calculated the probability that (A or P) are correct, and R is incorrect. So, that should give us the correct scenario.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but R is incorrect. So, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via A or P, not via R. So, that's the scenario we're looking for.\n\nSo, according to that calculation, the probability is 13/45, which is option E.\n\nBut let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to compute all possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That would be the cases where R is incorrect, and either A or P is correct.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved without cheating when:\n\n- R is incorrect, and A is correct (regardless of P), or\n\n- R is incorrect, and P is correct (regardless of A), or\n\n- R is incorrect, and both A and P are correct.\n\nSo, the total probability is P(R incorrect) multiplied by [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)].\n\nWhich is (1/3) * [ (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) ) ]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, 6/30 +25/30 =31/30. But wait, that's more than 1, which can't be right. Wait, no. Because 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is ~0.833. So, 0.2 + 0.833 is about 1.033. But since the events are not mutually exclusive, that's possible. Wait, but when you add probabilities, it's okay for them to sum to more than one if they are not mutually exclusive.\n\nWait, but wait, no, because when you have P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P), which for independent events is 1/5 +5/6 - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 +25/30) - (5/30) )= (31/30 -5/30 )=26/30=13/15.\n\nSo, the same as before.\n\nSo, the total probability is (1/3) * (13/15) =13/45.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 13/45. So, the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. What is the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating? So, the correct answer is achieved via either A or P.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved if A is correct, or P is correct, or both. But we don't want the correct answer to be achieved via R. So, the correct answer is achieved via A or P, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but if R also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well, which we don't want. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved via A or P, and not via R. But wait, that's what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, and the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via A or P. So, regardless of whether R got it right, as long as the correct answer was achieved by A or P, we count it. But that would include cases where R also got it right, but the correct answer was achieved via A or P.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't via cheating. So, regardless of whether others cheated, the correct answer was achieved via a non-cheating method. So, if A or P got it right, regardless of R's result, the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating.\n\nWait, but then if R also got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via both cheating and non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want to count. So, we have to exclude the cases where R got it right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is given, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is given, and it was not achieved through cheating. So, it's given via A or P, but not via R. So, in cases where R got it right, even if A or P got it right, it's via cheating, so we don't count those cases.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if A got it right and R didn't, then the correct answer was achieved via A, which is non-cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer is achieved, and it's via non-cheating.\n\nBut if A and R both got it right, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating (R's method), so we don't want to count that scenario.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the cases where the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R did not get it right. So, that's the same as P( (A or P) and not R ).\n\nWhich is what I computed earlier as 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer should be E)13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we analyze the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. The probabilities of each individual answering correctly are as follows:\n\n- **Alan (A):** \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger (R):** \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter (P):** \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Key Events:\n1. **Correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter:** This is represented by the event \\( A \\cup P \\).\n2. **Correct answer is not achieved by Roger:** This is represented by \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nThe probability we are seeking is \\( P((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) \\). Since the events are independent, we can compute this as:\n\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R)\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( P(A \\cup P) \\)\nUsing the formula for the union of two independent events:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) \\cdot P(P)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( P(\\neg R) \\)\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\nNow, calculate \\( P((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) \\):\n\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{45}}\n\\]\n\nANSWER: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014trying to answer an exam question. Each has a different probability of getting it right. The problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that someone other than Roger (the cheater) got it right, right? Or wait, no, the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't, because if Roger got it right by cheating, that's not considered the correct way in this context.\n\nWait, no, the question says the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger did or didn't. Because if Roger got it right by cheating, that's via cheating. So the scenario we're interested in is the question being correct, but without Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer being due to Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that someone got it right without cheating, but the overall correct answer is correct. So, the correct answer is correct, but it's not because of cheating. Wait, no, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nOh, wait. So the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter. So the event we're looking for is that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or both, but not Roger. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if Roger didn't cheat, and someone else did, the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone not cheating. So, the correct answer is correct, but it wasn't due to cheating. So, the correct answer is correct because either Alan or Peter got it right, not because Roger cheated and got it right.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rephrase.\n\nEach person is trying to answer the question. Alan has a 1/5 chance of being correct (random guess). Roger has a 2/3 chance because he cheated. Peter has a 5/6 chance because he did the work. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But wait, what if all three are correct? No, because the question is about the event where the answer is correct, regardless of who got it right, but not via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer is obtained by either Alan or Peter. But wait, if Roger's method is cheating and he gets it right, then the correct answer was obtained through cheating. So, the event we're interested in is when the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, that can't be right, because if the correct answer is achieved by any of the three, but we want it to not be via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If the correct answer is achieved by someone, but if it's via cheating (Roger), then it's not the desired case. So, the desired case is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But in reality, the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them gets it right, but we have to make sure that it's not because of Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's model it more formally.\n\nEach person can either get the question right or wrong. The events are independent.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. Which means, either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger did not. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly, but the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, or Peter, or both. But if Roger got it right, then that's cheating, so we don't count that case. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is a single event. So, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is correct, and it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. So, the correct answer is correct, and it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being achieved without any cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the correct answer can be achieved by any of the three. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, which would be if Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer could be achieved by all three. So, we need the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The correct answer is achieved in the exam. Now, the question is, what's the probability that this correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat, meaning that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through the cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, we need the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is not allowed in this scenario.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. But in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan). So, the problem is about the overall correct answer, but not via cheating. So, perhaps we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved if at least one of them gets it right. But in some cases, it's achieved via cheating (Roger), and in others, via non-cheating (Alan or Peter).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it's not achieved through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by someone else, Roger could also have gotten it right through cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who got it right. But that's not necessarily the case. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan). But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That would be when at least one of Alan or Peter got the correct answer, regardless of Roger's result. Because if Alan or Peter got it right, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the problem is, the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer was achieved without Roger being involved. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but that correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because the correct answer is a single event. So, perhaps the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is not desired. So, perhaps we need to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut how can that be? Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, it doesn't matter if Roger also got it right. The correct answer is achieved via Alan (non-cheating). So, perhaps the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, or Peter, or both. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nBut that's not entirely correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by someone, it's either by Alan, Peter, or Roger. So, to ensure that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, it must have been achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, it doesn't matter if Roger also got it right. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should model this using probabilities.\n\nThe events are independent. Let me denote:\n\nA: Alan is correct (prob 1/5)\nR: Roger is correct (prob 2/3)\nP: Peter is correct (prob 5/6)\n\nWe need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is (A or P) and not via cheating. So, perhaps the event is (A or P) and not R. Wait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, we need the correct answer to be achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of others.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the correct answer is achieved, and the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that the correct answer was achieved via cheating. Wait, no, that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by more than one person. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A, R, or P is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, i.e., it's achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, how do we handle that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, which is fine. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also achieved by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A or P is correct, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because the correct answer could also be achieved by R, which is via cheating. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating, so perhaps the correct answer must be achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, no, because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, the problem is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating, meaning it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which is Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also achieved by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P), which is 1 - P(not A and not P). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(not A) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5\nP(not P) = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6\nSince A and P are independent, P(not A and not P) = (4/5) * (1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the options don't include 13/15. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which is Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought earlier. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15 \u2248 0.8667, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would be Alan or Peter, and the correct answer is achieved regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is a single event. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's achieved by both Alan and Roger, because in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by exactly Alan or exactly Peter.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach either.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The correct answer is achieved if at least one of the three is correct. But we want the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating, which could be if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nBut that's not correct because if A is correct and R is correct, then the correct answer is achieved via both A and R, which includes cheating. So, to have the correct answer achieved without cheating, we need that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then it's via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would require that either A or P is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not right because even if R is correct, the correct answer is achieved via cheating. So, the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat (A or P), and not by R.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the correct answer can be achieved by multiple people. So, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of A or P, and not achieved by R. But that's not correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then it's achieved via cheating as well.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Since A and P are independent.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) =13/15.\n\nBut 13/15 is not among the options, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options: E is 13/45, which is less than 1/3. So, perhaps I'm not considering the fact that the correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat, but also that it's not achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and not by R.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that?\n\nThe correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R )\n\nAlternatively, since the correct answer can be achieved by any of them, but we want it to be achieved by A or P, and not by R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by A and P, but R is incorrect. Or by A alone, R incorrect. Or by P alone, R incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R )\n\nWhich can be written as P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R), since A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no. Because R is independent of A and P, so P(not R) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nAh, that's option E:13/45.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but Roger is not correct. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(not A and not P) = 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) = 1/3.\n\nSince events are independent, multiply them: 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we want the correct answer to be achieved by A or P, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014trying to answer an exam question. Each has a different probability of getting it right. The problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to find the probability that someone other than Roger (the cheater) got it right, right? Or wait, no, the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't, because if Roger got it right by cheating, that's not considered the correct way in this context.\n\nWait, no, the question says the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So maybe it's the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether Roger did or didn't. Because if Roger got it right by cheating, that's via cheating. So the scenario we're interested in is the question being correct, but without Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer being due to Alan or Peter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that someone got it right without cheating, but the overall correct answer is correct. So, the correct answer is correct, but it's not because of cheating. Wait, no, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nOh, wait. So the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through cheating. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter. So the event we're looking for is that either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, or both, but not Roger. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if Roger didn't cheat, and someone else did, the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone not cheating. So, the correct answer is correct, but it wasn't due to cheating. So, the correct answer is correct because either Alan or Peter got it right, not because Roger cheated and got it right.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me rephrase.\n\nEach person is trying to answer the question. Alan has a 1/5 chance of being correct (random guess). Roger has a 2/3 chance because he cheated. Peter has a 5/6 chance because he did the work. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it wasn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But wait, what if all three are correct? No, because the question is about the event where the answer is correct, regardless of who got it right, but not via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The question is about the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer is obtained by either Alan or Peter. But wait, if Roger's method is cheating and he gets it right, then the correct answer was obtained through cheating. So, the event we're interested in is when the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not through Roger's cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But wait, that can't be right, because if the correct answer is achieved by any of the three, but we want it to not be via cheating, meaning that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If the correct answer is achieved by someone, but if it's via cheating (Roger), then it's not the desired case. So, the desired case is that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. But in reality, the correct answer is achieved when at least one of them gets it right, but we have to make sure that it's not because of Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's model it more formally.\n\nEach person can either get the question right or wrong. The events are independent.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating. Which means, either Alan or Peter got it right, but Roger did not. Because if Roger got it right, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the question is answered correctly, but the method isn't cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, or Peter, or both. But if Roger got it right, then that's cheating, so we don't count that case. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is a single event. So, perhaps the question is about whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is correct, and it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the event is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. So, the correct answer is correct, and it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the correct answer being achieved without any cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the correct answer can be achieved by any of the three. So, the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, which would be if Roger was the one who got it right. So, the correct answer is achieved either by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer could be achieved by all three. So, we need the probability that the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger got it right or not.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The correct answer is achieved in the exam. Now, the question is, what's the probability that this correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat, meaning that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved, but not through the cheating method. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, we need the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is not allowed in this scenario.\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. But in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan). So, the problem is about the overall correct answer, but not via cheating. So, perhaps we need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not through Roger's cheating.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved if at least one of them gets it right. But in some cases, it's achieved via cheating (Roger), and in others, via non-cheating (Alan or Peter).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it's not achieved through cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. But that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by someone else, Roger could also have gotten it right through cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not the one who got it right. But that's not necessarily the case. Because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger. So, in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating (Roger) and via non-cheating (Alan). But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone other than Roger, regardless of whether Roger also got it right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible cases where the correct answer is achieved without cheating. That would be when at least one of Alan or Peter got the correct answer, regardless of Roger's result. Because if Alan or Peter got it right, then the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the problem is, the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer was achieved without Roger being involved. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but that correct answer was not achieved via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because the correct answer is a single event. So, perhaps the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result. Because if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want.\n\nWait, no. Because the question is about the correct answer being achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which is not desired. So, perhaps we need to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut how can that be? Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, it doesn't matter if Roger also got it right. The correct answer is achieved via Alan (non-cheating). So, perhaps the event we're interested in is that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but it's not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer could be achieved by Alan, or Peter, or both. So, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nBut that's not entirely correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by someone, it's either by Alan, Peter, or Roger. So, to ensure that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, it must have been achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not.\n\nWait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating. So, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut that's not possible because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan, it doesn't matter if Roger also got it right. So, perhaps the event is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should model this using probabilities.\n\nThe events are independent. Let me denote:\n\nA: Alan is correct (prob 1/5)\nR: Roger is correct (prob 2/3)\nP: Peter is correct (prob 5/6)\n\nWe need the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the event we're interested in is (A or P) and not via cheating. So, perhaps the event is (A or P) and not R. Wait, no. Because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, we need the correct answer to be achieved by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of others.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the correct answer is achieved, and the method used was not cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) minus the probability that the correct answer was achieved via cheating. Wait, no, that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by Alan or Peter, not Roger. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but the correct answer could be achieved by more than one person. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A, R, or P is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via cheating, i.e., it's achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's result.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, how do we handle that?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Peter, which is fine. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also achieved by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is achieved via Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved if at least one of A or P is correct, regardless of R.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because the correct answer could also be achieved by R, which is via cheating. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating, so perhaps the correct answer must be achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, no, because even if Roger is correct, the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So, the problem is, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not via cheating, meaning it was achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer is achieved by both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which is Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether it's also achieved by Roger.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P), which is 1 - P(not A and not P). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(not A) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5\nP(not P) = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6\nSince A and P are independent, P(not A and not P) = (4/5) * (1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the options don't include 13/15. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question is: What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but if it's achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which we don't want. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which is Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's what I thought earlier. So, the probability is P(A \u2228 P) = 13/15 \u2248 0.8667, which is not an option. So, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother possibility is that the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is not Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the correct answer could be achieved by multiple people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would be Alan or Peter, and the correct answer is achieved regardless of whether others also got it right.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is a single event. So, the correct answer is achieved by someone, and we want the probability that it's achieved by someone who didn't cheat, i.e., Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where it's achieved by both Alan and Roger, because in that case, the correct answer was achieved via cheating as well. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by exactly one person, and that person is either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by exactly Alan or exactly Peter.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach either.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The correct answer is achieved if at least one of the three is correct. But we want the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the correct answer could be achieved by both Alan and Roger, so the correct answer is achieved via cheating as well. But the question is about the correct answer being achieved without cheating, which could be if either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the event is (A \u2228 P) and not R.\n\nBut that's not correct because if A is correct and R is correct, then the correct answer is achieved via both A and R, which includes cheating. So, to have the correct answer achieved without cheating, we need that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nThe correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. So, the probability that (A \u2228 P) is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then it's via cheating as well. So, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat, which would require that either A or P is correct, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not right because even if R is correct, the correct answer is achieved via cheating. So, the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by someone who didn't cheat (A or P), and not by R.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the correct answer can be achieved by multiple people. So, perhaps the correct event is that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of A or P, and not achieved by R. But that's not correct because if the correct answer is achieved by both A and R, then it's achieved via cheating as well.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved, but it's not because of cheating. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter. So, the probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of whether Roger is correct.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter is P(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A and P). Since A and P are independent.\n\nSo, P(A) = 1/5, P(P) =5/6.\n\nP(A and P) = (1/5)*(5/6) = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A \u2228 P) = 1/5 +5/6 -1/6 = (6/30 +25/30 -5/30) = (26/30) =13/15.\n\nBut 13/15 is not among the options, so I must be missing something.\n\nWait, looking back at the options: E is 13/45, which is less than 1/3. So, perhaps I'm not considering the fact that the correct answer is achieved via someone who didn't cheat, but also that it's not achieved via cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and not by R.\n\nWait, but how do we compute that?\n\nThe correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R )\n\nAlternatively, since the correct answer can be achieved by any of them, but we want it to be achieved by A or P, and not by R.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, but not by R. So, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the correct answer could be achieved by A and P, but R is incorrect. Or by A alone, R incorrect. Or by P alone, R incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is achieved by A or P, and R is incorrect.\n\nSo, the probability is P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R )\n\nWhich can be written as P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R), since A, P, R are independent.\n\nWait, no. Because R is independent of A and P, so P(not R) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 not R ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nAh, that's option E:13/45.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but Roger is not correct. So, the correct answer is achieved without cheating.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(not A and not P) = 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 =13/15.\n\nThen, P(not R) = 1/3.\n\nSince events are independent, multiply them: 13/15 * 1/3 =13/45.\n\nWhich is option E.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was achieved via cheating, which we don't want. So, we want the correct answer to be achieved by A or P, and Roger is not correct.\n\nSo, the probability is (13/15) * (1/3) =13/45.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to calculate the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. The events are independent, and the probabilities are as follows:\n\n- **Alan's probability of being correct**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of being correct**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of being correct**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter\nThe probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A \\cap P)\n\\]\nSince Alan and Peter's events are independent:\n\\[\nP(A \\cap P) = P(A) \\cdot P(P) = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Probability that Roger is not correct\nThe probability that Roger is not correct is:\n\\[\nP(\\neg R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combined probability\nSince the events are independent, the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct is:\n\\[\nP((A \\cup P) \\cap \\neg R) = P(A \\cup P) \\cdot P(\\neg R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these types of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014each trying to answer a question on an exam. Each has a different probability of getting it right. The twist is that we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so cheating is only from Roger, I think. \n\nLet me read the setup again. Alan guesses randomly, so his chance of being correct is 1/5. Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3. Peter does the calculations, so his probability is 5/6. We need the probability that the question is correct but not through cheating. So, that means we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness without cheating. So perhaps, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the event where the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would mean that the correct answer was achieved without Roger's cheating. So, that could be either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right via cheating, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Are the events independent? I think so. Each of them is answering the question independently, right? So the correctness of each is independent of the others.\n\nSo the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, any correct answer that didn't come from Roger's cheating. So, if Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's outcome, as long as the correct answer comes from either of them.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. So, the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it's answered isn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan's guess or Peter's work, but not Roger's cheating.\n\nBut wait, each of them is answering the question. So perhaps the question is answered correctly if any one of them got it right. But we're to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would mean that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or, perhaps, the correct answer was due to Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer was achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer came via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way the question is structured is that the question is answered correctly, but the method (cheating or not) is considered. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan, Roger, or Peter. But we want the cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Because if Roger's cheating leads to a correct answer, that's via cheating, so we exclude that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, if any of the three got it right, but only if it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via the cheating method (Roger). So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. But that's not quite right because if all three are answering the question, and the question is about the correctness regardless of who answered it. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger's answer is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be from either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the question could be answered correctly by more than one person. So, perhaps the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter or both, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says 'the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.' So, if the correct answer came from Roger via cheating, that's excluded. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer came from both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was via cheating. So, the scenario we want is that the correct answer came via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is either Alan got it right and/or Peter got it right, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where Roger's cheating also led to a correct answer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer came via both Alan and Peter, and Roger didn't, then the question is correctly answered without cheating. Alternatively, if Alan is correct, Roger is not, that's a case. Similarly, if Peter is correct and Roger is not, that's another case. But what about if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is not? That's still a correct answer without cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via either Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the correct answer coming from Alan or Peter, minus the overlap where both Alan and Peter are correct, but we also have to consider whether Roger's answer was correct or not.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not. Wait, no, because if Roger is correct via cheating, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct way is to model the events. Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\n- A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if the correct answer was via Roger, that's via cheating, so we exclude it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action, but not via Roger. Hmm, but that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct, because if the correct answer is from both Alan and Peter, then it's still a correct answer. But we have to consider that the correct answer was obtained via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But that's not considering whether the correct answer came via someone else's cheating. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness, not about who answered it. So, the correct answer could be due to Alan, Roger, or Peter. But we want the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer came via non-cheating, which is either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nWait, no, because if both Alan and Peter answer correctly, and Roger doesn't, that's a correct answer, so we include that. If only Alan is correct and Roger isn't, that's included. If only Peter is correct and Roger isn't, that's included. But if Roger is correct, even if Alan or Peter are correct, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, even if Roger also got it right via cheating, the correct answer is from non-cheating. But that's not what the question is asking. It says the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via cheating, that's excluded. So, the correct answer must have come via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Let me model this.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved if either Alan or Peter or both are correct, but not if Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability we're looking for is the probability that (A or P) is true and R is false.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R). But wait, no, because the events are independent. So, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not occur is equal to P(A or P) * P(not R), because they are independent events.\n\nWait, but no. Because the events are independent, but the occurrence of (A or P) is independent of R. So, the joint probability P(A or P and not R) is equal to P(A or P) * P(not R).\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Because the events are independent, so P(A or P and not R) = P(A or P) * P(not R). Because A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, first, let's compute P(A or P). Since A and P are independent, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, so P(A and P) = P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus (0.2 * 0.8333) which is 0.16666. So, 1.0333 - 0.16666 is approximately 0.8666.\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 6/30 + 25/30 - (6/30 * 25/30) = (31/30) - (150/900).\n\nWait, 31/30 is more than 1, which can't be right. Oh wait, that's a mistake. Because 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30, which is more than 1. But that can't be right because the probability of A or P cannot exceed 1.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. Because when adding probabilities, we can't have a sum more than 1. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when A and P are independent, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nP(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (25/300) = (31/30) - (25/300).\n\nWait, 31/30 is 1.0333, and 25/300 is 0.0833. So, 1.0333 - 0.0833 = 0.95.\n\nWhich is 19/20. Because 0.95 is 19/20.\n\nWait, 19/20 is 0.95. Let me see: 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So, their sum is 1.0333, which is more than 1. But when we subtract the product, which is 0.2 * 0.8333 = 0.16666, so 1.0333 - 0.16666 = 0.8666, which is 5/6 (0.8333) plus 1/5 (0.2) minus their product. Wait, but 0.8666 is approximately 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = 5/6 + 1/5 - 1/6 = (5/6 - 1/6) + 1/5 = (4/6) + 1/5 = 2/3 + 1/5 = (10/15 + 3/15) = 13/15? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.\n\nWait, 1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, P(A) = 6/30, P(P) = 25/30.\n\nP(A and P) = (6/30)*(25/30) = 150/900 = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 6/30 +25/30 -150/900.\n\n6/30 +25/30 = 31/30.\n\n150/900 is 1/6, which is 15/90 = 5/30.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because 13/15 is approximately 0.8667.\n\nSo, P(A or P) is 13/15.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that (A or P) happens and R does not happen. Since R is independent, P(R) = 2/3, so P(not R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P((A or P) and not R) = P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Is that correct?\n\nBecause the events are independent, so the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not is indeed the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, 13/15 multiplied by 1/3 is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Is this the right approach? Because perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is that the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's what we calculated. Because we're calculating the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Because the correct answer can be achieved in multiple ways, but we want the cases where the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. No, because if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly is the sum of the probabilities that each of them answered correctly, but not via cheating. Wait, no, that's not correct because they can overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But no, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer came via cheating, so that's not included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of it as the correct answer came via either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me think again about the events. The correct answer is considered as the question being answered correctly, but we want it to be correct without cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by any of them, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not. But that's not considering whether the correct answer came via someone else's cheating.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer came via Roger's cheating, that's via cheating, so it's excluded. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the correct approach would be to compute P(A or P), which is 13/15, multiplied by the probability that Roger did not answer correctly, which is 1/3. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose all three answer correctly. Then, the correct answer came via all three methods. But since Roger's is cheating, that's via cheating, so the correct answer via Roger is excluded. But the correct answer via Alan and Peter is still included.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, it's via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, it's via cheating, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the approach I took earlier, which gives 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45, which would be the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternative approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating is the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where both are correct and Roger is incorrect, but wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute all possible scenarios where the correct answer came via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nSo, the events where the correct answer came via Alan, or via Peter, or via both, but not via Roger.\n\nBut since the correct answer could be achieved by any of them, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer came via Alan, or via Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, how do we model that? Because the correct answer can be achieved in multiple ways. For example, if Alan and Peter both answer correctly, and Roger does not, that's a case where the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, if Alan answers correctly and Peter doesn't, and Roger doesn't, that's another case.\n\nSimilarly, if Peter answers correctly and Alan doesn't, and Roger doesn't.\n\nAnd if all three answer correctly, but Roger's answer is via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nWait, but if all three answer correctly, the correct answer is via all three methods. So, in that case, the correct answer is via cheating as well, which we need to exclude.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not achieved by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because even if Roger also answers correctly, as long as the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, it's via non-cheating. But wait, if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer is via non-cheating (i.e., via Alan or Peter).\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But if Roger's answer is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is via non-cheating, which is Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R), but wait, no. Because if the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, but Roger's answer is also correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nSo, P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be option E, 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Another way to think about it: the correct answer is achieved by someone, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from Alan or Peter. So, the probability is P(A or P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But that can't be right because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer must come via Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWhich is P(A or P) * P(not R) = 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45, so that's the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these types of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014each trying to answer a question on an exam. Each has a different probability of getting it right. The twist is that we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, right, so cheating is only from Roger, I think. \n\nLet me read the setup again. Alan guesses randomly, so his chance of being correct is 1/5. Roger cheats, so his probability is 2/3. Peter does the calculations, so his probability is 5/6. We need the probability that the question is correct but not through cheating. So, that means we're looking for the cases where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness without cheating. So perhaps, it's the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger cheating.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the event where the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So that would mean that the correct answer was achieved without Roger's cheating. So, that could be either Alan got it right, or Peter got it right, but Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right via cheating, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must have come from either Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Are the events independent? I think so. Each of them is answering the question independently, right? So the correctness of each is independent of the others.\n\nSo the total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, any correct answer that didn't come from Roger's cheating. So, if Alan or Peter got it right, regardless of Roger's outcome, as long as the correct answer comes from either of them.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently. So, the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but the way it's answered isn't through cheating. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan's guess or Peter's work, but not Roger's cheating.\n\nBut wait, each of them is answering the question. So perhaps the question is answered correctly if any one of them got it right. But we're to find the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would mean that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or, perhaps, the correct answer was due to Alan or Peter, but not Roger.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe problem says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, the correct answer was achieved through either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger's cheating. So, the correct answer came via non-cheating methods.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way the question is structured is that the question is answered correctly, but the method (cheating or not) is considered. So, the correct answer could have come from either Alan, Roger, or Peter. But we want the cases where the correct answer came from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger. So, the correct answer is due to either Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Because if Roger's cheating leads to a correct answer, that's via cheating, so we exclude that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is whether the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So, if any of the three got it right, but only if it's not because of Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is answered correctly, but not via the cheating method (Roger). So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter. But that's not quite right because if all three are answering the question, and the question is about the correctness regardless of who answered it. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. Because if Roger's answer is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be from either Alan or Peter.\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily the case. Because the question could be answered correctly by more than one person. So, perhaps the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter or both, but not by Roger.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says 'the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.' So, if the correct answer came from Roger via cheating, that's excluded. So, the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter. So, the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did.\n\nWait, no, because if the correct answer came from both Alan and Roger, then the correct answer was via cheating. So, the scenario we want is that the correct answer came via either Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is either Alan got it right and/or Peter got it right, but Roger did not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, minus the cases where Roger's cheating also led to a correct answer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if the correct answer came via both Alan and Peter, and Roger didn't, then the question is correctly answered without cheating. Alternatively, if Alan is correct, Roger is not, that's a case. Similarly, if Peter is correct and Roger is not, that's another case. But what about if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is not? That's still a correct answer without cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via either Alan, Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the correct answer coming from Alan or Peter, minus the overlap where both Alan and Peter are correct, but we also have to consider whether Roger's answer was correct or not.\n\nWait, no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not. Wait, no, because if Roger is correct via cheating, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must be incorrect.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the correct way is to model the events. Let me think in terms of events.\n\nLet me define the events:\n\n- A: Alan answers correctly. P(A) = 1/5.\n- R: Roger answers correctly. P(R) = 2/3.\n- P: Peter answers correctly. P(P) = 5/6.\n\nWe need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer was achieved via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and not by Roger. Because if the correct answer was via Roger, that's via cheating, so we exclude it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's action, but not via Roger. Hmm, but that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is that the correct answer is achieved by someone, but that someone is not Roger. So, the correct answer is from Alan or Peter.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily correct, because if the correct answer is from both Alan and Peter, then it's still a correct answer. But we have to consider that the correct answer was obtained via non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of what Roger did. But that's not considering whether the correct answer came via someone else's cheating. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, no, because the question is about the overall correctness, not about who answered it. So, the correct answer could be due to Alan, Roger, or Peter. But we want the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer came via non-cheating, which is either Alan or Peter. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not.\n\nWait, no, because if both Alan and Peter answer correctly, and Roger doesn't, that's a correct answer, so we include that. If only Alan is correct and Roger isn't, that's included. If only Peter is correct and Roger isn't, that's included. But if Roger is correct, even if Alan or Peter are correct, that's via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but Roger is not correct.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the question is about the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating. So, perhaps, if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, even if Roger also got it right via cheating, the correct answer is from non-cheating. But that's not what the question is asking. It says the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So, if the correct answer is achieved via cheating, that's excluded. So, the correct answer must have come via Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but how? Let me model this.\n\nThe correct answer is achieved if either Alan or Peter or both are correct, but not if Roger is correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the probability we're looking for is the probability that (A or P) is true and R is false.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R). But wait, no, because the events are independent. So, the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not occur is equal to P(A or P) * P(not R), because they are independent events.\n\nWait, but no. Because the events are independent, but the occurrence of (A or P) is independent of R. So, the joint probability P(A or P and not R) is equal to P(A or P) * P(not R).\n\nBut wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Because the events are independent, so P(A or P and not R) = P(A or P) * P(not R). Because A, P, and R are independent.\n\nSo, first, let's compute P(A or P). Since A and P are independent, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nBecause A and P are independent, so P(A and P) = P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, P(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)*(5/6).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333.\n\nSo, 0.2 + 0.8333 = 1.0333, minus (0.2 * 0.8333) which is 0.16666. So, 1.0333 - 0.16666 is approximately 0.8666.\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 6/30 + 25/30 - (6/30 * 25/30) = (31/30) - (150/900).\n\nWait, 31/30 is more than 1, which can't be right. Oh wait, that's a mistake. Because 6/30 +25/30 = 31/30, which is more than 1. But that can't be right because the probability of A or P cannot exceed 1.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. Because when adding probabilities, we can't have a sum more than 1. So, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when A and P are independent, P(A or P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) * P(P).\n\nSo, substituting the numbers:\n\nP(A or P) = (1/5) + (5/6) - (1/5)(5/6) = (6/30 + 25/30) - (25/300) = (31/30) - (25/300).\n\nWait, 31/30 is 1.0333, and 25/300 is 0.0833. So, 1.0333 - 0.0833 = 0.95.\n\nWhich is 19/20. Because 0.95 is 19/20.\n\nWait, 19/20 is 0.95. Let me see: 1/5 is 0.2, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So, their sum is 1.0333, which is more than 1. But when we subtract the product, which is 0.2 * 0.8333 = 0.16666, so 1.0333 - 0.16666 = 0.8666, which is 5/6 (0.8333) plus 1/5 (0.2) minus their product. Wait, but 0.8666 is approximately 5/6 + 1/5 - (1/5)(5/6) = 5/6 + 1/5 - 1/6 = (5/6 - 1/6) + 1/5 = (4/6) + 1/5 = 2/3 + 1/5 = (10/15 + 3/15) = 13/15? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I should do the calculation more precisely.\n\nWait, 1/5 is 6/30, 5/6 is 25/30.\n\nSo, P(A) = 6/30, P(P) = 25/30.\n\nP(A and P) = (6/30)*(25/30) = 150/900 = 1/6.\n\nSo, P(A or P) = 6/30 +25/30 -150/900.\n\n6/30 +25/30 = 31/30.\n\n150/900 is 1/6, which is 15/90 = 5/30.\n\nSo, 31/30 - 5/30 = 26/30 = 13/15.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because 13/15 is approximately 0.8667.\n\nSo, P(A or P) is 13/15.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that (A or P) happens and R does not happen. Since R is independent, P(R) = 2/3, so P(not R) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nSo, P((A or P) and not R) = P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Is that correct?\n\nBecause the events are independent, so the probability that (A or P) occurs and R does not is indeed the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, 13/15 multiplied by 1/3 is 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. So, is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Is this the right approach? Because perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not via cheating. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But no, because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is that the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's what we calculated. Because we're calculating the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Because the correct answer can be achieved in multiple ways, but we want the cases where the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's correctness. No, because if the correct answer came via Roger, that's via cheating, which we're excluding.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly is the sum of the probabilities that each of them answered correctly, but not via cheating. Wait, no, that's not correct because they can overlap.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But no, because if Roger is correct, the correct answer came via cheating, so that's not included.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of it as the correct answer came via either Alan or Peter, and not via Roger. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, and Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me think again about the events. The correct answer is considered as the question being answered correctly, but we want it to be correct without cheating. So, the correct answer could have been achieved by any of them, but not via Roger's cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer came from either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not. But that's not considering whether the correct answer came via someone else's cheating.\n\nWait, but if the correct answer came via Roger's cheating, that's via cheating, so it's excluded. So, the correct answer came via Alan or Peter, regardless of whether the others are correct or not.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the correct approach would be to compute P(A or P), which is 13/15, multiplied by the probability that Roger did not answer correctly, which is 1/3. So, 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose all three answer correctly. Then, the correct answer came via all three methods. But since Roger's is cheating, that's via cheating, so the correct answer via Roger is excluded. But the correct answer via Alan and Peter is still included.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct. Because if the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, it's via non-cheating. But if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, it's via cheating, so it's excluded.\n\nWait, but the way the question is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. So, the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the approach I took earlier, which gives 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45, which would be the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternative approach: The probability that the question is answered correctly via non-cheating is the sum of the probabilities that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, minus the cases where both are correct and Roger is incorrect, but wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute all possible scenarios where the correct answer came via non-cheating. So, the correct answer is either from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger.\n\nSo, the events where the correct answer came via Alan, or via Peter, or via both, but not via Roger.\n\nBut since the correct answer could be achieved by any of them, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability that the correct answer came via Alan, or via Peter, or both, but not via Roger.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger. So, the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and not by Roger.\n\nBut wait, how do we model that? Because the correct answer can be achieved in multiple ways. For example, if Alan and Peter both answer correctly, and Roger does not, that's a case where the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nAlternatively, if Alan answers correctly and Peter doesn't, and Roger doesn't, that's another case.\n\nSimilarly, if Peter answers correctly and Alan doesn't, and Roger doesn't.\n\nAnd if all three answer correctly, but Roger's answer is via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nWait, but if all three answer correctly, the correct answer is via all three methods. So, in that case, the correct answer is via cheating as well, which we need to exclude.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by at least one of Alan or Peter, and not achieved by Roger.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because even if Roger also answers correctly, as long as the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, it's via non-cheating. But wait, if the correct answer is achieved by Roger, that's via cheating, which is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer is via non-cheating (i.e., via Alan or Peter).\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased is that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer is via non-cheating.\n\nSo, the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, regardless of Roger's answer. But if Roger's answer is correct, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and not via Roger.\n\nSo, the correct answer is via non-cheating, which is Alan or Peter.\n\nSo, the probability is P(A or P) * P(not R), but wait, no. Because if the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, but Roger's answer is also correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which we're excluding. So, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability that the correct answer is via Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nSo, P(A or P) * P(not R) = (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45.\n\nSo, the answer would be option E, 13/45.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Another way to think about it: the correct answer is achieved by someone, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer came from Alan or Peter. So, the probability is P(A or P) * (1 - P(R)).\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to 13/45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, regardless of whether Roger is correct or not. But that can't be right because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer came via cheating, which is excluded. So, the correct answer must come via Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have answered correctly.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the probability that the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter, and that Roger did not answer correctly.\n\nWhich is P(A or P) * P(not R) = 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45, so that's the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we analyze the probabilities of Alan, Roger, and Peter answering correctly. The key is to calculate the probability that the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, but not by Roger (since Roger's correctness comes from cheating, which we are excluding).\n\n### Step 1: Define the probabilities\n- **Alan's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- **Roger's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(R) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Peter's probability of answering correctly**: \\( P(P) = \\frac{5}{6} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the probability of Alan or Peter answering correctly\nThe probability that either Alan or Peter answers correctly is given by:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A) \\cdot P(P)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} - \\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = \\frac{6}{30} + \\frac{25}{30} - \\frac{25}{300}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = \\frac{31}{30} - \\frac{5}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ or } P) = \\frac{26}{30} = \\frac{13}{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability that Roger does not answer correctly\nThe probability that Roger does not answer correctly is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{not } R) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the joint probability\nSince the events are independent, the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter and not by Roger is:\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ or } P) \\text{ and not } R) = P(A \\text{ or } P) \\cdot P(\\text{not } R)\n\\]\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ or } P) \\text{ and not } R) = \\frac{13}{15} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nP((A \\text{ or } P) \\text{ and not } R) = \\frac{13}{45}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\( \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\n**Answer: E**",
