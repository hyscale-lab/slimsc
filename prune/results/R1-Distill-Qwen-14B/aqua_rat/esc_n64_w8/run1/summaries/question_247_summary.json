      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice has this rectangular yard and she wants to put up fencing around three sides, leaving the fourth side, which is 10 meters, unfenced. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this, but let me think through it.\n\nFirst, I know that the yard is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. Let's say the sides are length and width. The area is given as 240 square meters. One side is 10 meters, and that's the one she's not fencing. Wait, but which side is that? Is it one of the lengths or one of the widths?\n\nWait, she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that could be either the length or the width. But since she's fencing three sides, perhaps the unfenced side is either a length or a width, and the other three sides (two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width) will be fenced.\n\nLet me try to sketch this. Imagine the yard is a rectangle. Let's denote the length as L and the width as W. So, the sides are two lengths and two widths. If she's leaving one length of 10m unfenced, then the fencing would be along the other length and both widths. Alternatively, if she's leaving a width of 10m unfenced, the fencing would be along the two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, no. If the unfenced side is 10m, then that could be either L or W. So, let's figure out which makes more sense.\n\nThe area is L * W = 240. So if the unfenced side is L =10, then W would be 240/10 = 24 meters. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is W=10, then L would be 240/10 =24 meters.\n\nWait, wait a second, no. If the unfenced side is 10 meters, which could be either length or width. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is the length (L=10m). Then the width (W) would be area divided by L, so 240 /10 = 24 meters. So the fencing would be along the other length (10m) and both widths (24m each). So total fencing is 10 + 24 +24 = 58 meters. Wait, that's one of the options, option A is 58.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is the width (W=10m). Then the length (L) is 240 /10 =24 meters. The fencing would be along both lengths (24 each) and one width (10m). So total fencing is 24 +24 +10 =58 meters again. Wait, that's the same number.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the unfenced side is length or width, the total fencing needed is 58 meters. So the answer would be 58, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nIn case 1: L=10, W=24. Fencing is L + 2W = 10 +24*2=10+48=58.\n\nCase 2: W=10, L=24. Fencing is 2L + W= 2*24 +10=48+10=58.\n\nSame result. So either way, the fencing needed is 58 meters. So the correct answer is A)58.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Alice has this rectangular yard, and she wants to put fencing around three sides. One side is going to be left unfenced, and that side is 10 meters. The area of the yard is 240 square meters. The question is asking how many meters of fencing she needs. Hmm, I need to figure out the total length of fencing required.\n\nAlright, let's start by visualizing the yard. It's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. Let's say the sides are length and width. But wait, the problem mentions that one side is unfenced, which is 10 meters. I'm not sure which side that is\u2014could it be the length or the width? Maybe I'll need to figure that out.\n\nSince it's a rectangle, there are two possibilities: either the unfenced side is one of the lengths or one of the widths. But the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to consider both cases.\n\nWait, but perhaps the 10 meters is the length of one side. Let me think. Let's denote the sides as length (L) and width (W). The area is L times W, so L*W = 240.\n\nShe is fencing three sides. Let me clarify: if the unfenced side is, say, the length, then she would be fencing the other length and both widths. Or if the unfenced side is a width, she would be fencing the other width and both lengths.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out which case applies. But wait, the problem says \"three sides\", which could be either two lengths and one width or two widths and one length, depending on which side is left open.\n\nWait, but the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side is either L or W, and it's 10 meters. So let's suppose that the unfenced side is the length. Then the fencing would be the other length plus two widths. Or if the unfenced side is a width, then fencing is two lengths plus the other width.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the 10m side is length or width. So maybe I can solve for both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I can determine which scenario is correct based on the area.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is the length (L) = 10 meters.\n\nThen the area is L * W = 240 \u2192 10 * W =240 \u2192 W=24 meters.\n\nIn this case, the fencing required would be for the other length (10m) plus both widths (24m each). So fencing = 10 + 24 +24 =58 meters.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is a width (W)=10 meters.\n\nThen area is L*10=240 \u2192 L=24 meters.\n\nThe fencing would be for the other two widths (each 10m) and the length (24m). So fencing =24 +10 +10=44 meters.\n\nWait, but 44 is not one of the options. The options are 58, 62, etc. So perhaps case 1 is the correct scenario.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says she's putting fencing around three sides. So if the yard is a rectangle, the three sides she's fencing could be two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nIf the unfenced side is the length (so the two other sides being fenced are length and two widths), but wait, no\u2014wait, if the yard is a rectangle, and one length is unfenced, then she's fencing the other length and both widths. Or if one width is unfenced, she's fencing the other width and both lengths.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's imagine the yard as a rectangle with two lengths and two widths. If she's leaving one of the lengths (L) unfenced, then the fencing would cover the other length (L) and the two widths (W each). So the total fencing would be L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if she's leaving one width (W) unfenced, then the fencing would be 2L + W.\n\nBut the problem states that the unfenced side is 10 meters. So in the first case, L=10, and in the second case, W=10.\n\nLet me compute both cases.\n\nCase 1: L=10.\n\nArea = L * W = 240 \u2192 10 * W=240 \u2192 W=24.\n\nFencing needed: L + 2W =10 + (2*24)=10+48=58 meters. Which is option A.\n\nCase 2: W=10.\n\nArea = L * 10 =240 \u2192 L=24.\n\nFencing needed: 2L + W= 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters. Wait, same as case 1? That can't be right. Wait, 2*24 is 48 plus 10 is 58. So both cases give 58 meters? But that can't be correct because the area is same regardless, but the fencing depends on which side is unfenced.\n\nWait, but that suggests that regardless of whether the 10m is length or width, the fencing required is 58 meters. But looking at the options, option A is 58. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because in the second case, I have L=24, W=10. So fencing would be 2L + W = 2*24 +10=58.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the first case. Hmm, that's interesting. So regardless of whether the 10m is length or width, the fencing required is 58 meters. So the answer should be 58, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options: A is 58, B is 62, etc. So according to this, the answer is A.\n\nBut wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Because in the problem, Alice is fencing three sides. So if the yard is a rectangle, three sides could be two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, but in either case, the fencing would be L + 2W or 2L + W, depending on which side is left unfenced.\n\nBut in both cases, when one side is 10m, the other calculations give fencing as 58.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe problem states: \"put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced.\"\n\nSo perhaps the 10m side is one of the three sides? No, that can't be, because the three sides are being fenced, and one is left unfenced. So the 10m is the unfenced side.\n\nWait, but the way I approached earlier, whether the 10m is L or W, fencing is 58.\n\nBut wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the unfenced side is one of the longer sides, which might not necessarily be length or width. But in any case, the calculation should hold.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the 10m is the width, then fencing would be two lengths and one width. Let's plug the numbers.\n\nIf W=10, then L=24. Fencing is 2L + W =48 +10=58.\n\nIf L=10, then W=24. Fencing is L +2W=10+48=58.\n\nSo both scenarios give 58 meters of fencing.\n\nSo the answer is A)58.\n",

The area of the yard is 240 square meters. I need to figure out how much fencing she needs. The options are A to E, and I have to choose the right one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The yard is rectangular, so opposite sides are equal. She's leaving one side unfenced, which is 10 meters. Wait, but which side is that? Is it one of the length sides or one of the width sides? That's important because it affects the total fencing required.\n\nLet me think. If the yard is a rectangle, it has two lengths and two widths. If one of the sides is 10 meters and it's unfenced, that could be either a length or a width. So I need to figure out which one it is.\n\nThe area is 240 m\u00b2. So area = length \u00d7 width. Let's denote the sides. Suppose the side that's 10 meters is the width. Then the area would be length \u00d7 10 = 240, so length = 240 /10 = 24 meters.\n\nAlternatively, if the unfenced side is the length, then the area is length \u00d7 width = 240, but the length would be 10 m. Then the width would be 240 /10 = 24 m.\n\nWait, but which case is it? Because the fencing is on three sides. So if the 10-meter side is a width, then the fencing would consist of the other width and both lengths. Or if the 10-meter is a length, then the fencing would be the other length and both widths.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the problem says she's fencing three sides, leaving one side (10m) unfenced. So depending on whether the unfenced side is a length or a width, the fencing will vary.\n\nLet me model both scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is a length. Then the fencing would cover both widths and one length.\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is a width. Then the fencing would cover both lengths and one width.\n\nWait, but let's think about the structure. A rectangle has two lengths and two widths. If one length is left unfenced, then the fencing would consist of the other length and both widths. Alternatively, if one width is left, then the fencing is both lengths and the other width.\n\nSo, let's model both.\n\nFirst, let's define variables.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the side left unfenced is a length (L). Then, the fencing will include the other length (L) and both widths (W each). So fencing total is L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if the unfenced side is a width (W), then fencing is 2L + W.\n\nBut wait, we need to know whether the unfenced side is a length or a width. So perhaps the problem gives a clue about that.\n\nWait, the problem states that the side left unfenced is 10 meters. So either L=10 or W=10.\n\nSo let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: Unfenced side is length (L=10 m). Then, the area is L \u00d7 W = 240. So W = 240 /10 =24 m. Then fencing required is L + 2W = 10 + 2\u00d724 = 10 +48=58 meters.\n\nSecond possibility: Unfenced side is width (W=10 m). Then, L = 240 /10=24 m. Fencing would be 2L + W = 2\u00d724 +10=48+10=58 meters.\n\nWait a minute, both cases give the same fencing length of 58 meters. But that can't be right because the options have 58 as option A.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting. Because in both cases, the fencing is 58 meters. So why are the options varying? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the first case, the unfenced side is a length (10m). Then the fencing is the other length (10m) and both widths (24m each). So 10 + 24 +24=58.\n\nIn the second case, unfenced is a width (10m). Fencing is two lengths (24 each) and the other width (10m). So 24+24+10=58.\n\nSo either way, fencing is 58 meters. So why is the option A)58. So that's the answer?\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"she is putting up fencing around three sides.\" So perhaps the arrangement is that the unfenced side is opposite to the fenced side.\n\nWait, no, in a rectangle, each side has an opposite side. So if one length is unfenced, the other length is fenced. Similarly for widths.\n\nWait, but maybe the way the fencing is arranged is such that the unfenced side is, for example, the front, so the fencing is on the other three sides. So in that case, if the front is 10 meters (length), then fencing is on the other length and both widths.\n\nWait, but in both cases, whether the unfenced is length or width, the fencing required is 58 meters.\n\nHmm, so that suggests the answer is 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the problem says she is putting fencing around three sides. So maybe the unfenced side is a length. Let's say the yard is oriented so that the 10m side is the width. So the fencing is two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think about the sides. Let's imagine the yard as a rectangle with length L and width W.\n\nIf the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing is the other length plus both widths: L + W + W = L + 2W.\n\nIf the unfenced side is a width, then fencing is the other width plus both lengths: W + L + L = 2L + W.\n\nBut in either case, since L and W are variables, the total fencing could vary.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the unfenced side is 10 meters. So whether that's a length or a width, it's 10.\n\nSo, in the first case, if unfenced is L=10, then area is L \u00d7 W = 240 \u2192 W=24. Fencing: L + 2W =10 +48=58.\n\nIn the second case, if unfenced is W=10, then L=240/10=24. Fencing: 2L + W=48 +10=58.\n\nSo both scenarios give 58 meters. So why is 58 an option? Because in both cases, the fencing is 58.\n\nSo the answer must be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the options include 58 as the first option, but the problem is presented in a way that makes it seem like the answer could be different. But according to my calculations, both cases lead to 58.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A)58.\n",

So that's the answer.\n\n\nAlice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The yard has an area of 240 square meters. To determine the total length of fencing needed, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\nLet the length and width of the yard be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\), respectively. Since the yard is rectangular, opposite sides are equal. The area of the yard is given by:\n\n\\[\nL \\times W = 240\n\\]\n\nThe problem specifies that one side of 10 meters is left unfenced. This side could either be the length (\\( L = 10 \\)) or the width (\\( W = 10 \\)).\n\n### Case 1: Unfenced side is the length (\\( L = 10 \\))\nIf \\( L = 10 \\), then the width \\( W \\) can be calculated using the area formula:\n\\[\n10 \\times W = 240 \\implies W = 24\n\\]\nThe fencing required covers the other length and both widths:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = L + 2W = 10 + 2(24) = 10 + 48 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unfenced side is the width (\\( W = 10 \\))\nIf \\( W = 10 \\), then the length \\( L \\) can be calculated using the area formula:\n\\[\nL \\times 10 = 240 \\implies L = 24\n\\]\nThe fencing required covers both lengths and the other width:\n\\[\n\\text{Fencing} = 2L + W = 2(24) + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\nIn both cases, the total length of fencing required is 58 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice putting up fencing around her yard. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the yard is rectangular, and she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So she's fencing three sides. The area is 240 square meters, and I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nWait, let's think about the shape. A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the sides are length and width. If she's leaving one side unfenced, that could be either the length or the width. But which one?\n\nWait, the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that 10 meters is one side. So the fencing would cover the other three sides. So if the unfenced side is, say, the width, then the fencing would be the other width plus two lengths. Or if the unfenced side is a length, then the fencing is two widths plus the other length.\n\nWait, I think I need to define variables here. Let me denote the length as L and the width as W. But wait, in a rectangle, which is which? Maybe it doesn't matter, but the problem says she's leaving a side of 10 meters. So let's say the unfenced side is either L or W. So either L=10 or W=10.\n\nWait, but the area is 240. So the area is L times W. So if, for example, W is 10, then L would be 240 /10=24. Then the fencing would be for the other three sides: L (24) + W (10) + L (24), which totals 24+10+24=58 meters. Alternatively, if L is 10, then W is 240/10=24. Then the fencing would be W + L + W =24 +10 +24=58 meters again. Wait, so either way, the total fencing is 58 meters? But looking at the options, 58 is option A. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. Oh, wait, she's putting fencing around three sides and leaving one side of 10m unfenced. So the side she's leaving is 10m, so that's either L or W. So depending on which side it is, the fencing will be the sum of the other three.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me take the unfenced side as one of the lengths. So if the yard is a rectangle, maybe the longer side is the one she's leaving. Or maybe not. But regardless, the area is 240.\n\nLet me approach this systematically. Let's assume the unfenced side is of length 10 meters. So that could be either the length or the width. So if the unfenced side is the length, then the area would be 10 * W =240. So W would be 240/10=24 meters. Then the fencing would be for the two widths and the other length. So that's 24 + 24 +10? Wait no, wait. If the yard is rectangular, and she's fencing three sides, the sides would be two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width, depending on which side is unfenced.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to draw a diagram mentally. Imagine the yard as a rectangle with length L and width W. She leaves one of the length sides unfenced. Then she needs fencing for the other length and both widths. So fencing required would be L + 2W. Alternatively, if she leaves a width side unfenced, fencing is 2L + W.\n\nSo in either case, the total fencing depends on whether the unfenced side is a length or a width.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she's leaving a side of 10 meters. So let's say that the unfenced side is 10 meters. So whether it's L or W, we can proceed.\n\nCase 1: Unfenced side is length (L=10m). Then area is L*W=240 => W=240/10=24 m. Fencing needed is 2W + L. So 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: Unfenced side is width (W=10m). Then area is L*10=240 => L=24 m. Fencing needed is 2L + W. So 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters again.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the fencing comes out to 58 meters. But looking at the options, option A is 58. But I think that's correct. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I make mistakes in these calculations.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me represent the sides. Let the unfenced side be one of the sides, say, of length 10 meters. So the fencing will cover the other three sides.\n\nSo if the side is 10 meters, and the area is 240, the other side is 240 /10 =24 meters.\n\nIf the fencing covers two sides of 24 meters and one side of 10 meters, then total fencing is 24*2 +10=58.\n\nAlternatively, if the fencing is two sides of 10 and one of 24, but that would be if the unfenced side was 24. Wait, but the problem states that the unfenced side is 10. So that scenario isn't applicable.\n\nSo the correct calculation is 24 +24 +10=58. So option A is 58.\n\nBut wait, why is there an option C as 66? Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the side she's leaving is one of the longer sides. But in that case, the calculations would change. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the sides.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me define the sides. Let me say that the side she's leaving is the length, so L=10. Then the width W is 240/10=24. Then fencing is 2W + L = 2*24 +10=48+10=58.\n\nAlternatively, if the side she's leaving is the width, then W=10. So L=240/10=24. Fencing is 2L + W=2*24 +10=48+10=58. So either way, 58.\n\nSo the answer should be 58, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 66. Could I have made a mistake in the initial setup?\n\nWait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think: The problem says she is putting fencing around three sides, and leaving one side of 10m unfenced. So the unfenced side is 10m, but perhaps the three fenced sides are the other three, which could be two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, but in the problem, does it matter which side is unfenced? Let me think, perhaps the unfenced side is one of the length sides, so the fencing is two widths and one length. Alternatively, if the unfenced side is a width, then fencing is two lengths and one width.\n\nIn either case, the calculations gave me 58. So the answer should be A)58.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 66. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the way I set up the variables. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me let the length be L and the width be W. She is leaving a side of 10m, so either L=10 or W=10.\n\nCase 1: L=10. Area is L*W=10W=240 \u2192 W=24. Fencing is 2W + L = 2*24 +10=58.\n\nCase 2: W=10. Area is L*10=240 \u2192 L=24. Fencing is 2L + W=2*24 +10=58.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think: is the problem perhaps that the fencing is around three sides, but the unfenced side is a different one? Wait, perhaps the yard is a rectangle, but the fencing is not necessarily along the length or width in a particular way.\n\nWait, perhaps the side left is the same as the width or the length, but I need to calculate the fencing accordingly. But the calculations seem correct.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the fencing is along the two lengths and one width, but the unfenced side is a width. Alternatively, two widths and one length if the unfenced side is a length.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I assumed the fencing is for two sides of 24 and one of 10, but perhaps the layout is different. Let me think: if the yard is a rectangle with length L and width W, then the fencing could be two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length, depending on which side is left unfenced.\n\nSo in both cases, the fencing comes out to 58.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 58 as an incorrect option, but let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA)58\n\nB)62\n\nC)66\n\nD)70\n\nE)74\n\nSo 58 is an option (A).

Hmm, the problem says she's fencing three sides of a rectangular yard and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters, and I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the yard. It's a rectangle, so it has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the length is longer than the width, but it doesn't really matter which is which for now. The unfenced side is 10 meters. Wait, but which side is that? It could be either a length or a width.\n\nWait, the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side is either one of the lengths or one of the widths. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is one of the lengths. So the yard has two lengths and two widths. If one length is 10 meters, then the other length is also 10 meters. But then she's fencing three sides, which would be the two widths and one length. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the three sides she's fencing would include both widths and one length, leaving the other length unfenced. So in this case, the area would be length times width. If length is 10, then area is 10 * width = 240. So width would be 240 /10 =24 meters. Then the fencing needed is two widths (each 24) and one length (10). So that's 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is one of the widths. Then the other three sides she's fencing would be the two lengths and one width. Let's see. Let's say the width is 10 meters. Then the area is length * width = length *10 =240. So length is 240/10=24 meters. Then the fencing needed is two lengths (24 each) and one width (10). So that's 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters again. Wait, same result? So either way, the fencing comes out to 58 meters?\n\nWait, that's strange. So whether the unfenced side is a length or a width, the total fencing is the same. So the answer would be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the way the fencing is arranged might affect the total. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first case, unfenced side is a length of 10 meters. So the two widths are 24 each, and the two lengths are 10 each. So she's fencing the two widths (24*2=48) and one length (10). So 48+10=58.\n\nIn the second case, the unfenced side is a width of 10 meters. So the two lengths are 24 each, and the two widths are 10 each. She's fencing the two lengths (24*2=48) and one width (10). So again, 48+10=58.\n\nSo either way, the total fencing is 58 meters.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice putting up fencing around her yard. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem says she's fencing three sides of a rectangular yard and leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. The area is 240 square meters, and I need to find out how much fencing she needs.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the yard. It's a rectangle, so it has two pairs of equal sides. Let's say the length is longer than the width, but it doesn't really matter which is which for now. The unfenced side is 10 meters. Wait, but which side is that? It could be either a length or a width.\n\nWait, the problem says she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced. So that side is either one of the lengths or one of the widths. Let me think about both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unfenced side is one of the lengths. So the yard has two lengths and two widths. If one length is 10 meters, then the other length is also 10 meters. But then she's fencing three sides, which would be the two widths and one length. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the three sides she's fencing would include both widths and one length, leaving the other length unfenced. So in this case, the area would be length times width. If length is 10, then area is 10 * width = 240. So width would be 240 /10 =24 meters. Then the fencing needed is two widths (each 24) and one length (10). So that's 2*24 +10 =48+10=58 meters.\n\nCase 2: The unfenced side is one of the widths. Then the other three sides she's fencing would be the two lengths and one width. Let's see. Let's say the width is 10 meters. Then the area is length * width = length *10 =240. So length is 240/10=24 meters. Then the fencing needed is two lengths (24 each) and one width (10). So that's 2*24 +10=48+10=58 meters again. Wait, same result? So either way, the fencing comes out to 58 meters?\n\nWait, that's strange. So whether the unfenced side is a length or a width, the total fencing is the same. So the answer would be 58 meters, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the way the fencing is arranged might affect the total. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first case, unfenced side is a length of 10 meters. So the two widths are 24 each, and the two lengths are 10 each. So she's fencing the two widths (24*2=48) and one length (10). So 48+10=58.\n\nIn the second case, the unfenced side is a width of 10 meters. So the two lengths are 24 each, and the two widths are 10 each. She's fencing the two lengths (24*2=48) and one width (10). So again, 48+10=58.\n\nSo either way, the total fencing is 58 meters. So the correct answer must be option A, which is 58.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 58. So that's the answer.\n\n\nAlice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced.

So, fencing needed would be L + 2W. Substituting the values, that's 10 + (2 *24) = 10 +48=58 meters. Hmm, that's option A.\n\nWait, but maybe the unfenced side is a width instead. Let me check that scenario. Suppose W=10. Then the area equation becomes L *10=240, so L=24 meters. The fencing would then be two lengths and one width, since she's leaving one width unfenced. So fencing needed is 2L + W = (2*24) +10=48 +10=58 meters. Wait, same result.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because in both cases, the fencing is 58 meters. But that's not possible, because whether it's length or width being 10, the fencing is the same? Or am I making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, in the first case, when L=10, the fencing is L + 2W =10 +48=58. In the second case, W=10, fencing is 2L + W =48 +10=58. So either way, the fencing required is 58 meters. So that's option A.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)58, B)62, etc. So the answer would be A)58.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I have the sides mixed up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if the yard is rectangular, and she's leaving one side of 10 meters unfenced, that could be either the length or the width.

Substituting \\( W = 10 \\), we solve for \\( L \\):  \n   \\[\n   L \\times 10 = 240 \\implies L = 24 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]  \n   The fencing required covers two lengths and one width:  \n   \\[\n   2L + W = 2 \\times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, the total length of fencing needed is **58 meters**. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",
