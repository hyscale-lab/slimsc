      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a trader selling an article with a 20% profit, and I need to find the cost price. Hmm, I think I remember that profit is calculated based on the cost price. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says the selling price is Rs.360, and that's after a 20% profit. So, I guess the selling price is 120% of the cost price because 100% is the cost, plus 20% profit. Oh wait, right! Profit percentage is always on the cost price, not the selling price. So, I can model this with an equation.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as CP. The selling price (SP) is CP plus 20% of CP. So, SP = CP + 20% of CP, which simplifies to SP = 1.2 * CP. Oh wait, another way to write that is SP = (100% + 20%) * CP, so 120% of CP.\n\nGiven that SP is Rs.360, I can set up the equation as 360 = 1.2 * CP. To find CP, I need to divide both sides by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2... Hmm, 360 divided by 1.2. I can think of this as 360 \u00f7 (6/5) because 1.2 is 6/5. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 360 * (5/6). Let's compute that. 360 divided by 6 is 60, and 60 multiplied by 5 is 300. Oh, so the cost price is 300 rupees.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So the answer should be B. But wait, let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 20% of 300 is 60, right? So, adding that to 300 gives 360, which matches the selling price given. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident that option B is correct.\n",

The options are A)270, B)300, C)280, D)320, E)315.\n\nHmm, right. So, profit is calculated based on the cost price, right? I remember that profit percentage is calculated on the cost price. So if the trader made a 20% profit, that 20% is of the cost price, and the selling price is 120% of the cost price.\n\nWait, let's get the formula right. The selling price (SP) is equal to the cost price (CP) plus the profit. And profit is 20% of CP. So SP = CP + 20% of CP, which is the same as SP = 1.2 * CP.\n\nOr, putting it another way: SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + Profit%).

So if the cost price is CP, then the selling price SP is CP plus 20% of CP. Or, in other words, SP is 1.2 times CP because 20% is 0.2, and 1 plus 0.2 is 1.2.\n\nThe problem says SP is 360. So 360 equals 1.2 multiplied by CP. To find CP, I can rearrange this equation. CP is SP divided by 1.2. Let me write that down: CP = 360 / 1.2.\n\nWait, what's 360 divided by 1.2? Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2 * 300 = 360. So that would make CP 300. So the cost price is 300.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 300. So that's the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the cost is 300, 20% of 300 is 60. Adding that to 300 gives 360, which matches the selling price. Yep, that makes sense.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my profit and loss calculations, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, profit percentage is always calculated on the cost price, right? So if the trader made a 20% profit, that 20% is based on what he originally paid for the article, which is the cost price. Let me denote the cost price as CP.\n\nThe selling price (SP) is given as Rs.360. The formula I remember is that selling price equals cost price plus profit. Profit is calculated as a percentage of CP, so in this case, it's 20% of CP. Alternatively, I can write the selling price as cost price multiplied by (1 + profit percentage). Wait, yeah, because if profit is 20%, then SP = CP * 1.20. Oh wait, no, 20% is 0.2, so it's 1 + 0.2 = 1.2. So SP = CP * 1.2.\n\nSo substituting the numbers: 360 = CP * 1.2.
