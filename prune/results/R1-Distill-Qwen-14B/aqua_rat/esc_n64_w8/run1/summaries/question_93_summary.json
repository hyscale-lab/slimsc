      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two balls rotating on a circular track. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is asking when they'll both be back at the starting point again. \n\nAlright, let's see. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point now, and I need to find when they'll both return to that same starting point simultaneously.\n\nWait, this sounds like a problem about finding the least common multiple, or LCM, of their rotation periods. Because the LCM would give me the smallest time after which both of their cycles complete an integer number of rotations, bringing them back to the start.\n\nSo first, I should find out how long each ball takes to make one full rotation. For Ball A, it does 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So the time per rotation for A is 26 divided by 2. Let me calculate that: 26 / 2 = 13 minutes per rotation. Oh, that's easy.\n\nNow, Ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So its time per rotation is 35 divided by 5. That's 35/5 = 7 minutes per rotation. Got it.\n\nWait, so Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation and Ball B takes 7 minutes per rotation. Now I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7. Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is just 13 multiplied by 7. 13 *7 is 91. So the LCM is 91 minutes. \n\nHmm, but wait, 91 minutes is the time when both will be back at the starting point. Let me check the options given. The options are in hours and minutes. So 91 minutes is how many hours? Well, 60 minutes make an hour. 91 divided by 60 is 1 with a remainder of 31. So that's 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, option A is 1 hour and 31 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when dealing with LCM, especially with periods, you have to think about the time each takes to complete their cycles. So Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation, so after 13 minutes it's back. Ball B takes 7 minutes per rotation, so after 7 minutes it's back. So the first time they meet again is when the time is a multiple of both 13 and 7, which is 91 minutes. That's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes. Looking at the options, that's option A. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Are the periods correct? Because sometimes I might mix up the number of rotations and the time. So Ball A does 2 rotations in 26 minutes, so per rotation is 13 minutes. Ball B does 5 in 35, so per rotation is 7. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo the LCM of 13 and 7 is 91. So 91 minutes is the time when both are back at the starting point. So the answer is option A, 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n",

The question says that ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. They start at the same point, and I need to find when they'll be at the same starting point again. The options are A to E, with times ranging from 1 to 5 hours and 31 minutes.\n\nWait, so this is about finding when both balls complete an integer number of rotations such that they're back to the starting point at the same time. I think this relates to the concept of least common multiples (LCM), but maybe not directly because their rotation periods are different.\n\nLet me break it down. For each ball, I should find how long it takes to complete one full rotation. Then, I can find when they both complete an integer number of rotations simultaneously, which would bring them back to the starting point.\n\nBall A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes. So, the time for one rotation is 26 minutes divided by 2. That's 13 minutes per rotation. So, ball A's period is 13 minutes.\n\nBall B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes. So, one rotation takes 35 divided by 5, which is 7 minutes. So ball B's period is 7 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait. Oh wait, no. Because if it makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, each rotation is 35/5 = 7 minutes. So yes, ball B's period is 7 minutes. So each ball's period is 13 and 7 minutes respectively.\n\nWait, but now I'm thinking, maybe I should find the time when both have completed an integer number of their periods. So the time when both are back at the starting point is the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because LCM is used when you have two numbers, and you find the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So in this case, the periods are 13 and 7. Let me check: 13 and 7 are both primes, right? So their LCM would be 13 *7 = 91 minutes. Because 91 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.\n\nWait, 91 minutes is how many hours? Let's calculate: 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91 is 1 hour and 31 minutes (since 60 +31=91). So the time they meet again is 1 hour 31 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1h 31m, which would be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Is it correct to take the LCM of their periods? Because the LCM of the periods would give the time when both have completed a whole number of rotations, thus returning to their starting points.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by considering the time when the number of rotations each has done is an integer. So for ball A, the time t must be such that t is a multiple of 13 minutes. For ball B, t must be a multiple of 7 minutes. So the earliest time is when t is the LCM of 13 and 7, which is 91 minutes. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two balls rotating around a circular track. I need to find when they'll both be back at the starting point again. Hmm, let's see.\n\nBall A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Wait, so in 26 minutes, it does 2 spins. That means each rotation takes 26/2 = 13 minutes. So the time for one full rotation is 13 minutes for Ball A.\n\nBall B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. So each rotation takes 35/5 = 7 minutes. So Ball B's period is 7 minutes per rotation.\n\nNow, the question is when will they both be at the starting point again. I think this is a problem about finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. Because the LCM would be the smallest time when both have completed an integer number of rotations and thus are back at the start.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. So each time Ball A completes a rotation, it's back at the starting point. Same for Ball B. So the time they meet again is the LCM of their individual times.\n\nSo I need to find the LCM of 13 and 7 minutes. Oh, wait, 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, so their LCM is 13 *7 =91 minutes.\n\nWait, but 91 minutes is how much in hours and minutes? Let's calculate. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 91 is 1 hour and 31 minutes. Because 60 *1=60, 91-60=31. So 1h 31m.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 1h31m, option B is 2h31, and so on.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake here? Let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with rotations, the LCM isn't the only factor, but in this case, since both are starting at the same point and we want them to align again, the LCM is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right. Because after 91 minutes, Ball A would have done 91/13 =7 rotations, and Ball B would have done 91/7=13 rotations. Both are whole numbers, so they meet again at the start.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine when both balls A and B will be at the starting point again, we calculate their rotational periods. Ball A completes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, so its period is:\n\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{26}{2} = 13 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nBall B completes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, so its period is:\n\n\\[\nT_B = \\frac{35}{5} = 7 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThe next time both balls align at the starting point is when the time is the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. Since 13 and 7 are prime numbers, their LCM is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \\times 7 = 91 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nConverting 91 minutes into hours and minutes:\n\n\\[\n91 \\, \\text{minutes} = 1 \\, \\text{hour} \\, \\text{and} \\, 31 \\, \\text{minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the two balls will be at the starting point together after 1 hour and 31 minutes.
