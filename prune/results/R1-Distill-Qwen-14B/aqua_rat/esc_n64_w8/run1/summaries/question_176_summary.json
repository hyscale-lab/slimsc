      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Jerry's bond has accrued by the time it matures. Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nThe bond is a 1-year $5,000 bond with an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. Hmm, compounding every six months means that the interest is added twice a year. So, I think I need to calculate the compound interest here.\n\nWait, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 in this case).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% becomes 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's compounded every six months, n is 2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (1 year here).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: P is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nLet me compute that. First, calculate r/n: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. Then, nt is 2*1=2. So the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nWait, 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Squaring that gives 1.06^2. Let me compute that. 1.06 * 1.06 equals... 1.1236. So A is 5000 * 1.1236.\n\nCalculating 5000 * 1.1236: 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those up: 5000 + 600 = 5600, plus 18 is 5618.\n\nWait, that's the total amount after one year. But the question asks for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I subtract the principal from A. 5618 - 5000 = 618.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that should be the correct answer.\n",

Since it's compounded every six months, that means the interest is added twice a year.\n\nWait, so the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is $5,000 here.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal), so 12% is 0.12.\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year. Since it's every six months, n is 2.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years, which is 1 year here.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers, let's calculate it. \n\nP is 5000, r is 0.12, n is 2, t is 1.\n\nSo A = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nSimplify inside the parentheses first: 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 + 0.06 is 1.06.\n\nThen the exponent is 2*1=2, so 1.06 squared. Let me calculate that. 1.06 times 1.06. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is another 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them all up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 = 1.12, plus 0.0036 is 1.1236. Wait, wait, that can't be right because 1.06 squared is actually 1.1236. Oh yeah, right.\n\nSo A is 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 * 1.1236. 5000 times 1 is 5000, 5000 times 0.12 is 600, 5000 times 0.0036 is 18. So adding all together: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So the total amount after one year is $5,618.\n\nBut the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest is A minus P. That would be 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618.\n\nWait, looking at the options: option B is $618. So that should be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to think about it: since it's compounded semi-annually, each six months, the interest is 6% of the current amount. So for the first six months, the interest is 5000 * 0.06 = 300. The new principal becomes 5300. Then, for the next six months, the interest is 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618.

The annual interest rate r is 12%, which is 0.12 in decimal. The compounding is done every six months, so n would be 2.

Let me do that. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.06 is 0.06, 0.06 times 1 is 0.06, and 0.06 times 0.06 is 0.0036. Adding them all together: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236.

So the interest is 618, which is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate in decimal),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded semi-annually),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (time in years).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{2}\\right)^{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06\\). Then, the exponent \\(2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\), so:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1.06\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nNext, compute \\((1.06)^2\\). Using the formula \\((1 + 0.06)^2 = 1 + 2(0.06) + (0.06)^2 = 1 + 0.12 + 0.0036 = 1.1236\\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\cdot 1.1236 = 5618\n\\]\n\nThe total amount after 1 year is \\$5,618. To find the interest accrued, subtract the principal:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618\n\\]\n\nThus, the interest accrued at maturity is \\$618, which corresponds to option B.\n\nAnswer: B",

I'm a bit rusty on compound interest, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nThe problem says it's a 1-year bond for $5,000 with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. Oh right, compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times per year. So in this case, every six months, the interest is added once.\n\nWait, the formula for compound interest is A = P (1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 12% becomes 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (here, 1 year).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers. The rate is 12%, so r = 0.12. It's compounded every six months, so n = 2. Time is 1 year, so t = 1.\n\nWait, but the question isn't asking for the total amount, but the interest accrued. So I need to calculate the total amount and then subtract the principal to get the interest.\n\nLet me write that down. So first calculate A:\n\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\n\nSimplify that. 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. And 2*1 is 2. So the equation becomes:\n\nA = 5000 * (1.06)^2\n\nWhat's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 1.06 is 1.1236. So A is 5000 * 1.1236.\n\n5000 * 1.1236: Let me compute that. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.1236 is 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 *0.0036 is 18. So 600 +18 =618. So 5000 +618=5618.\n\nSo A is $5618. The principal was $5000, so the interest is 5618 -5000 = $618.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. Alternatively, I could compute 5000 * 1.1236 directly. Let's see: 5000 * 1 =5000. 5000 *0.1236 =5000 *0.12=600, 5000*0.0036=18. So 600+18=618. So 5000 +618 =5618. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo the interest is $618. Let me look at the options. Option B is 618, so that's the one. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the calculation steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of each compounding period. The first six months: the interest is 5000 * 6% (since it's compounded semi-annually). 6% of 5000 is 300. So after six months, the amount is 5000 +300=5300.\n\nThen, the next six months, the interest is 6% of 5300. 6% is 0.06. 5300 *0.06= 318. So after the second six months, the amount is 5300 +318=5618.

So each compounding period gives 6% interest.\n\nThen, 2*1 is 2, so we have (1.06)^2. What's 1.06 squared?

Hmm, so Jerry bought a 1-year bond for $5,000, and it has a 12% annual interest rate compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it has accrued at maturity.\n\nWait, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated and added more than once per year. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year. So each compounding period is six months.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, P is $5,000, r is 12% which is 0.12, n is 2 because it's compounded twice a year, and t is 1 year.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula:\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 plus that is 1.06. Then we raise that to the power of 2 (since 2*1 is 2). \n\n1.06 squared is 1.1236. So multiply that by 5000. \n\n5000 * 1.1236 = 5618.\n\nWait, but the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I need to subtract the principal to find the interest. \n\n5618 minus 5000 is 618. So the interest is $618. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as two six-month periods.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about bonds and interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, so Jerry bought a 1-year bond for $5,000, and it has a 12% annual interest rate compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it has accrued at maturity.\n\nWait, I remember that compound interest means the interest is calculated and added more than once per year. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year. So each compounding period is six months.\n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, P is $5,000, r is 12% which is 0.12, n is 2 because it's compounded twice a year, and t is 1 year.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula:\nA = 5000 * (1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So 1 plus that is 1.06. Then we raise that to the power of 2 (since 2*1 is 2). \n\n1.06 squared is 1.1236. So multiply that by 5000. \n\n5000 * 1.1236 = 5618.\n\nWait, but the question is about the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I need to subtract the principal to find the interest. \n\n5618 minus 5000 is 618. So the interest is $618. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So the answer should be B.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as two six-month periods. Each period, the interest is 6% because 12% annual rate divided by two periods. \n\nFirst six months: 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So the amount after six months is 5300.\n\nSecond six months: 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Same result. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(P = 5000\\) (principal amount),\n- \\(r = 0.12\\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\(n = 2\\) (compounded every six months),\n- \\(t = 1\\) (time in years).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.12}{2}\\right)^{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\frac{0.12}{2} = 0.06\\), so:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\left(1 + 0.06\\right)^2 = 5000 \\cdot (1.06)^2\n\\]\n\nNext, compute \\((1.06)^2 = 1.1236\\), so:\n\n\\[\nA = 5000 \\cdot 1.1236 = 5618\n\\]\n\nThe total amount at maturity is $5618.

Hmm, so Jerry bought a 1-year bond for $5,000, and it has an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. I need to find out how much interest it's accrued at maturity. \n\nWait, compound interest, right? So the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount, which is the initial amount of money.\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the principal P is $5,000. The rate r is 12%, so that's 0.12 in decimal. The time t is 1 year. Since it's compounded every six months, n would be 2, because there are two compounding periods in a year.\n\nSo plugging the numbers into the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.12 divided by 2. That gives 0.06. So each compounding period, the interest is 6%.\n\nThen, the exponent is 2*1 = 2. So we're looking at (1.06) squared.\n\nWhat's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate. 1.06 * 1.06. Let's see, 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. So 1.06 squared is 1.1236.\n\nNow multiply that by the principal: 5000 * 1.1236. Let me do that. 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.12 is 600, 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those: 5000 + 600 is 5600, plus 18 is 5618. So A is $5,618.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So I need to subtract the principal from A. So 5618 - 5000 = 618. That would be the interest earned.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is $618. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: since it's compounded semi-annually, each six months the bond earns 6% interest. So after the first six months, the interest is 5000 * 0.06 = 300. The new principal becomes 5300. Then, the next six months, 5300 * 0.06 is 318. So total interest is 300 + 318 = 618. Yep, same as before. So that's correct.\n",
