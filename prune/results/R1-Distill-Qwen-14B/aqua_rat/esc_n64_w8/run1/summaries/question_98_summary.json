      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully again.\n\nA man is dividing Rs 8600 among his 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The conditions are that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. I need to find out how much each daughter receives. The options are given as A to E, with E being 800.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should assign variables to each of these groups to make it easier. Let's say the amount each nephew gets is a certain value, and then express the sons' and daughters' shares in terms of that.\n\nSo, let me denote the amount each nephew receives as N. Then, each daughter gets four times that, so 4N. Each son gets five times as much as each nephew, so that's 5N.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total amount distributed. The total is the sum of what all the sons, daughters, and nephews get.\n\nLet me compute each group's total:\n\n- Sons: There are 5 sons, each getting 5N. So total for sons is 5 * 5N = 25N.\n- Daughters: There are 4 daughters, each getting 4N. So total for daughters is 4 * 4N = 16N.\n- Nephews: There are 2 nephews, each getting N. So total for nephews is 2 * N = 2N.\n\nAdding all these together gives the total amount:\n\n25N (sons) + 16N (daughters) + 2N (nephews) = (25 + 16 + 2) N = 43N.\n\nAnd the total amount is Rs 8600, so 43N = 8600.\n\nTo find N, I'll divide both sides by 43.\n\nN = 8600 / 43. Let me calculate that. 43 times 200 is 8600, because 43*200 is 8600. So N is 200.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So each nephew gets Rs 200.\n\nNow, each daughter gets four times that, so 4 * 200 = 800. So each daughter receives Rs 800.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 800. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, N = 200. Sons get 5N each, so 1000 each. 5 sons would be 5 * 1000 = 5000. Daughters get 4N each, which is 800 each. 4 daughters would be 4 * 800 = 3200. Nephews get 200 each, 2 of them, so 400.\n\nTotal is 5000 + 3200 + 400 = 8600. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. Each daughter gets Rs 800, which is option E.\n",

The problem states that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five times as much as each nephew. The question is asking how much each daughter receives. The options are A) Rs 400, B) Rs 500, C) Rs 600, D) Rs 700, E) Rs 800.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should start by assigning a variable to the amount each nephew receives because the daughters and sons receive multiples of that amount. So, let's say each nephew gets 'x' rupees. Then, each daughter gets four times that, which would be 4x, and each son gets five times, so 5x.\n\nNow, the total amount is divided among all these people. So, let's calculate how much each group gets.\n\nThere are 5 sons, each getting 5x. So, total for sons is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nThen, there are 4 daughters, each getting 4x. So, that's 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nAnd 2 nephews, each getting x. So, 2x.\n\nAdding all these together: 25x + 16x + 2x. Let me add that up. 25 +16 is 41, plus 2 is 43.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a man divides Rs 8600 among his 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. The problem states that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five times as much as each nephew. The question is asking how much each daughter receives. The options are A) Rs 400, B) Rs 500, C) Rs 600, D) Rs 700, E) Rs 800.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should start by assigning a variable to the amount each nephew receives because the daughters and sons receive multiples of that amount. So, let's say each nephew gets 'x' rupees. Then, each daughter gets four times that, which would be 4x, and each son gets five times, so 5x.\n\nNow, the total amount is divided among all these people. So, let's calculate how much each group gets.\n\nThere are 5 sons, each getting 5x. So, total for sons is 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nThen, there are 4 daughters, each getting 4x. So, that's 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nAnd 2 nephews, each getting x. So, 2x.\n\nAdding all these together: 25x + 16x + 2x. Let me add that up. 25 +16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So, 43x is the total amount.\n\nWait, but the total amount is Rs 8600. So, 43x = 8600. To find x, I can divide 8600 by 43.\n\nLet me calculate that. 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43 * 200 = 8600. So, x is 200.\n\nBut wait, each daughter gets 4x, so 4 * 200 is 800. So each daughter receives Rs 800. Looking at the options, E is 800. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check. \n\nTotal sons:5, each 5x \u2192 25x. Daughters:4, each 4x \u219216x. Nephews:2, each x \u21922x. Total is 25x+16x+2x=43x. 43x=8600 \u2192x=8600/43=200. So yes, each daughter gets 4x=800. So the answer is E.\n\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the amount each nephew receives. Each daughter receives \\( 4x \\), and each son receives \\( 5x \\). The total amount is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.\n\n- Total for sons: \\( 5 \\times 5x = 25x \\)\n- Total for daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4x = 16x \\)\n- Total for nephews: \\( 2 \\times x = 2x \\)\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n25x + 16x + 2x = 43x\n\\]\nThe total amount is Rs 8600, so:\n\\[\n43x = 8600 \\implies x = \\frac{8600}{43} = 200\n\\]\nEach daughter receives \\( 4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\) rupees.\n\nAnswer: E",

How much does each daughter receive?\n\nHmm, the options are A) 400, B) 500, C) 600, D) 700, E) 800. So I need to find out the correct amount each daughter gets.\n\nAlright, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem involving ratios and total distribution. So, the total amount is 8600, and it's being divided among sons, daughters, and nephews. The relationships between their shares are given in terms of the nephews' share.\n\nLet me denote the amount each nephew receives as 'x'. Then, each daughter gets four times that, so 4x. And each son gets five times the nephew's share, so 5x.\n\nSo, each son: 5x, each daughter:4x, each nephew:x.\n\nNow, the man has 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.

So 800 is option E.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me recheck my calculations.\n\nWait, 43x =8600. So x is 8600 /43.

Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so son is 5x.\n\nSo total is 5*(5x) +4*(4x) +2*(x) =25x +16x +2x =43x.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but why are the options including lower numbers? Did I make a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me check the problem again. Oh wait! The problem says \"each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew\", which is correct. Each son five times as much as each nephew, which is correct.\n\nSo, the calculation should be correct. Then why is option E 800 the correct answer?\n\nWait, but perhaps I should recheck the total.\n\nWait, 5 sons each getting 5x=5*200=1000 each. So 5*1000=5000.\n\n4 daughters each getting 800: 4*800=3200.\n\n2 nephews each getting 200: 2*200=400.\n\nAdding these: 5000+3200=8200, plus 400 is 8600.

So x is 200.\n\nWait, so each nephew gets Rs 200. But the question asks how much each daughter gets. Since each daughter gets four times as much as a nephew, that's 4 * 200 = 800. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because 43x is 8600, so x is 200. So daughter's share is 4x = 800. So the answer should be E) Rs 800.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the variables. Each son gets five times as much as a nephew, so 5x. Each daughter four times, 4x. So for 5 sons, 5*5x=25x. 4 daughters, 4*4x=16x. 2 nephews, 2x. Total is 25x +16x +2x =43x. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo 43x=8600, so x=200. So each daughter is 4x=800. So the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man is dividing Rs 8600 among his children and nephews. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says he has 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Hmm. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew. And each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So I think I should probably set up some variables to represent these amounts.\n\nLet me denote the amount each nephew gets as 'x'. Then, each daughter would get 4x, right? Because the daughters get four times as much as the nephews. And each son gets five times as much as a nephew, so that's 5x per son.\n\nSo now, let's figure out the total amount each group receives. \n\nFirst, the nephews: there are 2 of them, each getting x. So that's 2x total.\n\nThe daughters: 4 daughters each getting 4x. So that's 4 * 4x = 16x.\n\nThe sons: 5 sons each getting 5x. So that's 5 * 5x = 25x.\n\nWait, adding all those up, the total money distributed should be 2x + 16x +25x. Let me add those numbers. 2+16 is 18, plus 25 is 43. So total is 43x.\n\nBut the total amount is Rs 8600. So 43x = 8600. \n\nTo find x, I can divide 8600 by 43. Let's see, 43 times 200 is 8600 because 43*200=8600. So x is 200.\n\nWait, so each nephew gets Rs 200. But the question asks how much each daughter gets. Since each daughter gets four times as much as a nephew, that's 4 * 200 = 800. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because 43x is 8600, so x is 200. So daughter's share is 4x = 800.

Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. The question is, how much does each daughter receive?\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. We have different groups: sons, daughters, and nephews. Each group gets a certain amount based on the nephew's share. \n\nSo, let's denote the amount each nephew gets as N. Then, each daughter gets 4N, and each son gets 5N. \n\nWait, so each daughter's share is four times a nephew's share. So if a nephew gets N, a daughter gets 4N. Similarly, a son gets 5N. \n\nNow, the total money is 8600 Rs. So I can write an equation that adds up all the shares from each group.\n\nLet me think about the number of people in each group. There are 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.\n\nSo the total amount is the sum of:\n\n- 5 sons * 5N each = 25N\n- 4 daughters *4N each = 16N\n- 2 nephews * N each = 2N\n\nAdding all together: 25N +16N +2N = 43N.\n\nWait, 25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43.
