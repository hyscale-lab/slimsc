      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about partners in a business and their shares of profit based on the time they've invested and the capital they've contributed.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. Hmm, those are the possible answers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each partner has been in the business. So each partner's share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the duration they were involved. \n\nSo the formula for each partner's share would be: (Capital \u00d7 Time) / Total Capital \u00d7 Time. Or wait, perhaps it's better to calculate each partner's investment-time product, sum them all, and then their shares are proportional to those products.\n\nRight, so the profit is divided in the ratio of their individual contributions of capital multiplied by time. So A, B, and C each have their own (Capital \u00d7 Time) values.\n\nLet me outline the timeline.\n\n- A starts the business. So A's investment is Rs.40,000. Let's say he started at time 0.\n\n- After 2 months, B joins. So B's investment is Rs.60,000 starting from month 2.\n\n- C joins after some more time. Let's say C joins after (x) months from B's joining. So the time between A starting and C joining would be 2 + x months.\n\nWait, but the entire period is a year, which is 12 months. So the business runs for 12 months in total.\n\nLet me calculate how long each partner was involved.\n\n- A was there for the entire 12 months.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- C joined after B by x months, so C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if B joined at month 2, and C joined x months after B, then C's joining time is 2 + x months. So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. But wait, x can't be more than 10, because otherwise C's time would be negative.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the duration each person contributed. Let me model it.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- A's capital: 40,000. Time: 12 months.\n\n- B's capital: 60,000. Time: 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- C's capital: 120,000. Time: Let's say C joined after t months from the start. Then C's time is 12 - t months. But wait, the problem says C joined after some time after B. So B joined at 2 months. So C joined at 2 + x months, where x is the time after B's joining. So C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, but x can't be more than 10, because then C's time would be negative. So x must be less than 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assign variables for the time each person was in the business. Let me see.\n\nLet me define the time each partner was involved:\n\n- A: 12 months.\n\n- B: Let's say B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 10 months (since 12 - 2 =10).\n\n- C: Joined after B, so let's say C joined (2 + x) months after the start. So C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. Wait, but x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So x is the time between B's joining and C's joining.\n\nSo for example, if x is 2 months, then C joined 2 months after B, which would be at month 4. So C's time would be 12 -4=8 months.\n\nSo each partner's contribution is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB:60,000 * (10) = 60,000 * (12-2).\n\nC:120,000 * (12 - (2 + x)) = 120,000 * (10 -x).\n\nWait, but 10 -x can't be negative. So x must be less than 10.\n\nNow, the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So the ratio of their profits is based on their (capital \u00d7 time) contributions.\n\nLet me compute the total profit ratio.\n\nThe total ratio is (A's share + B's share + C's share) = [40000\u00d712] + [60000\u00d7(10)] + [120000\u00d7(10 -x)].\n\nBut let me think about the ratio of each partner's share to the total.\n\nThe ratio for each partner is:\n\nA: 40000 \u00d7 12\n\nB:60000 \u00d7 (10)\n\nC:120000 \u00d7 (10 -x)\n\nBut the total profit is divided in the ratio of these amounts.\n\nSo, C's share is (120000*(10-x)) / [ (40000*12) + (60000*10) + (120000*(10-x)) ) ] \u00d7 total profit.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio of each partner's (capital \u00d7 time), then their shares are in that ratio.\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of:\n\nA : B : C = (40000\u00d712) : (60000\u00d710) : (120000\u00d7(10-x)).\n\nWait, but the actual shares are calculated as:\n\nEach partner's share = (their ratio) \u00d7 total profit / sum of ratios.\n\nSo, given that C's share is 150,000, I can set up an equation to solve for x.\n\nLet me compute the ratios.\n\nCompute A's ratio:\n\n40000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's ratio:\n\n60000 \u00d710 = 600,000.\n\nC's ratio:\n\n120000 \u00d7 (10 - x) = 1200000 - 120000 x.\n\nSo the sum of ratios is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1200000 - 120000 x) = 480k + 600k = 1080k. 1080k + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step.\n\nTotal ratio = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000 x) \n\n= (480,000 + 600,000) + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\n= 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 x\n\n= 2,280,000 - 120,000 x.\n\nSo the total ratio is (2,280,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nC's ratio is (1,200,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nSo, C's share is (C's ratio) / (total ratio) \u00d7 total profit.\n\nGiven that C's share is 150,000 and total profit is 375,000.\n\nSo,\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000 x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) ) \u00d7 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n( (1,200,000 - 120,000 x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 x) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n(1,200,000 - 120,000 x) = 0.4 \u00d7 (2,280,000 - 120,000 x).\n\nCompute 0.4 \u00d7 2,280,000: 0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000.\n\n0.4 \u00d7 (-120,000 x) = -48,000 x.\n\nSo,\n\n1,200,000 - 120,000 x = 912,000 - 48,000 x.\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side.\n\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000 x - 48,000 x.\n\nLeft side: 288,000.\n\nRight side: 72,000 x.\n\nSo,\n\n288,000 = 72,000 x.\n\nDivide both sides by 72,000.\n\n288,000 /72,000 = x.\n\n288,000 \u00f7 72,000 is 4. So x=4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. But what does x represent here? x is the time after B joined that C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo, the answer would be 4 months. Let me check the options. Option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, the equation setup:\n\nC's share = (C's ratio) / (total ratio) * total profit.\n\nC's ratio is 120000*(10-x) = 1200000 -120000x.\n\nTotal ratio is 480000 +600000 + (1200000-120000x) = 2280000 -120000x.\n\nThen, (1200000 - 120000x)/(2280000 -120000x) = 150000/375000 = 0.4.\n\nCross multiply:\n\n1200000 -120000x = 0.4*(2280000 -120000x)\n\nCalculate 0.4*2280000= 912,000.\n\n0.4*(-120000x)= -48,000x.\n\nSo 1200000 -120000x = 912000 -48000x.\n\nBring variables to one side:\n\n1200000 -912000 = 120000x -48000x.\n\n288000 = 72000x.\n\nx=4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 4 months. So the correct answer is B.\n",

Hmm, the question is about partners in a business and their shares of profit based on the time they've invested and the capital they've contributed.\n\nAlright, let's read the problem again. A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84.

Let's say C joins after (x) months from B's joining. So the time between A starting and C joining would be 2 + x months.\n\nWait, but the entire period is a year, which is 12 months. So the business runs for 12 months in total.\n\nLet me calculate how long each partner was involved.\n\n- A was there for the entire 12 months.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- C joined after B by x months, so C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if B joined at month 2, and C joined x months after B, then C's joining time is 2 + x months. So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months.

Time: Let's say C joined after t months from the start. Then C's time is 12 - t months. But wait, the problem says C joined after some time after B. So B joined at 2 months.

So C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. Wait, but x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So x is the time between B's joining and C's joining.\n\nSo for example, if x is 2 months, then C joined 2 months after B, which would be at month 4. So C's time would be 12 -4=8 months.\n\nSo each partner's contribution is:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB:60,000 * (10) = 60,000 * (12-2).\n\nC:120,000 * (12 - (2 + x)) = 120,000 * (10 -x).\n\nWait, but 10 -x can't be negative.

So x=4.\n\nWait, so x is 4 months. But what does x represent here? x is the time after B joined that C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo, the answer would be 4 months. Let me check the options. Option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, the equation setup:\n\nC's share = (C's ratio) / (total ratio) * total profit.\n\nC's ratio is 120000*(10-x) = 1200000 -120000x.\n\nTotal ratio is 480000 +600000 + (1200000-120000x) = 2280000 -120000x.\n\nThen, (1200000 - 120000x)/(2280000 -120000x) = 150000/375000 = 0.4.\n\nCross multiply:\n\n1200000 -120000x = 0.4*(2280000 -120000x)\n\nCalculate 0.4*2280000= 912,000.\n\n0.4*(-120000x)= -48,000x.\n\nSo 1200000 -120000x = 912000 -48000x.\n\nBring variables to one side:\n\n1200000 -912000 = 120000x -48000x.\n\n288000 = 72000x.\n\nx=4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 4 months. So the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit shares of A, B, and C based on their capital contributions and the time they were involved in the business. The profit is distributed in the ratio of their respective contributions, which is given by the product of capital and time.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Contribution**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 40,000  \n   - Time: 12 months (entire duration of the business)  \n   - Contribution: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n\n2. **B's Contribution**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 60,000  \n   - Time: \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months (joined after 2 months)  \n   - Contribution: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n\n3. **C's Contribution**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 120,000  \n   - Time: Joined \\( x \\) months after B, so total time in the business is \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months.  \n   - Contribution: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x \\)\n\n### Total Profit and C's Share:\n- Total profit: Rs. 375,000  \n- C's share: Rs. 150,000  \n\nThe profit is distributed in the ratio of the contributions of A, B, and C.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business partnership problem to solve. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some time later, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm, I remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the amount of capital each partner invested and the time they were in the business. So it's like their share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). \n\nLet me break down the timeline:\n\n- A starts first. So A's investment is for the entire year, which is 12 months. But wait, B joins after 2 months, so A's investment period is 12 months.\n\nWait, no. Let me structure it properly. Let's list each partner's investment period.\n\nA: He started at the beginning, so he's in for the entire 12 months.\n\nB: Joined after 2 months, so how long was he in? Let's say he joined at month 2 and stayed until the end. So that's 10 months (because 12 - 2 = 10). Wait, no, 12 - 2 is 10, but since the months are counted from the start, if he joined at month 2, he is present for 10 months? Or 10 months? Wait, yes, from month 2 to month 12 is 11 months? Wait, no, because if the business runs for a year, which is 12 months. So if someone joins at the beginning, they are there for 12 months. If they join at month 2, then the time is 10 months (since 12 - 2 = 10). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: if you join in month 2, you start contributing from that point. So from month 2 to month 12 is 11 months, right? Because from month 2 to 3 is 1, up to 12, which is 11 months. Wait, but sometimes people count the first month as part of the investment. So, maybe the calculation is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model each person's investment period in months as follows:\n\n- A: 12 months (since he started at month 0)\n- B: Let's say B joined at month 2, so his investment period is 12 - 2 = 10 months. Wait, no, that would be if he left at month 12. But he was there until the end. So if the business runs for 12 months, and B joined at month 2, then his time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Or is it 11 months? Hmm. Let's see: from month 2 to month 12 is 11 months. Because in month 2, he's there for the entire month. So from month 2 to 12 is 11 months.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the time as the number of months they were part of the business. So if someone starts at time t and ends at time T, the time is T - t.\n\nBut when considering the first month, if someone starts in the first month, they contribute for the entire month. So for example, if someone joins at the start of month 2, they are present for months 2 through 12, which is 11 months.\n\nSo A is present for 12 months. B is present for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months, so 12 - 2 = 10). Wait, no, 12 - 2 is 10, but that would mean he is present for 10 months, but that's from month 3 to 12, which is 10 months. Wait, no: from month 2 (joining) to month 12, that's 11 months. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the joining is at the start of a month or the end. Let me clarify:\n\n- The business runs for 12 months. Let's say the first month is month 1.\n\nA starts at the beginning of month 1. So he's in for 12 months.\n\nB joins after 2 months. So that would be at the beginning of month 3? Because after 2 months, the next month is 3. So B is present from month 3 to month 12, which is 10 months.\n\nWait, but 12 - 3 + 1 = 10 months? Because from month 3 to 12 inclusive, that's 10 months.\n\nWait, no. 12 - 3 = 9, but adding 1 gives 10 months. So yes, B is there for 10 months.\n\nNow, C joins after some more time. Let's say C joined x months after B joined. So since B joined at month 3, C joined at month 3 + x. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (3 + x) months. Because the business ends at month 12.\n\nWait, no, the time is from when C joins (month 3 + x) until the end (month 12), which is 12 - (3 + x) + 1 months? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf someone starts at the beginning of a month, they stay for that entire month. So if C joins at the beginning of month (3 + x), then the number of months they contribute is from (3 + x) to 12, inclusive.\n\nSo that's 12 - (3 + x) + 1 = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, wait. Let's take an example. If x is 0 (C joins at the same time as B), then C's time is 10 months. If x is 1, C joins at month 4, then time is 9 months (months 4 to 12 is 9 months). So 12 - (3 + 1) +1 = 9 months. So yes, the formula is 12 - (3 + x) + 1 = 10 - x months. Wait, no, 12 - (3+x) +1 = 10 - x. So if x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think of it as:\n\nTotal time each partner is in the business:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since he joined 2 months after A, so 12 - 2 = 10)\n- C: Let\u2019s say C joined t months after B. So C joined 2 + t months after A started. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nWait, no, because the business is for 12 months. So if someone joins at month (2 + t), they are in for (12 - (2 + t)) months. Because from (2 + t) to 12 is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me take t=0: C joins at same time as B, which is 2 months after A. So C's time would be 10 months. 12 - (2+0) =10. Correct. If t=1, C joins at 3 months, time is 9 months. 12-3=9. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo C's time is (12 - (2 + t)) months, where t is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nAlternatively, C joined t months after B. So if B joined at month 2, then C joined at month (2 + t). So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as 10 - t. Because 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t.\n\nSo each partner's investment in terms of capital multiplied by time (called their 'capital-time' product) is:\n\n- A: 40,000 * 12\n- B: 60,000 * (10)\n- C: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, because if t is the months after B joined, then C's time is (10 - t) months? No, wait, no. Because 12 - (2 + t) =10 - t.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If t is the months after B joined, then:\n\nC's time = 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000.\n\nSo the ratio of their shares is equal to the ratio of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's share: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's share: 60000 * (10) = 600,000\nC's share: 120000 * (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 - t)\n\nWait, but the profit is 375,000, and the sum of their shares should add up to that. Wait, no, because they're sharing the profit according to their ratios. So the total ratio is the sum of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nSo the total ratio is (40000\u00d712) + (60000\u00d710) + (120000\u00d7(10 - t)).\n\nWhich is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, wait, 120,000*(10 -t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo total ratio = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nNow, C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total ratio is 150,000 / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = ?\n\nBut wait, the profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nBut how does this relate to their capital-time ratios?\n\nWait, the profit is divided according to their capital \u00d7 time. So the total ratio is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nC's capital \u00d7 time is 120,000*(10 - t).\n\nSo C's share is (120,000*(10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000 * (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(120,000 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 2/5.\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCalculate left side: 5 *120,000 = 600,000. So 600,000*(10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 *2,280,000 = 4,560,000. 2 * (-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So total is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\nt = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, that's t=4.\n\nBut wait, t is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So if t=4, then C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo the time after B joined is 4 months.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, the equation setup:\n\nC's share is 150,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit. So, the ratio of C's capital*time to the total capital*time should be 2/5.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 - t)) / (total ratio) = 2/5.\n\nWhich led to t=4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n",

So if C joins at the beginning of month (3 + x), then the number of months they contribute is from (3 + x) to 12, inclusive.\n\nSo that's 12 - (3 + x) + 1 = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, wait. Let's take an example. If x is 0 (C joins at the same time as B), then C's time is 10 months. If x is 1, C joins at month 4, then time is 9 months (months 4 to 12 is 9 months). So 12 - (3 + 1) +1 = 9 months. So yes, the formula is 12 - (3 + x) + 1 = 10 - x months. Wait, no, 12 - (3+x) +1 = 10 - x. So if x is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think of it as:\n\nTotal time each partner is in the business:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since he joined 2 months after A, so 12 - 2 = 10)\n- C: Let\u2019s say C joined t months after B. So C joined 2 + t months after A started. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nWait, no, because the business is for 12 months. So if someone joins at month (2 + t), they are in for (12 - (2 + t)) months. Because from (2 + t) to 12 is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me take t=0: C joins at same time as B, which is 2 months after A. So C's time would be 10 months. 12 - (2+0) =10. Correct. If t=1, C joins at 3 months, time is 9 months. 12-3=9. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo C's time is (12 - (2 + t)) months, where t is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nAlternatively, C joined t months after B. So if B joined at month 2, then C joined at month (2 + t). So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as 10 - t. Because 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t.\n\nSo each partner's investment in terms of capital multiplied by time (called their 'capital-time' product) is:\n\n- A: 40,000 * 12\n- B: 60,000 * (10)\n- C: 120,000 * (10 - t)\n\nWait, because if t is the months after B joined, then C's time is (10 - t) months? No, wait, no. Because 12 - (2 + t) =10 - t.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If t is the months after B joined, then:\n\nC's time = 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000.\n\nSo the ratio of their shares is equal to the ratio of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's share: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's share: 60000 * (10) = 600,000\nC's share: 120000 * (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 - t)\n\nWait, but the profit is 375,000, and the sum of their shares should add up to that. Wait, no, because they're sharing the profit according to their ratios. So the total ratio is the sum of their capital \u00d7 time.\n\nSo the total ratio is (40000\u00d712) + (60000\u00d710) + (120000\u00d7(10 - t)).\n\nWhich is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, wait, 120,000*(10 -t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo total ratio = 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nNow, C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total ratio is 150,000 / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = ?\n\nBut wait, the profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nBut how does this relate to their capital-time ratios?\n\nWait, the profit is divided according to their capital \u00d7 time. So the total ratio is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nC's capital \u00d7 time is 120,000*(10 - t).\n\nSo C's share is (120,000*(10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000 * (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4, which is 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n(120,000 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 2/5.\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCalculate left side: 5 *120,000 = 600,000. So 600,000*(10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 *2,280,000 = 4,560,000. 2 * (-120,000 t) = -240,000 t. So total is 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 600,000 t - 240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\nt = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nWait, that's t=4.\n\nBut wait, t is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So if t=4, then C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo the time after B joined is 4 months.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, the equation setup:\n\nC's share is 150,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit. So, the ratio of C's capital*time to the total capital*time should be 2/5.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 - t)) / (total ratio) = 2/5.\n\nWhich led to t=4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital invested and the time each partner was in the business. The profit is distributed proportionally to the product of capital and time for each partner.\n\n### Step 1: Define the timeline and investment periods\n- **A** starts the business with Rs.40,000 and remains in the business for the entire year, i.e., **12 months**.\n- **B** joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000 and stays in the business for **10 months** (from month 3 to month 12).\n- **C** joins after some time with Rs.120,000. Let the number of months after B joined that C joined be **t**. Thus, C's investment period is **12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the \"capital \u00d7 time\" for each partner\n- **A's capital \u00d7 time**: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n- **B's capital \u00d7 time**: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n- **C's capital \u00d7 time**: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - t) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Total profit and C's share\nThe total profit is Rs.375,000, and C's share is Rs.150,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:\n\\[\n\\frac{150,000}{375,000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nThis means C's \"capital \u00d7 time\" must be \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the total \"capital \u00d7 time\" of all partners.\n\n### Step 4: Set up the equation for total \"capital \u00d7 time\"\nThe total \"capital \u00d7 time\" is:\n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 2,280,000 - 120,000t\n\\]\nC's \"capital \u00d7 time\" is \\(120,000 \\times (10 - t)\\). According to the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{2,280,000 - 120,000t} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(t\\)\nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\n5 \\times 120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 2 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000t)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n6,000,000 - 600,000t = 4,560,000 - 240,000t\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\n1,440,000 = 360,000t\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{1,440,000}{360,000} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Interpret the result\n\\(t = 4\\) means C joined **4 months after B**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this business problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some more time passes, and C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm. So the key here is understanding how partnerships work, especially when people join at different times. I remember that the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each person has been in the business. So it's like their investment times the duration they were in the business, right? That's called the concept of \"man-month\" or something like that.\n\nLet me outline the periods each person was in the business.\n\nA starts first. He invests Rs.40,000. Let's see, the total time of the business is a year, which is 12 months. But since A started at the beginning, he is there for the entire 12 months. So A's investment period is 12 months.\n\nB joins after 2 months. So B starts in month 3. But when does C join? Let's denote the time after B joined as x months. Wait, no. Because the question is how many months after B joined did C join. So if B joined at 2 months in, and C joined x months after B, then C joined at 2 + x months from the start. Then, since the business runs for a year (12 months), the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the business runs for 12 months. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins some time after B, say at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. Then, the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that can't be right because if x is 0, C would be in for 10 months. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, if B joins after 2 months, then C joins after B, which is 2 + x months from the start. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. But wait, if x is the number of months after B joined, then yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as the time each person contributed. Let me write down:\n\nA's time: 12 months.\n\nB's time: 12 - 2 = 10 months? No, wait. Because B joined after 2 months, so he was there for 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nWait, no, that's correct. Because the total duration is 12 months, and B started at 2 months in. So he was present for 10 months.\n\nSimilarly, C joined after B, so let's say C joined y months after B. So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months. But the question is asking for y, which is how many months after B joined did C join. So y is the value we need.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is worded, it's \"after some more time\" after B joined. So perhaps I should model the time each person contributed.\n\nSo the profit is divided in the ratio of (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time). Since the profit is split in that ratio, I can set up the ratios.\n\nSo let me calculate each person's product.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business. Because C joined after B, t = 12 - (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. Alternatively, t = 10 - x. Wait, but perhaps it's better to express t in terms of when C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of C's time as (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the months after B joined. So t = 10 - x.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined as t months after the start. Since A started at 0, and B joined at 2 months, then C joined at t months, where t > 2. Then, the time C was in the business is (12 - t) months.\n\nSo:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - t) = 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. So the sum of their shares is 375,000.\n\nBut the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions.\n\nSo the ratio is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nBut we know that C's share is 150,000.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the ratio of their contributions. Let's compute the total contribution for each, then find the ratio.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the total contribution and then find each person's share based on that.\n\nWait, the profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5. Hmm, 150,000 divided by 375,000 is 0.4, or 2/5. Wait, 150,000 is 40% of 375,000. So C's share is 40% of the profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the ratio of each person's contribution to the total contribution and then set up equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of their contributions is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nLet me compute the sum of the contributions.\n\nTotal contribution = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nBut the profit is distributed according to the ratio of their contributions. So the sum of their contributions is the total, and each person's share is their contribution divided by the total, multiplied by the profit.\n\nSo C's share is [120,000*(12 - t)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(12 - t) is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, 120,000*(12 - t) is 1,440,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t)] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me simplify the equation:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000.\n\nLet me denote (12 - t) as x for a moment, but maybe not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to cross-multiply.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000 = 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: 120,000 * (12 - t) * 375,000.\n\nRight side: 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, let's compute left side:\n\n120,000 * 375,000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nMultiply by (12 - t): 45,000,000,000 * (12 - t).\n\nRight side: 150,000 * 2,520,000 = 150,000 * 2.52e6 = 378,000,000,000.\n\n150,000 * (-120,000 t) = -18,000,000,000 t.\n\nSo right side: 378e9 - 18e9 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n45e9 * (12 - t) = 378e9 - 18e9 t.\n\nDivide both sides by 3e9 to simplify:\n\n45e9 /3e9 = 15; 378e9/3e9=126; 18e9/3e9=6.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n15*(12 - t) = 126 - 6 t.\n\nMultiply out left side:\n\n180 -15 t = 126 -6 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n180 -15t -126 +6t =0.\n\n54 -9t =0.\n\nSo 54 =9t \u2192 t=6.\n\nWait, t is the time when C joined in months from the start. Because earlier, I defined t as the time when C joined from the start.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me recap. I defined t as the time when C joined, measured in months from the start. So C joined at t months.\n\nBut B joined at 2 months. So the time after B joined is (t -2) months.\n\nWait, wait, that's correct. Because t is the time from the start when C joined. So the time after B joined is t - 2.\n\nSo if t is 6, then C joined 6 months from the start. But B joined at 2 months. So the time between B joining and C joining is 6 - 2 = 4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months. Let me check the options. Option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe set up the equation:\n\n(120,000*(12 - t)) * 375,000 / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000.\n\nWait, no, the initial equation was:\n\n( [120,000*(12 - t)] / [total contributions] ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo [120,000*(12 - t)] / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nWait, the total contributions are 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(12 - t) (C).\n\nWhich is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000 ] = 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier in setting up the equation. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the profit is 375,000, which is divided into A, B, C's shares based on their contributions. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is (C's contribution) / (total contributions).\n\nSo C's share is (C's contribution / total contributions) * 375,000.\n\nGiven that C's share is 150,000, we can set up:\n\n(120,000*(12 - t) ) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t) ) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let me compute this correctly.\n\nLet me compute the denominator: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nAdding 120,000*(12 -t) gives 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150/375 = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) = 0.4 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCompute right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,520,000 = 1,008,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) = 1,008,000 -48,000 t.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n120,000 *12 = 1,440,000.\n\n120,000*(-t) = -120,000 t.\n\nSo:\n\n1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 1,008,000 -48,000 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1,440,000 -120,000 t -1,008,000 +48,000 t =0.\n\nCompute:\n\n1,440,000 -1,008,000 = 432,000.\n\n-120,000 t +48,000 t = -72,000 t.\n\nSo equation: 432,000 -72,000 t = 0.\n\n72,000 t = 432,000.\n\nt = 432,000 /72,000 = 6.\n\nSo t is 6 months.\n\nWait, t is the time from the start when C joined. So C joined at 6 months.\n\nBut B joined at 2 months. So the time after B joined is 6-2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check.\n\nIf C joined 4 months after B, which was at 2 months in, so C joined at 6 months.\n\nSo C's time in the business is 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nSo C's contribution is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution is 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution is 60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nSo the ratio is 480,000 :600,000 :720,000.\n\nWhich simplifies to 480 :600 :720.\n\nDivide each by 120: 4:5:6.\n\nSo total parts =4+5+6=15.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000.\n\nSo each part is 375,000 /15=25,000.\n\nC's share is 6 parts \u2192 6*25,000=150,000.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this business problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.\n\nAlright, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, some more time passes, and C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm. So the key here is understanding how partnerships work, especially when people join at different times. I remember that the profit is divided based on the capital multiplied by the time each person has been in the business. So it's like their investment times the duration they were in the business, right? That's called the concept of \"man-month\" or something like that.\n\nLet me outline the periods each person was in the business.\n\nA starts first. He invests Rs.40,000. Let's see, the total time of the business is a year, which is 12 months. But since A started at the beginning, he is there for the entire 12 months. So A's investment period is 12 months.\n\nB joins after 2 months. So B starts in month 3. But when does C join? Let's denote the time after B joined as x months. Wait, no. Because the question is how many months after B joined did C join. So if B joined at 2 months in, and C joined x months after B, then C joined at 2 + x months from the start. Then, since the business runs for a year (12 months), the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) months. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the business runs for 12 months. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins some time after B, say at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. Then, the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that can't be right because if x is 0, C would be in for 10 months. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, if B joins after 2 months, then C joins after B, which is 2 + x months from the start. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. But wait, if x is the number of months after B joined, then yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as the time each person contributed. Let me write down:\n\nA's time: 12 months.\n\nB's time: 12 - 2 = 10 months? No, wait. Because B joined after 2 months, so he was there for 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\nWait, no, that's correct. Because the total duration is 12 months, and B started at 2 months in. So he was present for 10 months.\n\nSimilarly, C joined after B, so let's say C joined y months after B. So the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + y) = 10 - y months. But the question is asking for y, which is how many months after B joined did C join. So y is the value we need.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is worded, it's \"after some more time\" after B joined. So perhaps I should model the time each person contributed.\n\nSo the profit is divided in the ratio of (A's investment * A's time) : (B's investment * B's time) : (C's investment * C's time). Since the profit is split in that ratio, I can set up the ratios.\n\nSo let me calculate each person's product.\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * t, where t is the time C was in the business. Because C joined after B, t = 12 - (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. Alternatively, t = 10 - x. Wait, but perhaps it's better to express t in terms of when C joined.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of C's time as (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the months after B joined. So t = 10 - x.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined as t months after the start. Since A started at 0, and B joined at 2 months, then C joined at t months, where t > 2. Then, the time C was in the business is (12 - t) months.\n\nSo:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - t) = 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000. So the sum of their shares is 375,000.\n\nBut the profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions.\n\nSo the ratio is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nBut we know that C's share is 150,000.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the ratio of their contributions. Let's compute the total contribution for each, then find the ratio.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute the total contribution and then find each person's share based on that.\n\nWait, the profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5. Hmm, 150,000 divided by 375,000 is 0.4, or 2/5. Wait, 150,000 is 40% of 375,000. So C's share is 40% of the profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the ratio of each person's contribution to the total contribution and then set up equations.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of their contributions is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nLet me compute the sum of the contributions.\n\nTotal contribution = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(12 - t).\n\nBut the profit is distributed according to the ratio of their contributions. So the sum of their contributions is the total, and each person's share is their contribution divided by the total, multiplied by the profit.\n\nSo C's share is [120,000*(12 - t)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t)] / [480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Plus 120,000*(12 - t) is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, 120,000*(12 - t) is 1,440,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t)] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me simplify the equation:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) = 150,000.\n\nLet me denote (12 - t) as x for a moment, but maybe not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to cross-multiply.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000 = 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: 120,000 * (12 - t) * 375,000.\n\nRight side: 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, let's compute left side:\n\n120,000 * 375,000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nMultiply by (12 - t): 45,000,000,000 * (12 - t).\n\nRight side: 150,000 * 2,520,000 = 150,000 * 2.52e6 = 378,000,000,000.\n\n150,000 * (-120,000 t) = -18,000,000,000 t.\n\nSo right side: 378e9 - 18e9 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n45e9 * (12 - t) = 378e9 - 18e9 t.\n\nDivide both sides by 3e9 to simplify:\n\n45e9 /3e9 = 15; 378e9/3e9=126; 18e9/3e9=6.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n15*(12 - t) = 126 - 6 t.\n\nMultiply out left side:\n\n180 -15 t = 126 -6 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n180 -15t -126 +6t =0.\n\n54 -9t =0.\n\nSo 54 =9t \u2192 t=6.\n\nWait, t is the time when C joined in months from the start. Because earlier, I defined t as the time when C joined from the start.\n\nBut wait, wait, let me recap. I defined t as the time when C joined, measured in months from the start. So C joined at t months.\n\nBut B joined at 2 months. So the time after B joined is (t -2) months.\n\nWait, wait, that's correct. Because t is the time from the start when C joined. So the time after B joined is t - 2.\n\nSo if t is 6, then C joined 6 months from the start. But B joined at 2 months. So the time between B joining and C joining is 6 - 2 = 4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months. Let me check the options. Option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe set up the equation:\n\n(120,000*(12 - t)) * 375,000 / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000.\n\nWait, no, the initial equation was:\n\n( [120,000*(12 - t)] / [total contributions] ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo [120,000*(12 - t)] / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nWait, the total contributions are 480,000 (A) + 600,000 (B) + 120,000*(12 - t) (C).\n\nWhich is 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) * 375,000 ] = 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier in setting up the equation. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, the profit is 375,000, which is divided into A, B, C's shares based on their contributions. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is (C's contribution) / (total contributions).\n\nSo C's share is (C's contribution / total contributions) * 375,000.\n\nGiven that C's share is 150,000, we can set up:\n\n(120,000*(12 - t) ) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t) ) ) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nSo let me compute this correctly.\n\nLet me compute the denominator: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nAdding 120,000*(12 -t) gives 1,080,000 + 1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 2,520,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 375,000:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150/375 = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(12 - t) ] / (2,520,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) = 0.4 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nCompute right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,520,000 = 1,008,000.\n\n0.4 * (-120,000 t) = -48,000 t.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n120,000*(12 - t) = 1,008,000 -48,000 t.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n120,000 *12 = 1,440,000.\n\n120,000*(-t) = -120,000 t.\n\nSo:\n\n1,440,000 - 120,000 t = 1,008,000 -48,000 t.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n1,440,000 -120,000 t -1,008,000 +48,000 t =0.\n\nCompute:\n\n1,440,000 -1,008,000 = 432,000.\n\n-120,000 t +48,000 t = -72,000 t.\n\nSo equation: 432,000 -72,000 t = 0.\n\n72,000 t = 432,000.\n\nt = 432,000 /72,000 = 6.\n\nSo t is 6 months.\n\nWait, t is the time from the start when C joined. So C joined at 6 months.\n\nBut B joined at 2 months. So the time after B joined is 6-2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check.\n\nIf C joined 4 months after B, which was at 2 months in, so C joined at 6 months.\n\nSo C's time in the business is 12 -6 =6 months.\n\nSo C's contribution is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nA's contribution is 40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB's contribution is 60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nTotal contributions: 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nSo the ratio is 480,000 :600,000 :720,000.\n\nWhich simplifies to 480 :600 :720.\n\nDivide each by 120: 4:5:6.\n\nSo total parts =4+5+6=15.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000.\n\nSo each part is 375,000 /15=25,000.\n\nC's share is 6 parts \u2192 6*25,000=150,000. Which matches the given data.\n\nYes, this all checks out.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business did C join.

The ratio of C's share to the total profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{C's Contribution}}{\\text{Total Contribution}} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n   \\]\n   Substituting C's contribution:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} \\times 375,000 = 150,000.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   Divide both sides by 375,000:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4.\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x).\n   \\]\n   Expand and simplify:\n   \\[\n   1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x.\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000x - 48,000x.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   288,000 = 72,000x.\n   \\]\n   Solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   C joined 4 months after B joined the business. This corresponds to **Option B**.\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this business partnership problem. Hmm, I remember that in such problems, the profit is divided based on the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. So, it's like calculating the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nSo, the first thing I should probably do is figure out how much each person invested and for how long. Let's go step by step.\n\nA starts the business with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. And then after some more time, C joins with Rs.120,000. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. We need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the total time is a year, which is 12 months. So, A was there for the entire year, B was there for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months), and C's time is what we need to find.\n\nLet me outline the information:\n\n- A's investment: Rs.40,000 for 12 months.\n- B's investment: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C's investment: Rs.120,000 for (12 - x) months, where x is the time after B joined. Or wait, no, because B joined after 2 months, and C joined after some more time. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nSo, A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins after some more months, say 't' months after B joined. So, C joins at month (2 + t). Then, the time C is in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) months, right? Because the business runs for a year (12 months). So C's time is (10 - t) months.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, C's investment period is (10 - t) months. Because from when C joins to the end is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months.\n\nNow, the profit is divided in the ratio of their individual investments multiplied by their time. So, the ratio is:\n\nA : B : C = (40000 * 12) : (60000 * 10) : (120000 * (10 - t)).\n\nWait, let me compute each part.\n\nCalculating each person's capital multiplied by time:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000.\nB: 60000 * 10 = 600,000.\nC: 120000 * (10 - t) = 1,200,000 * (10 - t).\n\nWait, 120,000 multiplied by (10 - t) would be 120000*(10-t). Let me compute that:\n\nWait, 120,000 is 1.2 lakhs. So 1.2 * (10-t) = 12*(10-t) * 10,000.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to write it as 120000*(10-t).\n\nSo, the profit is divided in the ratio of these three numbers: 480000, 600000, and 120000*(10 - t).\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. And C gets 150,000.\n\nSo, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, or 40%.\n\nWait, but the ratio of each person's share is based on their (capital * time). So, let me find C's share as a fraction of the total.\n\nC's share is 150,000. So, the total parts would be A's part + B's part + C's part. Let me compute the sum of their (capital * time):\n\nSum = 40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 - t).\n\nWhich is 480,000 + 600,000 + 1,200,000*(10 - t).\n\nWait, wait, 120000*(10 - t) is 1200000*(10 - t)? No, wait: 120000 is 1.2 * 10^5, so 120000*(10-t) is 1.2e5 * (10-t). Let me compute each term:\n\n40000 * 12 = 480,000\n60000 *10=600,000\n120000*(10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, 120000*(10-t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t? No, wait, 120,000 * 10 is 1,200,000, and 120,000 * t is 120,000 t. So yeah, 1,200,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, but I think I'm getting confused with the units. Let me re-express all in terms of thousands to make it easier.\n\n40000 * 12 = 480,000 = 480 (in thousands)\n60000 *10=600,000 =600\n120000*(10-t) = 120*(10 - t) = 1200 - 120t.\n\nSo, the sum is 480 + 600 + 1200 - 120t = (480 + 600) is 1080, plus 1200 is 2280, minus 120t.\n\nSo, sum = 2280 - 120t.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, which is 375 in thousands. So, the sum of their ratios should equal 375, right? Or wait, the sum is the total parts, and each part corresponds to a certain share. So, the total parts are 480 + 600 + (1200 - 120t) = 2280 -120t.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. So, the sum of all parts is 2280 -120t (in thousands). But 375,000 is 375 in thousands. So, 2280 - 120t = 375? That can't be right because 2280 is way bigger than 375. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I messed up the units.\n\nWait a minute, no. The profit is 375,000, which is the total, and each person's share is based on their (capital * time). So, the sum of all (capital * time) is the total 'investment units' and the profit is divided according to this ratio. So, the total ratio is 480 (A) + 600 (B) + 1200 - 120t (C) = 2280 -120t.\n\nBut the total ratio (sum) is 2280 - 120t, and the profit is 375,000. So, each unit of ratio corresponds to 375,000 / (2280 - 120t) per thousand. Hmm, not sure if I'm getting that right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of fractions. The share of each partner is (their investment * time) divided by total sum of (investment * time), multiplied by the total profit.\n\nSo, for C, their share is [120000*(10 - t)] / [sum of all] * 375000 = 150,000.\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(120000 * (10 - t)) / [40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 - t)] = 150000 / 375000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150000 /375000 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\n[120000*(10 - t)] / [480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 - t)] = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute the denominator:\n\n480000 + 600000 = 1,080,000.\n\nDenominator = 1,080,000 + 120000*(10 - t).\n\nSo,\n\n120000*(10 - t) / (1,080,000 + 120000*(10 - t)) = 0.4.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 120000 to simplify.\n\n(10 - t) / [ (1,080,000 / 120,000) + (10 - t) ) ] = 0.4.\n\nCompute 1,080,000 /120,000 = 9.\n\nSo,\n\n(10 - t) / [9 + (10 - t)] = 0.4.\n\nLet me let x = 10 - t.\n\nSo, x / (9 + x) = 0.4.\n\nMultiply both sides by (9 + x):\n\nx = 0.4*(9 + x).\n\nx = 3.6 + 0.4x.\n\nx - 0.4x = 3.6.\n\n0.6x = 3.6.\n\nx = 3.6 / 0.6 = 6.\n\nSo, x is 6. But x is 10 - t.\n\nSo, 10 - t = 6 \u2192 t = 10 -6 \u2192 t=4.\n\nWait, t is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as A)2, B)4, etc. So, the correct option would be B)4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nSo, t=4 months. So, C joined 4 months after B. B joined at month 2, so C joined at 2 +4=6 months from the start. Then, the time C was in the business is 12 -6=6 months.\n\nSo, let's check the ratios.\n\nA: 40,000 *12 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nSum is 480,000 +600,000=1,080,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000. So each unit is 375000 /1,800,000 = 0.216666... per 1.\n\nC's share is 720,000 * 0.216666... = 720,000 * (375000 /1,800,000).\n\nWait, 375,000 /1,800,000 = 0.208333... Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, actually, each person's share is (their investment * time) multiplied by (total profit / total investment units).\n\nSo, C's share = 720,000 * (375000 /1,800,000).\n\nCompute 375000 /1,800,000 = 0.208333... So,\n\n720,000 * 0.208333 = 720,000 * (5/24) = 720,000 *5=3,600,000; divided by 24: 3,600,000 /24= 150,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems right. So, C joined 4 months after B. So, the answer is option B.\n",

But x is 10 - t.\n\nSo, 10 - t = 6 \u2192 t = 10 -6 \u2192 t=4.\n\nWait, t is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined 4 months after B.\n\nBut wait, the options are given as A)2, B)4, etc. So, the correct option would be B)4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nSo, t=4 months. So, C joined 4 months after B. B joined at month 2, so C joined at 2 +4=6 months from the start. Then, the time C was in the business is 12 -6=6 months.\n\nSo, let's check the ratios.\n\nA: 40,000 *12 =480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nSum is 480,000 +600,000=1,080,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nTotal profit is 375,000. So each unit is 375000 /1,800,000 = 0.216666... per 1.\n\nC's share is 720,000 * 0.216666... = 720,000 * (375000 /1,800,000).\n\nWait, 375,000 /1,800,000 = 0.208333... Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, actually, each person's share is (their investment * time) multiplied by (total profit / total investment units).\n\nSo, C's share = 720,000 * (375000 /1,800,000).\n\nCompute 375000 /1,800,000 = 0.208333... So,\n\n720,000 * 0.208333 = 720,000 * (5/24) = 720,000 *5=3,600,000; divided by 24: 3,600,000 /24= 150,000. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems right. So, C joined 4 months after B. So, the answer is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit share based on the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. The profit is divided in the ratio of each partner's \"investment multiplied by time.\"\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's investment**: Rs.40,000 for 12 months.\n2. **B's investment**: Rs.60,000 for 10 months (since B joined after 2 months).\n3. **C's investment**: Rs.120,000 for \\(10 - t\\) months, where \\(t\\) is the time after B joined.\n4. Total profit: Rs.375,000, with C's share being Rs.150,000.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the \"investment-time\" for each partner\n- **A's investment-time**: \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\).\n- **B's investment-time**: \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\).\n- **C's investment-time**: \\(120,000 \\times (10 - t)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Total investment-time\nThe total investment-time is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000t = 2,280,000 - 120,000t.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: C's share of the profit\nC's share is given as Rs.150,000. The fraction of the total profit that C receives is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{C's investment-time}}{\\text{Total investment-time}} = \\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{2,280,000 - 120,000t}.\n\\]\nThis fraction equals \\(0.4\\) (since \\(150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(t\\)\nSet up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - t)}{2,280,000 - 120,000t} = 0.4.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - t) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000t).\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000t = 912,000 - 48,000t.\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000t - 48,000t.\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000t.\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 4.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nC joined the business 4 months after B.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this business partnership problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.\n\nSo, A starts a business with Rs.40,000. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. After some more time, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find out how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nHmm. I remember that in partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the time each person's investment was in the business and the capital they contributed. So each partner's share is proportional to their investment multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me visualize the timeline. The business runs for a year, which is 12 months. \n\nA started first. So A's investment is for the entire 12 months. But wait, when did B and C join?\n\nB joined after 2 months. So B's investment is for (12 - 2) = 10 months. Let me note that down.\n\nC joined after some more time after B. Let's say C joined x months after B. So the time C was in the business is (12 - 2 - x) months. Because the total time is 12 months. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total duration is 12 months. A starts at month 0. B joins at month 2. C joins at month 2 + x, where x is the number of months after B joined. So the time each has invested:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 12 - 2 = 10 months (since B joined after 2 months)\n- C: 12 - (2 + x) months, because C joined at month (2 + x), so from then till the end is (12 - (2 +x)) months.\n\nWait, but x is the time after B joined. So C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months? Wait, that can't be right because if x is the time after B, then C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x. Hmm, but if x is in months, and the total time can't be negative. So for example, if x is 5, then C's time is 5 months.\n\nWait, but let me think in terms of the total time each person was in the business:\n\n- A: 12 months\n- B: 10 months (since started at 2nd month)\n- C: (12 - (2 + x)) months. Because C starts at 2 + x months, so the time until the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if x is zero, C starts at 2 months, and is in for 10 months. But if x is 8, then C starts at 10 months, and is in for 2 months. But the question is, how many months after B joined did C join? So x is that time.\n\nWait, but the profit is divided based on their capital multiplied by their time. So the ratio of their shares would be (A's capital * A's time) : (B's capital * B's time) : (C's capital * C's time). \n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 or 0.4, which is 40%. \n\nSo let me compute the ratios. Let me denote:\n\nA's investment * time: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB's investment * time: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\nC's investment * time: 120,000 * (10 - x) = 120,000*(10 -x)\n\nWait, but C's time is (12 - (2 +x)) = 10 -x months. So yes.\n\nThe total ratio would be 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but the profit is divided in the ratio of these three amounts. So C's share is (120,000*(10 -x)) / (total) = 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5.\n\nSo setting up the equation:\n\n(120,000 * (10 -x)) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)) ) = 1/2.5\n\nWait, let me compute 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. Then plus 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n120,000*(10 - x) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) = 1/2.5\n\nWait, 1/2.5 is 0.4. So,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) ) = 0.4\n\nLet me cross-multiply:\n\n120,000*(10 - x) = 0.4 * (2,280,000 - 120,000x )\n\nCompute the right side:\n\n0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000\n\n0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x\n\nSo right side is 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLeft side: 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 -120,000x\n\nSo equation:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 -120,000x +48,000x =0\n\n288,000 -72,000x=0\n\nSo,\n\n288,000 =72,000x\n\nx=288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4 months.\n\nWait, x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined 4 months after B. So the answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using the concept of man-months or investment-time.\n\nThe profit ratio is based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo,\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB:60,000 * (12 - 2) =60,000 *10=600,000\nC:120,000 * (12 -2 -x) =120,000*(10 -x)\n\nWait, no, C's time is (12 - (2 +x)) =10 -x.\n\nSo the profit ratio is 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(10 -x).\n\nThe total is 480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nC's share is 150,000, which is (120,000*(10 -x)) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) * 375,000 =150,000.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x) ) *375,000 / (2,280,000 -120,000x ) =150,000.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more accurate way.\n\nWait, 375,000 is the total profit. So C's share is (C's investment-time) / (total) * total profit.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x) ) / (480,000 +600,000 +120,000*(10 -x)) ) *375,000 =150,000.\n\nWhich is the same as I did earlier.\n\nSo, when I solved it, I found x=4. So C joined 4 months after B. So the answer is option B)4 months.\n",

Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using the concept of man-months or investment-time.\n\nThe profit ratio is based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo,\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\nB:60,000 * (12 - 2) =60,000 *10=600,000\nC:120,000 * (12 -2 -x) =120,000*(10 -x)\n\nWait, no, C's time is (12 - (2 +x)) =10 -x.\n\nSo the profit ratio is 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000*(10 -x).\n\nThe total is 480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(10 -x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nC's share is 150,000, which is (120,000*(10 -x)) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) ) * 375,000 =150,000.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x) ) *375,000 / (2,280,000 -120,000x ) =150,000.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more accurate way.\n\nWait, 375,000 is the total profit. So C's share is (C's investment-time) / (total) * total profit.\n\nSo,\n\n(120,000*(10 -x) ) / (480,000 +600,000 +120,000*(10 -x)) ) *375,000 =150,000.\n\nWhich is the same as I did earlier.\n\nSo, when I solved it, I found x=4. So C joined 4 months after B. So the answer is option B)4 months.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the business partnership based on the capital contributed and the time each partner was involved. The profit is distributed proportionally to the product of capital and time for each partner.\n\n### Key Information:\n1. **A's Investment**: Rs. 40,000 for 12 months.\n2. **B's Investment**: Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (since B joined after 2 months).\n3. **C's Investment**: Rs. 120,000 for \\(10 - x\\) months, where \\(x\\) is the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n4. **Total Profit**: Rs. 375,000.\n5. **C's Share**: Rs. 150,000.\n\n### Profit Distribution:\nThe profit is divided based on the ratio of each partner's \"capital \u00d7 time.\" Let the total \"capital \u00d7 time\" be:\n- For A: \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\).\n- For B: \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\).\n- For C: \\(120,000 \\times (10 - x)\\).\n\nThe total \"capital \u00d7 time\" is:\n\\[\n480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\\]\n\nC's share of the profit is proportional to their \"capital \u00d7 time,\" so:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (10 - x)}{2,280,000 - 120,000x} = \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4.\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 0.4 \\times (2,280,000 - 120,000x).\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 120,000x = 912,000 - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\\[\n1,200,000 - 912,000 = 120,000x - 48,000x.\n\\]\n\\[\n288,000 = 72,000x.\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{288,000}{72,000} = 4.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nC joined the business 4 months after B joined.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about A, B, and C starting a business together, and I need to figure out after how many months C joined after B. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says A starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins some time after B, with Rs.120,000. The total profit after a year is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find how many months after B joined did C come in.\n\nHmm, so the key here is understanding how profit is divided in a partnership. I remember that profit is usually divided based on the capital invested and the time each person has been in the business. So, the formula is Profit Share = (Capital \u00d7 Time) / Total Capital \u00d7 Time.\n\nWait, right. So each partner's share depends on both how much they invested and how long their investment was in the business.\n\nLet me list out the details:\n\n- A invested 40,000 Rs. Let's see, the time he was there is the entire year, which is 12 months.\n\n- B joined after 2 months, so his investment time is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- C joined some time after B. Let me denote the time after B joined as 'x' months. So the total time C was in the business is x months.\n\nWait, but wait, the total time from the start is 2 + x months? Because B joined after 2 months, so from the start, C joined at 2 + x months. So C's time in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) months? No, wait, no. Wait, the total business duration is 12 months. So if C joined after B, and B joined at 2 months, then the time C's investment was there is (12 - (2 + x)) months? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the timeline.\n\n- Time 0: A starts with 40,000.\n\n- Time 2 months: B joins with 60,000. So B is there for 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n\n- Time (2 + x) months: C joins with 120,000. So C's investment is for (12 - (2 + x)) months? Or wait, if the business runs for 12 months, and C joins after x months from when B joined, then the time C is in the business is (12 - 2 - x) = (10 - x) months? Wait, that can't be right because x could be more than 10, which would make time negative. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months, but that would only be correct if C joined before the end of the year. Wait, but the problem states that C joined after some more time, so x is the time after B joined, so C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) months. So for example, if x is 2, C joined 2 months after B, so 2 + 2 = 4 months from start, and C was there for 12 -4 = 8 months.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should model each person's investment-time product.\n\nSo, A's investment is 40,000 for 12 months. B's is 60,000 for (12 - 2) =10 months. C's is 120,000 for (12 - (2 + x)) months. Wait, no, because if C joined after x months from when B joined, then the time from when the business started is 2 + x months, so C's time is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x months. But that would make sense only if x is less than 10, because otherwise, C's time would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps x can't be more than 10 months.\n\nBut wait, the options given include 2,4,23,24,84 months. Hmm, wait, 23 or 24 months would make C's time negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variables. Maybe x is the time after B joined, but the total time is 12 months, so C can't join more than 10 months after B. Otherwise, C's investment time would be zero or negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me denote t as the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined t months after B. Since B joined at 2 months, C joined at (2 + t) months. The business runs for 12 months, so C's investment period is (12 - (2 + t)) = (10 - t) months. Wait, but if t is, say, 5, then C is in for 5 months. If t is 8, then C is in for 2 months. If t is 10, then C is in for zero months, which can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model their investment periods as:\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC: (12 - (2 + t)) months, where t is the time after B joined.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem states that C joined after some more time after B joined. So the time between when B joined and C joined is t months. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. Hmm, but that would only be possible if t is less than or equal to 10 months. But in the options, the possible t's are 2,4,23,24,84. So for t=23, C would have been in the business for 10 -23 = -13 months, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm getting the model wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think that the time each person is in the business is:\n\nA is in for 12 months.\n\nB is in for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC is in for (12 - (2 + t)) = (10 - t) months. But if t is the number of months after B joined that C joined, then if t is 4, for example, C joined 4 months after B, so 2+4=6 months after start, and thus is in for 12 -6=6 months.\n\nWait, but then when C's time is (10 - t) months, that would be 10 -4 =6 months, which aligns with 6 months. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So the ratio of the profits is C's share to the total. So C's ratio is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, or 0.4.\n\nWait, but let's think about the profit sharing. Each partner's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). So the ratio of their shares is (A's capital \u00d7 A's time) : (B's capital \u00d7 B's time) : (C's capital \u00d7 C's time).\n\nSo let me compute each:\n\nA's share = 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's share =60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC's share=120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nThe total of all shares is 480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000*(10 -t).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 120,000 multiplied by (10 - t) is 1,200,000*(10 -t) is not correct. Wait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) would be 1,200,000*(10 -t) only if 120,000 is 1.2 million, but 120,000 is 0.12 million. So perhaps it's better to keep all in thousands. Let me redo the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratios without worrying about the actual total.\n\nThe profit is divided as per the ratio of (A's investment \u00d7 time) : (B's \u00d7 theirs) : (C's \u00d7 theirs).\n\nSo:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000*(10 - t) = 1,200,000*(10-t) [Wait, no, 120,000 is 120 thousand, so 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) is 120*(10 -t) thousand, which is 1200*(10 -t) thousand? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of thousands.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of units:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10 =600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 - t).\n\nTotal is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. Wait, but wait, the profit is 375,000, but the sum of the shares would be the total profit. So I think I made a mistake earlier. No, wait, no: the total profit is 375,000, and each partner's share is a portion of this. So the sum of all their shares equals 375,000.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the profit is divided among them based on their investment ratios. So the total of their shares would be the total profit. So, 480,000 (A's) + 600,000 (B's) + 120,000*(10-t) (C's) = 375,000.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480,000 is already larger than 375,000. So I must have messed up the model. Oh, wait, no, I'm confusing the units. Because the 480,000 is in terms of (capital \u00d7 time), not in the actual profit. So the actual profit is 375,000, and each partner's share is (their (capital \u00d7 time) / total (capital \u00d7 time)) multiplied by the profit.\n\nSo, the total (capital \u00d7 time) is 480,000 +600,000 +120,000*(10-t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nSo the total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So 480,000 +600,000 is 1,080,000. So adding that to 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000, minus 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So the total is 1,080,000 (from A and B) plus 1,200,000 -120,000 t. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000, minus 120,000 t.\n\nSo total is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nThe profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 /375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of C's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the profit is divided based on the (capital \u00d7 time) ratios. So, the profit is divided into parts proportional to each partner's (capital \u00d7 time). So, the ratio of C's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total (capital \u00d7 time) is equal to C's share of the profit over the total profit.\n\nSo, (120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000: that's 1/2.5 = 2/5.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 -t)) / (2,280,000 -120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: 5 * 120,000 * (10 - t) = 600,000 (10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 -240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 600,000 t -240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nSo t = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n",

The total profit after a year is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000.

Hmm, perhaps I should model it as C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months, but that would only be correct if C joined before the end of the year. Wait, but the problem states that C joined after some more time, so x is the time after B joined, so C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) months. So for example, if x is 2, C joined 2 months after B, so 2 + 2 = 4 months from start, and C was there for 12 -4 = 8 months.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should model each person's investment-time product.\n\nSo, A's investment is 40,000 for 12 months. B's is 60,000 for (12 - 2) =10 months. C's is 120,000 for (12 - (2 + x)) months. Wait, no, because if C joined after x months from when B joined, then the time from when the business started is 2 + x months, so C's time is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x months. But that would make sense only if x is less than 10, because otherwise, C's time would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps x can't be more than 10 months.\n\nBut wait, the options given include 2,4,23,24,84 months. Hmm, wait, 23 or 24 months would make C's time negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variables. Maybe x is the time after B joined, but the total time is 12 months, so C can't join more than 10 months after B. Otherwise, C's investment time would be zero or negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the options are wrong, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me denote t as the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, C joined t months after B. Since B joined at 2 months, C joined at (2 + t) months. The business runs for 12 months, so C's investment period is (12 - (2 + t)) = (10 - t) months. Wait, but if t is, say, 5, then C is in for 5 months. If t is 8, then C is in for 2 months. If t is 10, then C is in for zero months, which can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model their investment periods as:\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC: (12 - (2 + t)) months, where t is the time after B joined.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem states that C joined after some more time after B joined. So the time between when B joined and C joined is t months. So the time C is in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. Hmm, but that would only be possible if t is less than or equal to 10 months. But in the options, the possible t's are 2,4,23,24,84. So for t=23, C would have been in the business for 10 -23 = -13 months, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm getting the model wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think that the time each person is in the business is:\n\nA is in for 12 months.\n\nB is in for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC is in for (12 - (2 + t)) = (10 - t) months. But if t is the number of months after B joined that C joined, then if t is 4, for example, C joined 4 months after B, so 2+4=6 months after start, and thus is in for 12 -6=6 months.\n\nWait, but then when C's time is (10 - t) months, that would be 10 -4 =6 months, which aligns with 6 months. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C gets 150,000. So the ratio of the profits is C's share to the total. So C's ratio is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5, or 0.4.\n\nWait, but let's think about the profit sharing. Each partner's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). So the ratio of their shares is (A's capital \u00d7 A's time) : (B's capital \u00d7 B's time) : (C's capital \u00d7 C's time).\n\nSo let me compute each:\n\nA's share = 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's share =60,000 \u00d710=600,000.\n\nC's share=120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nThe total of all shares is 480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000*(10 -t).\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 120,000 multiplied by (10 - t) is 1,200,000*(10 -t) is not correct. Wait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) would be 1,200,000*(10 -t) only if 120,000 is 1.2 million, but 120,000 is 0.12 million. So perhaps it's better to keep all in thousands. Let me redo the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratios without worrying about the actual total.\n\nThe profit is divided as per the ratio of (A's investment \u00d7 time) : (B's \u00d7 theirs) : (C's \u00d7 theirs).\n\nSo:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000*(10 - t) = 1,200,000*(10-t) [Wait, no, 120,000 is 120 thousand, so 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) is 120*(10 -t) thousand, which is 1200*(10 -t) thousand? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of thousands.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of units:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10 =600,000.\n\nC:120,000 * (10 - t) = 120,000*(10 - t).\n\nTotal is 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(10 - t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. Wait, but wait, the profit is 375,000, but the sum of the shares would be the total profit. So I think I made a mistake earlier. No, wait, no: the total profit is 375,000, and each partner's share is a portion of this. So the sum of all their shares equals 375,000.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the profit is divided among them based on their investment ratios. So the total of their shares would be the total profit. So, 480,000 (A's) + 600,000 (B's) + 120,000*(10-t) (C's) = 375,000.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 480,000 is already larger than 375,000. So I must have messed up the model. Oh, wait, no, I'm confusing the units. Because the 480,000 is in terms of (capital \u00d7 time), not in the actual profit. So the actual profit is 375,000, and each partner's share is (their (capital \u00d7 time) / total (capital \u00d7 time)) multiplied by the profit.\n\nSo, the total (capital \u00d7 time) is 480,000 +600,000 +120,000*(10-t) = 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -t).\n\nSo the total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000 t = 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 -t) is 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So 480,000 +600,000 is 1,080,000. So adding that to 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000, minus 120,000 t.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait, 120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t) = 1,200,000 - 120,000 t. So the total is 1,080,000 (from A and B) plus 1,200,000 -120,000 t. So total is 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,280,000, minus 120,000 t.\n\nSo total is 2,280,000 - 120,000 t.\n\nThe profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 /375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of C's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the profit is divided based on the (capital \u00d7 time) ratios. So, the profit is divided into parts proportional to each partner's (capital \u00d7 time). So, the ratio of C's (capital \u00d7 time) to the total (capital \u00d7 time) is equal to C's share of the profit over the total profit.\n\nSo, (120,000 \u00d7 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nSimplify 150,000 / 375,000: that's 1/2.5 = 2/5.\n\nSo, (120,000*(10 -t)) / (2,280,000 -120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(120,000 (10 - t)) / (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) ) = 2/5.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n5 * 120,000 (10 - t) = 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t).\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: 5 * 120,000 * (10 - t) = 600,000 (10 - t) = 6,000,000 - 600,000 t.\n\nRight side: 2 * (2,280,000 - 120,000 t) = 4,560,000 - 240,000 t.\n\nSo:\n\n6,000,000 - 600,000 t = 4,560,000 -240,000 t.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 600,000 t -240,000 t.\n\n1,440,000 = 360,000 t.\n\nSo t = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4.\n\nSo t is 4 months. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\n\nTo determine how many months after B joined the business that C joined, we analyze the profit-sharing ratio based on the capital invested and the time each partner was in the business.\n\n### Key Details:\n1. **A's Investment**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 40,000  \n   - Time: 12 months (entire duration of the business).  \n   - Contribution: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\).\n\n2. **B's Investment**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 60,000  \n   - Joined after 2 months, so time in business: \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months.  \n   - Contribution: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\).\n\n3. **C's Investment**:  \n   - Capital: Rs. 120,000  \n   - Joined \\( t \\) months after B, so time in business: \\( 10 - t \\) months.  \n   - Contribution: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - t) \\).\n\n4. **Profit Distribution**:  \n   - Total profit: Rs. 375,000.  \n   - C's share: Rs. 150,000.  \n   - Profit-sharing ratio is proportional to the product of capital and time.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the problem is about three people, A, B, and C, who are starting a business together, but they invest different amounts at different times. We need to find out after how many months C joined the business after B. The answer choices are given, so I'll need to figure out the correct one.\n\nLet me break down the information step by step.\n\nA starts the business with Rs.40,000. That's straightforward. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. So, B's investment comes in 2 months after A started. Now, C joins them after some more time with Rs.120,000. So the timeline is: A starts, then 2 months later B joins, and then some time after that, C joins.\n\nAt the end of the year (so 12 months from when A started), the total profit is Rs.375,000. Out of this, C gets Rs.150,000. We're told that C's share is 150k, so I need to find out when C joined.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the share of profits? I remember that in such partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. So each partner's contribution is their capital multiplied by the time they've been in the business. The ratio of these products determines their share of the profit.\n\nSo let's denote the time each person's money was in the business.\n\nA started first, so he was there for the entire year, which is 12 months. So A's investment is 40,000 * 12.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so he was there for (12 - 2) = 10 months. So B's investment is 60,000 * 10.\n\nC joined after some months from when B joined. Let's say C joined x months after B. So the total time C was in the business is (12 - 2 - x) months. Wait, let me think again. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nIf the total time is 12 months from when A started, and B joined after 2 months, then the time left after B joined is 10 months. But if C joined after y months from when A started, then the time C was in is (12 - y) months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much time each person's investment was in the business.\n\nLet me structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at month 0, invests 40,000 for 12 months.\n- B joins at month 2, invests 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So C's investment time is (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after some more time\" after B joined. So perhaps x is the time after B's joining. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.\" Hmm, perhaps I need to model the time C was in as (12 - t), where t is the month when C joined. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to assign variables based on when each person joined.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- A's investment time: 12 months (since he started at month 0).\n- B's investment time: 10 months (since he joined at month 2, so from month 2 to month 12 is 10 months).\n- C's investment time: Let's say C joined after 'm' months from when A started. So C's time is (12 - m) months.\n\nBut the question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. So B joined at 2 months, so if C joined at 'm' months from A's start, then the time after B's joining is (m - 2) months.\n\nSo the problem is to find (m - 2), which is the number of months after B joined that C came in.\n\nBut how do I find 'm'?\n\nI know that the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo each partner's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). So the profit is divided in the ratio of (A's product : B's product : C's product).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so 40% of the profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the ratio of their investments' time multiplied by their capital.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m)\n\nSo the total investment ratio is (40,000*12) : (60,000*10) : (120,000*(12 - m)).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to calculate each person's share as a fraction of the total.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, and each person's share is proportional to their (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo the ratio of their shares is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (12 - m)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 *10=600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m) = 1,440,000 - 120,000 m\n\nSo the sum of all three parts is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nWait, no, that's the sum, but each person's share is their individual product. The total profit is 375,000, which is the sum of all shares. So the total of A's share + B's share + C's share = 375,000.\n\nWait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. No, no. Profit is divided based on their contributions, so the sum of all their shares is the total profit. So:\n\nA's share: (40,000 * 12) \u00d7 (total profit / total sum of all products)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the ratio.\n\nThe ratio is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,440,000 - 120,000 m).\n\nThe total of this ratio is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. So each part of the ratio is multiplied by a factor to reach 375,000.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the parts (A + B + C) should equal 375,000. Or no, wait: the ratio represents the proportions. So each part is proportional to their contribution, and the sum is the total profit.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions. So if the ratio is A:B:C = a : b : c, then the total profit is a + b + c. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because each a, b, c is their individual share, so the sum of a, b, c would be the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because for example, if a=1, b=2, c=3, the sum is 6, and each share would be (1/6)*total, (2/6)*total, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nA's share = (40,000 *12) / (Total contribution) \u00d7 375,000\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute each person's contribution, sum them up to get the total contribution, then compute the share based on that.\n\nSo, let's compute each person's contribution:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m) = 1,440,000 - 120,000 m\n\nTotal contribution = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. So each person's share is their contribution divided by the total contribution, multiplied by the total profit.\n\nSo C's share is [ (120,000*(12 - m)) / (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) ] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nWe can set up this equation and solve for m.\n\nSo:\n\n[ (120,000*(12 - m)) / (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) ] * 375,000 = 150,000\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(120000*(12 - m) * 375000) / (2520000 - 120000 m) ) = 150000\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nFirst, cross-multiplying:\n\n120000*(12 - m)*375000 = 150000*(2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute the left and right sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000 * 375000 * (12 - m)\nRight side: 150000 * (2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nCompute 120000 * 375000 = ?\n\n120000 * 375000 = 120,000 * 375,000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nSimilarly, 150000 * 2520000 = 150,000 * 2,520,000 = 378,000,000,000.\n\n150000 * 120000 m = 18,000,000,000 m.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n45,000,000,000 * (12 - m) = 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n45,000,000,000 * 12 = 540,000,000,000\n\n45,000,000,000 * (-m) = -45,000,000,000 m\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n540,000,000,000 - 45,000,000,000 m = 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n540e9 -45e9 m -378e9 +18e9 m =0\n\n(540e9 -378e9) + (-45e9 m +18e9 m )=0\n\n162e9 -27e9 m =0\n\nFactor out 27e9:\n\n27e9 (6 - m) =0\n\nSince 27e9 is not zero,\n\n6 - m =0 \u2192 m=6.\n\nSo m is 6. That means C joined 6 months after A started.\n\nWait, but wait, B joined after 2 months. So C joined at m=6, which is 6 months from A's start. So the time after B joined is 6 - 2 =4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the large numbers.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEquation:\n\n(120000*(12 - m) * 375000) = 150000*(2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000 * (12 - m) * 375000.\n\n120000 * 375000 = 120000 * 375000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nSo left side is 45e9 * (12 -m).\n\nRight side: 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) \n\n= 150,000 * 2,520,000 - 150,000 * 120,000 m\n\n= 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n45e9 (12 - m) = 378e9 - 18e9 m\n\nDivide both sides by 9e9 to simplify.\n\n(45e9 /9e9) (12 -m) = (378e9 /9e9) - (18e9 /9e9) m\n\n\u2192 5 (12 -m) =42 -2 m\n\nMultiply out left side:\n\n60 -5m =42 -2m\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n60 -5m -42 +2m=0 \u2192 18 -3m=0 \u21923m=18 \u2192 m=6.\n\nYes, correct. So m=6. So C joined at month 6 from A's start.\n\nSince B joined at month 2, the time after B is 6-2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, option B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the problem is about three people, A, B, and C, who are starting a business together, but they invest different amounts at different times. We need to find out after how many months C joined the business after B. The answer choices are given, so I'll need to figure out the correct one.\n\nLet me break down the information step by step.\n\nA starts the business with Rs.40,000. That's straightforward. Then, after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. So, B's investment comes in 2 months after A started. Now, C joins them after some more time with Rs.120,000. So the timeline is: A starts, then 2 months later B joins, and then some time after that, C joins.\n\nAt the end of the year (so 12 months from when A started), the total profit is Rs.375,000. Out of this, C gets Rs.150,000. We're told that C's share is 150k, so I need to find out when C joined.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the share of profits? I remember that in such partnership problems, the profit is divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it was invested. So each partner's contribution is their capital multiplied by the time they've been in the business. The ratio of these products determines their share of the profit.\n\nSo let's denote the time each person's money was in the business.\n\nA started first, so he was there for the entire year, which is 12 months. So A's investment is 40,000 * 12.\n\nB joined after 2 months, so he was there for (12 - 2) = 10 months. So B's investment is 60,000 * 10.\n\nC joined after some months from when B joined. Let's say C joined x months after B. So the total time C was in the business is (12 - 2 - x) months. Wait, let me think again. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nIf the total time is 12 months from when A started, and B joined after 2 months, then the time left after B joined is 10 months. But if C joined after y months from when A started, then the time C was in is (12 - y) months.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how much time each person's investment was in the business.\n\nLet me structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at month 0, invests 40,000 for 12 months.\n- B joins at month 2, invests 60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n- C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So C's investment time is (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after some more time\" after B joined. So perhaps x is the time after B's joining. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.\" Hmm, perhaps I need to model the time C was in as (12 - t), where t is the month when C joined. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to assign variables based on when each person joined.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- A's investment time: 12 months (since he started at month 0).\n- B's investment time: 10 months (since he joined at month 2, so from month 2 to month 12 is 10 months).\n- C's investment time: Let's say C joined after 'm' months from when A started. So C's time is (12 - m) months.\n\nBut the question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. So B joined at 2 months, so if C joined at 'm' months from A's start, then the time after B's joining is (m - 2) months.\n\nSo the problem is to find (m - 2), which is the number of months after B joined that C came in.\n\nBut how do I find 'm'?\n\nI know that the profit is divided based on the product of capital and time.\n\nSo each partner's share is proportional to (capital \u00d7 time). So the profit is divided in the ratio of (A's product : B's product : C's product).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so 40% of the profit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to find the ratio of their investments' time multiplied by their capital.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 * 10\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m)\n\nSo the total investment ratio is (40,000*12) : (60,000*10) : (120,000*(12 - m)).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to calculate each person's share as a fraction of the total.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, and each person's share is proportional to their (capital \u00d7 time).\n\nSo the ratio of their shares is:\n\nA : B : C = (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * (12 - m)).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 *10=600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m) = 1,440,000 - 120,000 m\n\nSo the sum of all three parts is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nWait, no, that's the sum, but each person's share is their individual product. The total profit is 375,000, which is the sum of all shares. So the total of A's share + B's share + C's share = 375,000.\n\nWait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. No, no. Profit is divided based on their contributions, so the sum of all their shares is the total profit. So:\n\nA's share: (40,000 * 12) \u00d7 (total profit / total sum of all products)\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of the ratio.\n\nThe ratio is A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : (1,440,000 - 120,000 m).\n\nThe total of this ratio is 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nBut the total profit is 375,000. So each part of the ratio is multiplied by a factor to reach 375,000.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of the parts (A + B + C) should equal 375,000. Or no, wait: the ratio represents the proportions. So each part is proportional to their contribution, and the sum is the total profit.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The profit is divided in the ratio of their contributions. So if the ratio is A:B:C = a : b : c, then the total profit is a + b + c. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because each a, b, c is their individual share, so the sum of a, b, c would be the total profit.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because for example, if a=1, b=2, c=3, the sum is 6, and each share would be (1/6)*total, (2/6)*total, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nA's share = (40,000 *12) / (Total contribution) \u00d7 375,000\n\nSimilarly for B and C.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute each person's contribution, sum them up to get the total contribution, then compute the share based on that.\n\nSo, let's compute each person's contribution:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m) = 1,440,000 - 120,000 m\n\nTotal contribution = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,440,000 - 120,000 m) = 2,520,000 - 120,000 m.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000. So each person's share is their contribution divided by the total contribution, multiplied by the total profit.\n\nSo C's share is [ (120,000*(12 - m)) / (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) ] * 375,000 = 150,000.\n\nWe can set up this equation and solve for m.\n\nSo:\n\n[ (120,000*(12 - m)) / (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) ] * 375,000 = 150,000\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n(120000*(12 - m) * 375000) / (2520000 - 120000 m) ) = 150000\n\nSimplify this equation.\n\nFirst, cross-multiplying:\n\n120000*(12 - m)*375000 = 150000*(2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute the left and right sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000 * 375000 * (12 - m)\nRight side: 150000 * (2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nCompute 120000 * 375000 = ?\n\n120000 * 375000 = 120,000 * 375,000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nSimilarly, 150000 * 2520000 = 150,000 * 2,520,000 = 378,000,000,000.\n\n150000 * 120000 m = 18,000,000,000 m.\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n45,000,000,000 * (12 - m) = 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n45,000,000,000 * 12 = 540,000,000,000\n\n45,000,000,000 * (-m) = -45,000,000,000 m\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n540,000,000,000 - 45,000,000,000 m = 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side.\n\n540e9 -45e9 m -378e9 +18e9 m =0\n\n(540e9 -378e9) + (-45e9 m +18e9 m )=0\n\n162e9 -27e9 m =0\n\nFactor out 27e9:\n\n27e9 (6 - m) =0\n\nSince 27e9 is not zero,\n\n6 - m =0 \u2192 m=6.\n\nSo m is 6. That means C joined 6 months after A started.\n\nWait, but wait, B joined after 2 months. So C joined at m=6, which is 6 months from A's start. So the time after B joined is 6 - 2 =4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months. Looking at the options, option B is 4 months.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake with the large numbers.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEquation:\n\n(120000*(12 - m) * 375000) = 150000*(2520000 - 120000 m)\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 120000 * (12 - m) * 375000.\n\n120000 * 375000 = 120000 * 375000 = 45,000,000,000.\n\nSo left side is 45e9 * (12 -m).\n\nRight side: 150,000 * (2,520,000 - 120,000 m) \n\n= 150,000 * 2,520,000 - 150,000 * 120,000 m\n\n= 378,000,000,000 - 18,000,000,000 m.\n\nSo equation is:\n\n45e9 (12 - m) = 378e9 - 18e9 m\n\nDivide both sides by 9e9 to simplify.\n\n(45e9 /9e9) (12 -m) = (378e9 /9e9) - (18e9 /9e9) m\n\n\u2192 5 (12 -m) =42 -2 m\n\nMultiply out left side:\n\n60 -5m =42 -2m\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n60 -5m -42 +2m=0 \u2192 18 -3m=0 \u21923m=18 \u2192 m=6.\n\nYes, correct. So m=6. So C joined at month 6 from A's start.\n\nSince B joined at month 2, the time after B is 6-2=4 months.\n\nSo the answer is 4 months, option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the timeline and contributions of each partner:\n\n1. **Timeline and Contributions**:\n   - A starts the business with Rs. 40,000 and remains for the entire year (12 months).\n   - B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000 and remains for 10 months.\n   - C joins after some time with Rs. 120,000 and remains for \\(12 - m\\) months, where \\(m\\) is the month C joined from A's start.\n\n2. **Profit Sharing**:\n   Profit is distributed based on the product of capital and time invested.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this business problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nSo, the problem says that A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then, after some more time, C joins with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000. I need to find how many months after B joined did C join.\n\nWait, the question is about the time between when B joined and when C joined. So, first, I think I need to figure out each person's investment period and their share of the profit based on that.\n\nHmm, profit in a partnership is usually divided based on the product of the capital invested and the time for which it's invested. So each person's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me structure this. The total time is a year, which is 12 months.\n\nA starts first. He invests Rs.40,000. How long was he in the business? Well, since the business runs for a year, he was there for 12 months. But wait, B joined after 2 months, so A's investment period is the entire 12 months.\n\nB joins after 2 months, so he starts after 2 months. How long was B in the business? Let's say he was there for x months. So his investment period is (12 - 2) = 10 months? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total time is 12 months. If B joined after 2 months, then he was in the business for (12 - 2) = 10 months. So his time is 10 months.\n\nWait, but then C joins after some more time. Let me think. Let's denote the time when C joined as t months after B joined. So B joined at month 2, C joined at month 2 + t. So C's investment time is (12 - (2 + t)) months. Because the business ends after 12 months, so from when C joined until the end is 12 - (2 + t) months.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should model it differently. Let me represent the time each person was in the business.\n\nA: 12 months\nB: 10 months (since he joined after 2 months)\nC: (12 - (2 + t)) months, where t is the time between B joining and C joining.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose B joined after 2 months, and C joined t months after B. So the time when C joined is 2 + t months. So the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t months.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because if t is the time after B joined, then the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. Hmm. Wait, but if t is how many months after B joined, then C's investment period is (12 - (2 + t)) = 10 - t. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should model the time each person was in the business. Let me think about the timeline.\n\n- Month 0: A starts with 40,000.\n- Month 2: B joins with 60,000. So B is there for 10 months (from month 2 to 12).\n- Let's say C joins at month (2 + x), where x is the number of months after B joined. So C is in the business for (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months.\n\nWait, but the problem says C joined after some more time after B joined. So x is the time after B joined, so C's time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x.\n\nSo the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of their shares would be based on their capital multiplied by time.\n\nSo each person's share is proportional to (capital * time).\n\nSo, let's compute the ratios.\n\nA's investment: 40,000 for 12 months. So 40,000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's investment: 60,000 for 10 months. 60,000 *10 = 600,000.\n\nC's investment: 120,000 for (10 - x) months. 120,000 * (10 - x) = 1200000 - 120000x.\n\nThe total profit is divided in the ratio of their products. So the total ratio is A + B + C.\n\nLet me compute the sum:\n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + [1200000 - 120000x] = 480000 + 600000 = 1,080,000. Plus 1,200,000 is 2,280,000. Minus 120,000x: 2,280,000 -120,000x.\n\nWait, but that's the total ratio. So each person's share is (their product) divided by the total ratio multiplied by the total profit.\n\nWait, but the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo C's product over total product equals 0.4.\n\nSo [120,000*(10 -x)] / [2,280,000 -120,000x] = 0.4.\n\nLet me write that equation.\n\n120000*(10 -x) / (2280000 - 120000x) ) = 0.4.\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator: 120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x.\n\nDenominator: 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nSo equation: (1,200,000 -120,000x) / (2,280,000 -120,000x) )= 0.4.\n\nLet me cross multiply:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 0.4 * (2,280,000 -120,000x).\n\nCompute right side: 0.4 * 2,280,000 = 912,000. 0.4 * (-120,000x) = -48,000x.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x = 912,000 -48,000x.\n\nLet me bring all terms to left side:\n\n1,200,000 -120,000x -912,000 +48,000x = 0.\n\nCompute:\n\n1,200,000 -912,000 = 288,000.\n\n-120,000x +48,000x = -72,000x.\n\nSo equation: 288,000 -72,000x =0.\n\n288,000 =72,000x.\n\nx = 288,000 /72,000 =4.\n\nSo x is 4 months. Wait, but what does x represent? x is the time after B joined when C joined. So C joined 4 months after B.\n\nSo the time between B joining and C joining is 4 months. So the answer should be option B)4 months.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo x=4. Let me plug back into C's time.\n\nC was in the business for 10 -x =6 months.\n\nSo C's product is 120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nLet me compute the total product.\n\nA:40,000 *12=480,000.\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000.\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000.\n\nTotal =480,000 +600,000=1,080,000 +720,000=1,800,000.\n\nWait, wait. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating the denominator. Because when I sum A, B, and C:\n\nA: 480,000.\n\nB:600,000.\n\nC:120,000*(10 -x) =120,000*(6)=720,000.\n\nSo total is 480,000 +600,000 +720,000 = 1,800,000.\n\nThen, the ratio of C's share is 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4.\n\nSo 0.4 of 375,000 is 150,000. Which matches the given information.\n\nYes, that's correct. So x is 4 months. So the time after B joined is 4 months. So the correct answer is option B)4 months.\n",
