      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and take it step by step.\n\nThe problem says that you can buy one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Or, alternatively, you can buy two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. And the question is asking me to find out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. The options are A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900.\n\nHmm, alright, so I think this is a system of equations problem. I need to find the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar. Let's denote the cost of one soda as 's' cents and one energy bar as 'e' cents.\n\nSo from the first part of the problem, one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. That gives me the equation:\ns + 2e = 150.\n\nThe second part says two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents. So that's another equation:\n2s + 3e = 300.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here. Let me see.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n1) s + 2e = 150\n2) 2s + 3e = 300\n\nI can try to eliminate one variable. Maybe eliminate 's' first. To do that, I can multiply the first equation by 2. So:\n\n1) 2s + 4e = 300\n2) 2s + 3e = 300\n\nNow, subtract equation 2 from equation 1. So (2s +4e) minus (2s +3e) equals 300 minus 300.\n\nLet me compute that. 2s - 2s is 0. 4e -3e is e. 300-300 is 0. So e=0? Wait, that can't be right. If e=0, then the energy bars are free. That doesn't make sense in a real-world scenario, but maybe the math is correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Oh no, wait. The second equation after multiplying the first by 2 is 2s +4e=300. The second equation is 2s +3e=300. Subtracting the second equation from the first: (2s +4e) - (2s +3e) = 300-300.\n\nSo 2s-2s is 0. 4e-3e is e. 300-300 is 0. So e=0. That's what I got. So e=0. That means each energy bar is 0 cents. Hmm, that's odd.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe first option is one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, if e=0, then substituting back into equation 1: s + 2(0) =150. So s=150. So each soda is 150 cents. Let me check the second equation: 2s +3e =300. 2*150 + 3*0=300, which is correct. So the math is right.\n\nSo each soda is 150 cents, each energy bar is 0 cents. That's a bit strange, but maybe that's what the problem says.\n\nNow the question is to compute the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. So 6*s +7*e.\n\nSubstituting the values: 6*150 +7*0 = 900 + 0 =900 cents.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 900. So the answer would be E.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I do everything right? Because 0 cost for the bars seems odd, but mathematically, it fits.\n\nLet me think again. Let me try another approach to solve the equations to see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitution. From the first equation, s=150-2e.\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation: 2*(150-2e) +3e =300.\n\nCalculate that: 300 -4e +3e =300. 300 -e =300. So -e=0 \u2192 e=0. Same result as before.\n\nSo yes, e=0. So each energy bar is free, and each soda is 150 cents. So six sodas would be 6*150=900, and seven bars are 0. Total 900.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 900. So the answer should be E.\n",

We need to find out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. The options are A to E, with E being 900. \n\nAlright, so I think this is a system of equations problem. Let me assign variables. Let's say the cost of one soda is 's' cents and one energy bar is 'b' cents. \n\nSo, the first scenario gives me the equation: s + 2b = 150. Because one soda plus two bars cost 150 cents. \n\nThe second scenario is two sodas and three bars costing 300 cents, so that's 2s + 3b = 300. \n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I need to solve for s and b. Once I have those, I can compute 6s +7b. \n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1) s + 2b = 150  \n2) 2s + 3b = 300  \n\nHmm, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. I'll try elimination. Let's try to eliminate one variable. Let's see, if I multiply the first equation by 2, then I can subtract or add to eliminate 's' perhaps.\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 2 gives: 2s +4b = 300.\n\nWait, equation 2 is 2s +3b = 300. Oh, that's interesting. So now I have:\n\nEquation 1a: 2s +4b = 300  \nEquation 2: 2s +3b = 300  \n\nIf I subtract equation 2 from equation 1a, that should eliminate 2s. \n\nSo (2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 -300  \nWhich simplifies to: 0s + b = 0. So b=0?\n\nWait, that can't be right. If b is zero, then the energy bars are free. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, equation 1a is 2s +4b =300, equation 2 is 2s +3b =300. So subtracting equation 2 from equation 1a:\n\n(2s -2s) + (4b -3b) = 300-300  \nWhich is 0s + b =0. So b=0. \n\nHmm, but if b=0, then from equation 1, s + 2(0) =150, so s=150. So soda is 150 cents each, and energy bars are free. That's possible, but let me see if that makes sense with the second equation.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b =300. Substituting s=150 and b=0, we get 2*150 +3*0=300. Which is 300=300. So that works. \n\nWait, but energy bars being free? That seems odd, but mathematically, it fits. So if that's the case, let's proceed. \n\nSo each soda is 150 cents, each bar is 0 cents. Now, the question is about six sodas and seven bars. So 6*150 +7*0 = 900 +0 =900. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 900. So the answer would be E. \n\nBut wait, another thought: is there any possibility I made a mistake in setting up the equations? Let me double-check.\n\nThe first option: 1 soda + 2 bars = 150. Second option: 2 sodas +3 bars=300. \n\nWait, if I double the first equation, I get 2 sodas +4 bars=300. Which is the same as the second option's total cost of 300. So 2s+4b=300 and 2s+3b=300. Subtracting these gives b=0, as before. So calculations are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try substitution instead. Let's solve equation 1 for s.\n\nFrom equation 1: s = 150 -2b.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(150 -2b) +3b =300  \n300 -4b +3b =300  \n300 -b =300  \nSo, subtract 300: -b=0 \u2192 b=0.

Let me check my equations again.\n\nEquation 1: s + 2b = 150 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b = 300 \u2192 correct.\n\nWhen I multiplied equation 1 by 2, I got 2s +4b = 300 \u2192 correct.\n\nEquation 2 is 2s +3b = 300.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 -300 \u2192 (2s-2s) + (4b-3b) = 0 \u2192 0 + b = 0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nThat's impossible because then the first equation would be s =150, and the second equation would be 2s + 0 =300 \u2192 2s=300 \u2192 s=150. So if s=150 and b=0, then 2 sodas would cost 300, which fits equation 2. But energy bars are free? That seems odd, but maybe it's possible in this problem's context.\n\nWait, but let's check. If b is zero, then one soda is 150. So 6 sodas would be 6*150=900, and 7 bars would be 7*0=0. So the total would be 900. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 900. But let me think again because this seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nThe first option: 1 soda and 2 bars cost 150. The second: 2 sodas and 3 bars cost 300.\n\nWait, if I substitute b=0, then 2 sodas and 3 bars would cost 2s +0=300 \u2192 s=150. So yes, that works. But is there another way to interpret the problem? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, maybe I should try solving the system using substitution instead. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation 1: s = 150 - 2b.\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2:\n\n2*(150 -2b) +3b = 300.\n\nExpand that:\n\n300 -4b +3b =300.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300 -b =300.\n\nSubtract 300 from both sides:\n\n-b =0 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSo again, same result. So b is zero.\n\nHmm. So then, each energy bar is free, and each soda is 150 cents. So 6 sodas would be 6*150=900, and 7 bars would be 7*0=0. So total is 900 +0 =900.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 900. So that's the answer? But wait, that seems a bit strange because why would energy bars be free? But maybe in this problem, that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the first option is one soda and two energy bars for 150. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second equation.\n\nWait, 2 sodas and 3 bars: 2s +3b = 300. Yes.\n\nBut if I have s=150, then 2s is 300. So 2s +3b=300 \u2192 300 +3b=300 \u2192 3b=0 \u2192 b=0. So yes, same result.\n\nSo the answer would be 6s +7b = 6*150 +7*0=900.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 900. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, the options don't include 900 as the first choice. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900.\n\nSo E is 900. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but why would the problem set up the second option as 2sodas and 3bars for 300 when 2sodas alone would be 300. That's why the bars are free.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way I set up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nProblem says: purchase one soda and two bars for 150. So s +2b=150.\n\nPurchase two sodas and three bars for 300 \u2192 2s +3b=300.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I solve for s and b, I get b=0 and s=150.\n\nSo in that case, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6*150 +7*0=900.\n\nHmm. So the correct answer would be E)900.\n\nBut wait, the option D is 800, which is close. Did I make a calculation error?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the equations.\n\nEquation 1: s + 2b =150 \u2192 s =150-2b.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b=300.\n\nSubstitute s from equation1 into equation2:\n\n2*(150-2b) +3b =300 \u2192 300 -4b +3b =300 \u2192 300 -b=300 \u2192 -b=0 \u2192b=0.\n\nSo yes, correct.\n\nSo 6s +7b =6*(150) +7*0=900.\n\nSo the answer is E)900.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is not about purchasing combinations but about the cost per item. So maybe the first scenario is buying one soda and two bars for 150, but that could mean that 1 soda is 150 and two bars are 0. Or perhaps the total is 150 for the combination, which is what I've considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the problem is correct.

Let me denote the cost of a soda as 's' and an energy bar as 'e'. So the first equation would be:\n\ns + 2e = 150\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents.

The second equation is 2s +3e=300. So subtracting:\n\n(2s +4e) - (2s +3e) = 300 - 300\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n0s + e = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 4e -3e is e, and 300-300 is zero. So e=0? That doesn't make sense. If energy bars are free, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait, no, I think I messed up the subtraction. Let me try that again. The two equations after multiplying the first by 2 are:\n\nEquation A: 2s +4e = 300\nEquation B: 2s +3e = 300\n\nSo subtracting B from A gives:\n\n(2s -2s) + (4e -3e) = 300 -300\n\nWhich is 0s + e = 0 \u2192 e=0.

Which matches the given second option. So that works.\n\nBut that's a bit odd because why would energy bars be free? But according to the math, that's the solution.

Because sometimes when you set up equations, you might have made a mistake.\n\nAnother approach: Let me solve the two equations again.\n\nEquation 1: s + 2e =150\nEquation 2: 2s +3e=300\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for s: s=150-2e.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(150-2e) +3e=300\n\nExpanding: 300 -4e +3e=300 \u2192 300 -e=300 \u2192 -e=0 \u2192 e=0.\n\nSo yeah, same result. So s=150-0=150.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. So six sodas are 6*150=900, seven bars are 0, total 900. So E is the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we are given two equations based on the costs of sodas and energy bars:\n\n1. \\( s + 2e = 150 \\)  \n2. \\( 2s + 3e = 300 \\)\n\nHere, \\( s \\) represents the cost of one soda in cents, and \\( e \\) represents the cost of one energy bar in cents. We aim to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the system of equations\nFrom the first equation, solve for \\( s \\):  \n\\[\ns = 150 - 2e\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( s = 150 - 2e \\) into the second equation:  \n\\[\n2(150 - 2e) + 3e = 300\n\\]\n\nSimplify:  \n\\[\n300 - 4e + 3e = 300\n\\]\n\n\\[\n300 - e = 300\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-e = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad e = 0\n\\]\n\nNow substitute \\( e = 0 \\) back into the first equation:  \n\\[\ns + 2(0) = 150 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of one soda is \\( s = 150 \\) cents, and the cost of one energy bar is \\( e = 0 \\) cents.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars\nThe cost of six sodas is:  \n\\[\n6s = 6 \\times 150 = 900 \\, \\text{cents}\n\\]\n\nThe cost of seven energy bars is:  \n\\[\n7e = 7 \\times 0 = 0 \\, \\text{cents}\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:  \n\\[\n6s + 7e = 900 + 0 = 900 \\, \\text{cents}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is **900 cents**.  \n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me two different purchase options with different combinations and prices. My goal is to find out how much six sodas and seven bars would cost. \n\nAlright, let's break down what's given. The first option is buying one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. Let me write that down as an equation. Let's say the cost of one soda is S cents and one energy bar is E cents. So the first equation would be:\n\nS + 2E = 150.\n\nThe second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. That translates to:\n\n2S + 3E = 300.\n\nNow I have a system of two equations with two variables. I need to solve for S and E. Once I have their individual costs, I can compute the total for six sodas and seven bars, which would be 6S +7E.\n\nHmm, how to solve the system. Maybe using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let me see. \n\nFrom the first equation, I can express S in terms of E. So S = 150 - 2E. Then substitute this into the second equation.\n\nWait, substituting S into the second equation:\n\n2*(150 - 2E) + 3E = 300.\n\nLet me compute that. 2*150 is 300, and 2*(-2E) is -4E. So:\n\n300 -4E +3E = 300.\n\nCombine like terms: 300 - E = 300.\n\nSubtract 300 from both sides: -E = 0.\n\nSo E = 0. Wait, that can't be right. An energy bar costing zero cents? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.\n\nWait, let me check my substitution again. The second equation is 2S +3E = 300. Substituting S =150 -2E, so:\n\n2*(150 -2E) +3E = 300.\n\nExpanding that:\n\n300 -4E +3E = 300.\n\nWhich simplifies to 300 - E = 300.\n\nSubtract 300: -E =0. So E=0. Hmm, that's weird. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should multiply the first equation by 2 so that I can eliminate S. Let me see:\n\nFirst equation multiplied by 2: 2S +4E = 300.\n\nSecond equation is 2S +3E =300.\n\nNow subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 -300.\n\nWhich simplifies to 0S + E =0.\n\nSo E=0. Wait, same result. That can't be right. So energy bars are free? That's impossible. Maybe I messed up the problem setup.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. Oh! The first option is one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. The second is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So the equations are correct. So perhaps the answer is that each energy bar is free and each soda is 150 cents. Let me test that.\n\nIf E=0, then from the first equation S=150. So one soda is 150 cents.\n\nLet's plug into the second equation: 2*150 +3*0=300. Which works. So it checks out. But that seems odd, but maybe that's the case.\n\nSo, if E is 0, then each soda is 150 cents. Now, the question is to compute the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars.\n\nSo 6S +7E =6*150 +7*0=900 +0=900 cents. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 900. So that's an option.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because if each soda is 150, then two would be 300. So two sodas and three bars (which are free) would be 300, which matches the second equation. So it's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the costs of the items do not change.\" So perhaps this is correct. So the answer would be 6*150=900. So option E)900.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me check again. Maybe I should have considered that the second option is 300 cents for two sodas and three bars, which is double the first option. Let me see: the first option is 150 for 1 and 2. So doubling that would be 300 for 2 and 4. But the second option is 300 for 2 and 3. So the difference is that the second option gives one less bar. So that suggests that perhaps the bar is free.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are correct, but perhaps there's another way to approach this. Let me try another method.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second. The first equation is S + 2E=150. The second is 2S +3E=300.\n\nSubtract first from second: (2S +3E) - (S +2E) =300-150.\n\nWhich gives S + E =150.\n\nSo S + E =150. Hmm, but the first equation is S +2E=150.\n\nSo subtract these two: (S +2E) - (S + E) =150-150.\n\nWhich gives E=0. So again, E=0. So S=150.\n\nSo that's the same result. So yes, E is 0. So energy bars are free. So the cost for six sodas is 6 *150=900. So the answer is E)900.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I buy one soda and two bars for 150, and bars are free, that makes sense. Two sodas and three bars would be 2*150=300. So that works. So yes, the answer should be 900, option E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two different purchase options for sodas and energy bars, and we need to find out the total cost for six sodas and seven bars. Hmm, okay, I think I'll need to set up some equations based on the given information.\n\nThe first option says one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. Let me write that down as an equation. Let's say the cost of one soda is 's' cents and one energy bar is 'b' cents. So the first equation would be:\n\ns + 2b = 150. \n\nGot that. Now the second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So the second equation is:\n\n2s + 3b = 300.\n\nAlright, now I have a system of two equations with two variables. I think I can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination because the coefficients look manageable.\n\nHmm, if I multiply the first equation by 2, I'll have:\n\n2s + 4b = 300. \n\nWait, because 2*(s + 2b) = 2s +4b, which equals 2*150=300. Now, I can subtract the second equation from this new equation. The second equation is 2s +3b=300. So subtracting:\n\n(2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 - 300.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(2s-2s) + (4b-3b) = 0.\n\nSo that's 0s + b =0. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean b=0, which can't be possible because you can't have a free item. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait a minute, let me check. I multiplied the first equation by 2, which is correct. The first equation after multiplication is 2s +4b=300. The second equation is 2s+3b=300. So when I subtract, it's (2s+4b) - (2s+3b) = 300 -300.\n\nSo 2s-2s is 0, and 4b-3b is b. On the right side, 300-300 is 0. So I get b=0? That can't be possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. Oh! Oh no, wait. The first option is one soda and two bars for 150 cents. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300 cents. So the second option's cost is double the first? Because 150 *2 is 300, but the items are also doubled (1 to 2, 2 to 3). Hmm, but 2*(1 soda +2 bars) is 2 sodas and 4 bars, which would cost 300. But the second option is 2 and 3, so that's one less bar. So perhaps the way I set up the equations is correct, but the problem arises when I subtract.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation. Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. Wait, maybe I should subtract the equations differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use substitution. Let's solve the first equation for s. From the first equation:\n\ns = 150 - 2b.\n\nThen plug this into the second equation. So the second equation is 2s +3b=300. Substituting s:\n\n2*(150 -2b) +3b =300.\n\nCalculating that: 300 -4b +3b =300. So 300 -b=300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -b=0. So b=0. Again, same result. That can't be right. So where's the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Oh wait, the first option is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150 cents. The second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300. So perhaps the second option is not twice the first because it's 2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, let me subtract the two equations as they are. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1: s +2b =150.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b=300.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2s +4b=300.\n\nThen subtract equation 2 from this: (2s+4b) - (2s+3b) =300-300.\n\nWhich gives 0s +b=0. So b=0. But that's impossible because if bars are free, then the first option would be s + 0 =150 \u2192 s=150. Then in the second option, 2*150 +3*0=300, which is correct. But then the question is about 6 sodas and 7 bars. If bars are free, 6*150 +7*0=900. But that's option E. But that can't be right because the problem implies that the cost of items doesn't change, but getting a free bar seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again. The first purchase is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150. The second is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300. So perhaps the second option is not a multiple of the first, which complicates things. So perhaps I should solve the two equations correctly.\n\nWait, but according to the equations I set up, the solution is b=0. That can't be right because then the second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300, but if bars are free, then 2s=300 \u2192 s=150. Which is consistent with the first option. So s=150, b=0.\n\nBut that would make the cost of 6 sodas and 7 bars: 6*150 +7*0=900. But that's option E. But why would the problem give such an option? It seems too straightforward, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try a different approach. Let me think: If I have two equations:\n\n1) s + 2b =150.\n\n2) 2s +3b=300.\n\nI can solve for s and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: s=150 -2b.\n\nPlug into equation 2: 2*(150-2b) +3b =300.\n\nWhich is 300 -4b +3b =300 \u2192 300 -b=300 \u2192 -b=0 \u2192b=0.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So the bar is free, and a soda is 150 cents. So six sodas would be 6*150=900, and seven bars are 0, so total is 900. But that's option E, but the options given are A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900.\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents.\" So s + 2b =150.\n\n\"Two sodas and three energy bars for 300.\" So 2s +3b=300.\n\nSo I think my equations are correct. So according to that, the solution is b=0, s=150. So 6s +7b =6*150 +7*0=900. So E is the answer.\n\nBut why is the answer E? Because the bars are free? That seems a bit strange, but mathematically, that's the solution. Unless I've made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by using ratios or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the cost of one soda and one bar. Let me see.\n\nFrom the first option, s +2b=150.\n\nSecond option: 2s+3b=300.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two different purchase options for sodas and energy bars, and we need to find out the total cost for six sodas and seven bars. Hmm, okay, I think I'll need to set up some equations based on the given information.\n\nThe first option says one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. Let me write that down as an equation. Let's say the cost of one soda is 's' cents and one energy bar is 'b' cents. So the first equation would be:\n\ns + 2b = 150. \n\nGot that. Now the second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. So the second equation is:\n\n2s + 3b = 300.\n\nAlright, now I have a system of two equations with two variables. I think I can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination because the coefficients look manageable.\n\nHmm, if I multiply the first equation by 2, I'll have:\n\n2s + 4b = 300. \n\nWait, because 2*(s + 2b) = 2s +4b, which equals 2*150=300. Now, I can subtract the second equation from this new equation. The second equation is 2s +3b=300. So subtracting:\n\n(2s +4b) - (2s +3b) = 300 - 300.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(2s-2s) + (4b-3b) = 0.\n\nSo that's 0s + b =0. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean b=0, which can't be possible because you can't have a free item. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait a minute, let me check. I multiplied the first equation by 2, which is correct. The first equation after multiplication is 2s +4b=300. The second equation is 2s+3b=300. So when I subtract, it's (2s+4b) - (2s+3b) = 300 -300.\n\nSo 2s-2s is 0, and 4b-3b is b. On the right side, 300-300 is 0. So I get b=0? That can't be possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. Oh! Oh no, wait. The first option is one soda and two bars for 150 cents. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300 cents. So the second option's cost is double the first? Because 150 *2 is 300, but the items are also doubled (1 to 2, 2 to 3). Hmm, but 2*(1 soda +2 bars) is 2 sodas and 4 bars, which would cost 300. But the second option is 2 and 3, so that's one less bar. So perhaps the way I set up the equations is correct, but the problem arises when I subtract.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me subtract the first equation multiplied by 2 from the second equation. Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. Wait, maybe I should subtract the equations differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use substitution. Let's solve the first equation for s. From the first equation:\n\ns = 150 - 2b.\n\nThen plug this into the second equation. So the second equation is 2s +3b=300. Substituting s:\n\n2*(150 -2b) +3b =300.\n\nCalculating that: 300 -4b +3b =300. So 300 -b=300. Subtract 300 from both sides: -b=0. So b=0. Again, same result. That can't be right. So where's the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Oh wait, the first option is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150 cents. The second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300. So perhaps the second option is not twice the first because it's 2 and 3 instead of 1 and 2. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, let me subtract the two equations as they are. Let's see:\n\nEquation 1: s +2b =150.\n\nEquation 2: 2s +3b=300.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 2: 2s +4b=300.\n\nThen subtract equation 2 from this: (2s+4b) - (2s+3b) =300-300.\n\nWhich gives 0s +b=0. So b=0. But that's impossible because if bars are free, then the first option would be s + 0 =150 \u2192 s=150. Then in the second option, 2*150 +3*0=300, which is correct. But then the question is about 6 sodas and 7 bars. If bars are free, 6*150 +7*0=900. But that's option E. But that can't be right because the problem implies that the cost of items doesn't change, but getting a free bar seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again. The first purchase is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150. The second is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300. So perhaps the second option is not a multiple of the first, which complicates things. So perhaps I should solve the two equations correctly.\n\nWait, but according to the equations I set up, the solution is b=0. That can't be right because then the second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300, but if bars are free, then 2s=300 \u2192 s=150. Which is consistent with the first option. So s=150, b=0.\n\nBut that would make the cost of 6 sodas and 7 bars: 6*150 +7*0=900. But that's option E. But why would the problem give such an option? It seems too straightforward, but perhaps that's the case.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try a different approach. Let me think: If I have two equations:\n\n1) s + 2b =150.\n\n2) 2s +3b=300.\n\nI can solve for s and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: s=150 -2b.\n\nPlug into equation 2: 2*(150-2b) +3b =300.\n\nWhich is 300 -4b +3b =300 \u2192 300 -b=300 \u2192 -b=0 \u2192b=0.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So the bar is free, and a soda is 150 cents. So six sodas would be 6*150=900, and seven bars are 0, so total is 900. But that's option E, but the options given are A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900.\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents.\" So s + 2b =150.\n\n\"Two sodas and three energy bars for 300.\" So 2s +3b=300.\n\nSo I think my equations are correct. So according to that, the solution is b=0, s=150. So 6s +7b =6*150 +7*0=900. So E is the answer.\n\nBut why is the answer E? Because the bars are free? That seems a bit strange, but mathematically, that's the solution. Unless I've made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by using ratios or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me compute the cost of one soda and one bar. Let me see.\n\nFrom the first option, s +2b=150.\n\nSecond option: 2s+3b=300.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second. So:\n\n(2s +3b) - (s +2b) =300-150.\n\nWhich is s +b=150.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\ns +2b=150.\n\ns +b=150.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if s +b=150, then substituting into the first equation: 150 + b=150 \u2192 b=0.\n\nSo again, same conclusion.\n\nSo the only solution is b=0, s=150.\n\nThus, the cost for six sodas and seven bars is 6*150 +7*0=900. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. For one soda and two energy bars:  \n   \\[\n   s + 2b = 150\n   \\]  \n   where \\( s \\) is the cost of one soda in cents and \\( b \\) is the cost of one energy bar in cents.\n\n2.

The problem gives me two purchase options, right? \n\nThe first option is buying one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents. The second option is two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. Wait, but that seems a bit odd because the second option is double the first in terms of quantity but not in cost. Let me think: 150 cents for the first option, and 300 for the second. Oh, wait, actually, the second is exactly double the first's quantity. Because the first is 1 soda and 2 bars, so double that would be 2 sodas and 4 bars. But wait, the second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars, which is less. So that must mean that maybe the second option is giving a better deal, or perhaps the items have different individual prices.\n\nHmm, so maybe I should set up equations to solve for the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar. Let me assign variables. Let's say the cost of one soda is S cents and one energy bar is B cents.\n\nSo from the first option: 1 soda + 2 bars = 150 cents. So that gives me equation 1: S + 2B = 150.\n\nThe second option is 2 sodas + 3 bars = 300 cents. So equation 2: 2S + 3B = 300.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system of equations to find S and B.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1) S + 2B = 150  \n2) 2S + 3B = 300\n\nHmm, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination would be easier here. Let me try to eliminate one variable. If I multiply equation 1 by 2, then I can subtract equation 2 from it to eliminate S.\n\nMultiplying equation 1 by 2 gives: 2S + 4B = 300.\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from this new equation:\n\n(2S + 4B) - (2S + 3B) = 300 - 300  \nSo, 2S +4B -2S -3B = 0  \nWhich simplifies to B = 0. Wait, that can't be right. B can't be zero because then the first option would cost 150 cents, which would mean S is 150, but then the second option would be 2*150 + 0 = 300, which fits. Wait, but that would mean energy bars are free. Is that possible?\n\nWait, but if B is zero, then let's check. From equation 1: S + 0 =150 => S=150. Then equation 2: 2*150 + 3*0 = 300, which is correct. So yes, that's possible. So the energy bars are free. That's a bit strange, but mathematically it holds.\n\nSo then, each soda is 150 cents, and each bar is 0 cents.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the second option, you're getting two sodas (300) and three bars (0), totaling 300. So that's correct.\n\nNow the question is asking for six sodas and seven bars. So 6*S +7*B.\n\nSince B is 0, that's just 6*150 + 7*0 = 900 + 0 =900 cents.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 900. But that seems high. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me check the equations again. First equation: S + 2B =150. Second equation: 2S +3B =300.\n\nWait, if I multiply the first equation by 2, I get 2S +4B=300. The second equation is 2S +3B=300. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives (2S+4B)-(2S+3B)=300-300 \u2192 B=0. So that's correct. So energy bars are free.\n\nSo then, six sodas would be 6 *150 = 900. Seven bars would be 0. So total is 900. So the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, why would the problem give options that include 500,600, etc. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think if I interpreted the problem correctly.\n\nWait, the first option is 150 cents for 1 soda and 2 bars. Second option is 300 cents for 2 sodas and 3 bars. So perhaps the second option is not double the first, but it's just another option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try another method. Let's see the cost per item.\n\nIf I buy the first option, which is 1 soda and 2 bars for 150 cents. Let me compute the cost per soda and per bar if I assume that the second option is a multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps the second option is just another way to buy more items. So maybe I can find the individual prices by setting up the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: S +2B =150.\n\nEquation 2: 2S +3B=300.\n\nI can solve equation 1 for S: S=150-2B.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(150-2B) +3B =300.\n\nCalculate that: 300 -4B +3B =300 \u2192 300 -B =300 \u2192 -B=0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nSo again, B=0, S=150.\n\nHmm, so the same result. So the cost of six sodas is 6*150=900, and seven bars is 0. So total is 900, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the options have E as 900. So that must be the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the problem is asking for something else. Oh, the question is to find the cost of six sodas and seven bars. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine.\n\nAnother approach: Let's subtract the first equation from the second. Equation 2 minus equation 1:\n\n(2S +3B) - (S +2B) =300 -150 \u2192 S +B =150.\n\nSo S + B =150.\n\nBut from equation 1, S +2B=150.\n\nSubtracting these two equations: (S +2B) - (S + B) =150-150 \u2192 B=0.\n\nAgain, same result. So B is 0.\n\nHmm, that's correct. So the energy bars are free, and each soda is 150 cents.\n\nSo six sodas: 6*150=900. Seven bars: 0. Total is 900. So option E.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the problem allows for a different interpretation. For example, perhaps the options are not prices but the cost, and maybe I should find the unit prices.\n\nWait, another way: Let's think of the two equations again.\n\nEquation 1: S + 2B =150 \u2192 equation A.\n\nEquation 2: 2S +3B =300 \u2192 equation B.\n\nLet me subtract 2 times equation A from equation B.\n\nEquation B: 2S +3B =300.\n\n2*A: 2S +4B=300.\n\nSubtract 2*A from B: (2S+3B) - (2S+4B) =300-300 \u2192 -B=0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nSo yes, same conclusion.\n\nI think this is correct.

Equation 2 minus equation 1:\n\n(2S +3B) - (S +2B) =300 -150 \u2192 S +B =150.\n\nSo S + B =150.\n\nBut from equation 1, S +2B=150.\n\nSubtracting these two equations: (S +2B) - (S + B) =150-150 \u2192 B=0.\n\nAgain, same result. So B is 0.\n\nHmm, that's correct. So the energy bars are free, and each soda is 150 cents.\n\nSo six sodas: 6*150=900. Seven bars: 0. Total is 900. So option E.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the problem allows for a different interpretation. For example, perhaps the options are not prices but the cost, and maybe I should find the unit prices.\n\nWait, another way: Let's think of the two equations again.\n\nEquation 1: S + 2B =150 \u2192 equation A.\n\nEquation 2: 2S +3B =300 \u2192 equation B.\n\nLet me subtract 2 times equation A from equation B.\n\nEquation B: 2S +3B =300.\n\n2*A: 2S +4B=300.\n\nSubtract 2*A from B: (2S+3B) - (2S+4B) =300-300 \u2192 -B=0 \u2192 B=0.\n\nSo yes, same conclusion.\n\nI think this is correct. So the answer must be E)900.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars based on the given purchase options. Let the cost of one soda be \\( S \\) cents and one energy bar be \\( B \\) cents. The two equations provided are:\n\n1. \\( S + 2B = 150 \\) (from the first option: 1 soda and 2 bars for 150 cents)  \n2. \\( 2S + 3B = 300 \\) (from the second option: 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300 cents).\n\n### Step 1: Solve for \\( S \\) and \\( B \\)\nTo find the individual costs, we can use the method of elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n2S + 4B = 300\n\\]\n\nSubtract the second equation from this result:\n\n\\[\n(2S + 4B) - (2S + 3B) = 300 - 300\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nB = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( B = 0 \\) back into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nS + 2(0) = 150 \\implies S = 150\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of one soda is \\( S = 150 \\) cents, and the cost of one energy bar is \\( B = 0 \\) cents.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars\nThe total cost for six sodas and seven energy bars is:\n\n\\[\n6S + 7B = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900 \\, \\text{cents}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is **900 cents**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe problem says: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300 cents. The costs of the items don't change. I need to compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. The options are A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900.\n\nHmm. So it's a system of equations problem, I think. I need to find the individual prices of a soda and an energy bar. Once I have those, I can calculate six sodas and seven bars.\n\nLet me denote the price of one soda as S cents, and one energy bar as E cents.\n\nFrom the first part: one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents. So that translates to:\n\nS + 2E = 150  \u2192 Equation 1.\n\nThe second part says two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents. So:\n\n2S + 3E = 300 \u2192 Equation 2.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system to find S and E.\n\nLet me see. Maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination because the numbers seem manageable.\n\nIf I multiply Equation 1 by 2, I'll have:\n\n2S + 4E = 300 \u2192 Equation 3.\n\nNow, Equation 2 is 2S + 3E = 300. If I subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3, I can eliminate S.\n\nSo:\n\n(2S +4E) - (2S +3E) = 300 - 300 \u2192 \n\n2S cancels out, 4E -3E = E = 0. Wait, that can't be right. E is 0? That doesn't make sense because then the first equation would be S +0 =150 \u2192 S=150. Then the second equation would be 2*150 +3*0 =300, which is correct. But wait, if E is 0, then seven bars would cost 0. So the total for six sodas and seven bars would be 6*150 +7*0 =900. But let's check the options. Option E is 900. But that seems a bit strange. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake when subtracting the equations. Let me go through it again.\n\nEquation 3: 2S +4E =300.\n\nEquation 2: 2S +3E =300.\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n(2S -2S) + (4E -3E) = 300 - 300.\n\nSo 0 + E =0 \u2192 E=0.\n\nHmm, that's what I got earlier. So the energy bar is free? Then the soda is 150 cents each. Let me test this with the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: 150 + 2*0 =150 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond equation: 2*150 +3*0 =300 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo E=0 and S=150.\n\nBut that's a bit odd, but mathematically it's correct. So now, I need to find the cost for six sodas and seven bars.\n\nSix sodas would be 6 *150 = 900 cents.\n\nSeven bars would be 7 *0 =0.\n\nSo total is 900 +0 =900 cents.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 900. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, the first purchase is one soda and two bars for 150. The second is two sodas and three bars for 300. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can find the price per soda and bar.\n\nWait, perhaps the second option is just twice the first option. Because 2*(1 soda +2 bars) would be 2 sodas +4 bars, which costs 300. But the second option is 2 sodas and 3 bars for 300. So that would mean that 2 sodas +3 bars =300, but 2*(1 soda +2 bars)=300 as well. So that would imply that 2 sodas +4 bars =2 sodas +3 bars \u2192 which would mean 4 bars =3 bars \u2192 bar is zero. So E=0. So that's the same conclusion as before.\n\nSo it seems that the only solution is E=0, S=150. Thus, the total for six sodas and seven bars is 6*150=900.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because the second option is more bars but same cost as double the first option. So that implies the extra bar is free. Hence, each bar is free.\n\nSo the answer should be 900 cents, which is option E.\n",
