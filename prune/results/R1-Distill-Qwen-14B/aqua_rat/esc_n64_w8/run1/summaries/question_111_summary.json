      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about employees taking vacations. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I think I can work through it.\n\nThe problem says that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. So, let me denote the set of employees taking winter vacation as W. That means P(W) = 75%. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. So that's the intersection of W and S (summer), so P(W \u2229 S) = 40%. \n\nAnd 20% take neither. So the percentage of employees not taking either vacation is 20%. That probably means the rest take at least one of the vacations. Wait, total is 100%, so 100% minus 20% is 80%. So P(W \u222a S) = 80%.\n\nWait, but I remember that the formula for the union of two sets is P(W) + P(S) - P(W \u2229 S) = P(W \u222a S). Oh right, so that's 75% + P(S) - 40% = 80%. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 75 + S - 40 = 80. Hmm, solving for S. 75 -40 is 35. So 35 + S = 80. So S = 45%. Oh, so 45% take summer vacations. But wait, the question is asking for the percentage that take summer but not winter. So that would be P(S only) = P(S) - P(W \u2229 S). \n\nSo, 45% minus 40% is 5%. Wait, that can't be right. Because if 40% take both, and 5% only summer, that would make 45% in summer. But then, adding the winter only, which is 75% -40% =35%, so 35% winter only, 5% summer only, 40% both, and 20% neither. Let me add those up: 35 +5 is 40, plus 40 is 80, plus 20 is 100. Oh yeah, that adds up correctly.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. If 45% take summer (including both), then the only summer is 5%. But wait, the options have 5% as option A. So that's the answer? Or did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait another way: the employees taking only summer would be the total summer vacationers minus those who take both. So P(S) is 45%, and those taking both are 40%, so 45-40=5%. Yeah, that's 5% only take summer. So the answer should be 5% which is option A. But wait, the options are A)5%, B)15%, etc. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, the problem is about employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter. So yes, that's S minus both. So 45% total summer, minus 40% both, gives 5% summer only. So the answer is 5%, option A.\n",

I'm a bit rusty on sets and percentages, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe question says that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. Oh, and 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Also, 20% take neither. They're asking what percent take summer but not winter. Right, so that's the summer only group.\n\nWait, let me think about the Venn diagram approach. There's two circles: one for winter and one for summer. The overlapping part is the 40% who take both. The total in the winter circle is 75%, which includes those who take both and those who take only winter. Similarly, the summer circle includes those who take only summer and those who take both.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the total number of employees. But since percentages are given, I can consider the total as 100% for simplicity. So, the total is 100%.\n\nLet me jot down the data:\n\n- Winter only: W\n- Summer only: S\n- Both: B =40%\n- Neither: N =20%\n- Total: 100%\n\nSo, the total can be represented as W + S + B + N = 100%.\n\nWait, no. Because the employees taking winter vacation include both W and B. Similarly, summer includes S and B. So the total is W (only winter) + S (only summer) + B (both) + N (neither) = 100%.\n\nBut wait, the data says 75% take winter. So W + B =75%. And the total number taking summer would be S + B =? That's what we need to find eventually, but the question is about S, not S + B.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. That's S.\n\nSo, I need to find S.\n\nWe know that:\n\nW + B =75% (winter takers)\nS + B = summer takers, which we don't know yet.\nN=20%\n\nSo, the total is W + S + B + N =100%.\n\nSubstituting W =75% - B.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\nTotal = (W) + (S) + B + N = 100%\nSo, (75 - B) + S + B + 20 = 100% ?\n\nWait, wait, because W is only winter, which is 75% minus those who take both. Because the 75% includes both W and B. So W = 75% - B.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The 75% includes both the ones who take only winter (W) and those who take both (B). So W =75% - B.\n\nSimilarly, the total percentage taking summer is S + B.\n\nSo the total is:\n\nOnly winter (W) + Only summer (S) + Both (B) + Neither (N) =100%\n\nWhich is (75 - B) + S + B +20 =100%.\n\nBecause W is 75 - B, and S is what we're trying to find, and B is 40% as given.\n\nWait wait, wait a second. Oh no, wait. The question says 40% take both winter and summer. So B is 40%, not a variable. So I can plug that in.\n\nSo, B=40%.\n\nSo W =75% -40% =35%. That's the number of employees taking only winter.\n\nN=20%.\n\nSo now, the total is:\n\nW + S + B + N =100%\n35% + S +40% +20% =100%\n\nAdding those up: 35 + S +40 +20 = 100.\n\n35+40 is 75, plus 20 is 95. So 95 + S =100. So S=5%.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because 5% seems really low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, so:\n\nTotal employees: 100%.\n\nWinter vacation: 75% (includes both only winter and both).\n\nSummer vacation: S +40% (since 40% take both).\n\nNeither:20%.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nOnly Winter (75% -40% =35%) + Only Summer (S) + Both (40%) + Neither (20%) =100%.\n\nSo 35 + S +40 +20 =100.\n\nAdding 35 +40 is 75, plus 20 is 95. So 95 + S =100 \u2192 S=5%.\n\nHmm, so the percentage taking summer but not winter is 5%? That's option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because 40% take both, so 75% take winter, meaning 35% take only winter. 20% take neither, so 80% take at least one. Wait, 75+ S +40 would have some overlap, but perhaps that's not the right way to think.\n\nWait, another approach: the total number taking at least one vacation is 100% -20% =80%.\n\nSo, the union of winter and summer vacationers is 80%.\n\nThe formula for union is W + S - B =80%.\n\nWe know W is 75%, B is40%.\n\nSo, 75 + S -40 =80 \u2192 (75-40) + S =80 \u2192 35 + S=80 \u2192 S=45%.\n\nSo, S=45% take summer vacation. But wait, that's the total taking summer, including those who take both.\n\nBut the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter, which is S_only = S_total - B.\n\nSo S_only =45% -40% =5%.\n\nAh, so that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo the answer is 5%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, another way. Let's visualize:\n\nWinter only:35%, both:40%, summer only:5%, neither:20%.\n\nSo 35+40+5+20=100%. Yes.\n\nSo the summer only is 5%, so the answer is A)5%.\n",

Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh wait, that's a big overlap. And 20% take neither. So I guess I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nWait, let me get the numbers straight.

The formula is: Winter + Summer - Both = Total taking at least one. But wait, the total taking at least one is 80%, right?\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: Winter is 75%, summer is what we're trying to find (let's call it S), and both are 40%. So the equation would be 75 + S - 40 = 80. Because the total is 80.\n\nLet me compute that. 75 plus S minus 40 equals 80. So 75-40 is 35, so 35 + S =80. That means S is 45. Oh, so 45% take summer vacations. But wait, the question isn't asking for the total summer vacationers. It's asking for those who take summer but not winter.\n\nSo summer vacationers include those who take both and those who take only summer. So if 45% take summer, and 40% take both, then the ones taking only summer would be 45 minus 40, which is 5%. But wait, that seems low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through it again. So the total taking at least one vacation is 80%. The winter vacationers are 75%, which includes those who take only winter and those who take both. The summer vacationers are S, which includes those who take only summer and those who take both.\n\nSo the inclusion-exclusion formula is: Winter + Summer - Both = Total. So 75 + S - 40 =80. So 75 + S = 120. Wait, that can't be right because 75 + S would then be 120, so S is 45. Yeah, that's correct. So 45% take summer, which includes both those who take only summer and those who take both.\n\nSo the number taking only summer is S minus both, which is 45-40=5%. So that would be 5% take summer but not winter. But wait, the options don't have 5% as the correct answer? Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are A)5%, B)15%, C)25%, D)35%, E)45%. So option A is 5%, which is what I just got. But wait, that seems really low. Let me think again. Because 75% take winter, and 40% take both, that means 75-40=35% take only winter. So 35% only winter, 40% both, and some take only summer.\n\nWait, the total of those taking at least one is 80%. So 35 (only winter) + 40 (both) + only summer =80. So 35+40 is 75, so only summer is 5%. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer would be 5%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but that seems really small. Let me see if I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question is about summer vacation but not winter. So yeah, 5% seems right based on the numbers. So the answer should be A)5%.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the question says 75% of employees take a winter vacation. That means a lot of people are going away in the winter. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh wait, that's a big overlap. And 20% take neither. So I guess I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this.\n\nWait, let me get the numbers straight. Total employees are 100%, right? So if 20% take neither, then 80% take at least one vacation, either winter, summer, or both. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%.\n\nNow, the 80% who take at least one vacation includes those who take only winter, only summer, and both. But the problem gives me that 75% take winter.

The question is about finding the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. \n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. \n\nFirst, 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. That means that 75% are in the winter group. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh right, so those 40% are part of both groups. \n\nAlso, 20% take neither vacation. So, that's the group that doesn't take any of them. \n\nWait, I remember that in set theory, the total percentage should add up to 100%, right? So let me think about how to model this. Maybe a Venn diagram would help. There's a winter circle and a summer circle overlapping.\n\nSo, the total percentage is 100%. Out of this, 20% take neither, so the remaining 80% must be taking at least one of the vacations. So 80% is the union of winter and summer vacationers.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is: \nTotal in union = Winter + Summer - Both. \n\nSo, in percentages, that's 80% = 75% + S - 40%, where S is the percentage taking summer vacation. \n\nWait, because 40% take both, so when we add winter and summer, we subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting. \n\nLet me write that equation out. \n\n80 = 75 + S - 40. \n\nHmm, solving for S. \n\nSo 80 = 35 + S. \n\nThat would make S = 45%. So 45% take summer vacation. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. Oh right, because some take both. So the summer-only group is S minus the overlap. \n\nSo the summer-only percentage would be 45% (total summer) minus 40% (both) which is 5%. \n\nWait, that can't be right because 5% is a very small number. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me go through it again. \n\nWe know that 20% take neither, so 80% take at least one. \n\nThe formula for union is Winter + Summer - Both. So 75 + S - 40 = 80. \n\nSo 75 + S = 80 + 40? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, 75 + S -40 = 80. So 35 + S = 80. Then S = 45. Oh right, that's correct. \n\nSo 45% take summer. But some of those also take winter. So the number taking summer only is 45% minus 40% who take both. That gives 5%. So 5% take only summer. \n\nWait, but that seems low. Let me see if that adds up. \n\nWinter only: 75% total winter minus 40% both. So 35% take only winter. \n\nSummer only: 45% total summer minus 40% both, which is 5%. \n\nThen, the ones who take neither are 20%. \n\nAdding them up: 35 (winter only) + 5 (summer only) + 40 (both) + 20 (neither) = 100? Wait, 35+5 is 40, plus 40 is 80, plus 20 is 100. Oh, yes, that adds up. \n\nSo the number of employees taking summer but not winter is 5%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but wait, the options don't have 5% as the correct answer. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions: A is 5%, B 15%, C 25%, D 35%, E 45%. So A is 5% which is the number I calculated. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the summer vacationers would be more. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 75% take winter, which includes the 40% who take both. So 35% take only winter. 40% take both. So that's 75% accounted for. \n\nThen, the summer vacationers are 45%, which includes those 40% who are already in winter. So the only summer is 5%. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be 5%, which is option A. But wait, wait another thought. \n\nWait, 75% take winter, 40% take both. So the employees taking summer only would be S - both. So 45% -40% =5%. So that's correct. \n\nYes, I think I've got it. So the correct answer is A)5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about employees taking vacations. Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about finding the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. \n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. \n\nFirst, 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. That means that 75% are in the winter group. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh right, so those 40% are part of both groups. \n\nAlso, 20% take neither vacation. So, that's the group that doesn't take any of them. \n\nWait, I remember that in set theory, the total percentage should add up to 100%, right? So let me think about how to model this. Maybe a Venn diagram would help. There's a winter circle and a summer circle overlapping.\n\nSo, the total percentage is 100%. Out of this, 20% take neither, so the remaining 80% must be taking at least one of the vacations. So 80% is the union of winter and summer vacationers.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is: \nTotal in union = Winter + Summer - Both. \n\nSo, in percentages, that's 80% = 75% + S - 40%, where S is the percentage taking summer vacation. \n\nWait, because 40% take both, so when we add winter and summer, we subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting. \n\nLet me write that equation out. \n\n80 = 75 + S - 40. \n\nHmm, solving for S. \n\nSo 80 = 35 + S. \n\nThat would make S = 45%. So 45% take summer vacation. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. Oh right, because some take both. So the summer-only group is S minus the overlap. \n\nSo the summer-only percentage would be 45% (total summer) minus 40% (both) which is 5%. \n\nWait, that can't be right because 5% is a very small number.

The question is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. I remember something about sets and maybe a Venn diagram could help visualize this.\n\nAlright, let's break down the information given. The first thing says that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. So, if I imagine a circle representing all employees, 75% is in the winter circle. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Oh, right, that's the overlap between the two circles. And 20% take neither, so they're outside both circles.\n\nWait, I think the total percentage should add up in a certain way. Let me think. The total is 100%, right? Because all employees are either taking at least one vacation or neither. So the ones taking at least one vacation would be 100% minus 20%, which is 80%. That 80% includes all the people taking winter, summer, or both.\n\nNow, I know that the winter vacationers include those who take both and those who take only winter. Similarly, the summer vacationers include those who take both and those who take only summer. But I need to find the ones who take only summer.\n\nSo, the winter vacationers are 75%. Of those, 40% take both. That means the number taking only winter is 75% minus 40%, which is 35%. Wait, no, wait. Because 40% is taking both. So, if 75% take winter, and 40% are part of that 75%, then the only winter vacationers are 75% minus 40% = 35%.\n\nNow, the total number taking at least one vacation is 80%, right? Because 20% take neither. So, the summer vacationers must include both those who take only summer and those who take both. Let me denote the summer vacationers as S. So, the only summer vacationers would be S minus the overlap (which is 40%).\n\nSo, the total in the summer circle is (only summer) + (both) = S. And we know that the total in both circles (winter and summer) is 80%.\n\nWait, let me write down the equation. The union of winter and summer vacationers is 80%. So, the formula for the union is Winter + Summer - Both = Union. So, 75% + S - 40% = 80%.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 75 + S -40 = 80. Let's compute that. 75 minus 40 is 35. So, 35 + S = 80. Subtract 35 from both sides: S = 45%.\n\nOh, so the total summer vacationers are 45%. But the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. That's the only summer part, which is S minus both. So 45% minus 40% gives 5%. Wait, that's 5%? But looking at the options, option A is 5%, but I'm a bit confused because that seems low.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nThe union is 80%, which is Winter (75%) plus Summer (S) minus Both (40%) equals 80%. So, 75 + S -40 =80. That's 35 + S =80 \u2192 S=45. So yes, summer vacationers total 45%, which includes the 40% who take both. So the ones taking only summer are 45-40=5%.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about employees taking vacations, and I need to find out what percentage takes a summer vacation but not a winter one. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the problem. There are two types of vacations here: winter and summer. Some employees take only winter, some take both, and some take neither. I'm supposed to find out the percentage that takes summer but not winter.\n\nWait, the problem states that 75% take a winter vacation. But 40% take both winter and summer. Oh, right, because if someone takes both, they're included in both the winter and summer percentages. And 20% take neither. So the total is 100%, and I can use that to find the missing piece.\n\nLet me think in terms of a Venn diagram. Imagine two overlapping circles: one for winter vacationers and one for summer vacationers. The overlapping part is the 40% who take both. The winter circle includes those 40% plus those who take only winter. Similarly, the summer circle includes the 40% plus those who take only summer.\n\nWait, but I don't know the only summer vacationers yet. That's what I need to find. Let me denote the variables.\n\nLet\u2019s let W be the percentage taking winter vacation (75%), S be those taking summer (which includes both S_only and both W and S), and neither is 20%.\n\nSo, the total is 100%, which is the sum of all four groups: only winter, only summer, both, and neither.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer + Both + Neither = 100%\n\nI know that Both is 40%, Neither is 20%. So:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer + 40 + 20 = 100\nOnly Winter + Only Summer = 100 - 60 = 40%\n\nBut I also know that W is 75%, which is Only Winter plus Both. Because W includes everyone who took winter, whether they took summer or not.\n\nSo, W = Only Winter + Both \u2192 75 = Only Winter +40 \u2192 Only Winter = 75-40=35%.\n\nNow, going back to the earlier equation, Only Winter is 35, Only Summer + 35 =40 \u2192 Only Summer = 40-35=5%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options don't have 5% as the correct answer for the summer only. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the options have A)5% and others. So if Only Summer is 5%, then the answer would be A. But that seems low.

But the question asks for those who take summer but not winter, which is Only Summer. So 5% is the correct answer. But looking at the options, A is 5% and E is 45%, which is the total summer vacationers. So the answer should be A)5%?\n\nBut wait, the problem says 75% take winter, 40% take both. So 75% includes the 40% who take both. So the only winter is 35%, as I calculated.\n\nSo Only Summer is 5% as per the equation.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about employees taking vacations, and I need to find out what percentage takes a summer vacation but not a winter one. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the problem. There are two types of vacations here: winter and summer. Some employees take only winter, some take both, and some take neither. I'm supposed to find out the percentage that takes summer but not winter.\n\nWait, the problem states that 75% take a winter vacation. But 40% take both winter and summer. Oh, right, because if someone takes both, they're included in both the winter and summer percentages. And 20% take neither. So the total is 100%, and I can use that to find the missing piece.\n\nLet me think in terms of a Venn diagram. Imagine two overlapping circles: one for winter vacationers and one for summer vacationers. The overlapping part is the 40% who take both. The winter circle includes those 40% plus those who take only winter. Similarly, the summer circle includes the 40% plus those who take only summer.\n\nWait, but I don't know the only summer vacationers yet. That's what I need to find. Let me denote the variables.\n\nLet\u2019s let W be the percentage taking winter vacation (75%), S be those taking summer (which includes both S_only and both W and S), and neither is 20%.\n\nSo, the total is 100%, which is the sum of all four groups: only winter, only summer, both, and neither.\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer + Both + Neither = 100%\n\nI know that Both is 40%, Neither is 20%. So:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer + 40 + 20 = 100\nOnly Winter + Only Summer = 100 - 60 = 40%\n\nBut I also know that W is 75%, which is Only Winter plus Both. Because W includes everyone who took winter, whether they took summer or not.\n\nSo, W = Only Winter + Both \u2192 75 = Only Winter +40 \u2192 Only Winter = 75-40=35%.\n\nNow, going back to the earlier equation, Only Winter is 35, Only Summer + 35 =40 \u2192 Only Summer = 40-35=5%.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options don't have 5% as the correct answer for the summer only. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the options have A)5% and others. So if Only Summer is 5%, then the answer would be A. But that seems low. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me go through again.\n\nThe total is 100%, which is the sum of Only Winter, Only Summer, Both, and Neither. So:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer + Both + Neither = 100\n\nWe know Both is 40%, Neither is 20%, so:\n\nOnly Winter + Only Summer = 40.\n\nBut W is the percentage taking winter, which is Only Winter + Both. So:\n\nOnly Winter = W - Both =75% -40% =35%.\n\nSo Only Summer is 40 -35=5%.\n\nSo the percentage that takes summer but not winter is 5%, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the options don't seem to make sense because 40% take both, and 75% take winter.

Hmm, let me try to understand it. \n\nAlright, the question is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. I think I need to use some set theory or maybe a Venn diagram approach here.\n\nLet me jot down the given information:\n\n- 75% take a winter vacation. So that's the winter set, W. So P(W) = 75%.\n- 40% take both winter and summer vacations. That's the intersection of W and S, so P(W \u2229 S) = 40%.\n- 20% take neither. So they don't take either vacation. That means the total outside both circles in the Venn diagram is 20%.\n\nWait, so the total percentage of employees is 100%. If 20% take neither, then 80% take at least one of the vacations. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So P(W \u222a S) = 80%.\n\nI remember there's a formula for the union of two sets: P(W \u222a S) = P(W) + P(S) - P(W \u2229 S). Oh right, that's inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nSo I can plug in the numbers I have into this formula to find P(S), which is the percentage taking a summer vacation.\n\nSo plugging in:\n80% = 75% + P(S) - 40%\n\nLet me calculate that. 75% plus P(S) minus 40% equals 80. So 75 -40 is 35, plus P(S) equals 80. So 35 + P(S) = 80. Therefore, P(S) is 80 -35 = 45%. So 45% take summer vacations.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't asking for the total summer vacationers. It's asking for those who take summer but not winter. Oh right, so that's the part of the summer circle that doesn't overlap with winter.\n\nThe summer vacationers include both those who take only summer and those who take both. So to find the ones who take only summer, I subtract the overlap from the total summer.\n\nSo P(S only) = P(S) - P(W \u2229 S) = 45% - 40% = 5%. \n\nWait, but that seems low. Let me double-check. Because if 75% take winter, and 40% take both, then 75% minus 40% is 35% take only winter. So 35% + (summer only 5%) + both (40%) = 80% (since 20% take neither). 35 +5 is 40, plus 40 is 80. Oh yeah, that adds up.\n\nSo the percentage taking summer but not winter is 5%? But wait, looking at the options, 5% is option A. Hmm, but I thought the answer would be higher. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the calculation seems correct. So the problem is to find the summer only, which is 5%. So the answer should be A)5%. But wait, that seems too small. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's say the total is 100 employees for simplicity.\n\n- 75 take winter. So 25 don't take winter.\n- 20 take neither, so 20 don't take winter or summer. That leaves 80 who take at least one.\n\nOf those 80, 40 take both. So 40 take both, and the rest take only one. So 80 -40 =40 take only one. But wait, how is this split between winter only and summer only?\n\nWait, the 75 taking winter include those who take both. So winter only is 75 -40 =35. So 35 take only winter, 40 take both, and 40 take only summer? Wait, no, because 35 (only winter) +40 (both) is 75, and the summer only would be 40? Because 35+40=75, and 40+35+40= 110, which can't be right because total is 100.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a table.\n\nTotal employees: 100.\n\n- Winter only: 75 -40 =35.\n- Both:40.\n- Neither:20.\n- Summer only: ?\n\nTotal in at least one: 100-20=80. So 35 (winter only) +40 (both) + summer only =80.\n\nSo 35+40 =75. 75 + summer only =80. So summer only is 5. Oh, that's the same as before. So the summer only is 5% of the employees. So the answer is 5%, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 45%, which is the total summer vacationers. So why is the answer 5%?
