      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that A and B are independent events. The probability of A, P(A), is 0.2, and the probability of B, P(B), is 0.8. I need to find P(A/B), which I think is the probability of A given B. \n\nWait, wait. Since A and B are independent, does that mean P(A/B) is the same as P(A)? Because I remember that if two events are independent, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. So, the probability of A given B should just be the probability of A, right?\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). Oh, right, that's the formula. Since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) should be equal to P(A) * P(B). So substituting that into the formula, P(A|B) would be [P(A) * P(B)] / P(B). \n\nWait, the P(B) in the numerator and denominator would cancel out, right? So that leaves me with P(A|B) = P(A). Which is 0.2. So the answer should be 0.2, which is option A.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, independence implies that the probability of both A and B happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(A and B) is 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16. Then, when I compute P(A|B), it's 0.16 divided by P(B), which is 0.8. 0.16 divided by 0.8 is 0.2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition here.\n\nI remember that the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). Since A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is just P(A) times P(B). Oh right, because for independent events, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo putting that into the formula, P(A|B) would be [P(A)*P(B)] divided by P(B). Wait, the P(B) in the denominator and the numerator would cancel each other out. So that would leave just P(A). Oh, that makes sense because if they're independent, the probability of A given B is just the probability of A.\n\nSo substituting the given values, P(A) is 0.2. So P(A/B) must be 0.2. Let me double-check that logic. If A and B are independent, then P(A|B) = P(A). So yeah, that's right.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 0.2. So the correct answer should be A.\n\n\nTo determine \\( P(A|B) \\) for independent events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we use the formula for conditional probability:\n\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent, the joint probability \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is equal to \\( P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\). Substituting this into the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) \\cdot P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( P(A) = 0.2 \\), it follows that \\( P(A|B) = 0.2 \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",
