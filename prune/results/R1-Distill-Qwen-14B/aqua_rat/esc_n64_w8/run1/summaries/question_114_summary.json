      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a fan blade and a point on its edge. I remember that when something rotates, the distance traveled by a point on the edge is related to the circumference of the circle it's making.\n\nWait, the fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute. Oh right, revolutions per minute (RPM) is a measure of rotational speed. So first, I need to find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds.\n\nWait, wait. 300 RPM is per minute, so in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, it would be 150 revolutions. Oh right, because 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes, so 300 * 0.5 = 150. Got that part.\n\nBut wait, each revolution is a full circle. So each point on the edge travels the circumference of the circle once per revolution. The circumference is 2 * pi * r. Here, the radius is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi centimeters per revolution.\n\nSo for each revolution, the point moves 20 pi cm. If there are 150 revolutions in 30 seconds, then the total distance is 150 * 20 pi. Let me compute that: 150 * 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi centimeters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, RPM is 300 per minute. Time is 30 seconds. So time in minutes is 0.5. 300 * 0.5 = 150 revolutions. Correct.\n\nEach revolution, circumference is 2 pi r = 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi. So total distance is 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be D) 3000pi.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a fan blade. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says there's a point on the edge of a fan blade that's rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are all in terms of pi, so I think the answer will involve some circular motion calculations.\n\nHmm, right. So, the key concepts here are rotational motion and the relationship between linear distance and angular measures. I remember that when something rotates, each point on the edge moves in a circular path. The distance traveled by that point would be the circumference of the circle it makes, multiplied by the number of times it goes around.\n\nWait, so the fan is moving at 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is in seconds, so I probably need to convert the time to minutes or the RPM to per second. Let me think: 30 seconds is half a minute, because 30 divided by 60 is 0.5 minutes. Alternatively, I could convert the RPM to revolutions per second by dividing by 60. Let me see which approach is easier.\n\nIf the fan is 300 revolutions per minute, that's 300 RPM. So in one minute (which is 60 seconds), it does 300 revs. So in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, it would do 150 revolutions. Oh, that makes sense.\n\nEach revolution means the point goes around once, so the distance for each rev is the circumference of the circle. The radius is 10 cm, so the circumference is 2 * pi * radius. That would be 2 * pi * 10 cm, which is 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nSo if there are 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi. Let's compute that. 150 multiplied by 20 is 3000, so 3000 pi centimeters. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options include other numbers.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake with the time conversion. Let me think again. The fan is 300 RPM. So in one minute (60 seconds), it does 300 revs. So in 30 seconds, it does 300/2 = 150 revs. That part is correct. The circumference is 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi * 10 cm = 20 pi cm. So 150 revs would be 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. That's option D.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes, when dealing with rotational problems, people confuse linear speed with angular speed. But in this case, the question is about the distance traveled, so it's just the circumference multiplied by the number of revolutions. So I think I'm right.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the linear speed first. The angular speed in radians per second is (300 rev/min) * (2 pi rad/rev) / 60 sec/min. Let me compute that: 300 * 2 pi / 60 = (300/60)*2 pi = 5 * 2 pi = 10 pi radians per second. Then, the linear speed (v) is r * omega, which is 10 cm * 10 pi rad/s = 100 pi cm/s. Then, the distance traveled in 30 seconds is speed multiplied by time: 100 pi * 30 = 3000 pi cm. Yep, same result.\n\nSo the answer should be option D) 3000 pi. Looking back at the options, D is 3000 pi, so that's the correct one.\n",

The question is asking about the distance traveled by a point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds.

So each revolution, the point would travel the circumference of the circle it's making. Oh right, circumference is 2\u03c0r.

The circumference of a circle is 2\u03c0r, right? So for this point, the circumference would be 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm. Let me calculate that: 2*10 is 20, so 20\u03c0 cm. That's the distance it travels in one full revolution.\n\nNow, the fan's speed is 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is in seconds\u201430 seconds. Oh, right, so I need to convert the time into minutes or the revolutions per minute into per second. Maybe both ways. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's convert 30 seconds into minutes. Since 60 seconds make a minute, 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. Alternatively, I can find revolutions per second by dividing 300 by 60, which is 5 revolutions per second. Either way works.\n\nOption 1: Let's use the per minute rate. If the fan runs for 0.5 minutes, the number of revolutions would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min. That's 150 revolutions.

And the revolutions per minute is 300, so 300 *0.5 is 150 revs. Multiply by circumference gives the total distance. Yep, that's right.\n\nI think I got this right.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are A to E, all involving pi, which suggests the answer will involve circles and maybe circumference calculations.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: radius, time, and revolutions per minute. I remember that when something rotates, the distance a point travels depends on the circumference of the circle it's making and how many times it goes around.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the given values:\n\n- Radius (r) = 10 cm. That's the distance from the center, so the edge is 10 cm away.\n- Time (t) = 30 seconds.\n- Revolutions per minute (RPM) = 300.\n\nWait, RPM is per minute, but the time given is in seconds. I should probably convert RPM to revolutions per second or vice versa. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nSince 1 minute is 60 seconds, 300 revolutions per minute is the same as 300/60 revolutions per second. Let me calculate that: 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, the fan is spinning at 5 revolutions per second.\n\nBut wait, I think it's more accurate to compute the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds. Because RPM is per minute, maybe I should find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds. Let me try that approach.\n\n300 revolutions per minute is 300 rev/min. So, in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, the number of revolutions would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min = 150 revolutions. Oh right, because 30 seconds is 0.5 of a minute. That makes sense.\n\nNow, each revolution the point travels the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2 * pi * r. With r being 10 cm, the circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nSo each full turn, the point moves 20 pi cm. Now, over 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi cm.\n\nLet me compute that: 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. The time is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So 300 RPM for 30 seconds: 300 * (30/60) = 300 * 0.5 = 150 revolutions. That's correct.\n\nEach revolution is 20 pi cm. So 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. That seems right. Let me look at the options. Option D is 3000 pi. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this: maybe calculate the angular velocity and then find the arc length. But I think that's more complicated when the problem is straightforward with revolutions.\n\nAngular velocity (omega) is usually in radians per second. Since one revolution is 2 pi radians, 300 RPM is 300 rev/min. To convert to radians per second: (300 rev/min) * (2 pi rad/rev) * (1 min/60 sec) = (300 * 2 pi) / 60 = (600 pi) / 60 = 10 pi radians per second.\n\nThen, the angular displacement theta is omega * t.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A point on the edge of a fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center. I need to find the distance traveled by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute. The options are A to E, all involving pi, which suggests the answer will involve circles and maybe circumference calculations.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: radius, time, and revolutions per minute. I remember that when something rotates, the distance a point travels depends on the circumference of the circle it's making and how many times it goes around.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the given values:\n\n- Radius (r) = 10 cm. That's the distance from the center, so the edge is 10 cm away.\n- Time (t) = 30 seconds.\n- Revolutions per minute (RPM) = 300.\n\nWait, RPM is per minute, but the time given is in seconds. I should probably convert RPM to revolutions per second or vice versa. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nSince 1 minute is 60 seconds, 300 revolutions per minute is the same as 300/60 revolutions per second. Let me calculate that: 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, the fan is spinning at 5 revolutions per second.\n\nBut wait, I think it's more accurate to compute the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds. Because RPM is per minute, maybe I should find out how many revolutions happen in 30 seconds. Let me try that approach.\n\n300 revolutions per minute is 300 rev/min. So, in 30 seconds, which is half a minute, the number of revolutions would be 300 rev/min * 0.5 min = 150 revolutions. Oh right, because 30 seconds is 0.5 of a minute. That makes sense.\n\nNow, each revolution the point travels the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2 * pi * r. With r being 10 cm, the circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi cm per revolution.\n\nSo each full turn, the point moves 20 pi cm. Now, over 150 revolutions, the total distance would be 150 * 20 pi cm.\n\nLet me compute that: 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. The time is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So 300 RPM for 30 seconds: 300 * (30/60) = 300 * 0.5 = 150 revolutions. That's correct.\n\nEach revolution is 20 pi cm. So 150 * 20 pi = 3000 pi cm. That seems right. Let me look at the options. Option D is 3000 pi. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to approach this: maybe calculate the angular velocity and then find the arc length. But I think that's more complicated when the problem is straightforward with revolutions.\n\nAngular velocity (omega) is usually in radians per second. Since one revolution is 2 pi radians, 300 RPM is 300 rev/min. To convert to radians per second: (300 rev/min) * (2 pi rad/rev) * (1 min/60 sec) = (300 * 2 pi) / 60 = (600 pi) / 60 = 10 pi radians per second.\n\nThen, the angular displacement theta is omega * t. So theta = 10 pi rad/s * 30 s = 300 pi radians.\n\nThe linear distance traveled (s) is r * theta. So s = 10 cm * 300 pi rad = 3000 pi cm. Yep, same answer. So this confirms that D is the correct choice.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 3000 pi. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade, we start by analyzing the given parameters:\n\n- **Radius (r):** 10 cm  \n- **Time (t):** 30 seconds  \n- **Revolutions per minute (RPM):** 300  \n\nFirst, convert the RPM to revolutions per second:  \n\\[\n\\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{300}{60} = 5 \\, \\text{revolutions per second}.\n\\]  \n\nNext, calculate the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total revolutions} = 5 \\, \\text{rev/s} \\times 30 \\, \\text{s} = 150 \\, \\text{revolutions}.\n\\]  \n\nEach revolution corresponds to one full circumference of the circular path.

So, first, I think I should find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds, and then multiply that by the circumference to get the total distance.\n\nWait, the fan's speed is given in revolutions per minute (RPM), but the time given is in seconds. Oh right, I need to convert the time to minutes to match the units. So, 30 seconds is half a minute. That makes it easier. So the time in minutes is 0.5 minutes.\n\nNow, the RPM is 300. So in one minute, it makes 300 revolutions. In 0.5 minutes, how many revolutions does it make? Let me calculate that. 300 rev/min * 0.5 min = 150 revolutions. Got that.\n\nEach revolution is a full circle, and the circumference is 2\u03c0r. The radius here is 10 cm, so circumference is 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm = 20\u03c0 cm. Right, so each full turn, the point moves 20\u03c0 cm.\n\nSo the total distance is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. That would be 150 rev * 20\u03c0 cm/rev. Let me compute that. 150 * 20 is 3000. So 3000\u03c0 cm. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 3000pi, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. So 300 RPM for 30 seconds. 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. 300 * 0.5 is 150. Then, circumference is 2\u03c0*10=20\u03c0. 150 *20\u03c0 is indeed 3000\u03c0. So yes, D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of angular velocity. Angular velocity \u03c9 is 300 rev per minute. But wait, I should convert it to rev per second. 300 rev/min is 300/60 = 5 rev/s. So in 30 seconds, it's 5 *30=150 rev. Same as before.\n\nAnother approach: calculate the linear speed. Linear speed v = \u03c9 * r. But \u03c9 in radians per second. Let's see, 300 rev/min is 300 * 2\u03c0 rad/min. So 600\u03c0 rad/min. To convert to rad/s, divide by 60: 600\u03c0 /60=10\u03c0 rad/s. Then v = \u03c9 * r = 10\u03c0 rad/s * 10 cm = 100\u03c0 cm/s. Then, distance is speed multiplied by time: 100\u03c0 *30 s=3000\u03c0 cm. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo all methods lead to the same result.
