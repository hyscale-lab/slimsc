      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a map scale. Hmm, let's see. The question says that on the map, the road from Town F to G is 20 inches long. And the scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance in miles.\n\nWait, I remember that map scales are about converting the measured distance on the map to the real-world distance. So the basic idea is that a certain number of inches on the map equals a certain number of miles in reality. \n\nSo the scale here is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. I think I need to find out how many miles one inch represents, then multiply that by 20 inches to get the total distance.\n\nLet me break it down. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be 4 times that, right? Because 1 divided by 1/4 is 4. So 10 miles multiplied by 4 is 40 miles per inch.\n\nNow, the distance on the map is 20 inches. So I take 20 inches and multiply by the number of miles per inch. That would be 20 * 40 miles. Let me calculate that: 20 times 40 is 800. So the actual distance should be 800 miles.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the scale. Sometimes people get confused between the scale units. Oh wait, the scale says 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So for each 1/4 inch, it's 10 miles. So each inch is 40 miles. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo 20 inches on the map would be 20 * 40 = 800 miles. Looking at the options, option A is 800. So the answer should be A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: On a map, the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches long. The map's scale is such that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. I need to find the actual distance between the towns in miles.\n\nHmm, right. So this is a problem about map scales. I remember that maps use scales to represent real-world distances. The scale tells you how many real miles (or kilometers) are equivalent to a certain number of inches or centimeters on the map.\n\nAlright, the given scale here is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So for every quarter inch on the map, it's actually ten miles in real life. Now, the distance on the map between Town F and G is 20 inches. So I need to convert this 20 inches into actual miles using the scale provided.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Well, if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then I can find out how many miles one inch represents. That might make it easier. So if I have 1/4 inch = 10 miles, then one inch would be four times that, because 1/4 multiplied by 4 is 1.\n\nSo, 10 miles multiplied by 4 is 40 miles. Oh wait, wait a minute. No, wait, that's not right. Because if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then to find how much one inch is, I should multiply 10 by 4. So 10 * 4 is 40. So one inch on the map is 40 miles in reality.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then 1 inch would be 40 miles because 10 * 4 =40. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo now, the distance on the map is 20 inches. So to find the actual distance, I multiply 20 inches by the number of miles per inch.\n\nSo actual distance = 20 inches * 40 miles/inch.\n\nLet me calculate that. 20 *40 is 800. So the actual distance is 800 miles.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 800. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this using proportions. Let me see. The scale is 1/4 inch : 10 miles. So for 20 inches, how many miles?\n\nSet up a ratio: (1/4) inch / 10 miles = 20 inches / x miles.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The ratio should be set up as map distance over actual distance equals scale map distance over scale actual distance.\n\nSo (1/4) inch / 10 miles = 20 inches / x miles.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me correct that. The ratio should be the same. So (map distance) / (actual distance) = (scale map distance) / (scale actual distance).\n\nSo 20 inches / x miles = (1/4 inch) / (10 miles).\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the scale is 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. So the ratio is 1/4 inch : 10 miles. So for the actual distance, the ratio is 20 inches : x miles.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find how many miles per inch. Since 1/4 inch = 10 miles, then per inch it's 10 * 4 = 40 miles. So 1 inch =40 miles.\n\nSo 20 inches would be 20 *40 =800 miles.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my first method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of unit conversion. The scale is 10 miles per 1/4 inch. So I can write that as 10 miles / (1/4 inch) = 40 miles per inch.\n\nSo then, 20 inches * 40 miles/inch = 800 miles.\n\nThat's straightforward.

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that on a map, the distance from Town F to Town G is 20 inches. Then, it says that 1/4 inch on this map represents an actual distance of 10 miles. The question is asking for the actual distance between the two towns in miles. The options are A) 800, B)720, C)960, D)1140, E)1160. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that maps use scales to represent real-world distances. So the scale here is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. I need to find out how many miles each inch represents and then multiply that by the total inches on the map.\n\nWait, right. So if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then each inch must be a larger number. Let me calculate that. If 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then one inch would be 10 miles multiplied by 4. Because 1 inch is four times 1/4 inch. So 10 times 4 is 40. Oh wait, so each inch on the map equals 40 miles in real life.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So, 1 inch is 4*(10 miles) = 40 miles. Yeah, that makes sense. So the scale is 40 miles per inch.\n\nBut wait, wait. The road is 20 inches on the map. So the actual distance is 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me do that math: 20 * 40. Hmm, 20 times 40 is 800. So that would be 800 miles? Looking at the options, option A is 800. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the scale right? Let me think again. 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So 1 inch would be 40 miles. So 20 inches would be 20 times 40. Oh, right, 20 *40 is 800. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's see, if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then how many miles per inch? 10 miles / (1/4 inch) is the same as 10 *4 miles per inch, which is 40. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a ratio. 1/4 inch : 10 miles = 1 inch : 40 miles. So yeah, 20 inches would be 20 *40=800.\n\nWait, but wait again.
