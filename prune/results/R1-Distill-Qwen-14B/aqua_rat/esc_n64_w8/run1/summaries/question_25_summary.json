      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Bill riding his bicycle on a windy day. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. I'll need to find the distance, right?\n\nAlright, let's start by gathering the information given. Normally, Bill averages about 15 mph when riding his bike. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So I think that means his speed on a windy day is 15 minus 4, which is 11 mph. Wait, yeah, that makes sense. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph.\n\nNow, the time he's traveling is 21 minutes. Wait, but speed is in hours, so I need to convert minutes to hours to make the units match. How do I do that? Oh right, 21 minutes is 21 divided by 60 hours. Let me calculate that: 21 \u00f7 60 equals... let's see, 0.35 hours. So the time is 0.35 hours.\n\nDistance is calculated by multiplying speed by time, right? So I'll take his reduced speed (11 mph) and multiply it by the time (0.35 hours). Let me compute that: 11 * 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. So adding those together, 3.5 + 0.35 = 3.85 miles.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check the calculations. 11 mph for 0.35 hours. 11 * 0.35. Alternatively, 0.35 is the same as 35/100, which is 7/20. So 11 * 7 = 77, divided by 20 is 3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles. So that must be the right answer. The other options don't match. Option E is 2.85, which is less than 3.85, so I think I'm confident with D.\n",

Hmm, the question is about how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. \n\nAlright, let's see. Normally, Bill averages about 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. Wait, so I think I need to subtract 4 from 15. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 equals 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph. Got it.\n\nNow, the next part is time. He's riding for 21 minutes. Oh, but wait, speed is in hours, right? Because mph is miles per hour. So I can't just multiply 11 by 21 directly. I need to convert minutes to hours. How do I do that? Well, 21 minutes is a third of an hour because 60 minutes divided by 21 is approximately 0.35 hours. Wait, let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo now I can find the distance. Distance equals speed multiplied by time. His speed is 11 mph, time is 0.35 hours. So 11 times 0.35. Let me compute that. 11 * 0.35.

So 11 * (7/20) = (77)/20 = 3.85. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the distance is 3.85 miles. Looking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles. So that should be the answer.

The question is asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. The options are A to E, and I need to pick the right one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I think I need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. Since his normal speed is 15 mph and it's reduced by 4 mph, that should be 15 minus 4. So 15-4 is 11 mph. Okay, so his speed is 11 mph on a windy day.\n\nNext, I need to find out how far he goes in 21 minutes. Wait, because speed is in hours, I should convert the time from minutes to hours. Right, 21 minutes is less than an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 divided by 60 should give me the fraction of an hour.\n\nLet me calculate that: 21 \u00f7 60. Hmm, 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. So the time is 0.35 hours.\n\nNow, distance is speed multiplied by time. So I multiply his speed by the time. That would be 11 mph * 0.35 hours.

Sometimes I make mistakes with decimals. Let me compute 11 * 0.35 again. 0.35 is the same as 35/100. So 11 * 35 is 385, then divided by 100 is 3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 3.85 miles. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything else. Did I convert the time correctly? Yes, 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. 21 divided by 60 is 0.35. Speed is 11 mph, so 11 * 0.35 is indeed 3.85. That's correct.\n\nSo the answer is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, Bill's usual average speed is 15 mph on a normal day. But on a windy day, his speed drops by 4 mph. So I'll subtract 4 from 15 to find his speed on that day. Let me calculate that: 15 minus 4 equals 11 mph. So his speed is 11 mph on a windy day.\n\nNow, the time he's riding is 21 minutes. Wait, speed is in hours, so I need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me compute that. 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. Hmm, yeah, because 20 minutes is 1/3 which is about 0.333, so 21 is a bit more, so 0.35 makes sense.\n\nNext, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. So the formula is distance = speed \u00d7 time. Plugging in the numbers, it's 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me do the multiplication: 11 times 0.35. Hmm, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. Adding those together, 3.5 + 0.35 equals 3.85 miles. \n\nWait, the options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. Oh, so D is 3.85.

Hmm, Bill usually averages 15 mph on a normal day, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. The question is asking how far he can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. And I need to choose the correct option from A to E. \n\nWait, so first, I should find out Bill's speed on a windy day. Oh right, his average speed goes down by 4 mph. So subtracting 4 from 15, that would be 11 mph. That makes sense because wind can slow you down.\n\nNow, the next part is about time. He's riding for 21 minutes. But wait, speed is in hours, right? Because it's miles per hour. So I need to convert 21 minutes into hours. How do I do that? Well, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60 equals 0.35 hours. Oh, right, because 20 minutes is a third of an hour (which is about 0.333), so 21 is a bit more than that.\n\nOkay, so now I have his speed and the time. To find distance, I remember the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So I should multiply 11 mph by 0.35 hours. Let me do that math. 11 times 0.35... Hmm, 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those together, 3.3 + 0.55 equals 3.85 miles. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. 11 * 0.35. Alternatively, 0.35 is the same as 35/100. So 11 * 35 is 385, and then divide by 100, which gives 3.85. Yep, that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3.85 miles.
