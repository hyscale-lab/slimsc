      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the ratio of volumes between a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on geometry, but let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a sphere fitting perfectly inside a cube would touch the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube. That means the sphere is inscribed in the cube. So, the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is touching all the sides, its diameter can't be bigger than the cube's edge, and in this case, it's exactly the same.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 's'. Then the diameter of the sphere would be 's' as well. So, the radius of the sphere, which is half the diameter, would be s/2. Got that down.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere. The volume of the cube is straightforward\u2014it's just the edge length cubed. So that's s\u00b3.\n\nFor the sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is s/2, I can substitute that into the formula. Let me write that out: (4/3)\u03c0(s/2)\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me compute that. (s/2) cubed is s\u00b3/(2\u00b3) which is s\u00b3/8. Multiply that by 4/3 and \u03c0: so (4/3) * (s\u00b3/8) * \u03c0. Let me do the math: 4/3 times 1/8 is (4)/(24) which simplifies to 1/6. So the volume of the sphere is (1/6)\u03c0 s\u00b3.\n\nNow, the question is the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. So that's cube volume divided by sphere volume. Cube is s\u00b3, sphere is (\u03c0 s\u00b3)/6.\n\nSo the ratio is s\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 s\u00b3 /6). The s\u00b3 terms cancel out, leaving 1 divided by (\u03c0/6), which is the same as 6/\u03c0.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me double-check that calculation. So, cube volume is s\u00b3. Sphere is (4/3)\u03c0*(s/2)^3. So expanding that:\n\n(s/2)^3 = s\u00b3 / 8. So (4/3)*\u03c0*(s\u00b3/8) = (4/3)*(1/8) \u03c0 s\u00b3. 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 0.5 * (1/3) is 1/6. So yes, (1/6) \u03c0 s\u00b3.\n\nSo ratio is s\u00b3 / ( (1/6) \u03c0 s\u00b3 ) = 1 / (\u03c0/6) = 6/\u03c0.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0, which matches this ratio.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up cube to sphere. The question says the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube volume is larger, and sphere is smaller. So 6/\u03c0 is about 1.9, which makes sense because a cube can hold a sphere whose volume is about 6/\u03c0 times smaller.\n\nLooking back at the options: option D is 6: \u03c0, which is the same as 6/\u03c0. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. So the answer should be D.\n",

So the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because the sphere can't be bigger than that, otherwise it wouldn't fit.\n\nLet me break it down.

So volume of cube, V_cube = a\u00b3. \n\nNext, the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius is a/2, I'll plug that into the formula.

So the sphere's volume becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me calculate that. (a/2)\u00b3 is a\u00b3/(8), so the sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8).

So the ratio of cube volume to sphere volume is a\u00b3 : (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6). The a\u00b3 cancels out, leaving 1 : (\u03c0/6), which can be rewritten as 6:\u03c0. Wait, wait, no, wait. Because 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) is 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6/\u03c0, which is 6:\u03c0 when written as a ratio.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. Option E is 8:3. Hmm, but wait another thing. Did I get the ratio right? The question says the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube's volume is a\u00b3, sphere is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. So the ratio is a\u00b3 / (\u03c0 a\u00b3 /6 ) = 6/\u03c0. So 6:\u03c0, which is option D.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes when a sphere fits inside a cube, the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face. So that's correct because the diameter equals the edge length. But what if the sphere is the largest possible inside the cube? Yes, that's the same scenario.\n\nSo, the ratio is 6:\u03c0, which is option D. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) 2: \u03c0\nB)7:2\nC)8:2\nD)6: \u03c0\nE)8:3\n\nYes, D is 6:\u03c0. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which fits inside it, we start by noting that the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. Let the edge length of the cube be \\( a \\). The volume of the cube is then \\( a^3 \\).\n\nFor the sphere, the radius is \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\). The volume of the sphere is given by the formula \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\). Substituting \\( r = \\frac{a}{2} \\), the sphere's volume becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{a^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}.\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^3}{\\frac{\\pi a^3}{6}} = \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 6}{\\pi a^3} = \\frac{6}{\\pi}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume is \\( 6 : \\pi \\).

Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I should visualize the scenario. The sphere is perfectly fitting inside the cube, which means the sphere is inscribed in the cube. So, the sphere touches all the faces of the cube but doesn't extend beyond them. That tells me that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is inside, the maximum it can be is when its diameter is the same as the cube's side.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. So, the sphere's diameter is 'a', which means the sphere's radius is 'a/2'.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere and then find their ratio.\n\nThe volume of the cube is straightforward. It's side length cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nFor the sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is a/2, I'll substitute that in. So, V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute that. (a/2)\u00b3 is a\u00b3/(2\u00b3) which is a\u00b3/8. So, V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8). Multiplying those together: 4/3 times 1/8 is (4)/(24) which simplifies to 1/6. So, V_sphere = (1/6)\u03c0 a\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 4/3 * 1/8 is 4/(24) = 1/6. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. So, V_cube : V_sphere.\n\nV_cube is a\u00b3, V_sphere is (1/6)\u03c0 a\u00b3. So the ratio is a\u00b3 / ( (1/6) \u03c0 a\u00b3 ). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, which leaves 1 divided by (1/6 \u03c0).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this question about the ratio of the volumes of a cube and a sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I should visualize the scenario. The sphere is perfectly fitting inside the cube, which means the sphere is inscribed in the cube. So, the sphere touches all the faces of the cube but doesn't extend beyond them. That tells me that the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is inside, the maximum it can be is when its diameter is the same as the cube's side.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. So, the sphere's diameter is 'a', which means the sphere's radius is 'a/2'.\n\nNow, I need to find the volumes of both the cube and the sphere and then find their ratio.\n\nThe volume of the cube is straightforward. It's side length cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nFor the sphere, the volume formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Since the radius r is a/2, I'll substitute that in. So, V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute that. (a/2)\u00b3 is a\u00b3/(2\u00b3) which is a\u00b3/8. So, V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8). Multiplying those together: 4/3 times 1/8 is (4)/(24) which simplifies to 1/6. So, V_sphere = (1/6)\u03c0 a\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 4/3 * 1/8 is 4/(24) = 1/6. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need the ratio of the cube's volume to the sphere's volume. So, V_cube : V_sphere.\n\nV_cube is a\u00b3, V_sphere is (1/6)\u03c0 a\u00b3. So the ratio is a\u00b3 / ( (1/6) \u03c0 a\u00b3 ). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, which leaves 1 divided by (1/6 \u03c0).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 1 * (6/\u03c0) = 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0.\n\nWait, but let me look at the options. Option D is 6:\u03c0. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Did I mix up the ratio? The question says the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube's volume is larger than the sphere, so the ratio is 6:\u03c0. So yes, D is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere inscribed within it, we start by defining the edge length of the cube as \\( a \\).

So the sphere's diameter should be equal to the cube's edge length. Right, because the sphere can't be bigger than that without sticking out.\n\nWait, so let me break this down. Let's say the cube has an edge length of, I don't know, maybe 'a'. Then the sphere inside it would have a diameter equal to 'a' as well. Oh wait, because the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere's diameter is the same as the cube's side length.\n\nSo the radius of the sphere would be half of that. So radius r = a/2.\n\nNow, the volume of the cube is straightforward. It's just (edge length)^3, so a^3.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Since r is a/2, plugging that in, it becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let me compute that. (a/2)^3 is a^3/8. So multiplying by 4/3\u03c0 gives (4/3)*(\u03c0)*(a^3/8) = (4\u03c0 a^3)/(24) which simplifies to (\u03c0 a^3)/6.\n\nSo the volume of the cube is a^3, and the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a^3)/6. The ratio we're looking for is cube volume to sphere volume, which is a^3 : (\u03c0 a^3)/6.\n\nWait, but when taking the ratio, the a^3 terms cancel out. So it's 1 : (\u03c0/6). To make this a ratio without fractions, I can write it as 6 : \u03c0. Because 1/(\u03c0/6) is 6/\u03c0.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ratio is cube volume divided by sphere volume.

But wait, wait a minute, did I compute the sphere's volume correctly?\n\nWait, sphere volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. r is a/2, so r\u00b3 is a\u00b3/8. So 4/3 * \u03c0 * a\u00b3/8 = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. Correct. So cube is a\u00b3, sphere is \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. Ratio is (a\u00b3)/(\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0.
