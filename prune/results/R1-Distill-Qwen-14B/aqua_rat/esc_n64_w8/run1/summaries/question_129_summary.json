      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000 and their sum is 1000. I need to find which of the given options are the correct numbers. The options are A, B, C, D, and E. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. Let's say the two numbers are x and y. We know two things: x + y = 1000, and x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256,000. I remember that the difference of squares can be factored into (x + y)(x - y). Oh right, that's the identity: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a + b)(a - b). So maybe I can use that here.\n\nSo, substituting the given values, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 256,000. But wait, x + y is 1000. So substituting that in, I get:\n\n1000 * (x - y) = 256,000.\n\nTo find (x - y), I can divide both sides by 1000. Let's see: 256,000 divided by 1000 is 256. So, x - y = 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. x + y = 1000\n2. x - y = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's add them together. When I add equation 1 and equation 2, the y terms will cancel out.\n\nAdding:\nx + y = 1000\nx - y = 256\n-----------------\n2x = 1256\n\nSo, 2x = 1256. Dividing both sides by 2, x = 628.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So x is 628. Then to find y, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe another way: since x + y = 1000, and x is 628, then y should be 1000 - 628. Let me calculate that. 1000 - 628 is 372. So y is 372.\n\nWait, so the numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify by plugging the numbers back into the original conditions.\n\nFirst, their sum: 628 + 372 = 1000. That's correct.\n\nNow, the difference of their squares: 628\u00b2 minus 372\u00b2. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it using the identity. 628\u00b2 - 372\u00b2 = (628 + 372)(628 - 372) = (1000)(256) = 256,000. Which matches the given condition.\n\nSo yes, option B is correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me look at the options again. Option C is 640 and 360. Let me check their sum: 640 + 360 is 1000, which is correct. Now their squares: 640\u00b2 is 409600, 360\u00b2 is 129600. The difference is 409600 - 129600 = 280000. Oh wait, that's 280,000, which is larger than 256,000. So option C doesn't satisfy the condition. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption A is 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. 600\u00b2 is 360000, 400\u00b2 is 160000. Difference is 200,000. Which is less than 256,000. So that's not right.\n\nSo the only correct pair is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and the sum of the numbers is 1,000. We're supposed to find which pair of numbers from the options fits these conditions.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with squares and sums, there are some algebraic identities that might come in handy. Oh right! The difference of squares formula. The formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). That might be useful here.\n\nSo, according to the problem, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256,000, and a + b = 1,000. Wait, because the sum is given as 1,000, maybe I can plug that into the formula.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as 'a' and 'b', with a being the larger number. So, a + b = 1000. And their squares' difference is 256,000. So, using the identity:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 256,000.\n\nWe know a + b is 1000, so substituting that in:\n\n(a - b) * 1000 = 256,000.\n\nTo find (a - b), I can divide both sides by 1000:\n\na - b = 256,000 / 1000 = 256.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) a + b = 1000\n2) a - b = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add both equations together to eliminate 'b'.\n\nAdding equation 1 and 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\n2a = 1256\na = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, so a is 628? Then, since a + b is 1000, b would be 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options given.\n\nOption B is 628 and 372. So that's one of the options. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I do all the steps correctly?\n\nLet me double-check the difference of squares. a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 should be 256,000.\n\nCompute 628\u00b2 and 372\u00b2.\n\nWait, calculating squares might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute the difference without calculating both squares.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 using the values of a and b.\n\na = 628, b=372.\n\nCompute (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) using the formula (a - b)(a + b). We know a + b is 1000, and a - b is 256.\n\nSo 256 * 1000 is 256,000. That's exactly the value given in the problem. So that checks out.\n\nSo the numbers are 628 and 372, which is option B. But wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 600,400\n\nB)628,372\n\nC)640,360\n\nD) None of these\n\nE) Cannot be determined\n\nSo option B is correct. But wait, why is option C an option? Let me just think again. Did I maybe miscalculate something?\n\nWait, maybe I should verify a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 another way. Let me compute 628 squared and 372 squared.\n\n628 squared: Let's compute 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 28\u00b2 is 784. The cross term is 2*(600)*(28)=33,600. So 628\u00b2 = (600+28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 394,384.\n\n372 squared: Similarly, 372 is 370 +2. So (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 + 2\u00b2. 370\u00b2 is 136,900. 2*370*2=1,480. 2\u00b2=4. So 136,900 + 1,480 = 138,380, plus 4 is 138,384.\n\nSo a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct pair is 628 and 372, which is option B.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems might have other solutions, but in this case, the system of equations only gives one solution, so I think B is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me look at the other options just in case.\n\nOption C is 640 and 360. Let me check their sum: 640 + 360 = 1000. So the sum is correct. Now, what about their squares' difference?\n\nCompute 640\u00b2 = 409,600. 360\u00b2 = 129,600. So 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. But the problem says the difference is 256,000. So option C's difference is 280,000, which is bigger than 256,000. So option C is wrong.\n\nOption A: 600 +400=1000. So sum is right. Now, their squares: 600\u00b2=360,000; 400\u00b2=160,000. Difference is 200,000. Which is less than 256,000. So option A is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n",

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct pair is 628 and 372, which is option B.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems might have other solutions, but in this case, the system of equations only gives one solution, so I think B is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me look at the other options just in case.\n\nOption C is 640 and 360. Let me check their sum: 640 + 360 = 1000. So the sum is correct. Now, what about their squares' difference?\n\nCompute 640\u00b2 = 409,600. 360\u00b2 = 129,600. So 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. But the problem says the difference is 256,000. So option C's difference is 280,000, which is bigger than 256,000. So option C is wrong.\n\nOption A: 600 +400=1000. So sum is right. Now, their squares: 600\u00b2=360,000; 400\u00b2=160,000. Difference is 200,000. Which is less than 256,000. So option A is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers whose sum is 1,000 and whose difference of squares is 256,000. Using the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), and substituting \\(a + b = 1,000\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(a - b) \\cdot 1000 = 256,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(a - b\\), we find:\n\n\\[\na - b = \\frac{256,000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 1,000\\)\n2. \\(a - b = 256\\)\n\nAdding these equations eliminates \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1,000 + 256 \\implies 2a = 1,256 \\implies a = 628\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 628\\) into \\(a + b = 1,000\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nb = 1,000 - 628 = 372\n\\]\n\nThus, the two numbers are 628 and 372. To verify, we compute the squares:\n\n\\[\n628^2 = 394,384, \\quad 372^2 = 138,384\n\\]\n\nThe difference of squares is:\n\n\\[\n628^2 - 372^2 = 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given condition. Checking the other options:\n\n- **Option A (600, 400):** Sum is 1,000, but the difference of squares is \\(600^2 - 400^2 = 200,000\\), which is incorrect.\n- **Option C (640, 360):** Sum is 1,000, but the difference of squares is \\(640^2 - 360^2 = 280,000\\), which is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B (628, 372)**.\n\nAnswer: B",

The question says that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and the sum of the numbers is 1,000. I need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions from the given options.\n\nHmm, let me jot down what I know. Let's call the two numbers x and y, and without loss of generality, let's assume x is larger than y. So, x > y.\n\nThe first equation given is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256,000. I remember that x squared minus y squared can be factored into (x - y)(x + y). Oh wait, that's right! So x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 256,000.\n\nAnd the second equation is x + y = 1,000. Oh, so that's helpful because I can plug that into the first equation. Let me substitute x + y with 1000.\n\nSo, substituting, (x - y)(1000) = 256,000. To find x - y, I can divide both sides by 1000. Let me do that: x - y = 256,000 / 1000 = 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. x + y = 1000\n2. x - y = 256\n\nHmm, so I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add them together to eliminate y. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 1000 + 256\n2x = 1256\nSo x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nThen, substituting x back into equation 1 to find y. So y = 1000 - x = 1000 - 628 = 372.\n\nWait, so the numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372.

Let me compute that. 600 squared is 360,000. 28 squared is 784. Then, 2*600*28 = 33,600. So (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 +28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000+33,600=393,600; 393,600 +784= 394,384.\n\nNow, 372 squared. Hmm, 370 squared is 136,900. 2 squared is 4. Then, 2*370*2=1,480. So (370+2)^2 = 370\u00b2 + 2*370*2 +2\u00b2 = 136,900 + 1,480 +4 = 138,384.\n\nNow, subtracting the squares: 394,384 (628\u00b2) minus 138,384 (372\u00b2). Let's do that. 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000. Oh yeah, that's exactly the difference given in the problem. So the numbers are indeed 628 and 372. So option B is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the other options quickly. Option C is 640 and 360. Let's see their sum: 640+360=1000, so that's correct. What about their squares?\n\n640 squared is 409,600. 360 squared is 129,600. The difference is 409,600 - 129,600 = 280,000. Oh, but the given difference is 256,000, so that's wrong. So option C is not the answer.\n\nWhat about option A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000, correct. Their squares: 600\u00b2=360,000; 400\u00b2=160,000. Difference is 200,000. Which is less than 256,000.

We need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions, and the options are given as A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nHmm. Alright, so I remember from algebra that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula that can be useful. The difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, the problem gives me that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 256,000, and a + b is 1,000. Oh, right! Because the sum of the numbers is 1,000, that's a + b. So substituting into the formula, I can write:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 256,000.\n\nSince a + b is 1,000, I can plug that in:\n\n(a - b) * 1,000 = 256,000.\n\nSo to find (a - b), I can divide both sides by 1,000. Let me calculate that.\n\n256,000 divided by 1,000 is 256. So,\n\na - b = 256.\n\nWait, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. a + b = 1,000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nThese are two linear equations with two variables, so I can solve for a and b. I think the best way is to add these two equations together. Let's see:\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1,000 + 256\n2a = 1,256\nSo, a = 1,256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, so a is 628.

Let's calculate that.\n\n628 * 628. Hmm, that's a bit big. Alternatively, I can compute 600\u00b2 is 360,000, 28\u00b2 is 784, and the cross term is 2*600*28 = 33,600. So (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000 + 33,600 is 393,600, plus 784 is 394,384. So a\u00b2 is 394,384.\n\nb is 372. So b\u00b2 is 372 squared. Let's compute that. 300\u00b2 is 90,000, 72\u00b2 is 5,184, and cross term 2*300*72=43,200. So (300+72)^2 = 90,000 +43,200 +5,184 = 138,384. \n\nNow, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 394,384 - 138,384. Let's subtract: 394,384 minus 138,384 equals 256,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd the sum is 628 + 372 = 1,000.

The difference is 409600-129600=280,000. Which is more than 256,000, so option C doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 400\u00b2 is 160,000. Difference is 200,000.

We need to find which pair of numbers fits these conditions, and the options are given as A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nHmm. Alright, so I remember from algebra that when dealing with the difference of squares, there's a formula that can be useful. The difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nWait, the problem gives me that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 256,000, and a + b is 1,000. Oh, right! Because the sum of the numbers is 1,000, that's a + b. So substituting into the formula, I can write:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 256,000.\n\nSince a + b is 1,000, I can plug that in:\n\n(a - b) * 1,000 = 256,000.\n\nSo to find (a - b), I can divide both sides by 1,000. Let me calculate that.\n\n256,000 divided by 1,000 is 256. So,\n\na - b = 256.\n\nWait, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. a + b = 1,000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nThese are two linear equations with two variables, so I can solve for a and b. I think the best way is to add these two equations together. Let's see:\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1,000 + 256\n2a = 1,256\nSo, a = 1,256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, so a is 628. Then I can find b by plugging back into equation 1.\n\n628 + b = 1,000\nb = 1,000 - 628 = 372.\n\nSo the numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options given. Option B is 628 and 372, so that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the difference of squares. a\u00b2 is 628 squared. Let's calculate that.\n\n628 * 628. Hmm, that's a bit big. Alternatively, I can compute 600\u00b2 is 360,000, 28\u00b2 is 784, and the cross term is 2*600*28 = 33,600. So (600+28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 360,000 + 33,600 is 393,600, plus 784 is 394,384. So a\u00b2 is 394,384.\n\nb is 372. So b\u00b2 is 372 squared. Let's compute that. 300\u00b2 is 90,000, 72\u00b2 is 5,184, and cross term 2*300*72=43,200. So (300+72)^2 = 90,000 +43,200 +5,184 = 138,384. \n\nNow, a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is 394,384 - 138,384. Let's subtract: 394,384 minus 138,384 equals 256,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd the sum is 628 + 372 = 1,000. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 640 and 360. Let me check their sum: 640 +360=1000. Their squares: 640\u00b2 is 409,600. 360\u00b2 is 129,600. The difference is 409600-129600=280,000. Which is more than 256,000, so option C doesn't fit.\n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Sum is 1000. 600\u00b2 is 360,000. 400\u00b2 is 160,000. Difference is 200,000. Not matching.\n\nOption B: 628 and 372. As we saw, their squares' difference is 256,000, so that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the difference of squares formula:  \n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). \\]  \nGiven that \\( a^2 - b^2 = 256,000 \\) and \\( a + b = 1,000 \\), we substitute \\( a + b = 1,000 \\) into the formula:  \n\\[\n(a - b)(1,000) = 256,000.\n\\]  \nDividing both sides by 1,000 gives:  \n\\[\na - b = 256.\n\\]  \nNow, we have two equations:  \n1. \\( a + b = 1,000 \\)  \n2. \\( a - b = 256 \\).  \n\nAdding these two equations:  \n\\[\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1,000 + 256 \\implies 2a = 1,256 \\implies a = \\frac{1,256}{2} = 628.\n\\]  \nSubstituting \\( a = 628 \\) into \\( a + b = 1,000 \\):  \n\\[\n628 + b = 1,000 \\implies b = 1,000 - 628 = 372.\n\\]  \nThus, the numbers are \\( a = 628 \\) and \\( b = 372 \\).  \n\nTo verify, calculate \\( a^2 - b^2 \\):  \n\\[\na^2 = 628^2 = 394,384, \\quad b^2 = 372^2 = 138,384.\n\\]  \n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = 394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000.\n\\]  \nThe conditions are satisfied. Checking the options, the correct pair is \\( 628 \\) and \\( 372 \\), which corresponds to option B.  \n\nOptions A, C, and others do not satisfy the conditions, confirming that the correct answer is:  \n**Answer: B**",

Let me denote the two numbers as x and y, where x is larger than y. So, the sum is x + y = 1000. The difference of their squares is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256,000.\n\nWait, I remember that x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 can be factored into (x - y)(x + y). Oh, right! So that might be helpful here.

So (600+28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 + 28\u00b2 = 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 394,384.\n\ny is 372: 372 squared. Let's compute that. 300\u00b2 is 90,000. 72\u00b2 is 5,184.

Oh wait, yes, because a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 equals (a + b)(a - b). So maybe I can use that here.\n\nGiven that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256000 and a + b = 1000. So if I let S = a + b and D = a - b, then the difference of squares is S*D. So here, S is 1000 and S*D = 256000. So I can solve for D.\n\nLet me compute D. D = 256000 / S = 256000 / 1000. Let's see, 256000 divided by 1000 is 256. So D is 256.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me add them together. Adding equation 1 and 2 gives:\n\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256\n2a = 1256\nSo a = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that calculation. 1000 + 256 is 1256. Divided by 2 is 628. So a is 628.\n\nThen to find b, I subtract equation 2 from equation 1. So:\n\n(a + b) - (a - b) = 1000 - 256\n2b = 744\nSo b = 744 / 2 = 372.\n\nHmm, so the two numbers are 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is 628 and 372. So that's the correct pair.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute the squares and check the difference.\n\n628 squared: let's see, 600\u00b2 is 360000. 28\u00b2 is 784. The cross term is 2*(600)*(28) = 33600. So 628\u00b2 = (600 + 28)\u00b2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 +28\u00b2 = 360000 + 33600 + 784 = 360000+33600 is 393600, plus 784 is 394384.\n\n372 squared: similarly, 300\u00b2 is 90000. 72\u00b2 is 5184. Cross term 2*300*72 = 43200. So 372\u00b2 = (300 +72)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*72 +72\u00b2 = 90000 + 43200 +5184. 90000 +43200 is 133200, plus 5184 is 138384.\n\nNow subtract the two squares: 394384 - 138384 = 256000. Yep, that's correct. So the difference is indeed 256000, and the sum is 628 + 372 = 1000. So the answer must be option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers whose difference of squares is 256000 and whose sum is 1000. Let the numbers be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with \\(a > b\\). Using the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\), and substituting the given values:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 1000\\)\n2. \\(a^2 - b^2 = 256000\\)\n\nFrom the second equation, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\), and since \\(a + b = 1000\\), we can solve for \\(a - b\\):\n\\[\na - b = \\frac{256000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\\[\na + b = 1000 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a - b = 256\n\\]\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256 \\implies 2a = 1256 \\implies a = \\frac{1256}{2} = 628\n\\]\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(a + b) - (a - b) = 1000 - 256 \\implies 2b = 744 \\implies b = \\frac{744}{2} = 372\n\\]\n\nThus, the two numbers are \\(628\\) and \\(372\\). Verifying the squares:\n\\[\n628^2 = 394384, \\quad 372^2 = 138384, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 394384 - 138384 = 256000\n\\]\nThe difference of squares matches the given value, and their sum is \\(628 + 372 = 1000\\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

Let me subtract that. 394384 minus 138384.\n\n394384 - 100000 = 294384\n294384 - 38384 = 256,000. Oh yes! That's correct.\n\nSo, the numbers are 628 and 372, which is option B. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option C is 640 and 360. Let me quickly check their squares.\n\n640\u00b2 is 409,600. 360\u00b2 is 129,600. The difference is 409600 - 129600 = 280,000. But the given difference is 256,000, so option C is not correct.\n\nWhat about option A: 600 and 400. 600\u00b2 is 360,000; 400\u00b2 is 160,000. Difference is 200,000. Not matching.\n\nOption D is none of these. But we have option B, which works. So D is not correct. Option E says cannot be determined. But we did find specific numbers, so E is not correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding two numbers whose difference of squares is 256,000 and whose sum is 1000. Using the difference of squares formula, \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\), and substituting \\(a + b = 1000\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(a - b)(1000) = 256,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(a - b\\), we divide both sides by 1000:\n\n\\[\na - b = \\frac{256,000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(a + b = 1000\\)\n2. \\(a - b = 256\\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\n\\[\n(a + b) + (a - b) = 1000 + 256 \\implies 2a = 1256 \\implies a = \\frac{1256}{2} = 628\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 628\\) into \\(a + b = 1000\\):\n\n\\[\n628 + b = 1000 \\implies b = 1000 - 628 = 372\n\\]\n\nThus, the numbers are 628 and 372. Verifying their squares:\n\n\\[\n628^2 = 394,384, \\quad 372^2 = 138,384\n\\]\n\nThe difference is:\n\n\\[\n394,384 - 138,384 = 256,000\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given condition. Checking the options, the correct pair is 628 and 372, which corresponds to **Option B**. Other options do not satisfy the conditions.\n\nAnswer: B",
