      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a worker's wages over a fortnight, which is 15 days. The average wage per day is $90. Hmm, so the total wages for the fortnight must be 15 days multiplied by $90. Let me calculate that. 15 times 90 is 1350. So the total wage is $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, his average was $87 per day. So the total for the first week is 7 times 87. Let me do that: 7 * 87. Hmm, 7*80 is 560, and 7*7 is 49. So 560 +49 is 609. So first 7 days total $609.\n\nThen, the average during the last 7 days was $92 per day. So the total for the last 7 days is 7 *92. Let me compute that. 7*90 is 630, and 7*2 is 14, so 630+14=644. So last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days, so if I add the first 7 days and the last 7 days, that's 14 days. So what about the 8th day? That's the middle day, the 8th. So the total of the first 7 plus the 8th day plus the last 7 days equals the total of 15 days.\n\nSo the total for first 7 is 609, last 7 is 644. Together, that's 609 +644. Let me add that: 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. Wait, but the total for 15 days is 1350, right? So 1350 minus 1253 equals the wage on the 8th day.\n\n1350 minus 1253: let's see, 1350 minus 1200 is 150, then minus 53 more. So 150-53=97.

Let me compute that: 90 * 15. Well, 90 times 10 is 900, and 90 times 5 is 450, so together that's 1350.

Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe average wage per day was $90 for all 15 days. So first, I think I should calculate the total wages for the entire period. Since average is total divided by the number of days, the total should be 15 days multiplied by $90. Let me do that math: 15 * 90. Hmm, 15 times 90 is 1350. So the total wages over the 15 days are $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, the average was $87 per day. So the total for the first 7 days would be 7 * 87. Let me calculate that. 7 times 80 is 560, and 7 times 7 is 49, so 560 +49 = 609. So first 7 days total $609.\n\nSimilarly, the last 7 days have an average of $92 per day. So their total is 7 * 92. Let me compute that. 7 times 90 is 630, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 630 +14= 644. So last 7 days total $644.\n\nWait, but the fortnight is 15 days. So the days are split into first 7, then the 8th day, then the last 7. Oh, right, so the 8th day is the middle day. So the total of the first 7 is $609, the last 7 is $644, and the 8th day is the remaining one day.\n\nSo the total of the first 7 and the last 7 is 609 + 644. Let me add those. 600 + 600 is 1200, 9 +44 is 53, so total is 1253. But wait, the total for all 15 days is 1350. So the 8th day's wage is 1350 - (609 +644). \n\nWait, 609 + 644. Let me compute that again. 600 + 600 = 1200, 9 +44=53. So 1253. So 1350 - 1253 is 97. So the wage on the 8th day must be $97.\n\nLooking at the options, D is $97. So the answer should be D.\n",

So the 8th day's wage must account for the difference. So 1350 minus 1253 equals... 97. Oh, wait, 1253 plus 97 is 1350. So the wage on the 8th day is $97.\n\nLet me double-check. First 7 days: 609, last 7: 644, so together 1253. 1350 minus 1253 is 97. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be D, which is $97.\n\n\nTo determine the worker's wage on the 8th day, we calculate the total wages for the fortnight and subtract the wages of the first 7 days and the last 7 days.\n\n1. **Total wages for 15 days**:  \n   The average wage per day is $90, so the total wages are:  \n   \\[\n   15 \\times 90 = 1350 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total wages for the first 7 days**:  \n   The average wage during the first 7 days is $87, so the total wages are:  \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 87 = 609 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total wages for the last 7 days**:  \n   The average wage during the last 7 days is $92, so the total wages are:  \n   \\[\n   7 \\times 92 = 644 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Wage on the 8th day**:  \n   The total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days are:  \n   \\[\n   609 + 644 = 1253 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]  \n   Subtracting this from the total wages for the fortnight gives the wage on the 8th day:  \n   \\[\n   1350 - 1253 = 97 \\, \\text{\\$}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the wage on the 8th day is **$97**.\n\nAnswer: D",
