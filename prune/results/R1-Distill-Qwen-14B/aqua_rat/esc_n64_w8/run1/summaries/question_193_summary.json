      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a two-digit number. Hmm, two-digit numbers have a ten's place and a unit's place. So the number can be represented as 10*a + b, where a is the digit in the ten's place and b is the unit's digit. \n\nThe problem states two main conditions. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number itself minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let me write that down. So, (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18. Simplifying that, 10a + b -a -b is 9a. So 9a = 18. Oh, that's straightforward. Dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. So the ten's digit is 2. \n\nThe second condition says that the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. So, b = 2*a. Since we found a is 2, then b would be 2*2 = 4. \n\nPutting it all together, the number is 10a + b = 10*2 +4 = 24. So looking at the options, option B is 24. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The number is 24. The sum of its digits is 2 +4=6. The number minus the sum is 24-6=18, which matches the first condition. And the unit digit is 4, which is double the ten's digit 2. Yep, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options: A is 12, but 12's digits sum to 3. 12-3=9, not 18. So no. B is 24, which works. C is 42. Let's see, 42- (4+2)=42-6=36, which is more than 18. So no. D is 48. 4+8=12, 48-12=36 again. E is 49, sum 13, 49-13=36. So none of the others fit. So the answer must be B, 24.\n",

Oh, and the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a two-digit number represents. The number can be written as 10*a + b, where a is the digit in the ten's place and b is the digit in the unit's place. So, for example, if a is 3 and b is 4, the number is 34.\n\nThe first condition is that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So the sum of the digits is a + b. The number itself is 10a + b. So the equation would be:\n\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18\n\nLet me write that down: 10a + b = a + b + 18.\n\nWait, if I subtract (a + b) from both sides, that would be 10a + b - a - b = 18. Simplifying that, 9a = 18. Oh, so a = 18 / 9 = 2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nBut wait, there's a second condition: the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So b = 2 * a. Since a is 2, then b = 4.\n\nSo the number would be 10*2 + 4 = 24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's plug this back into the original condition. The number is 24. The sum of the digits is 2 + 4 = 6. Does 24 exceed 6 by 18? Yes, because 6 + 18 = 24. So that works.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, there's also 42 and 48. Did I make a mistake? Let me think again. Maybe I misapplied the conditions.\n\nWait, the first condition is the number is 18 more than the sum of its digits. So for 24: sum is 6, 6 +18=24. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another option just to be sure. Let's take option C: 42. The sum of digits is 4+2=6. 6+18=24, which is not 42. So no. Option D: 48. Sum is 4+8=12. 12 +18=30, not 48. Option E: 49. Sum is 4+9=13. 13+18=31, no. Option A:12. Sum is 1+2=3. 3+18=21, which is not 12. So only option B fits.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The problem says the number exceeds the sum by 18. So number = sum +18. Which is what I used. So my approach is correct.\n\nSo the answer must be B)24.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it. It's about a two-digit number. The problem says two main things. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Second, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find which number fits these conditions from the given options.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. Let me think about how two-digit numbers work. A two-digit number can be represented as 10*a + b, where a is the digit in the tens place and b is the digit in the units place. So, for example, if the number is 34, a is 3 and b is 4.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nNumber = (Sum of digits) + 18.\n\nThe number is 10a + b, and the sum of digits is a + b. So plugging that in:\n\n10a + b = (a + b) + 18.\n\nLet me write that equation down: 10a + b = a + b + 18.\n\nWait, if I subtract (a + b) from both sides, I get 9a = 18. So 9a = 18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives a = 2. Oh, so the tens digit is 2. That's helpful.\n\nThe second condition says the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So, b = 2*a. Since a is 2, then b = 4. So the digits are a=2 and b=4. Therefore, the number is 24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2 + 4 = 6. The number (24) minus the sum (6) should be 18. 24 -6 is 18. Yes, that's correct. So 24 fits the first condition.\n\nBut wait, I should look at the options. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49. So 24 is option B. But wait, let me think again. Did I do the equation correctly?\n\nWait, when I set up the equation: 10a + b = (a + b) +18. Let me simplify that. 10a + b = a + b +18. Subtract a and b from both sides: 9a =18. So a=2. That's correct. Then b=2a=4. So the number is 24, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, another option is 42, option C. Let me see if 42 fits the conditions. The sum of digits is 4+2=6. 42 -6=36, which is more than 18. So that doesn't fit. So 42 is out.\n\nWait, another thought. What if I made a mistake in interpreting the problem? The number exceeds the sum by 18, so number = sum +18. So 10a + b = (a + b) +18. Which gives 9a=18, so a=2. So that's correct. So the number is 24, option B.\n\nBut let me also check the other options just to be thorough. Let's see:\n\nOption A: 12. Sum is 1+2=3. 12-3=9, not 18. So no.\n\nOption C:42. As I said, 42-6=36, which is way too big. So no.\n\nOption D:48. Sum is 4+8=12. 48-12=36, again nope.\n\nOption E:49. Sum is 4+9=13. 49-13=36. No.\n\nSo only option B fits. So the answer should be B)24.\n",

I need to find which number it is among the options given.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, it's a two-digit number. Let's think about how two-digit numbers are structured.

I need to find which number it is, and the options are given as A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, it's a two-digit number, so it's something like AB, where A is the ten's digit and B is the unit's digit. So the actual number would be 10*A + B.\n\nThe problem states two main conditions. The first condition is that the number itself exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nNumber = 10A + B\nSum of digits = A + B\nSo, condition 1: 10A + B = (A + B) + 18\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10A + B - A - B = 18 \u2192 9A = 18 \u2192 A = 2.\n\nWait, so A is 2?

Let me plug the number back into the first condition to verify.\n\nThe number is 24. Sum of digits is 2 + 4 =6. The number (24) minus the sum (6) should be 18. 24 -6 is 18, yes. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options too, just in case I missed something. Maybe there's another number that fits.\n\nLooking at option C)42. Let's see. The digits are 4 and 2. The unit digit is 2, which should be double the ten's digit (4). But 2 is not double of 4. So condition 2 is not met. So 42 is out.\n\nOption D)48. Digits 4 and 8. 8 is double of 4? Yes, because 4*2=8. So condition 2 is satisfied. Now, condition 1: number minus sum of digits equals 18. 48 - (4+8)=48-12=36. 36 is not 18, so condition 1 fails. So D isn't the answer.\n\nOption E)49. Digits 4 and9. 9 is not double of4 (since 4*2=8). So condition 2 fails.\n\nOption A)12. Digits 1 and 2. 2 is double of1, so condition 2 holds. Now condition 1: 12 - (1+2) =12-3=9. 9 is not 18. So condition 1 fails.\n\nSo the only number that satisfies both conditions is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated A=2, I got 24. So that's correct. But why is option D)48 not working? Because when I plug in 48, the sum is 12, and 48-12=36, which is more than 18. So it's not the right number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B)24.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. I need to find which number it is, and the options are given as A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, it's a two-digit number, so it's something like AB, where A is the ten's digit and B is the unit's digit. So the actual number would be 10*A + B.\n\nThe problem states two main conditions. The first condition is that the number itself exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, the number minus the sum of its digits equals 18. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nNumber = 10A + B\nSum of digits = A + B\nSo, condition 1: 10A + B = (A + B) + 18\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10A + B - A - B = 18 \u2192 9A = 18 \u2192 A = 2.\n\nWait, so A is 2? Let me check that. If 9A = 18, then yes, A is 2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nThe second condition is that the unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So B = 2*A. Since A is 2, B should be 4. So the number would be 24. Let me check if that's one of the options. Option B is 24, so that's a possibility.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug the number back into the first condition to verify.\n\nThe number is 24. Sum of digits is 2 + 4 =6. The number (24) minus the sum (6) should be 18. 24 -6 is 18, yes. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options too, just in case I missed something. Maybe there's another number that fits.\n\nLooking at option C)42. Let's see. The digits are 4 and 2. The unit digit is 2, which should be double the ten's digit (4). But 2 is not double of 4. So condition 2 is not met. So 42 is out.\n\nOption D)48. Digits 4 and 8. 8 is double of 4? Yes, because 4*2=8. So condition 2 is satisfied. Now, condition 1: number minus sum of digits equals 18. 48 - (4+8)=48-12=36. 36 is not 18, so condition 1 fails. So D isn't the answer.\n\nOption E)49. Digits 4 and9. 9 is not double of4 (since 4*2=8). So condition 2 fails.\n\nOption A)12. Digits 1 and 2. 2 is double of1, so condition 2 holds. Now condition 1: 12 - (1+2) =12-3=9. 9 is not 18. So condition 1 fails.\n\nSo the only number that satisfies both conditions is 24, which is option B.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated A=2, I got 24. So that's correct. But why is option D)48 not working? Because when I plug in 48, the sum is 12, and 48-12=36, which is more than 18.

I need to find what the number is, and the options are given as A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. I think I should represent the two-digit number in terms of its digits. So, a two-digit number can be written as 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit. Let me denote the ten's digit as 't' and the unit's digit as 'u'. So the number itself is 10t + u.\n\nThe first condition says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. That means the number is equal to the sum of its digits plus 18. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n10t + u = (t + u) + 18\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. Exceeds the sum by 18. So number = sum +18. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimplifying that equation: 10t + u = t + u +18. Let's subtract (t + u) from both sides. So 9t =18. Oh, that's easy. So 9t=18 implies t=2. So the ten's digit is 2.\n\nBut wait, there's another condition. The unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So u = 2 * t. Since t is 2, u would be 4. So the number is 10*2 +4 =24. Let me check the options. Option B is 24, so that's one possibility.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not sure. Let me verify the conditions with 24. Sum of digits is 2+4=6. The number is 24, which should exceed 6 by 18. 6+18=24, yes that's correct. So 24 fits.\n\nBut wait, are there other options that might also fit?

Did I miss any other possible numbers? Let's see. The way I set up the equation, t was 2. So the ten's digit is 2, and the unit is 4, making 24. But wait, what if the ten's digit was something else? Let me re-examine the first equation.\n\nThe first equation was 10t +u = (t + u) +18. Simplifying, 9t =18, so t=2. So that's fixed. So the ten's digit is definitely 2, and unit's is 4.
