      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by setting up an equation based on the problem statement. Let me denote the unknown number as 'x'. The problem says that when 30 is subtracted from this number, it becomes one third of the original number. So, the equation would be x minus 30 equals one third of x. \n\nWait, let me write that down: x - 30 = (1/3)x. Okay, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for x. How do I do that? I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side.\n\nSo, x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. Wait, maybe I should subtract (1/3)x from both sides first. Let me think again. Starting from x - 30 = (1/3)x. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides: x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. \n\nWait, x minus (1/3)x is the same as (2/3)x, right? Because 1 minus 1/3 is 2/3. So the equation becomes (2/3)x - 30 = 0. \n\nNow, I can add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So (2/3)x = 30. To solve for x, I multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So x = 30 * (3/2). \n\nLet me calculate that. 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. So x equals 45. \n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the initial equation is correct: x - 30 = (1/3)x. Subtracting (1/3)x gives (2/3)x = 30. Multiply both sides by 3/2, x=45. Yep, that looks right.\n\nNow the question is asking for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half. So half of 45 is 22.5. Let me see the options. Option A is 22.5. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. Sometimes wording can be tricky. The problem says when 30 is subtracted from the number, it is reduced to its one third. So the new value after subtraction is one third of the original. So yes, x-30 = (1/3)x. That part seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could it mean that the number is reduced by one third, but that's a different interpretation. Wait, no. The problem says it's reduced to its one third, which implies that the result is exactly one third of the original. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n",

The problem is: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" And there are five options provided.\n\nHmm, so let's break it down. The problem mentions a number, let's call it x, I guess. When we subtract 30 from this number, it becomes one third of the original number. So mathematically, that would translate to x minus 30 equals (1/3) of x. So the equation is x - 30 = (1/3)x. \n\nWait, right. So I need to solve for x first. Once I find x, I can then find 50% of it, which is the same as half of x, right? So the plan is to solve for x and then compute x/2.\n\nAlright, let's write that equation again: x - 30 = (1/3)x. I think I can solve this by getting all the x terms on one side. Let me subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms together. \n\nSo, x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0. Simplifying the left side, x is the same as (3/3)x, so (3/3)x - (1/3)x is (2/3)x. So the equation becomes (2/3)x - 30 = 0.\n\nNow, I can add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with x. That gives me (2/3)x = 30. To solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So x equals 30 multiplied by (3/2). \n\nLet me compute that: 30 * (3/2) is the same as (30/2)*3, which is 15 *3 = 45.

What is the value of 50% of that number?\" The options are A to E, with numbers like 22.5, 84, 21, etc.\n\nHmm. So, let's break this down. There's a number, let's call it x. When 30 is subtracted from x, the result is a third of the original number. So, mathematically, that would be x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. Or, in equation form: x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait, right. So I can set up the equation like that. Now, I need to solve for x. Let me write that out:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nHmm, okay, to solve for x, I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side. So subtracting (1/3)x from both sides gives:\n\nx - (1/3)x - 30 = 0.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to bring all x terms to one side. So, x minus (1/3)x is (2/3)x, right? Because 1x is the same as 3/3 x, so 3/3 x minus 1/3 x is 2/3 x. So:\n\n(2/3)x - 30 = 0.\n\nNow, add 30 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n(2/3)x = 30.\n\nTo solve for x, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2.\n\nx = 30 * (3/2) = ?\n\nCalculating that: 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. 2/3 of x is 30, so x is (30) * (3/2) which is 45. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the original number is 45.

The problem says that subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third of itself. So, x -30 = x/3. That's what I did. Let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly.\n\nWait, the way it's phrased is: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So, when you subtract 30, the number becomes one third of what it was.

Or wait, perhaps it's easier to first subtract (1/3)x from both sides. Let's see:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30.\n\nWait, because if I have x minus 30 equals (1/3)x, then moving (1/3)x to the left and the 30 to the right would give x - (1/3)x = 30. That makes sense.\n\nSimplifying the left side: x is the same as (3/3)x, so (3/3)x minus (1/3)x is (2/3)x. So (2/3)x = 30.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2). So x = 30 * (3/2). Let me calculate that: 30 times 3 is 90, divided by 2 is 45.

This can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx - 30 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3}x = 30\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 30 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nThe number is 45. The problem asks for 50% of this number, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50}{100} \\times 45 = \\frac{45}{2} = 22.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of 50% of the number is **22.5**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?\" And then there are the options A to E.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find the original number first, right? Because once I have that, finding 50% of it should be straightforward.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's call the number 'x'. According to the problem, when we subtract 30 from this number x, the result is one third of x. So the equation would be x - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Because if you subtract 30, it becomes one third of itself. So yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo I can write the equation as x - 30 = (1/3)x. Now, I need to solve for x.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get x - (1/3)x - 30 = 0.\n\nWait, that's the same as (2/3)x - 30 = 0. Because x is 3/3 x, so 3/3 x - 1/3 x is 2/3 x.\n\nSo, (2/3)x = 30. Now, to find x, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2.\n\nSo, x = 30 * (3/2). Let me compute that. 30 divided by 2 is 15, multiplied by 3 is 45. So x is 45.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If x is 45, subtracting 30 gives 15. Is 15 equal to one third of 45? Yes, because one third of 45 is 15. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the question asks for 50% of that number. 50% is the same as half, so half of 45 is 22.5. But wait, looking at the options, option A is 22.5. But I'm seeing the options again.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The options are A)22.5, B)84, C)21, D)24, E)25. So A is 22.5, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm thinking, did I make a mistake in the setup? Because sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me re-examine the wording.\n\nThe problem says, \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the way I interpreted it is correct: subtracting 30 reduces the number to a third of itself. So x -30 = x/3.\n\nAlternatively, could the problem be interpreted as 30 is subtracted from the number, and the result is a third of the original number? Yes, that's exactly what I did. So my setup is correct.\n\nSo the number is 45, and 50% of that is 22.5, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option B is 84. Did I miss something? Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate x.\n\nThe equation is x -30 = (1/3)x.\n\nSo, moving (1/3)x to the left: x - (1/3)x =30.\n\nWhich is (2/3)x =30.\n\nThen, x = 30 * (3/2) = 45. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but if the problem had said \"the number is reduced by a third when 30 is subtracted,\" that would be different. Because reducing by a third would mean x - (x/3) = 2x/3, which is the same as the original equation. So I think I did it right.\n\nSo 50% of 45 is 22.5, which is option A. But looking at the options, I see that 22.5 is A, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the options might not include the correct answer. But in this case, A is present.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\"\n\nWait, does it mean that after subtracting 30, the number is one third of what it was before? So original number is x, x -30 is (1/3)x.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So x=45, 50% is 22.5.\n\nWait, but why is option B 84? Could there be a different interpretation?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was read incorrectly. Let me read the problem again: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\"\n\nAnother interpretation could be that subtracting 30 makes the number become a third of what it was before. Which is what I did. So x -30 = x/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might misinterpret it as the result being a third of 30. But that wouldn't make sense. Because 30 is being subtracted, so that can't be.\n\nSo I think my approach is correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 22.5, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking again, the options: A is 22.5, B is 84, etc. So why is 84 an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that when 30 is subtracted, the number becomes one third less than itself. Oh wait, no. If it's reduced to its one third, that's the same as saying it's one third of the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that I set x -30 = x/3, but perhaps it's 30 subtracted from the number, making it 1/3 of 30? No, that doesn't make sense because 30 is subtracted from x, so the result is x-30, which is 1/3 of x.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that 30 is subtracted, and the result is 1/3 of the original number. Which is how I interpreted it. So I think I'm correct.\n\nSo the answer is 22.5, which is option A.\n",
