      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about Julie's yard. Let me see what it's asking. The yard is rectangular, right? So I remember that the area of a rectangle is length times width. The problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Hmm, wait, does it specify whether that's the length or the width? Oh, wait, no. It just says one side is 100 feet wide. So I think in rectangles, the opposite sides are equal, so the two sides opposite each other are the same. But in terms of area, it doesn't matter which one you call length or width because it's just two dimensions multiplied together.\n\nThe total area is 3,000 square feet. So I need to find the length of the other side. Let's think about the formula. Area equals length multiplied by width. So if one side is 100 feet, then the other side must be such that when multiplied by 100, it gives 3,000.\n\nWait, so if I have 100 feet as one side, let's call that the width. Then the area is width multiplied by length. So 3000 = 100 * length. To find the length, I can rearrange the formula. Length equals area divided by width. So 3000 divided by 100 is 30. So the length would be 30 feet. Let me check the options. Option A is 30 feet, so that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the sides right? Because sometimes people get confused between length and width. But in the problem, it just says one side is 100 feet wide. So if the width is 100, then the other side is length. So yeah, 30 feet. So the other side is 30, which is option A.\n",

If 100 feet were the length, then the width would be 30. But the problem says one side is 100 feet wide, so that's definitely the width. So the other side is the length, which is 30 feet. So option A is correct.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the other side of Julie's yard, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}.\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the area is 3,000 square feet and one side (the width) is 100 feet. Rearranging the formula to solve for the length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{width}} = \\frac{3,000}{100} = 30 \\, \\text{feet}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the other side is 30 feet. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

The yard is rectangular, one side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. I need to find the length of the other side.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. The formula is Area = length \u00d7 width. So in this case, they're giving me the area and one of the sides, and I need to find the other.\n\nWait, the problem says one side is 100 feet wide. So that's either the length or the width. Since it's a rectangle, it doesn't matter which one is which because the formula is the same. But the term 'width' is usually used for the shorter side, but I don't think that matters here. Anyway, moving on.\n\nSo, area is 3,000 square feet. Let me write down what I know:\n\nArea = 3,000 sq ft\nOne side (let's say width) = 100 feet\n\nWe need to find the other side, which would be the length. So, plugging into the formula:\n\n3,000 = length \u00d7 100\n\nTo find the length, I should rearrange the formula. So, length = area / width.\n\nWait, yeah, that makes sense. So:\n\nlength = 3000 / 100\n\nLet me do that division. 3,000 divided by 100. Hmm, 100 goes into 3000 thirty times because 100 times 30 is 3,000. So the length is 30 feet?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 30 feet. That seems right. But wait, let me think again. Did I mix up length and width? Oh, wait, in this problem, they called one side 100 feet wide, so that's the width. The other side would be the length. So yeah, 30 feet.\n\nLet me check the options again. Option A is 30. That's the first choice. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Another way to look at it: If the width is 100 feet, and the area is 3,000, then the length is 30. But 100 is a longer side. Wait, 30 feet is shorter than 100. So does that make sense? Because sometimes, people might get confused whether it's length or width, but in reality, it doesn't matter which is which because multiplication is commutative. So 100 * 30 is the same as 30 * 100, both give 3,000. So yeah, the other side is 30 feet.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A)30 feet.\n",
