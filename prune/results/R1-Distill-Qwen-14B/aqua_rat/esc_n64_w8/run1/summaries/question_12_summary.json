      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I've got this problem about a factory producing staplers. Hmm, so the question is about figuring out how many staplers were produced on Monday. The problem gives a few percentages and some numbers, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the problem states that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. That means 90% were non-defective, right? Because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So if I let the total number of staplers be some number, say N, then the defective ones would be 0.10*N, and the non-defective ones would be 0.90*N.\n\nWait, the next part says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh, so these are good staplers that were wrongly rejected. And it's given that 72 of these non-defective were rejected. So, 2% of the non-defective equals 72.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me define the non-defective staplers as ND. So ND = 0.90 * N. Then, 2% of ND is 72. So 0.02 * ND = 72.\n\nSubstituting ND from earlier, that's 0.02 * (0.90*N) =72. Let me compute that. 0.02 *0.90 is 0.018. So 0.018*N =72. To find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018.\n\nSo N =72 / 0.018. Let me compute that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Well, 0.018 is 18 thousandths, so dividing by 18/1000 is the same as multiplying by 1000/18. So 72 * (1000/18) = (72/18)*1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 * 1000 is 4000. So N is 4000?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 4000. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes these problems can trick you.\n\nSo let me go through it again. 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. 2% of non-defective are rejected, and that's 72. So 0.02 * (0.9N) =72. So 0.018N=72. N=72/0.018. Yes, 72 divided by 0.018 is indeed 4000.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says 2% of non-defective were rejected. So if N is 4000, then non-defective is 3600 (since 4000*0.9=3600). 2% of 3600 is 72, which matches. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 4,000.\n",

The question is about finding the total number of staplers produced on Monday given some percentages about defective and rejected ones.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The problem says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, if I denote the total number of staplers as N, then the number of defective ones is 0.10 * N. That makes sense because 10% is the same as 0.1 in decimal form.\n\nSince the rest aren't defective, the non-defective staplers would be 90% of N. So non-defective = N - defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N.\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh right, so these are good staplers that were mistakenly rejected. So the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 2% of 0.90N. \n\nThe problem states that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So I can set up an equation here. The number of rejected non-defective staplers is 2% of the non-defective ones. So 2% of 0.90N equals 72.\n\nLet me write that out: 0.02 * 0.90N = 72.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018. So 0.018 * N = 72. To find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018.\n\nSo N = 72 / 0.018. Let me compute that. 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.018 goes into 72 how many times? Let me think in terms of fractions. 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so dividing by 18/1000 is the same as multiplying by 1000/18. \n\nSo 72 * (1000/18) = (72/18) * 1000. 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 * 1000 equals 4000. So N is 4000.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option A is 4,000, which would make sense. But wait, let me double-check my math because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate N: 0.02 * 0.90N =72. So 0.018N=72. N=72/0.018. 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nWait, 0.018 times 4000 is 72? Let's see: 0.018 * 4000. 4000 * 0.01 is 40, 4000 *0.008 is 32. So 40 +32=72. Yes, that's correct.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a factory producing staplers, and I need to figure out how many were made in a day. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nAlright, the problem says that 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So out of all the staplers made, 10% are defective, and the remaining 90% are non-defective. Got that part.\n\nThen, it says that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh right, so not all the non-defective ones were accepted. Some were wrongly rejected. And the problem gives a specific number: 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So that 2% equals 72.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of staplers produced that day. The options are from 4,000 up to 5,000, so it's a matter of figuring out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, let me think about this step by step. I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's denote the total number of staplers produced as T. So T is what we're trying to find.\n\nOf these T staplers, 10% are defective. That means the number of defective staplers is 0.10 * T. So the non-defective ones are the rest, which would be 90% of T, right? So non-defective = 0.90 * T.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected. So the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected is 2% of 0.90T. And according to the problem, this equals 72. So I can set up an equation for that.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nRejected = 2% of (Non-defective)  \n72 = 0.02 * (0.90 * T)\n\nSo, 72 = 0.02 * 0.90T. Let me compute that. 0.02 * 0.90 is 0.018, right? So 72 = 0.018 * T.\n\nWait, so to find T, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nT = 72 / 0.018.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Hmm, maybe I can do this in fractions to make it easier. 0.018 is the same as 18/1000, so 72 divided by (18/1000) is 72 * (1000/18).\n\nCalculating 72 * 1000 gives me 72,000, and then divided by 18. Let me see, 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 * 1000 is 4,000. So T is 4,000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 4,000. So that would be the answer. But wait, did I make any mistakes in my calculations?\n\nLet me double-check. The number of non-defective is 0.9T. 2% of that is 0.02 * 0.9T = 0.018T. That equals 72. So T is 72 / 0.018. Let me compute that again: 72 divided by 0.018.\n\nAlternatively, 0.018 is 1.8e-2. So 72 / 0.018 = 72 / 0.018. Let me think in terms of moving decimals. 0.018 times 4,000 is 72, because 0.018 * 4,000 = 72. Because 0.018 * 1,000 is 18, so 18 * 4 is 72. Yep, so that's correct.\n\nSo T is 4,000, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says that 2% of the non-defective were rejected, and that equals 72. So the non-defective is 0.9T, and 2% of that is 72. So 0.02 * 0.9T = 72.\n\nSo 0.018T = 72, so T=72/0.018=4,000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be option A, 4,000.\n",

Hmm, let's see.\n\nThe problem says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, that means out of every 100 staplers, 10 are defective and 90 are non-defective. Wait, right, because 100% minus 10% is 90%.\n\nThen, it says 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Oh, so these are good staplers but were incorrectly turned away. And they told us that 72 of these non-defective staplers were rejected. So, 2% equals 72. Hmm, that's the key to find the number of non-defective staplers.\n\nWait, let me think. If 2% of the non-defective ones is 72, then I can set up an equation. Let me denote the number of non-defective staplers as N. So, 2% of N is 72. Which is the same as 0.02 * N = 72. Oh, right, so I can solve for N by dividing both sides by 0.02.\n\nSo N = 72 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 72 divided by 0.02 is the same as 72 multiplied by 50, since 1/0.02 is 50. So 72 *50 is 3600. So N is 3600. So there are 3600 non-defective staplers.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the total number of staplers produced that day. Since 10% were defective, the 3600 is 90% of the total. Oh, right! Because 10% defective means 90% non-defective.\n\nSo let me call the total number of staplers T. Then, 90% of T is 3600. So 0.9*T = 3600. To find T, I divide 3600 by 0.9. Let's see, 3600 divided by 0.9. Hmm, 0.9 is 9/10, so dividing by 9/10 is the same as multiplying by 10/9. So 3600 * (10/9) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3600 divided by 9 is 400. Then 400 multiplied by 10 is 4000. Oh, so T is 4000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 4000. So the answer should be A) 4,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 10% defective, so 90% non-defective. 2% of non-defective is rejected, and that equals 72. So 2% of N =72 \u2192 N=72/0.02=3600. Then, N is 90% of total, so 3600 is 90% of T \u2192 T=3600/0.9=4000. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think: if 2% of non-defective equals 72, then 1% is 36, so 100% would be 3600. So non-defective is 3600. Then, 3600 is 90% of total, so total is 3600 * (10/9) = 4000. Yep, same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is A.\n",

Looking at the options, option A is 4,000. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because 10% were defective, so non-defective is 90% of N. Then 2% of that non-defective is 72. So 0.02 * (0.9N) =72.\n\nWhich again gives 0.018 N =72 \u2192 N=72/0.018=4000. That's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the total number of staplers produced be \\( N \\). \n\n1. **Determine the number of non-defective staplers**:  \n   Since 10% of the staplers were defective, 90% were non-defective. Thus, the number of non-defective staplers is \\( 0.9N \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the number of non-defective staplers rejected**:  \n   It is given that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is \\( 0.02 \\times 0.9N \\).\n\n3. **Set up the equation**:  \n   According to the problem, 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Thus,  \n   \\[\n   0.02 \\times 0.9N = 72\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify and solve for \\( N \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   0.018N = 72\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 0.018:  \n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of staplers produced that day is **4,000**.  \n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a factory producing staplers, and we need to find out how many were produced on Monday based on some given percentages and numbers.\n\nFirst, the problem states that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, if I let the total number of staplers produced be, say, N, then 10% of N is defective. That means 90% of N are non-defective because 100% minus 10% is 90%. So non-defective staplers would be 0.9 * N.\n\nNext, it says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. So, 2% of the non-defective ones were wrongly rejected. And we're told that this number equals 72. Hmm, okay, so if 2% of non-defective staplers is 72, then I can set up an equation to find out how many non-defective staplers there were.\n\nLet me denote the number of non-defective staplers as D. So D = 0.9 * N. Then, 2% of D is 72. So, 0.02 * D = 72. Oh wait, yes, because 2% is 0.02 in decimal.\n\nSo substituting D with 0.9 * N, we get 0.02 * (0.9 * N) = 72. Let me compute that. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * N = 72.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N = 72 / 0.018. Let me compute that. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me see, 72 divided by 0.018. Well, 0.018 times 4000 is 72 because 0.018 * 4000 = 72. So N would be 4000.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check that. 0.018 * 4000 is indeed 72. Because 0.01 * 4000 is 40, and 0.008 *4000 is 32. 40 +32 =72. Yep, that's right. So N is 4000. Looking at the options, option A is 4000.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my setup. The problem says 2% of the non-defective were rejected, and that equals 72. So the equation is correct. Non-defective is 90% of total, 2% of that is 72, so 0.02*0.9*N =72. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of staplers produced is 4000.

Got it.\n\nThen, it says that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Wait, so the non-defective ones are good, but 2% of those got rejected.

So, those 72 are part of the 2% that were mistakenly rejected. My goal is to find the total number of staplers produced that day.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. I think I should set up some variables. Let's say the total number of staplers produced is N. Then, 10% are defective, which is 0.10 * N. So the non-defective ones would be N minus the defective ones, which is 0.90 * N.\n\nWait, no, that's the same as 90% of N. So non-defective = 0.90N.\n\nOut of these non-defective, 2% were rejected.
