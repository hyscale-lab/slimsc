      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about vitamins in a health food, and I need to figure out how much of it someone should eat to meet their daily requirements for both vitamin E and vitamin A. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that one gram of this health food has 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of vitamin A. Hmm, so each gram contributes a certain percentage towards each vitamin. But the goal is to get at least 100% of both vitamins, right? Because you need to meet the minimum daily requirements for both.\n\nWait, wait. Let me read it again. Oh, right, it says \"provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\" So, each vitamin needs to reach 100% or more. But I guess the health food alone is the source, so the percentages from the food should add up to 100% or more for each.\n\nWait, no, not add up. Because each gram contributes a certain percentage, so the total grams multiplied by the percentage per gram should meet or exceed 100% for each vitamin.\n\nSo, let me model this. Let's let x be the grams of health food eaten daily.\n\nFor vitamin E, each gram gives 9% of the requirement. So, x grams give 9x% of the requirement. We need this to be at least 100%, so 9x >= 100.\n\nSimilarly, for vitamin A, each gram gives 8%, so 8x >= 100.\n\nSo, I need to solve both inequalities and find the x that satisfies both.\n\nLet's solve the first inequality: 9x >= 100.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x >= 100/9. Let me compute that. 100 divided by 9 is approximately 11.111... grams.\n\nSecond inequality: 8x >= 100. Divide both sides by 8: x >= 12.5 grams.\n\nWait, so for vitamin E, you'd need about 11.11 grams, but for vitamin A, you need 12.5 grams. Since both need to be satisfied, you have to take the higher of the two, which is 12.5 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If you eat 12.5 grams, then for vitamin E, 12.5 * 9% is 112.5% of the requirement. That's more than enough. For vitamin A, 12.5 *8% is 100%, exactly meeting the requirement. So that's good.\n\nIf someone eats less than 12.5 grams, say 12 grams, then vitamin E would be 108% (which is okay), but vitamin A would be 96% (which is below the requirement). So you can't go below 12.5 grams because vitamin A wouldn't be met.\n\nSo the correct answer must be 12.5 grams, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking. \n\nThe question is about a health food that provides certain percentages of the minimum daily requirements for vitamins E and A. One gram of this food has 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. The question is asking how many grams someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum requirement for both vitamins. And the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm. So, I think I need to find the amount of grams such that both vitamins meet or exceed 100% of their respective daily requirements. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how to model this. Let me think.\n\nLet's denote the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E as E and for vitamin A as A. But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of percentages. So each gram provides 9% of E and 8% of A.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should think about what's needed. For each vitamin, the health food provides a certain percentage per gram. So, to reach 100% for each vitamin, how much do you need to eat?\n\nBut wait, the problem says that vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source. So all the vitamins must come from this health food.\n\nSo, the person's daily intake of vitamin E from the food must be at least 100% of the minimum requirement, and same for vitamin A.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think in terms of equations.\n\nLet me denote x as the grams of health food consumed daily.\n\nSo, the amount of vitamin E provided is 9% per gram, so 0.09x grams of vitamin E (assuming the percentages are in grams or whatever unit, but I think the actual units might not matter here because we're dealing with percentages relative to the daily requirement).\n\nSimilarly, the amount of vitamin A is 8% per gram, so 0.08x grams of vitamin A.\n\nBut wait, actually, the 9% is relative to the minimum daily requirement. So, if E is the minimum daily requirement for E, then 9% of E is provided per gram. Similarly for A.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let's say that the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E is, let's say, E units. Then, one gram of the health food provides 0.09 * E units of vitamin E. Similarly, one gram provides 0.08 * A units of vitamin A.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, think of it this way: each gram gives 9% of the required E and 8% of the required A. So, to get 100% of E, you need to eat enough grams such that 9% * x = 100% of E. But that can't be right because the same x would be used for both. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think in terms of equations. Let me define:\n\nLet R_E be the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E. Similarly, R_A for vitamin A.\n\nEach gram of the food provides 0.09 R_E of vitamin E and 0.08 R_A of vitamin A.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right. Each gram provides 9% of R_E, so 0.09 R_E per gram. Similarly, 0.08 R_A per gram.\n\nSo, if I eat x grams, the total vitamin E would be 0.09 R_E * x, and the total vitamin A would be 0.08 R_A * x.\n\nTo meet the requirements, both must be at least equal to their respective R values.\n\nSo, 0.09 R_E * x >= R_E\nAnd 0.08 R_A * x >= R_A\n\nWait, but that's not possible unless R_E and R_A are zero, which they aren't. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nOh wait, I think I see where I went wrong. The problem says that the food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, the daily requirement is 100%, so each gram provides 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's requirement.\n\nSo, to get 100% of E, you need to eat enough grams so that 0.09 * x = 100% of E. Similarly, for A, 0.08 * x = 100% of A.\n\nWait, but that would require x to satisfy both equations. But that's not possible unless E and A are zero, which they aren't. So perhaps I need to find x such that both conditions are satisfied. But that would mean that x has to be at least the value required for E and at least the value required for A.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the actual required percentages. Let me consider that the requirement is 100% for each vitamin.\n\nSo, for vitamin E: per gram, 9% of requirement. So, to get 100% of E, you need x grams where 9% * x = 100% \u2192 x = 100/9 \u2248 11.11 grams.\n\nFor vitamin A: 8% per gram. So x needs to be 100/8 = 12.5 grams.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 12.5 grams would provide 8% * 12.5 = 100% for A, but for E, 9% * 12.5 = 11.25%, which is less than 100%. So to get 100% of both, you'd have to take the maximum x required by either vitamin. Because if you take 12.5 grams, you get 100% of A, but only 11.25% of E. That's not enough. So you need to take enough grams so that both are at least 100%.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find x such that:\n\n0.09x >= 1 (since 1 represents 100% of E's requirement)\nand\n0.08x >= 1 (since 1 represents 100% of A's requirement).\n\nWait, but that would imply that x must satisfy both conditions. So the smallest x that is greater than or equal to both 1/0.09 and 1/0.08.\n\nLet me compute 1/0.09 = approximately 11.111... and 1/0.08=12.5.\n\nSo the smallest x that satisfies both is 12.5 grams. Because at x=12.5, 0.09 * 12.5 = 1.125 (which is more than 1, so E is satisfied), and 0.08 *12.5=1 (so A is satisfied). So 12.5 grams would give at least 100% of both.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says the food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, each gram contributes 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's requirement. So, to reach 100% of each, how much is needed.\n\nLet me model it with variables.\n\nLet R_E = the minimum daily requirement for E.\n\nEach gram provides 0.09 R_E of E.\n\nSo, to get R_E, the amount needed is x grams where 0.09 R_E * x >= R_E.\n\nDividing both sides by R_E (assuming R_E \u22600), 0.09x >=1 \u2192 x >= 1/0.09 \u224811.111 grams.\n\nSimilarly for A:\n\nEach gram provides 0.08 R_A of A.\n\nSo, 0.08 R_A *x >= R_A \u2192 0.08x >=1 \u2192 x >=12.5 grams.\n\nSo, to meet both requirements, x must be at least 12.5 grams. Because 12.5 grams gives 100% of A (since 0.08 *12.5 =1) and 11.25% of E (0.09 *12.5=1.125, which is 112.5% of E's requirement, so that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait, if x is 12.5 grams, then the E intake is 12.5 *0.09=1.125, which is 112.5% of the requirement, which is more than enough. So 12.5 grams would satisfy both. But looking at the options, option C is 12.5, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the percentages. Because the question says each gram provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, if the daily requirement is R_E for E, then each gram contributes 0.09 R_E.\n\nSo, to reach R_E, the total E from x grams is 0.09 R_E *x = R_E \u2192 x = R_E / (0.09 R_E) )= 1/0.09 = 11.111... grams.\n\nSimilarly, for A, x needs to be 1/0.08 =12.5 grams.\n\nSo, the maximum of these two is 12.5 grams. So, if you eat 12.5 grams, you'll have 0.09 *12.5 =1.125 R_E (which is 112.5% of E's requirement) and 0.08 *12.5=1.0 R_A (exactly 100% of A's requirement).\n\nTherefore, 12.5 grams is sufficient. But wait, the question says \"to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\" So, 12.5 grams is sufficient. So the answer would be C) 12.5 grams.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the options. The options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. So, 12.5 is option C. That's one of the choices, so that must be the correct answer.\n",

So the smallest x that is greater than or equal to both 1/0.09 and 1/0.08.\n\nLet me compute 1/0.09 = approximately 11.111... and 1/0.08=12.5.\n\nSo the smallest x that satisfies both is 12.5 grams. Because at x=12.5, 0.09 * 12.5 = 1.125 (which is more than 1, so E is satisfied), and 0.08 *12.5=1 (so A is satisfied). So 12.5 grams would give at least 100% of both.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem says the food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, each gram contributes 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's requirement. So, to reach 100% of each, how much is needed.\n\nLet me model it with variables.\n\nLet R_E = the minimum daily requirement for E.\n\nEach gram provides 0.09 R_E of E.\n\nSo, to get R_E, the amount needed is x grams where 0.09 R_E * x >= R_E.\n\nDividing both sides by R_E (assuming R_E \u22600), 0.09x >=1 \u2192 x >= 1/0.09 \u224811.111 grams.\n\nSimilarly for A:\n\nEach gram provides 0.08 R_A of A.\n\nSo, 0.08 R_A *x >= R_A \u2192 0.08x >=1 \u2192 x >=12.5 grams.\n\nSo, to meet both requirements, x must be at least 12.5 grams. Because 12.5 grams gives 100% of A (since 0.08 *12.5 =1) and 11.25% of E (0.09 *12.5=1.125, which is 112.5% of E's requirement, so that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait, if x is 12.5 grams, then the E intake is 12.5 *0.09=1.125, which is 112.5% of the requirement, which is more than enough. So 12.5 grams would satisfy both. But looking at the options, option C is 12.5, so that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the percentages. Because the question says each gram provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, if the daily requirement is R_E for E, then each gram contributes 0.09 R_E.\n\nSo, to reach R_E, the total E from x grams is 0.09 R_E *x = R_E \u2192 x = R_E / (0.09 R_E) )= 1/0.09 = 11.111... grams.\n\nSimilarly, for A, x needs to be 1/0.08 =12.5 grams.\n\nSo, the maximum of these two is 12.5 grams. So, if you eat 12.5 grams, you'll have 0.09 *12.5 =1.125 R_E (which is 112.5% of E's requirement) and 0.08 *12.5=1.0 R_A (exactly 100% of A's requirement).\n\nTherefore, 12.5 grams is sufficient. But wait, the question says \"to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\" So, 12.5 grams is sufficient. So the answer would be C) 12.5 grams.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the options. The options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. So, 12.5 is option C. That's one of the choices, so that must be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Vitamin E Requirement**:  \n   Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E. Let \\( R_E \\) represent the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E. To meet the requirement, the total intake of vitamin E must satisfy:  \n   \\[\n   0.09 \\cdot x \\geq R_E\n   \\]  \n   Dividing both sides by \\( R_E \\) (assuming \\( R_E \\neq 0 \\)):  \n   \\[\n   0.09 \\cdot x \\geq 1 \\implies x \\geq \\frac{1}{0.09} \\approx 11.11 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Vitamin A Requirement**:  \n   Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A. Let \\( R_A \\) represent the minimum daily requirement for vitamin A. To meet the requirement, the total intake of vitamin A must satisfy:  \n   \\[\n   0.08 \\cdot x \\geq R_A\n   \\]  \n   Dividing both sides by \\( R_A \\) (assuming \\( R_A \\neq 0 \\)):  \n   \\[\n   0.08 \\cdot x \\geq 1 \\implies x \\geq \\frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining Requirements**:  \n   To satisfy both requirements simultaneously, \\( x \\) must be at least the maximum of the two values calculated above. Thus:  \n   \\[\n   x \\geq 12.5 \\, \\text{grams}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:  \n   At \\( x = 12.5 \\, \\text{grams} \\):  \n   - For vitamin E:  \n     \\[\n     0.09 \\cdot 12.5 = 1.125 \\, \\text{(which is 112.5% of the requirement, satisfying vitamin E)}.\n     \\]  \n   - For vitamin A:  \n     \\[\n     0.08 \\cdot 12.5 = 1.0 \\, \\text{(which is exactly 100% of the requirement, satisfying vitamin A)}.\n     \\]  \n   Therefore, \\( x = 12.5 \\, \\text{grams} \\) is sufficient to meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins.\n\n5. **Answer Selection**:  \n   Among the given options, \\( 12.5 \\, \\text{grams} \\) corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

And we need to find out how many grams someone has to eat daily to get at least the minimum of both vitamins. So, no other sources of these vitamins, right?\n\nWait, so each gram gives 9% of E and 8% of A. But to meet the minimum daily requirements, they need 100% of each. So I guess I have to figure out how much of this health food is needed so that both percentages add up to at least 100% when considering the daily intake.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote the daily requirement for vitamin E as E and for vitamin A as A. But actually, since they're percentages, maybe I can set up equations based on that.\n\nSo, if one gram gives 9% of E, then x grams would give 9x% of E. Similarly, x grams would give 8x% of A. We need both of these to be at least 100%, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Because 9% per gram. So 9% per gram of E. So, for E, you need to reach 100%, so you need (100 / 9) grams. Because each gram gives 9%, so 100% would require 100/9 grams, which is approximately 11.11 grams. Similarly, for A, each gram gives 8%, so you need 100/8 grams, which is 12.5 grams.\n\nBut wait, that's the individual requirements. But since the person is getting both vitamins from the same food, they need to eat enough to satisfy the higher of the two, right? Because if you eat 12.5 grams, you get 8% *12.5 = 100% of A, and for E, 9% *12.5 is 11.25%, which is not enough. So you'd need to eat enough to cover the larger requirement. Or wait, no. Because the person needs both vitamins to meet 100%. So you can't just take the higher; you need both to be at least 100%.\n\nSo, each gram contributes to both, but the percentages are different. So, for each vitamin, you can set up an inequality.\n\nLet me define x as the number of grams needed. So, for vitamin E: 9% * x >= 100%. For vitamin A: 8% * x >= 100%. So solving both inequalities:\n\nFor E: 0.09x >= 1 \u2192 x >= 1 / 0.09 \u2192 x \u2248 11.11 grams.\n\nFor A: 0.08x >= 1 \u2192 x >= 1 / 0.08 \u2192 x = 12.5 grams.\n\nSo, to satisfy both, you need to take the larger x, which is 12.5 grams. Because eating 12.5 grams gives you enough A (100%) and more than enough E (11.25% of 12.5 is 1.125, which is 112.5% of E). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Because 9% per gram is 0.09, so 0.09 * x gives the percentage of E. So, 0.09x >= 1 (since 100% is 1). So x must be at least 1/0.09 \u224811.11 grams. But for A, it's 0.08x >=1, so x needs to be at least 12.5 grams.\n\nSo, since 12.5 grams is higher, you have to eat 12.5 grams to satisfy both. Because if you only eat 11.11 grams, you get enough E but not enough A. So you have to eat enough to get both. So 12.5 grams.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer must be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about vitamins and figuring out how much health food someone needs to eat to meet their daily requirements. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe question says that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. The goal is to find out how many grams are needed daily to get at least the minimum for both vitamins. \n\nWait, so the person can't get any vitamins from other sources, so all their E and A have to come from this health food. I think I need to set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the daily requirement for vitamin E as E and for vitamin A as A. But wait, the percentages are given per gram. So each gram provides 9% of E and 8% of A. \n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of percentages. So, for vitamin E, 1 gram gives 9% of the daily need. That means to get 100% of E, how many grams would I need? It would be 100% divided by 9%, right? So 100 / 9 \u2248 11.11 grams. But wait, that's just for E.\n\nSimilarly, for vitamin A, 1 gram gives 8% of the daily need. So to get 100%, it's 100 / 8 = 12.5 grams. \n\nBut the problem is that we need both vitamins to meet their respective 100% requirements. So if someone eats 12.5 grams, they get enough A (since 12.5 * 8% = 100%), but what about E? Let me calculate that. 12.5 grams * 9% = 11.25% of E. Oh, that's only 11.25%, which is less than the required 100%. So 12.5 grams isn't enough for E.\n\nHmm, so what's the minimum amount that will cover both? Let's think. Let's say they eat x grams of the food. Then, the amount of E they get is 9% of x, and the amount of A is 8% of x. Both of these need to be at least 100% of their respective requirements.\n\nWait, no. Because E and A have their own requirements. So 9% of x needs to be at least E's 100%, and 8% of x needs to be at least A's 100%. But wait, E and A have different daily requirements. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the percentages are based on their own daily requirements.\n\nWait, the problem says 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. So, perhaps each vitamin has its own daily requirement, and each gram provides 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's requirement.\n\nSo, let me think again. Let E be the daily requirement for vitamin E, and A be the daily requirement for vitamin A.\n\nSo, 1 gram provides 0.09E and 0.08A.\n\nWe need to find the smallest x such that:\n\n0.09E * x \u2265 E \u2192 0.09x \u2265 1 \u2192 x \u2265 1/0.09 \u2192 x \u2265 11.11 grams (for E).\n\nAnd for A:\n\n0.08A * x \u2265 A \u2192 0.08x \u2265 1 \u2192 x \u2265 1/0.08 \u2192 x \u2265 12.5 grams (for A).\n\nSo x must be at least the maximum of these two, which is 12.5 grams. Because if you eat 12.5 grams, you get enough A (since 12.5 * 0.08 = 1A) and for E, 12.5 * 0.09 = 1.125E, which is more than enough. Wait, but wait, the question says \"at least the minimum daily requirement of both.\" So both have to be met.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the percentages are per gram. So 1 gram gives 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's. So each gram is contributing to both, but they have different daily requirements.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as two separate equations. Let me let E be the daily requirement for E, and A be the daily requirement for A.\n\nEach gram gives 0.09E of E and 0.08A of A. So after x grams, the total E is 0.09E * x, and the total A is 0.08A * x.\n\nWe need both:\n\n0.09E * x \u2265 E \u2192 0.09x \u22651 \u2192 x \u2265 1/0.09 \u224811.111 grams.\n\nAnd \n\n0.08A *x \u2265 A \u2192 0.08x \u22651 \u2192 x\u22651/0.08=12.5 grams.\n\nSo the x must be the maximum of these two, which is 12.5 grams.\n\nWait, but wait. Because if x is 12.5, then for E:\n\n12.5 * 0.09 = 1.125, which is more than 1. So that's fine.\n\nAnd for A, 12.5 * 0.08 =1, which meets exactly.\n\nSo x=12.5 grams is sufficient. But wait, looking at the options, 12.5 is option C. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why isn't the answer higher? Because sometimes, you might think that since both percentages are per gram, but I think in this case, each gram contributes 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's. So the same x has to satisfy both conditions. So the maximum of 11.11 and 12.5 is 12.5, so that's the minimum grams needed.\n\nSo the correct answer should be C)12.5.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about vitamins and figuring out how much health food someone needs to eat to meet their daily requirements. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe question says that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. The goal is to find out how many grams are needed daily to get at least the minimum for both vitamins. \n\nWait, so the person can't get any vitamins from other sources, so all their E and A have to come from this health food. I think I need to set up some equations here.\n\nLet me denote the daily requirement for vitamin E as E and for vitamin A as A. But wait, the percentages are given per gram. So each gram provides 9% of E and 8% of A. \n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of percentages. So, for vitamin E, 1 gram gives 9% of the daily need. That means to get 100% of E, how many grams would I need? It would be 100% divided by 9%, right? So 100 / 9 \u2248 11.11 grams. But wait, that's just for E.\n\nSimilarly, for vitamin A, 1 gram gives 8% of the daily need. So to get 100%, it's 100 / 8 = 12.5 grams. \n\nBut the problem is that we need both vitamins to meet their respective 100% requirements. So if someone eats 12.5 grams, they get enough A (since 12.5 * 8% = 100%), but what about E? Let me calculate that. 12.5 grams * 9% = 11.25% of E. Oh, that's only 11.25%, which is less than the required 100%. So 12.5 grams isn't enough for E.\n\nHmm, so what's the minimum amount that will cover both? Let's think. Let's say they eat x grams of the food. Then, the amount of E they get is 9% of x, and the amount of A is 8% of x. Both of these need to be at least 100% of their respective requirements.\n\nWait, no. Because E and A have their own requirements.

For vitamin E, if one gram is 9%, then to get 100%, I'd need 100/9 grams. Similarly, for vitamin A, 100/8 grams. But wait, I can't eat different amounts for each vitamin because the food is the same. So I have to find a quantity that satisfies both requirements.\n\nSo, the amount of grams must be enough to cover the higher of the two percentages needed. Because whichever is higher will automatically cover the other if the required grams are sufficient.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Let me model this with equations.\n\nLet x be the grams eaten. Then:\n\nFor vitamin E: 9% of x must be >= 100% of the daily requirement. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, the daily requirement is 100%, so 9% per gram times x grams should be >= 100%. Similarly for vitamin A.\n\nSo, 9% * x >= 100% for E.\n\nAnd 8% * x >= 100% for A.\n\nWait, but that would mean x must be >= (100 / 9) and x >= (100 / 8). So x has to be at least the maximum of these two values.\n\nCalculating 100/9: that's approximately 11.111 grams.\n\nAnd 100/8 is 12.5 grams.\n\nSo, to satisfy both, x needs to be at least 12.5 grams, because that's the larger number. Because 12.5 grams gives 9% *12.5 = 1.125, which is 112.5% of E's requirement. And 8% *12.5 is 1, which is 100% of A's requirement. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I eat 12.5 grams, for E: 9% of 12.5 grams. 9% is 0.09, so 0.09 *12.5 is 1.125, which is 112.5% of the daily requirement. That's more than enough. For A: 8% of 12.5 grams is 0.08*12.5=1, which is exactly 100%. So that's sufficient.\n\nSo the minimum grams needed is 12.5 grams. Looking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way that eating a different amount could satisfy both with a lower gram count? Hmm, no, because each gram contributes 9% E and 8% A. So for each gram eaten, both vitamins are being incremented. To reach 100% in both, you need to find the x such that 0.09x >=1 and 0.08x >=1. So x has to be >= (1/0.09) and (1/0.08). Since 1/0.09 is about 11.11 and 1/0.08 is 12.5, the higher is 12.5, so x must be at least 12.5 grams.\n\nSo yeah, the answer is C, 12.5 grams.\n",

Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that one gram of this health food has 9% of the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. And we can't get these vitamins from anywhere else, so the health food has to supply 100% of both. \n\nWait, so each gram gives 9% of E and 8% of A.

Hmm, the question says that one gram of this health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of vitamin A. And we're supposed to find out how many grams someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum of both vitamins.\n\nWait, so the person can only get these vitamins from this health food, right? So they need enough to meet 100% of both vitamin E and vitamin A requirements. But each gram gives them 9% of E and 8% of A. So, if they eat x grams, they'll get 9x% of E and 8x% of A.\n\nI think the goal is to find the smallest x such that both percentages are at least 100%. Because you can't have less than the minimum requirement. So for vitamin E, 9x >= 100, and for vitamin A, 8x >=100. But wait, no, wait. Because 9% per gram is the percentage of the daily requirement. Oh, wait, no\u2014wait, 9% of the daily requirement. So, for example, if the daily requirement is 100 units, then 1 gram gives 9 units of E and 8 units of A.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The way the problem is phrased: one gram contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement for E and 8% for A. So, the daily requirement is, say, for E, 100 units. So 9% of that is 9 units per gram. Similarly, A's daily requirement is, say, 100 units, so 8 units per gram.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe the daily requirement is the same for both, but I don't think so. The question says \"the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E\" and \"the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.\" So each has its own requirement, which might be different. But the problem is that each gram provides 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's requirement. So to get 100% of each, we have to solve for each and find the maximum of the two x values, because whichever is larger will determine the amount needed.\n\nWait, but maybe the daily requirements are the same for both vitamins? Hmm, the question doesn't specify. Wait, perhaps each vitamin has its own daily requirement, and each gram contributes 9% of E's requirement and 8% of A's. So, for each, the amount needed in the food would be different. So for E, you need x grams such that 9% of E's requirement equals 100% of E's requirement. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me rephrase.\n\nWait, perhaps the daily requirement for E is, say, E_req, and for A, A_req. Then, each gram provides 0.09 * E_req and 0.08 * A_req. So, to get at least E_req and A_req, we need:\n\n0.09 * E_req * x >= E_req --> 0.09x >= 1 --> x >= 1/0.09 \u224811.11 grams.\n\nSimilarly for A:\n\n0.08 * A_req * x >= A_req --> 0.08x >=1 --> x >=1/0.08=12.5 grams.\n\nWait, but wait, this seems to assume that the daily requirements for E and A are the same. Because in each case, E_req and A_req are their respective daily requirements. So in the first equation, 0.09 * E_req * x >= E_req. Divide both sides by E_req (assuming it's positive, which it is), you get 0.09x >=1 --> x >= 1/0.09 \u224811.11.\n\nSimilarly, for A: 0.08x >=1 --> x >=12.5.\n\nSo, you need to meet both conditions. So x has to be at least 12.5 grams. Because 12.5 grams would give 9% *12.5 = 1.125, but wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the percentages.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say the minimum daily requirement for vitamin E is E.\n\nSo, one gram of the food gives 0.09 * E.\n\nSimilarly, the daily requirement for A is A, and one gram gives 0.08 * A.\n\nWe need to find x grams such that:\n\n0.09 * E * x >= E --> 0.09x >=1 --> x >=1/0.09 \u224811.11.\n\nSimilarly, 0.08 * A * x >= A --> 0.08x >=1 --> x >=1/0.08=12.5.\n\nSo, x must be at least 12.5 grams because that's the higher value between 11.11 and 12.5. So the answer would be 12.5 grams, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps the daily requirement is fixed, say 100% each. So, for E, you need 100% from the food. Each gram provides 9% of E, so you need 100/9 \u224811.11 grams. For A, 100% from 8% per gram, so 100/8=12.5 grams. So to get both, you need to take 12.5 grams because 12.5 grams will give you 9% *12.5=112.5% of E and 8% *12.5=100% of A. So that's sufficient for both.\n\nAlternatively, if you take 11.11 grams, you get 9% *11.11\u2248100% of E, but 8% *11.11\u224888.88% of A, which is insufficient.
