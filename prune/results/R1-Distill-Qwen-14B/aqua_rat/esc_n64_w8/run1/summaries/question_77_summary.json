Hmm, I think I remember something about the Lincoln-Petersen index or mark-recapture method from ecology. Let me think through this.\n\nSo, the setup is that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and then released back into the forest. Then, in 2002, they caught 500 deer at random, and out of those, 20 were found to have tags from the previous year.\n\nThe question is asking for the total deer population in the forest, assuming the population didn't change between 2001 and 2002. Oh right, and the percentage of tagged deer in the 500 caught sample is representative of the entire population. So, if 20 out of 500 were tagged in the sample, that ratio should reflect the overall proportion of tagged deer in the whole population.\n\nWait, how does the mark-recapture method work again? I think the formula is something like: (number tagged in first capture) divided by (total population) equals (number recaptured in second capture) divided by (total in second capture). Or maybe it's the other way around?

So, proportion tagged in second capture is 20/500, which is 0.04. So the proportion of the population that's tagged should also be 0.04.

Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me get that right.\n\nSo the formula is: \n\n(N) = (number tagged initially * total captured in second catch) / number recaptured.\n\nOh wait, right, because you're assuming that the proportion of tagged deer in the second catch reflects the proportion in the whole population.\n\nSo let me plug in the numbers. The initial number tagged is 300. In the second capture, they caught 500 deer, and 20 were tagged. So the proportion of tagged deer in the second catch is 20/500. \n\nSo according to the formula, the total population N would be:\n\nN = (300 * 500) / 20.\n\nLet me compute that. 300 times 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20 is 7,500. So N is 7,500.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 7500. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The question says that the percent in the sample is representative of the total population. So the approach is correct because we're using the proportion from the sample to estimate the total.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is: the ratio of tagged deer in the second capture should be equal to the ratio of the tagged deer in the entire population. So 300 is the total tagged, and N is the total population. So 300/N = 20/500. Solving for N:\n\n300/N = 20/500\nCross-multiplying: 20N = 300 * 500\n20N = 150,000\nN = 150,000 /20\nN=7500.\n\nYes, same result. So the total population is 7500, which is option E.\n\n\nThe problem involves estimating the total deer population in a forest using the mark and recapture method. In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them were found to be tagged. The goal is to estimate the total deer population, assuming the proportion of tagged deer in the sample represents the proportion in the entire population.\n\nUsing the Lincoln-Petersen index formula:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{\\text{number tagged initially} \\times \\text{total captured in the second catch}}{\\text{number recaptured}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\nN = \\frac{300 \\times 500}{20}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\\[\n300 \\times 500 = 150,000\n\\]\n\nThen, divide by the denominator:\n\\[\nN = \\frac{150,000}{20} = 7,500\n\\]\n\nThus, the estimated total deer population in the forest is 7,500. This corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",

Then, in 2002, they caught another 500 deer, and out of those, 20 were tagged. The question is asking for the total deer population in the forest, assuming the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample represents the whole population.\n\nWait, how does this method work again? Oh right, it's the Lincoln-Petersen estimator. The basic idea is that the proportion of tagged animals in the second catch should be about the same as the proportion of tagged animals in the entire population.\n\nSo, let's think. The total number of tagged deer after 2001 is 300, because that's how many were released. Then, in 2002, out of 500 caught, 20 were tagged. So the proportion is 20/500. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 500 is 0.04, which is 4%.\n\nIf that 4% represents the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population, then the total population (let's call it N) should have 300 tagged deer, which is 4% of N. So the equation would be:\n\n300 = 0.04 * N\n\nWait, solving for N, I divide 300 by 0.04. Let me compute that. 300 divided by 0.04 is the same as 300 multiplied by 25, because 0.04 is 1/25. So 300 *25 is 7500. So N should be 7500?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. The first year, 300 tagged. Second year, sample of 500 with 20 tagged.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about estimating the deer population in a forest. Hmm, I remember something about mark and recapture methods from biology class. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and then released back into the forest. Then, in 2002, they caught 500 deer at random, and out of those, 20 were found to have tags from the previous year. The question is asking me to estimate the total deer population in the forest, assuming the population hasn't changed between 2001 and 2002.\n\nWait, I think the method used here is the Lincoln-Petersen index, which is a common way to estimate animal populations. The formula, if I remember right, is:\n\nTotal population \u2248 (Number tagged in first capture * Total number in second capture) / Number recaptured in second capture.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers we have. The first capture tagged 300 deer. The second capture caught 500 deer, and 20 were tagged.\n\nSo using the formula: (300 * 500) / 20.\n\nLet me calculate that. 300 multiplied by 500 is 150,000. Divided by 20, that gives 7,500. So the estimated total population would be 7,500. Looking at the options, option E is 7500. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think about it is proportion. The proportion of tagged deer in the second sample should represent the proportion in the entire population. So 20 out of 500 were tagged, which is 4% (since 20/500=0.04). So if 300 deer are tagged in the whole population, then 300 is 4% of the total population. So to find the total, I can set up the equation:\n\n300 = 0.04 * Total.\n\nSolving for Total: 300 / 0.04 = 7500. Yep, same answer. So the correct answer should be E)7500.\n\n\nTo estimate the total deer population in the forest, the Lincoln-Petersen index method is applied. In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released. In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them were found to be tagged. Using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total population} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Number tagged in first capture} \\times \\text{Total number in second capture}}{\\text{Number recaptured in second capture}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total population} = \\frac{300 \\times 500}{20} = \\frac{150,000}{20} = 7,500\n\\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample (20 out of 500, or 4%) represents the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population. Since 300 tagged deer represent 4% of the total population, the total population is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total population} = \\frac{300}{0.04} = 7,500\n\\]\n\nThus, the estimated total deer population in the forest is **7,500**.\n\nAnswer: E",
