      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. We need to find what k is, and the options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nHmm. Alright, let me think. So, we're dealing with a sequence of consecutive integers. The first term is -50, and there are k terms in total. The sum of all these terms is 51. I need to find the value of k.\n\nI remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since the numbers are consecutive, the common difference is 1. So the series is something like -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nIn this case, the sum S is 51. So I can write:\n\n51 = k/2 * (-50 + an)\n\nBut I don't know an, the last term. Alternatively, I can express an in terms of k because the terms are consecutive. Since each term increases by 1, the last term would be the first term plus (k-1)*1. So an = -50 + (k-1).\n\nSo substituting that back into the sum equation:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (-50 + k -1))\nWait, let me make sure. Wait, the last term is a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is 1. So yes, a_n = -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo substituting into the sum formula:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k -51))\n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses. Let me compute (-50 + (k-51)).\n\nThat's (-50) + k -51 = k -101.\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (k -101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k -101)\n\nSo now, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\nk^2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check the algebra.\n\nWe have 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2:\n\n102 = k(k -101)\n\nWhich expands to k^2 -101k = 102. Then bringing 102 to the left:\n\nk^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in standard form. To solve for k, I can use the quadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 + 4*102)] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first. 101 squared is 10201. 4*102 is 408. So the discriminant is 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let me think. Hmm, 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 103*103 is 10609. Oh right, because 100^2=10000, 101^2=10201, 102^2=10404, 103^2=10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n(101 +103)/2 = 204/2=102.\n\n(101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2= -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms, so k=102.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 102. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me check my reasoning again. Let me think about the sum.\n\nIf the first term is -50 and the number of terms is 102, then the last term is (-50) + (102-1) = -50 +101 =51.\n\nSo the series is from -50 to 51, inclusive. Let's see if the sum is correct.\n\nThe number of terms is 102. The first term is -50, last term is 51.\n\nSum is (102/2)*(-50 +51) =51*(1)=51. Yes, that's correct. So k=102 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, why is the option E 102? Because the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, I thought I should double-check because sometimes when you're dealing with consecutive numbers, you might have an even number of terms, so maybe the average is between two integers, but in this case, the average seems to work out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think: the sum of consecutive integers can also be thought of as the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average in this case is (first + last)/2. So if the sum is 51, then average is 51/k.\n\nBut wait, the average is also (a1 + an)/2 = (-50 + an)/2.\n\nSo setting these equal: (-50 + an)/2 =51/k.\n\nBut we know an = -50 + (k-1), as before.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(-50 + (-50 +k-1))/2 =51/k.\n\nSimplify numerator: (-50 -50 +k -1) =k -101.\n\nSo (k-101)/2 =51/k.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2k:\n\nk(k-101)=102.\n\nWhich is the same equation as before, leading to k=102 or k=-1. So same result.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me think about the sequence. If the first term is -50 and the last term is 51, how many terms are there?\n\nLet me count. From -50 to 51 inclusive.\n\nWait, how many numbers are between -50 and 51? The count is 51 - (-50) +1 =51+50+1=102. So that's 102 terms. So that makes sense.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the sum is 51, which is correct as the average is 1, and 102 *1=102? Wait, no, wait, the sum is 51.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the average is (a1 + an)/2. So (-50 +51)/2 = (1)/2=0.5.\n\nThen sum is 0.5 *102=51. Oh, right, that's correct. So the average is 0.5, and 0.5 *102=51.\n\nAh, I see, I made a mistake earlier when I thought the average was 1. No, it's 0.5. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E)102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, let me think about consecutive integers. Consecutive integers mean numbers that follow each other in order, like n, n+1, n+2, and so on. So if the least integer is -50, the sequence starts at -50 and goes up by 1 each time for k terms.\n\nWait, so the sequence is -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number. The sum of all these numbers is 51. I need to find k.\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1, so it's an arithmetic series with d=1.\n\nSo, let me write down the formula. Sum S = k * (a1 + ak) / 2, where a1 is the first term and ak is the last term. Here, a1 is -50, and ak is the last term, which I don't know yet. The sum S is 51.\n\nBut wait, another way to write the last term is a1 + (k-1)*d. Since d is 1, ak = a1 + k-1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo, substituting into the sum formula: 51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2. Let me simplify that.\n\nInside the parentheses: -50 + k -51 = k -101.\n\nSo, 51 = k*(k-101)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k*(k -101).\n\nExpanding the right side: k\u00b2 -101k. So, the equation becomes k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I did that right. So:\n\n51 = [k*(-50 + (k-51))]/2\nWhich is 51 = [k*(k -101)]/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k-101)\nSo, k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Let me try to solve this.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 = (100+3)^2=10000+600+9=10609. Yes, so sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, the solutions are [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSince k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if that makes sense. If k=102, then the last term is k-51=102-51=51. So the sequence starts at -50 and ends at 51, with 102 terms.\n\nWait, let me count how many numbers are from -50 to 51 inclusive. From -50 to 0, that's 51 numbers (including 0), and from 1 to 51, that's 51 numbers. So total is 51 + 51 = 102. So that checks out.\n\nNow, let me confirm the sum. The sum of numbers from -50 to 51.\n\nWait, but the sum of a symmetric sequence around zero. Let's see, the numbers from -50 to 50 would sum to zero because each negative cancels the positive. Then, adding 51 would give a total sum of 51. Oh! Because from -50 to 50 is 101 numbers, sum zero, then adding 51 more terms (from 51 onwards? Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, the sequence is from -50 to 51, which is 102 terms. Let me think: -50 to 50 is 101 terms, and then adding 51 makes 102 terms. But the sum from -50 to 50 is zero. Then, adding 51 as the next term would give a sum of 51. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo k is 102. Looking back at the options, option E is 102.\n\nWait, but another thought: is there another possible value for k? Because when I solved the quadratic equation, I got two solutions: 102 and -1. But since k can't be negative, only 102 is valid.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the number of terms is even or odd? Let me think. For the sum to be 51, which is positive, but the series starts with a negative number. So the number of positive terms must outweigh the negatives.\n\nBut I think the earlier approach using the formula is correct. So the answer should be E)102.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, let me think about consecutive integers. Consecutive integers mean numbers that follow each other in order, like n, n+1, n+2, and so on. So if the least integer is -50, the sequence starts at -50 and goes up by 1 each time for k terms.\n\nWait, so the sequence is -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number. The sum of all these numbers is 51. I need to find k.\n\nI remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. Since these are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1, so it's an arithmetic series with d=1.\n\nSo, let me write down the formula. Sum S = k * (a1 + ak) / 2, where a1 is the first term and ak is the last term. Here, a1 is -50, and ak is the last term, which I don't know yet. The sum S is 51.\n\nBut wait, another way to write the last term is a1 + (k-1)*d. Since d is 1, ak = a1 + k-1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo, substituting into the sum formula: 51 = k * (-50 + (k -51)) / 2. Let me simplify that.\n\nInside the parentheses: -50 + k -51 = k -101.\n\nSo, 51 = k*(k-101)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k*(k -101).\n\nExpanding the right side: k\u00b2 -101k. So, the equation becomes k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure I did that right. So:\n\n51 = [k*(-50 + (k-51))]/2\nWhich is 51 = [k*(k -101)]/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k-101)\nSo, k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Let me try to solve this.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. For ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the solutions are (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)) / (2a).\n\nHere, a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nSo, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-101)^2 -4*(1)*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 = (100+3)^2=10000+600+9=10609. Yes, so sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, the solutions are [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nLet me compute both possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nSince k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k=102.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if that makes sense. If k=102, then the last term is k-51=102-51=51. So the sequence starts at -50 and ends at 51, with 102 terms.\n\nWait, let me count how many numbers are from -50 to 51 inclusive. From -50 to 0, that's 51 numbers (including 0), and from 1 to 51, that's 51 numbers. So total is 51 + 51 = 102. So that checks out.\n\nNow, let me confirm the sum. The sum of numbers from -50 to 51.\n\nWait, but the sum of a symmetric sequence around zero. Let's see, the numbers from -50 to 50 would sum to zero because each negative cancels the positive. Then, adding 51 would give a total sum of 51. Oh! Because from -50 to 50 is 101 numbers, sum zero, then adding 51 more terms (from 51 onwards? Wait, wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, the sequence is from -50 to 51, which is 102 terms. Let me think: -50 to 50 is 101 terms, and then adding 51 makes 102 terms. But the sum from -50 to 50 is zero. Then, adding 51 as the next term would give a sum of 51. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo k is 102. Looking back at the options, option E is 102.\n\nWait, but another thought: is there another possible value for k? Because when I solved the quadratic equation, I got two solutions: 102 and -1. But since k can't be negative, only 102 is valid.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe the number of terms is even or odd? Let me think. For the sum to be 51, which is positive, but the series starts with a negative number. So the number of positive terms must outweigh the negatives.\n\nBut I think the earlier approach using the formula is correct. So the answer should be E)102.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of consecutive integers \\( k \\) such that their sum is 51, with the least integer being \\(-50\\). The sequence starts at \\(-50\\) and ends at some integer \\( a_k \\), with \\( k \\) terms.

Substituting these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51))}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k \\cdot (k - 101)}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k \\cdot (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-(-101) \\pm \\sqrt{(-101)^2 - 4(1)(-102)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{10201 + 408}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{10609}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\sqrt{10609} = 103 \\), the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = \\frac{204}{2} = 102, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = \\frac{101 - 103}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative. Thus, \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nTo verify, the sequence starts at \\(-50\\) and ends at \\( 51 \\), with 102 terms. The sum of the numbers from \\(-50\\) to \\( 50 \\) is zero, and adding \\( 51 \\) gives a total sum of \\( 51 \\), which matches the problem's condition.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

So looking for two numbers that add up to -101.\n\nLet me see, 102 is 102*1. If I take 102 and -1, then 102*(-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. But we need their sum to be -101, so maybe -102 and +1? Let me see: (-102) *1= -102, and -102 +1 = -101. Yes! So the factors are (k - 102)(k +1) =0.\n\nSo the solutions are k =102 or k =-1.\n\nBut since k is the number of terms, it can't be negative.

I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, so the problem says it's the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50. So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, and so on, up to some number. The sum of all these numbers is 51. I need to find how many terms, k, are in this sequence.\n\nWait, I remember that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. Oh right, because the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. So in formula terms, S = k * (a1 + ak) / 2.\n\nIn this case, the sum S is 51, the first term a1 is -50. But I don't know the last term, ak. Hmm, but maybe I can express ak in terms of k.\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be written as a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1. So the last term, ak, would be a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51.\n\nSo substituting back into the sum formula: 51 = k * ( (-50) + (k - 51) ) / 2.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n51 = k * ( -50 + k -51 ) / 2\n\nSimplify the numerator inside the parentheses: -50 -51 is -101, so:\n\n51 = k * (k - 101) / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k * (k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, now I have to solve this quadratic for k.

Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 103*103=10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 103] / 2\n\nThat gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. [101 + 103] / 2 = 204 / 2 = 102\n2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. I need to find k. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nAlright, so the problem says it's the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50. So the sequence would be -50, -49, -48, and so on, up to some number. The sum of all these numbers is 51. I need to find how many terms, k, are in this sequence.\n\nWait, I remember that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. Oh right, because the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. So in formula terms, S = k * (a1 + ak) / 2.\n\nIn this case, the sum S is 51, the first term a1 is -50. But I don't know the last term, ak. Hmm, but maybe I can express ak in terms of k.\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So the nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be written as a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1. So the last term, ak, would be a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 51.\n\nSo substituting back into the sum formula: 51 = k * ( (-50) + (k - 51) ) / 2.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n51 = k * ( -50 + k -51 ) / 2\n\nSimplify the numerator inside the parentheses: -50 -51 is -101, so:\n\n51 = k * (k - 101) / 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k * (k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, now I have to solve this quadratic for k. Let me try using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so here a=1, b=-101, c=-102.\n\nThe quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (-101)^2 - 4*1*(-102) ) ] / 2\n\nCalculating the discriminant inside the square root:\n\n(-101)^2 = 10201\n4ac = 4 *1*(-102) = -408, so -4ac is 408\nSo sqrt(10201 + 408) = sqrt(10609)\n\nWait, what's the square root of 10609? Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 because 103*103=10609. So sqrt(10609) is 103.\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1 103] / 2\n\nThat gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. [101 + 103] / 2 = 204 / 2 = 102\n2. [101 - 103] / 2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k must be 102. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 102.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50. I need to find what k is. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since these are consecutive integers, the difference between each term is 1. So, the formula for the sum S of n terms is S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference. In this case, d is 1.\n\nWait, but another way to write the sum of consecutive integers is S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the last term. Since the numbers are consecutive, an = a1 + (n-1)*1. So, substituting that, the sum becomes S = n*(a1 + (a1 + n -1 )) / 2. Simplifying that gives S = n*(2a1 + n -1)/2.\n\nIn this problem, S is 51, a1 is -50. So plugging in, 51 = k*(2*(-50) + k -1)/2. Let me write that equation down.\n\nSo, 51 = k*( -100 + k -1 ) / 2. Simplify that equation: multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. That gives 102 = k*(k -101).\n\nExpanding the right side: 102 = k^2 - 101k. Let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. So, k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for k. I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is k^2 -101k -102 = 0. The quadratic formula is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101^2 +4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant. 101 squared is 10201. 4*1*102 is 408. So the discriminant is 10201 +408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, I think 103^2 is 10609 because 100^2 is 10000, 101^2 is 10201, 102^2 is 10404, 103^2 is 10609. Yes, right.\n\nSo sqrt(10609) is 103. So, substituting back, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions: (101+103)/2 = 204/2=102, and (101-103)/2= (-2)/2= -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative because it's the number of terms. So k is 102. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer, right?\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with consecutive integers, especially when starting with a negative, the number of terms could be something else. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me think again. The first term is -50, and we have k terms. The last term would be (-50) + (k-1)*1 = k-51. The sum is the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.\n\nSum = k*( (-50) + (k-51) ) / 2. That's the same as k*(k -101)/2. So sum is 51 = [k(k-101)]/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k^2 -101k.\n\nSame equation as before, so quadratic equation correct. So the solution is k=102. So the answer must be E)102.\n\nWait, but why is the option E 102? Let me check the numbers again. If k is 102, then the last term is -50 +101=51. So the sum is from -50 to 51, inclusive. How many terms is that?\n\nWait, from -50 to 51 is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102 terms. Yeah, that's correct. So the sum would be average of first and last term times number of terms: average is (-50 +51)/2 = 0.5, times 102 is 51. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the answer should be E)102.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k equals which of the options given?\n\nHmm, okay, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So the series would look like -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, the sum of these numbers is 51. That's interesting because the sum is positive, but the starting number is negative. So there must be a mix of negative and positive numbers that add up to a positive 51.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. So in symbols, that's S = k*(a1 + ak)/2. \n\nIn this case, S is 51, a1 is -50, and ak is the last term. So I need to find k and the last term. But I don't know ak yet. Hmm, how can I relate these?\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the last term can be expressed in terms of k. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1 because they're consecutive integers. So the last term, ak, is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 49.\n\nSo now I can substitute ak into the sum formula. Let's write that out:\n\n51 = k*(-50 + (k -49)) / 2.\n\nWait, let me check that substitution again. The sum S is (k*(a1 + ak))/2. So a1 is -50, ak is (k -49). So a1 + ak is (-50) + (k -49) = k - 99.\n\nSo the equation becomes 51 = k*(k - 99)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k - 99).\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\nk^2 - 99k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\nk\u00b2 -99k -102 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving for k. I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is k = [99 \u00b1 sqrt(99\u00b2 + 4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first. 99 squared is 9801. 4 * 1 * 102 is 408. So the discriminant is 9801 + 408 = 10209.\n\nNow, sqrt(10209). Let me think, what's the square of 100? 10000. 101 squared is 10201. Oh wait, 101\u00b2 is 10201. Then 10209 is 8 more than that, so sqrt(10209) would be 101 + something. Wait, no, wait. Because 101\u00b2 is 10201, adding 8 gives 10209. So sqrt(10209) is 101.04? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. 101 * 101 is 10201. 102 * 102 is 10404. Hmm, so 101. So maybe 101.04 is not correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute 101*101=10201. 10209 -10201=8. So sqrt(10209)=101 + 8/(2*101) approximately, using the linear approximation. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think, perhaps 101.04 is correct, but maybe I can factor 10209.\n\nWait, 10209. Let me see if it's a perfect square. Let me try 101: 101^2 is 10201, as before. So 10209 is 10201 +8. So it's not a perfect square. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Because the quadratic is k\u00b2 -99k -102=0. So discriminant is (99)^2 +4*1*102 = 9801 + 408 = 10209. Hmm, okay, so perhaps it's correct.\n\nBut wait, if the quadratic doesn't have integer roots, that's a problem because k should be an integer here, as it's the number of terms. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the setup. The sum is 51, the first term is -50, and there are k terms. So the sum is (k/2) * (2a1 + (k-1)d). Wait, another formula for the sum is (n/2)*(2a1 + (n-1)d). Oh right, maybe I should use that instead to avoid confusion. Let me try that.\n\nSo, Sum S = (k/2)*(2a1 + (k-1)*d). Here, a1 is -50, d is 1, and S is 51.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n51 = (k/2)*(2*(-50) + (k-1)*1)\n51 = (k/2)*(-100 + k -1)\n51 = (k/2)*(k -101)\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n102 = k*(k -101)\nSo, k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a different quadratic than before. Oh, wait a second, I think I messed up earlier. Because in the first approach, I set ak = k -49, which would make a1 + ak = -50 + (k-49) = k -99. Then Sum = k*(k-99)/2 =51. So 51 = k*(k-99)/2 \u2192 102 =k\u00b2 -99k \u2192k\u00b2 -99k -102=0. But when I used the other formula, I get k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Wait, so which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k-51. Because 50 +1 is 51. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate that.\n\nWait, a1 is -50, so a1 + (k-1)*d \u2192 since d=1, it's -50 + (k-1)*1 = k -50 -1 = k-51. So ak is k-51, not k-49 as I thought earlier. That was an error.\n\nSo then, when I set up the sum formula, I have:\n\nSum = k*(a1 + ak)/2 = k*(-50 + (k-51))/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n51 = k*(-50 + k -51)/2 \u2192 51 = k*(k -101)/2.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n102 = k*(k-101) \u2192k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nAh, so that's the correct quadratic equation. So earlier I had a mistake in the last term calculation. Now, the equation is correct.\n\nSo solving k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nAgain, using the quadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nCompute 101 squared: 101*101 = 10201.\n\n4*1*102 = 408.\n\nSo discriminant is 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let's see. 103 squared is 10609 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 101\u00b2 is 10201, 102\u00b2 is 10404, 103\u00b2 is 10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nk = (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative, so k=102.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 102. So the answer would be E)102. But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the sum is 51, but adding 102 terms starting from -50, that seems like a lot. Let me verify if this makes sense.\n\nWait, if we have 102 terms, starting at -50 and ending at (k-51)=102-51=51. So the last term is 51.\n\nThe sum of numbers from -50 to 51. But wait, that's not correct because if you start at -50 and have 102 terms, the last term would be -50 + 101 (since the number of steps is one less than the number of terms). Wait, wait. Let me compute the last term correctly.\n\nIf the first term is a1 = -50, and the number of terms is k, then the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo for k=102, last term is 102-51=51.\n\nSo the sum from -50 to 51 inclusive. Wait, but that's not exactly the case because the number of terms would be 102, but the distance from -50 to 51 is 101 steps, meaning 102 numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum from -50 to 51. The sum of numbers from a to b is (b - a +1)(a + b)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a is -50 and b is 51. So the number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1=102 terms. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThe sum would be (102)*(-50 +51)/2 =102*(1)/2=51. Which matches the given sum. So yes, k=102 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be E)102.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 102. But earlier when I thought I made a mistake, I was thinking that the answer would be one of the other options. Hmm, but according to this calculation, it's correct.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is 102, which is the solution I've arrived at.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes when you have a negative starting point and a positive ending point, the sum can be zero, but in this case, it's 51, which is positive. So that makes sense because the positive numbers contribute more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. So the discriminant is (101)^2 +4*1*102=10201 +408=10609. The square root of 10609 is 103 because 103^2=10609.\n\nSo the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. So (101+103)=204, divided by 2 is 102. (101-103)=-2, divided by 2 is -1. So k=102 is the only valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)102.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k equals which of the options given?\n\nHmm, okay, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. So the series would look like -50, -49, -48, ..., up to some number.\n\nWait, the sum of these numbers is 51. That's interesting because the sum is positive, but the starting number is negative. So there must be a mix of negative and positive numbers that add up to a positive 51.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (number of terms) \u00d7 (first term + last term) / 2. So in symbols, that's S = k*(a1 + ak)/2. \n\nIn this case, S is 51, a1 is -50, and ak is the last term. So I need to find k and the last term. But I don't know ak yet. Hmm, how can I relate these?\n\nSince the numbers are consecutive, the last term can be expressed in terms of k. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Here, d is 1 because they're consecutive integers. So the last term, ak, is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + (k-1) = k - 49.\n\nSo now I can substitute ak into the sum formula. Let's write that out:\n\n51 = k*(-50 + (k -49)) / 2.\n\nWait, let me check that substitution again. The sum S is (k*(a1 + ak))/2. So a1 is -50, ak is (k -49). So a1 + ak is (-50) + (k -49) = k - 99.\n\nSo the equation becomes 51 = k*(k - 99)/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k*(k - 99).\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\nk^2 - 99k - 102 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:\n\nk\u00b2 -99k -102 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving for k. I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is k = [99 \u00b1 sqrt(99\u00b2 + 4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first. 99 squared is 9801. 4 * 1 * 102 is 408. So the discriminant is 9801 + 408 = 10209.\n\nNow, sqrt(10209). Let me think, what's the square of 100? 10000. 101 squared is 10201. Oh wait, 101\u00b2 is 10201. Then 10209 is 8 more than that, so sqrt(10209) would be 101 + something. Wait, no, wait. Because 101\u00b2 is 10201, adding 8 gives 10209. So sqrt(10209) is 101.04? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. 101 * 101 is 10201. 102 * 102 is 10404. Hmm, so 101. So maybe 101.04 is not correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute 101*101=10201. 10209 -10201=8. So sqrt(10209)=101 + 8/(2*101) approximately, using the linear approximation. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think, perhaps 101.04 is correct, but maybe I can factor 10209.\n\nWait, 10209. Let me see if it's a perfect square. Let me try 101: 101^2 is 10201, as before. So 10209 is 10201 +8. So it's not a perfect square. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Because the quadratic is k\u00b2 -99k -102=0. So discriminant is (99)^2 +4*1*102 = 9801 + 408 = 10209. Hmm, okay, so perhaps it's correct.\n\nBut wait, if the quadratic doesn't have integer roots, that's a problem because k should be an integer here, as it's the number of terms. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the setup. The sum is 51, the first term is -50, and there are k terms. So the sum is (k/2) * (2a1 + (k-1)d). Wait, another formula for the sum is (n/2)*(2a1 + (n-1)d). Oh right, maybe I should use that instead to avoid confusion. Let me try that.\n\nSo, Sum S = (k/2)*(2a1 + (k-1)*d). Here, a1 is -50, d is 1, and S is 51.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n51 = (k/2)*(2*(-50) + (k-1)*1)\n51 = (k/2)*(-100 + k -1)\n51 = (k/2)*(k -101)\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n102 = k*(k -101)\nSo, k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a different quadratic than before. Oh, wait a second, I think I messed up earlier. Because in the first approach, I set ak = k -49, which would make a1 + ak = -50 + (k-49) = k -99. Then Sum = k*(k-99)/2 =51. So 51 = k*(k-99)/2 \u2192 102 =k\u00b2 -99k \u2192k\u00b2 -99k -102=0. But when I used the other formula, I get k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Wait, so which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k-51. Because 50 +1 is 51. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate that.\n\nWait, a1 is -50, so a1 + (k-1)*d \u2192 since d=1, it's -50 + (k-1)*1 = k -50 -1 = k-51. So ak is k-51, not k-49 as I thought earlier. That was an error.\n\nSo then, when I set up the sum formula, I have:\n\nSum = k*(a1 + ak)/2 = k*(-50 + (k-51))/2.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n51 = k*(-50 + k -51)/2 \u2192 51 = k*(k -101)/2.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n102 = k*(k-101) \u2192k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nAh, so that's the correct quadratic equation. So earlier I had a mistake in the last term calculation. Now, the equation is correct.\n\nSo solving k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nAgain, using the quadratic formula: k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*1*102)] / 2.\n\nCompute 101 squared: 101*101 = 10201.\n\n4*1*102 = 408.\n\nSo discriminant is 10201 + 408 = 10609.\n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Let's see. 103 squared is 10609 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 101\u00b2 is 10201, 102\u00b2 is 10404, 103\u00b2 is 10609. So sqrt(10609)=103.\n\nSo, k = [101 \u00b1 103]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nk = (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102.\n\nk = (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.\n\nBut k can't be negative, so k=102.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 102. So the answer would be E)102. But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the sum is 51, but adding 102 terms starting from -50, that seems like a lot. Let me verify if this makes sense.\n\nWait, if we have 102 terms, starting at -50 and ending at (k-51)=102-51=51. So the last term is 51.\n\nThe sum of numbers from -50 to 51. But wait, that's not correct because if you start at -50 and have 102 terms, the last term would be -50 + 101 (since the number of steps is one less than the number of terms). Wait, wait. Let me compute the last term correctly.\n\nIf the first term is a1 = -50, and the number of terms is k, then the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nSo for k=102, last term is 102-51=51.\n\nSo the sum from -50 to 51 inclusive. Wait, but that's not exactly the case because the number of terms would be 102, but the distance from -50 to 51 is 101 steps, meaning 102 numbers.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum from -50 to 51. The sum of numbers from a to b is (b - a +1)(a + b)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a is -50 and b is 51. So the number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1=102 terms. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThe sum would be (102)*(-50 +51)/2 =102*(1)/2=51. Which matches the given sum. So yes, k=102 is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be E)102.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 102. But earlier when I thought I made a mistake, I was thinking that the answer would be one of the other options. Hmm, but according to this calculation, it's correct.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102.\n\nSo E is 102, which is the solution I've arrived at.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes when you have a negative starting point and a positive ending point, the sum can be zero, but in this case, it's 51, which is positive. So that makes sense because the positive numbers contribute more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. So the discriminant is (101)^2 +4*1*102=10201 +408=10609. The square root of 10609 is 103 because 103^2=10609.\n\nSo the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. So (101+103)=204, divided by 2 is 102. (101-103)=-2, divided by 2 is -1. So k=102 is the only valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of consecutive integers, \\( k \\), such that their sum is 51, starting with the least integer as -50.\n\n### Step 1: Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\nThe sum of \\( k \\) consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_k)\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( S = 51 \\) (given sum),\n- \\( a_1 = -50 \\) (first term),\n- \\( a_k = a_1 + (k-1) \\times 1 = -50 + k - 1 = k - 51 \\) (last term).\n\nSubstitute these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (-50 + (k - 51))\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k \\times (k - 101)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Formulate and solve the quadratic equation\nExpand the equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nUse the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -101 \\), and \\( c = -102 \\).

I need to find k. Hmm, right.\n\nAlright, let me think about consecutive integers. So, if the first integer is -50, the next one would be -49, then -48, and so on. So they form a sequence like -50, -49, -48,... up to some number. The sum of all these numbers is 51. \n\nWait, so I need to find how many terms, k, are in this sequence such that their sum is 51. Hmm, I remember that the sum of consecutive numbers can be found using the formula for an arithmetic series. Right, because consecutive integers are an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. Alternatively, since the common difference is 1, the last term can be expressed as a1 + (n-1)d, where d is 1. So an = a1 + (k-1)*1 = a1 + k -1. But since a1 is -50, an = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nWait, but let me get this right. So the sum S is 51. So plugging into the formula: 51 = k/2 * (a1 + an). Substituting a1 as -50 and an as (k-51), the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (-50 + (k -51)).\n\nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses: -50 + k -51 = k -101.\n\nSo now the equation is 51 = (k/2) * (k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k(k -101).\n\nExpanding the right side: k^2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nWait, so this is a quadratic equation in the form of k^2 -101k -102 = 0. Hmm, solving for k.\n\nI can try to factor this quadratic, but I'm not sure if it's easy. Let me see. The product of the factors should be -102, and they should add up to -101. Hmm, factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 &51, 3&34, 6&17. Since the product is negative, one of them has to be negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add to -101. Let's see: 1 and -102 multiply to -102 and add to -101 (1 + (-102) = -101). Oh, so yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as (k - 102)(k + 1) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are k = 102 and k = -1. But since k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k must be 102.\n\nWait a minute, but 102 is one of the options. Let me check the options. Option E is 102. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation. Another approach: maybe using the formula for the sum as (number of terms) times the average of the first and last term. Since the terms are consecutive, the average is (first + last)/2.\n\nSo sum = k * (average) = k * [ (a1 + ak)/2 ].\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I used earlier. So that part is correct.\n\nLet me plug in the values again to double-check. If k is 102, then the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +101 = 51. So the last term is 51.\n\nSum would be 102/2 * (-50 +51) = 51 * (1) = 51. Yes, that works. So k is 102.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 102. So the correct answer is E.\n",

Hmm, factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 &51, 3&34, 6&17. Since the product is negative, one of them has to be negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add to -101. Let's see: 1 and -102 multiply to -102 and add to -101 (1 + (-102) = -101). Oh, so yes, that works.\n\nSo the equation factors as (k - 102)(k + 1) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are k = 102 and k = -1. But since k is the number of terms, it can't be negative. So k must be 102.\n\nWait a minute, but 102 is one of the options. Let me check the options. Option E is 102. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equation. Another approach: maybe using the formula for the sum as (number of terms) times the average of the first and last term. Since the terms are consecutive, the average is (first + last)/2.\n\nSo sum = k * (average) = k * [ (a1 + ak)/2 ].\n\nWhich is the same as the formula I used earlier. So that part is correct.\n\nLet me plug in the values again to double-check. If k is 102, then the last term is a1 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +101 = 51. So the last term is 51.\n\nSum would be 102/2 * (-50 +51) = 51 * (1) = 51. Yes, that works. So k is 102.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is 102. So the correct answer is E.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of consecutive integers, \\( k \\), such that their sum is 51, with the least integer being -50. Since the integers are consecutive, they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_k),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( S \\) is the sum, \\( k \\) is the number of terms, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( a_k \\) is the last term. Here, \\( a_1 = -50 \\), \\( S = 51 \\), and \\( a_k = a_1 + (k - 1) = -50 + (k - 1) = k - 51 \\).\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (-50 + (k - 51)).\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\cdot (k - 101).\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n(k - 102)(k + 1) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are \\( k = 102 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\). Since \\( k \\) represents the number of terms, it cannot be negative, so \\( k = 102 \\).\n\nTo verify, if \\( k = 102 \\), the last term is:\n\n\\[\na_{102} = -50 + (102 - 1) = 51.\n\\]\n\nThe sum is then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{102}{2} \\cdot (-50 + 51) = 51 \\cdot 1 = 51,\n\\]\n\nwhich matches the given sum. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",
