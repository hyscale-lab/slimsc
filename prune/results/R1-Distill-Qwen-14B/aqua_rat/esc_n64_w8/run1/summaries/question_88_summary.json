      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this age-related problem. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe question says: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, how old is Rahim now? The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. I'll try to visualize the timeline. So, the present time is now, and five years ago is the past. \n\nRaj's current age is 17. That's given. So, five years ago, Raj was 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. Because each year you subtract one from the current age. So, 17-5=12.\n\nNow, five years ago, Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age at that time. So, let me denote Rahim's age five years ago as something. Let's say, let x be Rahim's age five years ago. \n\nThe problem states that Raj's age then (12) was one-third of x. So mathematically, that would be 12 = (1/3) * x. To find x, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 3. So x = 12 * 3 = 36. \n\nSo, five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old. Now, to find his current age, I add those five years back. Because if five years ago he was 36, now he's 36 +5 =41. \n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because if five years have passed since then, his age would have increased by five. So 36 +5 is indeed 41. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 41. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, did I interpret the problem correctly? Let me make sure I didn't mix up who was older. The problem says Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago. So, yes, Raj being younger, so when Raj was 12, Rahim was 36. That makes sense.\n\nSo the calculation seems right.

So 17-5 is 12. So Rr = 12.\n\nAt that same time (five years ago), Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So Rr = (1/3) * Rrah.\n\nWe can plug in Rr as 12. So 12 = (1/3) * Rrah.\n\nTo find Rrah, I can rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 3. So Rrah = 12 * 3 = 36.\n\nSo five years ago, Rahim was 36 years old. That means now, his current age is 36 + 5 = 41.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Five years ago, Raj was 12, which is one-third of 36. Yep, that adds up. So now, adding 5 to 36 gives 41. So the current age of Rahim is 41. Looking at the options, option B is 41. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that Raj is currently 17 years old. Five years ago, Raj's age was \\( 17 - 5 = 12 \\). According to the problem, five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Let \\( R \\) represent Rahim's age five years ago. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n12 = \\frac{1}{3}R\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\nR = 36\n\\]\n\nThis means Rahim was 36 years old five years ago. To find Rahim's current age, we add 5 years:\n\n\\[\n36 + 5 = 41\n\\]\n\nThus, Rahim is currently 41 years old. The correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, how old is Rahim now?\n\nHmm. So, let's break this down. I need to find Rahim's current age. The information given is about their ages five years ago.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say Raj's current age is R, and Rahim's current age is H. Wait, but wait, the problem already tells me that Raj is 17 now, so R is 17. So I don't need to find R, I need to find H.\n\nFive years back, their ages would have been R-5 and H-5, respectively. Because if you subtract five years from their current ages, that's their age five years ago.\n\nThe problem states that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, the age of Raj five years ago (R-5) equals one-third of Rahim's age five years ago (H-5). So I can write that as an equation:\n\nR - 5 = (1/3) * (H - 5)\n\nSince I know R is 17, I can substitute that into the equation:\n\n17 - 5 = (1/3) * (H -5)\n\nCalculating 17 minus 5 gives me 12. So:\n\n12 = (1/3) * (H -5)\n\nNow I need to solve for H. Let's get rid of the fraction. If I multiply both sides by 3, I get:\n\n12 * 3 = H -5\n\n12 *3 is 36, so:\n\n36 = H -5\n\nNow, add 5 to both sides to solve for H:\n\n36 +5 = H\n\nWhich gives H = 41.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when setting up equations, it's easy to mix up the order.\n\nSo, five years ago, Raj was 12 (since 17-5=12). At that time, he was one-third as old as Rahim. So if Raj was 12, then Rahim must have been 3 times that age. 12 *3 is 36. So five years ago, Rahim was 36. That means now, five years later, he's 36 +5 =41.\n\nYes, that seems correct.
