      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a room's height and semi-perimeter, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Hmm, that's a ratio. So I guess height (h) divided by semi-perimeter (s) is 2/5. So h/s = 2/5, which means h = (2/5)s. Got that.\n\nThen, it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh, and there's an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows, which I think means that area isn't covered by the paper. So I need to calculate the area of the walls, subtract the 15 sq.m, and then relate that to the cost and the dimensions.\n\nWait, papering the walls\u2014so the area covered by the paper would be the total wall area minus the doors and windows. So first, let's think about the cost. The paper costs Rs.2 per meter, and the total cost is Rs.260. So the total length of paper used would be cost divided by price per meter. So 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Oh wait, but the paper is 50cm wide, so I should convert that to meters. 50cm is 0.5 meters. \n\nSo the area of the paper used is length * width. The paper's length is 130 meters, width is 0.5 meters. So 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m. But wait, this is the area of paper, but the actual wall area is 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m? Because the doors and windows take up 15 sq.m and aren't covered. Or wait, no\u2014actually, the paper covers (wall area - 15), so the area of paper is equal to (wall area - 15). So 65 = (wall area) - 15. Therefore, wall area = 80 sq.m.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The cost is for the paper used on the walls. The paper's area is 65 sq.m, which covers the walls minus the 15 sq.m. So yes, 65 = wall_area - 15 \u2192 wall_area = 80.\n\nNow, the wall area is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, right? Because each wall has area length \u00d7 height, and the total is the perimeter times height. So perimeter \u00d7 h = 80.\n\nWait, but wait. The semi-perimeter is s. Oh wait, no\u2014the problem says the height to the semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. So h/s = 2/5. So s = (5/2)h.\n\nWait, but the perimeter is 2*(length + width). The semi-perimeter is (length + width). So if s is the semi-perimeter, then the perimeter is 2s.\n\nSo the wall area would be perimeter \u00d7 height = 2s * h. But we have 2s * h = 80. But from the ratio, h = (2/5)s. So substituting h into the equation: 2s * (2/5)s = 80.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 2s*(2/5 s) = (4/5)s\u00b2 = 80. So s\u00b2 = (80 *5)/4 = (400)/4 = 100. So s = sqrt(100) = 10 meters.\n\nWait, but s is the semi-perimeter, which is (length + width). So (l + w) = 10 meters.\n\nThen, h = (2/5)*s = (2/5)*10 = 4 meters. So the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Cost is Rs.260, paper is Rs.2 per meter. So 260 / 2 = 130 meters of paper. Paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5m. So paper area is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.\n\n2. This area covers the walls minus doors and windows (15 sq.m). So wall area = 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m.\n\n3. Wall area is perimeter \u00d7 height. So perimeter \u00d7 h = 80.\n\n4. From the ratio h/s = 2/5, so h = (2/5)s. Also, since s is semi-perimeter, perimeter is 2s. So perimeter is 2s.\n\n5. Substituting into the equation: 2s * h = 80 \u2192 2s*(2/5 s) = 80 \u2192 (4/5)s\u00b2 =80 \u2192 s\u00b2 = 100 \u2192 s=10.\n\n6. Then, h = (2/5)*10 =4 m.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So the height is 4 meters, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a room's height and semi-perimeter. Hmm, I need to find the height. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2:5. Oh right, the semi-perimeter of a room would probably be half the perimeter, but wait, wait. Wait, the room is a rectangle, right? So the perimeter is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Oh yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo height (h) : semi-perimeter (s) = 2:5. So h/s = 2/5, which means h = (2/5)*s. So if I can find s, I can find h.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh, and they allowed 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So I think the cost is for the area of the paper used, excluding the doors and windows.\n\nWait, let me break it down. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter of paper is Rs.2. So the cost depends on the length of the paper used.\n\nWait, but how much paper is used? The area of the walls minus doors and windows. So the area of the walls is the perimeter multiplied by the height, right? But since it's a rectangle, the area would be 2*(l + w)*h. But wait, that's the total wall area including all four walls. Then subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nWait, but the paper is 50 cm wide. So the area of the paper used would be the length of the paper (in meters) multiplied by its width (0.5 m). So the cost is based on the area of the paper, which is (length of paper * 0.5 m) * cost per meter? Or wait, the cost is Rs.2 per meter of the paper, so perhaps the cost is 2 * (length of paper in meters) because the width is 0.5 m. Wait, no, maybe the cost is calculated per meter of the paper, regardless of width.\n\nWait, let me think. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of the paper. So each meter of the paper (which is 1m in length and 0.5m in width) costs Rs.2. So the area of the paper used is (length in meters) * 0.5 m, and the cost is 2 * length in meters.\n\nSo the area of the paper used is (length in meters) * 0.5, and the cost is 2 * length in meters.\n\nWait, but the cost is given as Rs.260. So 2 * (length in meters) = 260. So length in meters = 260 / 2 = 130 meters. So the length of the paper used is 130 meters.\n\nBut the area of the paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m. So the area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is 65 sq.m.\n\nWait, but the area of the walls is the area covered by the paper, which is 65 sq.m. But the actual wall area is 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m, because 15 is subtracted for doors and windows. Wait, no, wait. No, because the 15 sq.m is the area not covered by the paper. So the paper covers (total wall area) minus 15.\n\nSo the area of the paper is (total wall area) - 15. Because the paper is used to cover the walls, but 15 is subtracted as doors and windows.\n\nSo, (total wall area) = (paper area) + 15. So the total wall area is 65 +15 = 80 sq.m.\n\nWait, but wait, the paper area is 65, which is the area that's being covered. So the total wall area (including doors and windows) is 65 +15 =80. So 80 sq.m is the total wall area.\n\nBut the wall area is calculated as 2*(length + width)*height. So 2*(l + w)*h =80.\n\nBut we also know that h/s =2/5, where s is the semi-perimeter. Wait, s is the semi-perimeter, which is (l + w). So s = l + w.\n\nSo h = (2/5)*s = (2/5)(l +w).\n\nSo substituting h into the wall area equation: 2*(l +w)*h =80.\n\nBut h is (2/5)(l +w), so substituting:\n\n2*(l +w)*(2/5)(l +w) =80.\n\nLet me compute that. 2*(l +w)^2 * (2/5) =80.\n\nMultiply the terms: 2*(2/5) =4/5. So (4/5)(l +w)^2 =80.\n\nSo (l +w)^2 = (80 *5)/4 = (400)/4=100.\n\nSo (l +w)^2=100 \u2192 l +w =10 meters. Because length and width are positive, so s =10.\n\nThen h = (2/5)*10 =4 meters. So the height is 4 meters. That's option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So the semi-perimeter is 10 meters, so h is 4 m.\n\nThen the wall area is 2*(l +w)*h=2*10*4=80, which matches. Then the paper area is 80 -15=65. So the paper area is 65 sq.m. The paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length needed is 65 / 0.5 =130 m. The cost is 130 m * 2 Rs/m =260 Rs, which matches the given cost.

So the area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is 65 sq.m.\n\nWait, but the area of the walls is the area covered by the paper, which is 65 sq.m. But the actual wall area is 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m, because 15 is subtracted for doors and windows. Wait, no, wait. No, because the 15 sq.m is the area not covered by the paper. So the paper covers (total wall area) minus 15.\n\nSo the area of the paper is (total wall area) - 15. Because the paper is used to cover the walls, but 15 is subtracted as doors and windows.\n\nSo, (total wall area) = (paper area) + 15. So the total wall area is 65 +15 = 80 sq.m.\n\nWait, but wait, the paper area is 65, which is the area that's being covered. So the total wall area (including doors and windows) is 65 +15 =80.

So the height is 4 meters. That's option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So the semi-perimeter is 10 meters, so h is 4 m.\n\nThen the wall area is 2*(l +w)*h=2*10*4=80, which matches. Then the paper area is 80 -15=65. So the paper area is 65 sq.m. The paper is 0.5 m wide, so the length needed is 65 / 0.5 =130 m. The cost is 130 m * 2 Rs/m =260 Rs, which matches the given cost. So everything checks out.\n\nSo the answer is C)4m.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of papering the walls. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Given Ratios and Relationships**:  \n   - The height-to-semi-perimeter ratio is \\( h:s = 2:5 \\), where \\( s = l + w \\) (semi-perimeter of the room).  \n   - From the ratio, \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}s \\).  \n\n2. **Cost of Papering**:  \n   - The total cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.  \n   - The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs. 2 per meter.  \n   - The length of paper used can be calculated as \\( \\text{length of paper} = \\frac{\\text{cost}}{\\text{cost per meter}} = \\frac{260}{2} = 130 \\, \\text{m} \\).  \n   - The area of the paper used is \\( \\text{length of paper} \\times \\text{width of paper} = 130 \\times 0.5 = 65 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\).  \n\n3. **Total Wall Area**:  \n   - The total wall area (excluding doors and windows) is \\( 65 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\).  \n   - Including the area for doors and windows (15 sq.m), the total wall area is \\( 65 + 15 = 80 \\, \\text{sq.m} \\).  \n\n4. **Relating Wall Area to Dimensions**:  \n   - The total wall area is given by \\( 2(l + w)h = 80 \\).  \n   - Substituting \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}s \\) and \\( s = l + w \\), we get:  \n     \\[\n     2s \\cdot \\frac{2}{5}s = 80\n     \\]  \n     Simplifying:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{5}s^2 = 80 \\implies s^2 = 100 \\implies s = 10 \\, \\text{m}.\n     \\]  \n   - Thus, \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}s = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\).  \n\n5. **Verification**:  \n   - Substituting \\( s = 10 \\, \\text{m} \\) and \\( h = 4 \\, \\text{m} \\) into the wall area equation:  \n     \\[\n     2(l + w)h = 2 \\times 10 \\times 4 = 80 \\, \\text{sq.m}.\n     \\]  \n   - The calculations match the given conditions, confirming the solution.  \n\nThe height of the room is **4 meters**.  \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down what I know.\n\nThe problem says that the height of a room is in the ratio 2:5 with its semi-perimeter. Hmm, wait, wait. So the ratio is height to semi-perimeter. So if I let the height be 2x, then the semi-perimeter must be 5x. Got it.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh right, and they subtract an area of 15 square meters for doors and windows. So I need to calculate the total wall area first, then subtract 15, and then figure out how much paper was used.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, the cost. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper costs Rs.2 per meter. So the total length of paper used is cost divided by price per meter. So 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Wait, 130 meters of paper. But the paper is 50 cm wide, so the area of the paper used is length multiplied by width. Wait, paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So area = 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. But this area is the area that covers the walls, right? But wait, the problem states that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So the actual wall area is 65 m\u00b2 plus 15 m\u00b2? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The paper is used to cover the walls, but doors and windows aren't covered. So the area of the paper (65 m\u00b2) equals the total wall area minus the area of doors and windows. So:\n\nPaper area = Wall area - doors and windows area.\n\nSo 65 = Wall area - 15. Therefore, Wall area = 65 +15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nSo the total area of the walls is 80 m\u00b2.\n\nBut the walls are the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Oh wait, because the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth), and the area of the walls would be perimeter * height. But wait, the problem mentions semi-perimeter. Oh right, earlier I noted the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nSo semi-perimeter (S) is (length + breadth). So the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2S. So the area of the walls is perimeter * height / 2? Wait, no, the walls are four walls. The total area is 2*(length + breadth)*height. Which is the same as perimeter * height.\n\nWait, no: perimeter is 2*(l + b). So walls area is 2*(l +b)*h. Which is perimeter * h. But the semi-perimeter is (l + b) = S. So perimeter is 2S. So walls area = 2S * h.\n\nWait, but earlier, I have the ratio h:S = 2:5. So h = (2/5) S. Or wait, h:S is 2:5, meaning h/S = 2/5. So h = (2/5) S.\n\nSo substituting into walls area: 2S * h = 2S * (2/5 S) )= (4/5) S\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the walls area is 80 m\u00b2. So:\n\n(4/5) S\u00b2 = 80.\n\nWait, let me write that equation:\n\n(4/5) * S\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSo solving for S\u00b2: S\u00b2 = 80 * (5/4) = 100.\n\nSo S\u00b2 = 100 \u2192 S = 10 meters.\n\nSo the semi-perimeter S is 10 meters. Since S = (l + b), that's 10.\n\nBut we're asked for the height of the room, which is h = (2/5) S. Because h:S = 2:5.\n\nSo h = (2/5)*10 = 4 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 4m. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost is Rs260, paper is Rs2/m \u2192 260/2 = 130 meters of paper. Paper is 50cm wide \u2192 area is 130 * 0.5 =65 m\u00b2. But this is the area of the walls minus doors and windows (15 m\u00b2). So 65 = wall area -15 \u2192 wall area=80 m\u00b2.\n\n2. The walls area is 2*(l +b)*h. But semi-perimeter S = l +b. So perimeter is 2S. So walls area = 2S * h.\n\n3. The ratio h:S is 2:5 \u2192 h = (2/5) S.\n\nSubstitute into walls area: 2S*(2/5 S) = (4/5) S\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 S\u00b2= (80 *5)/4= 100 \u2192 S=10.\n\nh= (2/5)*10=4 m.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the height is 4 meters. So the correct option is C.\n",

So the ratio is height to semi-perimeter. So if I let the height be 2x, then the semi-perimeter must be 5x. Got it.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. Oh right, and they subtract an area of 15 square meters for doors and windows. So I need to calculate the total wall area first, then subtract 15, and then figure out how much paper was used.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nFirst, the cost. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper costs Rs.2 per meter. So the total length of paper used is cost divided by price per meter. So 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Wait, 130 meters of paper. But the paper is 50 cm wide, so the area of the paper used is length multiplied by width. Wait, paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. So area = 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. But this area is the area that covers the walls, right? But wait, the problem states that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So the actual wall area is 65 m\u00b2 plus 15 m\u00b2? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. The paper is used to cover the walls, but doors and windows aren't covered. So the area of the paper (65 m\u00b2) equals the total wall area minus the area of doors and windows. So:\n\nPaper area = Wall area - doors and windows area.\n\nSo 65 = Wall area - 15. Therefore, Wall area = 65 +15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nSo the total area of the walls is 80 m\u00b2.\n\nBut the walls are the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Oh wait, because the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth), and the area of the walls would be perimeter * height. But wait, the problem mentions semi-perimeter. Oh right, earlier I noted the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5.\n\nSo semi-perimeter (S) is (length + breadth). So the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2S. So the area of the walls is perimeter * height / 2? Wait, no, the walls are four walls. The total area is 2*(length + breadth)*height. Which is the same as perimeter * height.\n\nWait, no: perimeter is 2*(l + b). So walls area is 2*(l +b)*h. Which is perimeter * h. But the semi-perimeter is (l + b) = S. So perimeter is 2S. So walls area = 2S * h.\n\nWait, but earlier, I have the ratio h:S = 2:5. So h = (2/5) S. Or wait, h:S is 2:5, meaning h/S = 2/5. So h = (2/5) S.\n\nSo substituting into walls area: 2S * h = 2S * (2/5 S) )= (4/5) S\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the walls area is 80 m\u00b2. So:\n\n(4/5) S\u00b2 = 80.\n\nWait, let me write that equation:\n\n(4/5) * S\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSo solving for S\u00b2: S\u00b2 = 80 * (5/4) = 100.\n\nSo S\u00b2 = 100 \u2192 S = 10 meters.\n\nSo the semi-perimeter S is 10 meters. Since S = (l + b), that's 10.\n\nBut we're asked for the height of the room, which is h = (2/5) S. Because h:S = 2:5.\n\nSo h = (2/5)*10 = 4 meters.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 4m. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost is Rs260, paper is Rs2/m \u2192 260/2 = 130 meters of paper. Paper is 50cm wide \u2192 area is 130 * 0.5 =65 m\u00b2. But this is the area of the walls minus doors and windows (15 m\u00b2). So 65 = wall area -15 \u2192 wall area=80 m\u00b2.\n\n2. The walls area is 2*(l +b)*h. But semi-perimeter S = l +b. So perimeter is 2S. So walls area = 2S * h.\n\n3. The ratio h:S is 2:5 \u2192 h = (2/5) S.\n\nSubstitute into walls area: 2S*(2/5 S) = (4/5) S\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 S\u00b2= (80 *5)/4= 100 \u2192 S=10.\n\nh= (2/5)*10=4 m.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all these formulas, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Hmm, wait, semi-perimeter usually applies to the perimeter of a triangle, but I guess here they mean the perimeter of the room's floor. Oh right, because a room is a rectangle, so its perimeter is 2*(length + width). But wait, semi-perimeter would be half of that, so (length + width). So the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. So if I let the semi-perimeter be S, and the height be h, then h/S = 2/5, which means h = (2/5)*S. Or S = (5/2)*h. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, costing Rs.2 per meter. And they allow an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So I think this is about the area of the walls minus the doors and windows, which is then covered by the paper.\n\nWait, the cost is for the paper. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2. So the total cost is Rs.260. So perhaps I can find out how much paper was bought.\n\nWait, the cost is based on the length of paper used, right? Because the paper is sold by the meter, and you buy a certain length. So the cost would be (length of paper in meters) multiplied by Rs.2. So if the total cost is 260, then the length bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Because 260 divided by 2 is 130. So the paper length is 130 meters. Oh, and the paper is 0.5 meters wide. So the area of the paper used is length multiplied by width, so 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m.\n\nBut wait, this area of 65 sq.m is the area of the walls that's covered by the paper. But the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, meaning that the actual wall area to be covered is 65 +15 = 80 sq.m? Or wait, no. Because when you paper the walls, the area you need to cover is the total wall area minus the doors and windows. So the paper's area (65) equals the wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The total cost is for the paper, which covers the walls. But you have to subtract the area of doors and windows because they don't need papering. So the area of the paper (65) is equal to the total wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, no, I think it's the other way around. The area that the paper covers is the wall area minus the doors and windows. So the paper's area is 65, which equals the wall area minus 15. So the wall area is 65 +15 =80 sq.m. Because the paper covers 65, and the remaining 15 is the area not covered (doors and windows). So the actual wall area is 65 +15 =80.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the paper covers 65, and 15 is the area not covered. So total wall area is 65 +15 = 80.\n\nSo now, the wall area is 80 sq.m. But the wall area of a room is calculated as the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because each wall's area is length * height, and the perimeter is the sum of all walls, but each pair contributes 2*(length + width) for the perimeter. Wait, no, for four walls, the total area is 2*(length + width)*height. So 2*(l + w)*h = 80.\n\nBut earlier, we had the semi-perimeter S = (l +w), so 2*S = perimeter. So the wall area is 2*(l +w)*h = 2*S*h = 80. But from the ratio, h/S = 2/5, so S = (5/2)h. So substituting into 2*S*h:\n\n2 * (5h/2) * h = 80. Let me compute that. 2*(5h/2) is 5h. So 5h * h =5h\u00b2=80. So h\u00b2=80/5=16. So h = sqrt(16)=4 meters. Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 4m. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost of paper: Rs.260. Paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs.2 per meter. So cost per meter is Rs.2, so the length bought is 260 / 2 =130 meters. The area of paper is length * width =130 m *0.5 m=65 sq.m.\n\n2. The paper covers the walls except doors and windows, which are 15 sq.m. So the paper covers 65, so the actual wall area is 65 +15=80.\n\n3. Wall area is 2*(l +w)*h =80. But S is the semi-perimeter, so S = l +w. So 2*S*h =80.\n\n4. From the ratio, h/S =2/5 \u2192 S = (5/2)h.\n\n5. Substituting into 2*S*h \u2192 2*(5h/2)*h =5h\u00b2=80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4m.\n\nThat seems correct. So the height is 4m, option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all these formulas, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says that the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Hmm, wait, semi-perimeter usually applies to the perimeter of a triangle, but I guess here they mean the perimeter of the room's floor. Oh right, because a room is a rectangle, so its perimeter is 2*(length + width). But wait, semi-perimeter would be half of that, so (length + width). So the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. So if I let the semi-perimeter be S, and the height be h, then h/S = 2/5, which means h = (2/5)*S. Or S = (5/2)*h. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, costing Rs.2 per meter. And they allow an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So I think this is about the area of the walls minus the doors and windows, which is then covered by the paper.\n\nWait, the cost is for the paper. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter is Rs.2. So the total cost is Rs.260. So perhaps I can find out how much paper was bought.\n\nWait, the cost is based on the length of paper used, right? Because the paper is sold by the meter, and you buy a certain length. So the cost would be (length of paper in meters) multiplied by Rs.2. So if the total cost is 260, then the length bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Because 260 divided by 2 is 130. So the paper length is 130 meters. Oh, and the paper is 0.5 meters wide. So the area of the paper used is length multiplied by width, so 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 sq.m.\n\nBut wait, this area of 65 sq.m is the area of the walls that's covered by the paper. But the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, meaning that the actual wall area to be covered is 65 +15 = 80 sq.m? Or wait, no. Because when you paper the walls, the area you need to cover is the total wall area minus the doors and windows. So the paper's area (65) equals the wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The total cost is for the paper, which covers the walls. But you have to subtract the area of doors and windows because they don't need papering. So the area of the paper (65) is equal to the total wall area minus 15.\n\nWait, no, I think it's the other way around. The area that the paper covers is the wall area minus the doors and windows. So the paper's area is 65, which equals the wall area minus 15. So the wall area is 65 +15 =80 sq.m. Because the paper covers 65, and the remaining 15 is the area not covered (doors and windows). So the actual wall area is 65 +15 =80.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the paper covers 65, and 15 is the area not covered. So total wall area is 65 +15 = 80.\n\nSo now, the wall area is 80 sq.m. But the wall area of a room is calculated as the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because each wall's area is length * height, and the perimeter is the sum of all walls, but each pair contributes 2*(length + width) for the perimeter. Wait, no, for four walls, the total area is 2*(length + width)*height. So 2*(l + w)*h = 80.\n\nBut earlier, we had the semi-perimeter S = (l +w), so 2*S = perimeter. So the wall area is 2*(l +w)*h = 2*S*h = 80. But from the ratio, h/S = 2/5, so S = (5/2)h. So substituting into 2*S*h:\n\n2 * (5h/2) * h = 80. Let me compute that. 2*(5h/2) is 5h. So 5h * h =5h\u00b2=80. So h\u00b2=80/5=16. So h = sqrt(16)=4 meters. Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is 4m. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost of paper: Rs.260. Paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs.2 per meter. So cost per meter is Rs.2, so the length bought is 260 / 2 =130 meters. The area of paper is length * width =130 m *0.5 m=65 sq.m.\n\n2. The paper covers the walls except doors and windows, which are 15 sq.m. So the paper covers 65, so the actual wall area is 65 +15=80.\n\n3. Wall area is 2*(l +w)*h =80. But S is the semi-perimeter, so S = l +w. So 2*S*h =80.\n\n4. From the ratio, h/S =2/5 \u2192 S = (5/2)h.\n\n5. Substituting into 2*S*h \u2192 2*(5h/2)*h =5h\u00b2=80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4m.\n\nThat seems correct. So the height is 4m, option C.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the height of a room given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter (2:5) and the cost of wallpapering the walls. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Cost and Paper Area**:  \n   The cost of wallpapering is Rs.260, and the paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) with a cost of Rs.2 per meter. The length of paper purchased is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of paper} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Cost per meter}} = \\frac{260}{2} = 130 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]  \n   The area of the paper is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of paper} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 130 \\times 0.5 = 65 \\, \\text{sq.m}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Wall Area Calculation**:  \n   The problem states that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. Therefore, the total wall area to be covered by the paper is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = \\text{Area of paper} + \\text{Area for doors and windows} = 65 + 15 = 80 \\, \\text{sq.m}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wall Area Formula**:  \n   The total wall area of a rectangular room is given by:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\times \\text{Height}.\n   \\]  \n   Let the semi-perimeter of the room be \\( S = \\text{Length} + \\text{Width} \\). From the ratio \\( \\text{Height} : S = 2 : 5 \\), we have:  \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{5}{2} \\times \\text{Height}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( S \\) into the wall area formula:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times S \\times \\text{Height} = 80.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting \\( S = \\frac{5}{2} \\times \\text{Height} \\):  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{2} \\times \\text{Height}\\right) \\times \\text{Height} = 80.\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times \\text{Height}^2 = 80 \\implies \\text{Height}^2 = \\frac{80}{5} = 16 \\implies \\text{Height} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   The height of the room is \\( 4 \\, \\text{m} \\), which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the height of a room given some ratios and cost details. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter? Oh right, semi-perimeter usually refers to half the perimeter. But wait, which perimeter? Oh, I think it's the perimeter of the floor, which would be the perimeter of the room's base. So, if the room is rectangular, the perimeter would be 2*(length + width), and the semi-perimeter would be (length + width).\n\nThe ratio given is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. So, if I let the height be 2x, then the semi-perimeter is 5x. That means (length + width) = 5x. Got it.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, and the cost is Rs.2 per meter. Also, they allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows, which I guess means that area isn't covered by the paper. So, I need to calculate the area of the walls, subtract the 15 sq.m, and then relate that to the cost.\n\nWait, the walls' area is the lateral surface area. For a rectangular room, that's 2*(length + width)*height. Oh right, because there are two walls of each length and width.\n\nBut wait, when they paper the walls, they might be using the paper to cover the walls minus the doors and windows. So the area of paper used would be (2*(l + w)*h - 15) sq.m.\n\nBut wait, the cost is given as Rs.260. Let me think about how that cost is calculated. The cost depends on the area of paper used and the price per meter. Wait, the paper is sold at Rs.2 per meter. Hmm, but the paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So, each meter of paper covers 0.5 m in width and 1 m in length, so the area per meter is 0.5 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The paper is 50 cm wide, so each strip is 0.5 m wide. So, for each meter length, the area covered is 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost per meter is Rs.2. So, for each square meter of paper, the cost is Rs.2. Because if I buy 1 meter of paper, I get 0.5 m\u00b2, but I'm paying Rs.2. So, the area cost is Rs.2 per 0.5 m\u00b2, which is Rs.4 per m\u00b2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: cost per meter is Rs.2, and each meter gives 0.5 m\u00b2 of area. So, per square meter, the cost is 2 / 0.5 = Rs.4. So the cost per square meter is 4 Rs. Is that right?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate how much area is covered for Rs.260.\n\nWait, the total area of paper used is the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. So:\n\nTotal area to be papered = 2*(l + w)*h - 15.\n\nThe cost is Rs.260, and since the paper costs Rs.2 per meter, but each meter is 0.5 m wide. So, the area covered by the paper would be (cost / rate per meter) * width. Hmm, wait, maybe I should think in terms of how much paper is used in terms of length.\n\nWait, another approach. The area of the walls is 2*(l + w)*h. But doors and windows are 15 m\u00b2, so the area to be covered is (2*(l + w)*h - 15) m\u00b2.\n\nThe paper used has a width of 50 cm (0.5 m). So, the area of the paper used is length * width. The length of paper used would be (2*(l + w)*h -15) / 0.5. Because each strip is 0.5 m wide, so the length needed is total area divided by width.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If the area to be covered is A, and each meter of paper covers 0.5 m\u00b2 (since it's 0.5m wide and 1m long), then the area per meter is 0.5 m\u00b2. So, the number of meters of paper needed is A / 0.5 = 2A.\n\nBut wait, the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So, the cost is (2A) * 2 = 4A. Because each meter costs Rs.2, and we need 2A meters. So, 2A * 2 = 4A Rs. But the total cost is 260 Rs. So:\n\n4A = 260 \u2192 A = 260 /4 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me recheck. The area to be covered is (2*(l +w)*h -15) = A. The paper's area is (length of paper in meters) * 0.5 m. The area of paper is equal to A. So,\n\nlength of paper * 0.5 = A \u2192 length of paper = A / 0.5 = 2A.\n\nThe cost is (length of paper) * Rs.2 per meter. So,\n\nCost = 2A * 2 = 4A.\n\nBut the cost is Rs.260, so 4A = 260 \u2192 A = 65.\n\nSo, A is the area to be covered: 2*(l +w)*h -15 =65 \u2192 2*(l +w)*h = 80 \u2192 (l +w)*h =40.\n\nEarlier, we had from the ratio that (l +w) =5x, and h=2x.\n\nSo, substituting: (5x) * (2x) =40 \u219210x\u00b2=40 \u2192x\u00b2=4 \u2192x=2.\n\nSo x is 2. Therefore, h=2x=4 meters.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So (l +w)=5x=10 meters. h=4 meters.\n\nSo, the area to be covered is 2*(10)*4=80 m\u00b2. Subtract 15 \u219265, which matches what we had earlier. So the cost is 4*65=260, which is correct.\n\nSo, the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about the height of a room based on some given ratios and costs. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the first part says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter? Oh right, semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. So if the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter would be (length + width). So the ratio is height : (length + width) = 2:5. Let me denote height as h, and length + width as s. So h/s = 2/5, which means s = (5/2)h. Got that.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, priced at Rs.2 per meter. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So I need to find the area of the walls first, subtract the 15 sq.m, and then calculate how much paper was used, and from that find the dimensions.\n\nWait, the cost is for the paper. Let's think about how the cost relates to the area. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The price is Rs.2 per meter, so per meter of length of paper. So, the cost per square meter of paper would be... Well, the paper is sold by the meter, and each meter is 0.5m wide. So each meter gives 0.5m\u00b2 of area. So the price per square meter is 2 Rs per 0.5 m\u00b2, which is 4 Rs per m\u00b2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. Each meter of paper is 0.5m wide, so each meter gives 0.5 m\u00b2 of area. So per m\u00b2, the cost is 2 Rs / 0.5 m\u00b2 = 4 Rs/m\u00b2. So the paper costs Rs.4 per square meter. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate the amount of paper used first. The total cost is Rs.260, which is at Rs.2 per meter. So the length of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Since the paper is 0.5m wide, the total area of paper used is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. But we have to subtract the area for doors and windows, which is 15 m\u00b2. So the actual wall area is 65 - 15 = 50 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. No, wait. Because the 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, which are subtracted from the total wall area. So the total paper area used is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. So, the paper's area is 50 m\u00b2. Let me see: cost is Rs.260 = (length of paper in meters) * 2. So length is 130 m. Since each meter is 0.5m wide, the area is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2. But this 65 m\u00b2 is the area of the paper, which covers the walls minus the doors and windows. So, the actual wall area (excluding doors and windows) is 65 m\u00b2. Wait, no, wait. No, the paper is used to cover the walls, but the doors and windows are not covered. So the area of the paper is equal to the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. So, paper area = wall area - 15 m\u00b2. So, 65 m\u00b2 = wall area -15. Therefore, wall area = 65 + 15 = 80 m\u00b2. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the cost accounts for the paper used, which covers the walls, but the doors and windows aren't papered. So the paper's area is equal to the wall area minus the doors and windows. So 65 m\u00b2 = wall area -15. So wall area is 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2. Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nSo the total wall area is 80 m\u00b2. The wall area is the sum of all four walls. For a rectangular room, the area is 2*(length + width)*height. So 2*(l + w)*h =80.\n\nEarlier, we had s = l + w = (5/2)h. So substituting into the equation: 2*s*h =80. So 2*(5/2 h)*h =80. Let's compute that.\n\n2*(5/2 h)*h = (2*(5/2)) *h\u00b2 =5 h\u00b2=80. So 5h\u00b2=80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4 m. Because height can't be negative. So h is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nSo, cost is Rs.260. Paper is 50 cm wide, Rs.2 per meter. So length of paper used is 260/2=130 meters. Area of paper is 130 * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. Then, subtract 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows. So paper area is 65, which is equal to the wall area minus 15. So wall area is 65+15=80 m\u00b2. Correct.\n\nThen, wall area = 2*(l + w)*h =80. And l +w = (5/2)h. So 2*(5/2 h)*h = 5 h\u00b2=80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. Yep, that seems right. So the height is 4 meters, which is option C.\n",

Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter usually refers to the perimeter of a shape, but here it's applied to a room. I think a room is a rectangular shape, so the semi-perimeter would be half the sum of length and breadth. Oh right, for a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth), so semi-perimeter would be (length + breadth). Got it.\n\nSo, height : semi-perimeter = 2 :5. Let's denote height as h and semi-perimeter as s. So, h/s = 2/5. That means h = (2/5)*s. Or s = (5/2)*h. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide and costs Rs.2 per meter. They allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I need to find the height of the room.\n\nWait, wallpapering the walls means we're calculating the lateral surface area, excluding the floor and ceiling. But the problem says that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows. So, the total area of the walls minus 15 equals the area covered by the paper?\n\nOr perhaps, the area of the walls (without doors/windows) is what's being covered by the paper. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nThe cost is based on the area of the paper used. The paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. Wait, I'm not sure if that's per meter length or per square meter. Oh, the cost is Rs.2 per meter, which probably refers to per linear meter. So, if you buy X meters of paper, it'll cost 2*X Rs. \n\nSo, the total cost is Rs.260. So, the amount of paper used is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Because each meter costs 2 Rs, so 260 /2 = 130 meters of paper used.\n\nEach paper has a width of 0.5 meters. So, the area of the paper used is length * width. Wait, but the paper is being unrolled in a certain way. The area of the paper used would be length (in meters) multiplied by width (0.5 m). So, 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 square meters.\n\nWait, but the paper covers the walls, but we have to subtract the area for doors and windows. So, the actual wall area (excluding doors) is 65 m\u00b2 minus the 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows? No, wait, no. Because the 15 sq.m is the area allowed for doors and windows, meaning that the paper covers the remaining area.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total area of the walls (without doors/windows) is equal to the area of the paper used. Because the paper covers the walls, and doors and windows are subtracted. Or is the 15 sq.m the area that's not covered by the paper? \n\nThe problem says it allows an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think the paper is covering the walls, but the doors and windows are subtracted from the total wall area. So, the paper area used is (total wall area) minus 15 sq.m.\n\nWait, no, because when you paper the walls, you don't put paper over the doors and windows. So, the area of the paper is equal to the total wall area minus the doors and windows. So, if the paper covers an area of (A - 15), where A is the total wall area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total wall area is A, and the paper used is A - 15. But then, the paper area (length \u00d7 width) equals A -15.\n\nWait, the paper's area is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. So, 65 m\u00b2 = (Total wall area) - 15 m\u00b2. Because the paper covers the walls except the doors and windows, which take up 15 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, total wall area = 65 + 15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nTotal wall area is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because the walls are four, and each pair has the same length and height. So, perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(l + b). So, the area of the four walls is 2*(l + b)*h. But wait, wait. No, the semi-perimeter is (l + b). So, the total wall area is 2*(l + b)*h = 2*s*h.\n\nWait, no. Because semi-perimeter s = l + b. So, the perimeter is 2s. So, the area is perimeter * height = 2s * h.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total area of the four walls is 2*(length + breadth)*height. Which is the same as perimeter * height. So, if s is the semi-perimeter, then the perimeter is 2s. So, area = 2s * h.\n\nWait, but earlier I have h/s = 2/5, so h = (2/5)s.\n\nSo, substituting, the area is 2s * (2/5)s = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, I found that the total wall area (including doors and windows) is 80 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, 80 = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\nWait, solving for s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 80 * 5 /4 = 100.\n\nSo s\u00b2 = 100 \u2192 s = 10 meters.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the semi-perimeter is 10 m, so perimeter is 20 m. That seems a bit big, but let's proceed.\n\nThen, h = (2/5)*s = (2/5)*10 = 4 m.\n\nSo, the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost is Rs.260. Paper is 50 cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. So, meters bought: 260/2 = 130 meters.\n\n2. Each meter is 0.5 m wide, so area of paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\n3. This area is the wall area minus 15 m\u00b2 (doors and windows). So, wall area = 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2.\n\n4. Wall area = 2*(l + b)*h = 2s * h.\n\n5. Given h/s = 2/5 \u2192 h= (2/5)s.\n\n6. Wall area = 2s*(2/5)s = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\n7. (4/5)s\u00b2 =80 \u2192 s\u00b2 = 80 *5 /4 = 100 \u2192 s=10.\n\n8. h= (2/5)*10=4m.\n\nThat seems correct. So the answer should be option C)4m.\n",

Because each meter costs 2 Rs, so 260 /2 = 130 meters of paper used.\n\nEach paper has a width of 0.5 meters. So, the area of the paper used is length * width. Wait, but the paper is being unrolled in a certain way. The area of the paper used would be length (in meters) multiplied by width (0.5 m). So, 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 square meters.\n\nWait, but the paper covers the walls, but we have to subtract the area for doors and windows. So, the actual wall area (excluding doors) is 65 m\u00b2 minus the 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows? No, wait, no. Because the 15 sq.m is the area allowed for doors and windows, meaning that the paper covers the remaining area.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total area of the walls (without doors/windows) is equal to the area of the paper used. Because the paper covers the walls, and doors and windows are subtracted. Or is the 15 sq.m the area that's not covered by the paper? \n\nThe problem says it allows an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, I think the paper is covering the walls, but the doors and windows are subtracted from the total wall area. So, the paper area used is (total wall area) minus 15 sq.m.\n\nWait, no, because when you paper the walls, you don't put paper over the doors and windows. So, the area of the paper is equal to the total wall area minus the doors and windows. So, if the paper covers an area of (A - 15), where A is the total wall area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total wall area is A, and the paper used is A - 15. But then, the paper area (length \u00d7 width) equals A -15.\n\nWait, the paper's area is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. So, 65 m\u00b2 = (Total wall area) - 15 m\u00b2. Because the paper covers the walls except the doors and windows, which take up 15 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, total wall area = 65 + 15 = 80 m\u00b2.\n\nTotal wall area is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because the walls are four, and each pair has the same length and height. So, perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(l + b). So, the area of the four walls is 2*(l + b)*h. But wait, wait. No, the semi-perimeter is (l + b). So, the total wall area is 2*(l + b)*h = 2*s*h.\n\nWait, no. Because semi-perimeter s = l + b. So, the perimeter is 2s. So, the area is perimeter * height = 2s * h.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total area of the four walls is 2*(length + breadth)*height. Which is the same as perimeter * height. So, if s is the semi-perimeter, then the perimeter is 2s. So, area = 2s * h.\n\nWait, but earlier I have h/s = 2/5, so h = (2/5)s.\n\nSo, substituting, the area is 2s * (2/5)s = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\nBut earlier, I found that the total wall area (including doors and windows) is 80 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, 80 = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\nWait, solving for s\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 = 80 * 5 /4 = 100.\n\nSo s\u00b2 = 100 \u2192 s = 10 meters.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the semi-perimeter is 10 m, so perimeter is 20 m. That seems a bit big, but let's proceed.\n\nThen, h = (2/5)*s = (2/5)*10 = 4 m.\n\nSo, the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Cost is Rs.260. Paper is 50 cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. So, meters bought: 260/2 = 130 meters.\n\n2. Each meter is 0.5 m wide, so area of paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2.\n\n3. This area is the wall area minus 15 m\u00b2 (doors and windows). So, wall area = 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2.\n\n4. Wall area = 2*(l + b)*h = 2s * h.\n\n5. Given h/s = 2/5 \u2192 h= (2/5)s.\n\n6. Wall area = 2s*(2/5)s = (4/5)s\u00b2.\n\n7. (4/5)s\u00b2 =80 \u2192 s\u00b2 = 80 *5 /4 = 100 \u2192 s=10.\n\n8. h= (2/5)*10=4m.\n\nThat seems correct. So the answer should be option C)4m.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the height of a room based on given ratios and cost details for wallpapering the walls. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Given Ratios**: The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Let the height be \\( h \\) and the semi-perimeter be \\( s \\). This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{h}{s} = \\frac{2}{5} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad h = \\frac{2}{5}s.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Wallpaper Cost**: The cost to paper the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m) and costs Rs.2 per meter. The total length of paper used is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of paper} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Cost per meter}} = \\frac{260}{2} = 130 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n   The area of the paper is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of paper} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 130 \\times 0.5 = 65 \\, \\text{m}^2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adjust for Doors and Windows**: The problem states that 15 m\u00b2 is allowed for doors and windows. Thus, the total wall area (excluding doors and windows) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = \\text{Area of paper} + \\text{Area for doors and windows} = 65 + 15 = 80 \\, \\text{m}^2.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Wall Area Formula**: The total wall area of a rectangular room is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\times \\text{Height}.\n   \\]\n   Since the semi-perimeter \\( s = \\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth} \\), the formula becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = 2s \\times h.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}s \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wall area} = 2s \\times \\frac{2}{5}s = \\frac{4}{5}s^2.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( s \\)**: Equating the total wall area to 80 m\u00b2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{5}s^2 = 80 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s^2 = \\frac{80 \\times 5}{4} = 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = 10 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find Height**: Using \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}s \\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\, \\text{m}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the height of the room is **4 meters**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the height of a room given some ratios and costs for wallpapering. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem says the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter of what? Oh, I think it refers to the semi-perimeter of the floor, which would be the perimeter divided by two. Because for a room, the floor is usually a rectangle, so the semi-perimeter would be (2*(length + width))/2 = length + width. So, the ratio is height : (length + width) = 2:5. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, let me denote the height as h and the semi-perimeter as s. Then h/s = 2/5. That means s = (5/2) * h.\n\nNext, the cost part. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, costs Rs.2 per meter. And they've allowed an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So, the total area covered by the paper is the area of the walls minus the area of the doors and windows.\n\nWait, the walls. The walls are the four sides of the room. The area of the walls is the perimeter multiplied by the height. But since the semi-perimeter is (length + width), the full perimeter is 2*(length + width) = 2s. So the area of the four walls is perimeter * height = 2s * h.\n\nBut wait, we have to subtract the area for doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m. So the area of the paper used is (2s * h) - 15.\n\nNow, the cost calculation. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. So, the cost is based on the length of the paper used. How much paper is used?\n\nThe area of the paper is (length of paper) * (width of paper). Let me denote the length of paper used as L. So, the area is L * 0.5.\n\nBut this area equals the area of the walls minus the doors and windows. So, L * 0.5 = (2s * h) - 15.\n\nThe cost is Rs.260, which is the area of the paper multiplied by the cost per meter. Wait, no. Wait, the cost is per meter of the paper, which is Rs.2 per meter. So, the cost is (L) * 2 = 260. So, L = 260 / 2 = 130 meters.\n\nSo, from the area equation: L * 0.5 = (2s * h) -15. Substituting L=130:\n\n130 * 0.5 = (2s * h) -15 \u2192 65 = (2s * h) -15 \u2192 2s * h = 80 \u2192 s * h = 40.\n\nBut we have another equation from the ratio. s = (5/2) h. So substituting s into s*h=40:\n\n(5/2 h) * h = 40 \u2192 (5/2) h\u00b2 = 40 \u2192 h\u00b2 = (40 * 2)/5 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4 meters. Oh, because h can't be negative.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the area of the paper is 130 m * 0.5 m = 65 m\u00b2. The area of the walls is 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2. Because the paper covers 65, and 15 is subtracted, so the walls are 65 +15 =80. So, 2s*h =80.\n\nFrom the ratio, s= (5/2)h. So 2*(5h/2)*h=80 \u2192 5h\u00b2=80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. So the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. So the answer should be C.\n",
