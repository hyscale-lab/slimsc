      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a tricky wording. I think it means that the difference between Q's age and R's age is the same as the difference between Q's age and T's age, but in the opposite direction. Like, Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, and older than T by the same number of years. So, if I denote that difference as, say, x, then R is x years older than Q, and Q is x years older than T. \n\nSo, let me write that down. Let me assign variables to their ages. Let me call Q's age Q, R's age R, and T's age T. \n\nFrom the first part: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference R - Q is equal to Q - T. So, R - Q = Q - T. \n\nLet me rearrange that equation to see if I can find a relationship. If I add Q to both sides and add T to both sides, I get R + T = 2Q. Oh, that's interesting. So R plus T equals twice Q's age. \n\nThe next part of the problem says that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So R + T = 50. \n\nWait, but from the first part, R + T = 2Q. So substituting that in, 2Q = 50. So Q must be 25. Because 2Q equals 50, so Q is 25. \n\nSo, Q is 25. But the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. Hmm. Let's think about that. \n\nWe know that R - Q = Q - T, which is the same as R = Q + (Q - T). Or, wait, another way: Let's express R in terms of Q and T. From R - Q = Q - T, we can rearrange to R = Q + (Q - T). But maybe that's complicating it. \n\nWait, since R + T = 50, and R - Q = Q - T, let's see. Let me solve for R in terms of Q. Since R = Q + (Q - T), but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, since R + T = 50, and from the first equation, R = 2Q - T. Wait, because R + T = 2Q, so R = 2Q - T. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Let me think about the difference between R and Q. The difference R - Q is equal to Q - T. So, let me call this difference x. So, R = Q + x, and Q = T + x. So, T = Q - x. \n\nSo, R = Q + x, and T = Q - x. Then, R + T = (Q + x) + (Q - x) ) = 2Q. Which we already knew, since R + T is 50, so 2Q is 50, Q is 25. \n\nBut the question is about the difference between R and Q's age. R is Q + x, so R - Q = x. So the difference is x. But from the problem statement, I don't think we can find the exact value of x. Because all we know is that R + T is 50, but without more information, x could be any value. \n\nWait, let me think again. We have R = Q + x, T = Q - x. So, R + T = (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 2Q. So, 2Q =50, so Q=25. But we don't know what x is. So R is 25 + x, T is 25 -x. \n\nThe sum R + T is 50, which holds for any x. So, the value of x isn't fixed. For example, x could be 10, making R=35 and T=15. Or x could be 20, making R=45 and T=5. Or x could be 5, making R=30 and T=20. \n\nSo, in all these cases, the difference between R and Q is x, which varies. So, the difference between R and Q's age isn't determined by the given information. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, can't be determined because x can be any value, as long as R and T add up to 50. \n\nLooking back at the options: A is 22, B 27, C 29, D cannot be determined, E none of the above. So, the answer would be D, because there's not enough information to determine x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference is the same, but the actual ages could vary. \n\nSo, unless there's a way to find x from the given data, which I don't think there is because the sum R+T=50 is all we have, and that only gives us Q=25. So, without knowing R or T's individual ages, we can't find x. \n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is x, which could be any value as long as R and T add up to 50. Therefore, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this age-related problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to these types of problems, so I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me parse it. So, Q's age difference from R is the same as his age difference from T, but in the opposite direction. Like, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, then Q is older than T by the same number. So, the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. That makes sense.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's assign variables to their ages. Let me denote Q's age as Q, R's age as R, and T's age as T. \n\nSo the first part of the problem translates to: Q - T = R - Q. Wait, is that right? Because if Q is older than T by a certain amount, then R is older than Q by the same. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, R - Q = Q - T. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo equation one is R - Q = Q - T. Let me rearrange that. Adding Q to both sides and adding T to both sides: R + T = 2Q. Oh, wait, because if I have R - Q = Q - T, adding Q to both sides gives R = 2Q - T. Alternatively, adding both sides: R + T = 2Q. That's a key equation.\n\nThe second part of the problem says that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, R + T = 50. Oh, that's helpful. So I can substitute that into the equation I got earlier.\n\nFrom equation one: R + T = 2Q. And the second equation is R + T =50. So substituting, 50 = 2Q. So, 2Q =50. Therefore, Q =25. \n\nWait, so Q is 25. But the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, R - Q. From the first equation, R - Q = Q - T. But since R + T =50 and Q is 25, maybe I can find R and T's individual ages or at least the difference.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me express R and T in terms of Q. From R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T, which I can write as R = 2Q - T. Hmm, but I think I can find R - Q from the equations.\n\nWait, if Q is 25, then from R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T. Let me plug Q=25 into R -25 =25 - T. So, R -25 =25 - T \u2192 R + T =50. Which is consistent with the given information. But that doesn't give me new information.\n\nWait, but I need R - Q. Since Q is 25, R - Q is R -25. But from R + T =50, I can express T as 50 - R. Let's see: \n\nFrom R -25 =25 - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - (50 - R). Let me compute the right side: 25 -50 + R \u2192 R -25. So R -25 = R -25. Which is an identity. So that doesn't help me find the actual values of R and T.\n\nHmm, so I can't determine R or T individually because there are infinite solutions that satisfy R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T. For example, if R is 30, then T is 20. If R is 35, T is 15. Etc. But in all cases, R - Q would be R -25. So, let's see what R - Q is in terms of Q.\n\nWait, from the first equation: R - Q = Q - T. And since Q is 25, R -25 =25 - T. But T =50 - R. So substituting that in: R -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R-25 = 25 -50 + R \u2192 R-25 = R -25. Again, same as before.\n\nSo, I can't find the exact value of R - Q. Because R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50 and the differences from Q are equal. So, for example:\n\nCase 1: Let's say R is 30, T is 20. Then R - Q =5, Q - T=5. So R - Q is 5.\n\nCase 2: R is 35, T is 15. Then R - Q =10, Q - T=10.\n\nCase 3: R is 25, T is 25. Then R - Q=0, Q-T=0.\n\nWait, so R - Q can be any value depending on R and T's specific ages. But the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. But from the given information, I can't determine it exactly because multiple scenarios fit.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Wait, we found that Q is 25. So from R + T=50 and R -25 =25 - T, which implies R -25 =25 - (50 - R) \u2192 R-25 =25 -50 + R \u2192 R-25 = R-25. So that doesn't give any new info. So, R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50.\n\nThus, the difference R - Q is R -25, which can vary. For example:\n\nIf R is 30, difference is 5.\n\nIf R is 40, difference is 15.\n\nIf R is 25, difference is 0.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q can be any value, so the problem can't determine it definitely. So the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. Wait, but in the options, option E is None of the above. So, wait, in the problem, the question is what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\n\nWait, but from the given data, can I find a specific value? Let's see.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the equations.\n\nWe have R + T =50.\n\nWe have R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWhich is R + T =2Q \u2192 50=2Q \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is definitely 25. But what about R and T?\n\nR and T can be any pair adding to 50. So, R could be 25, T 25. Then R-Q=0. Or R could be 30, T 20 \u2192 R-Q=5. Or R=40, T=10 \u2192 R-Q=15.\n\nThus, the difference R-Q can be any value between 0 and 50, but no definite value. So, the problem cannot be determined from the given data.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n",

For example:\n\nIf R is 30, difference is 5.\n\nIf R is 40, difference is 15.\n\nIf R is 25, difference is 0.\n\nSo, the difference between R and Q can be any value, so the problem can't determine it definitely. So the answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. Wait, but in the options, option E is None of the above. So, wait, in the problem, the question is what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\n\nWait, but from the given data, can I find a specific value? Let's see.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the equations.\n\nWe have R + T =50.\n\nWe have R - Q = Q - T.\n\nWhich is R + T =2Q \u2192 50=2Q \u2192 Q=25.\n\nSo, Q is definitely 25. But what about R and T?\n\nR and T can be any pair adding to 50. So, R could be 25, T 25. Then R-Q=0. Or R could be 30, T 20 \u2192 R-Q=5. Or R=40, T=10 \u2192 R-Q=15.\n\nThus, the difference R-Q can be any value between 0 and 50, but no definite value. So, the problem cannot be determined from the given data.\n\nSo the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\n\nThe problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, which translates to the equation:\n\n\\[\nR - Q = Q - T\n\\]\n\nRearranging this, we get:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 2Q\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the problem provides the information that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:\n\n\\[\nR + T = 50\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R + T = 50 \\) into \\( R + T = 2Q \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n50 = 2Q \\implies Q = 25\n\\]\n\nNow, the question asks for the difference between R and Q's age, which is \\( R - Q \\). From the equation \\( R - Q = Q - T \\), we know that \\( R - Q \\) is equal to \\( Q - T \\). However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact values of R and T individually. While \\( Q \\) is fixed at 25, \\( R \\) and \\( T \\) can vary as long as their sum is 50. For example:\n\n- If \\( R = 30 \\), then \\( T = 20 \\), and \\( R - Q = 5 \\).\n- If \\( R = 35 \\), then \\( T = 15 \\), and \\( R - Q = 10 \\).\n- If \\( R = 25 \\), then \\( T = 25 \\), and \\( R - Q = 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( R - Q \\) can take multiple values depending on the specific ages of R and T, the difference between R and Q's age cannot be determined definitively from the given information.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

The question says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I think I need to break it down.\n\nSo, let's parse that sentence. \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" So, the difference between Q and R is the same as the difference between Q and T, but one is older and the other younger. Wait, maybe I should set up some equations here.\n\nLet me assign variables to each person's age. Let's say Q is Q years old, R is R years old, and T is T years old. Now, the first part says Q is younger than R by a certain amount. Let's call that difference 'x'. So, Q = R - x. Because Q is younger than R by x years.\n\nThe same statement also says Q is older than T by the same amount 'x'. So, Q = T + x. Because Q is older than T by x years.\n\nSo from these two equations, I can write:\nQ = R - x\nQ = T + x\n\nSince both equal Q, I can set them equal to each other: R - x = T + x. Let me rearrange this. R - T = 2x. So, the difference between R and T is 2x. But wait, the problem also says that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. So, R + T = 50.\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n1. R - T = 2x\n2. R + T = 50\n\nI think I can solve these two equations to find R and T in terms of x. Let me add these two equations together. Adding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\n(R - T) + (R + T) = 2x + 50\n2R = 50 + 2x\nDivide both sides by 2: R = 25 + x\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(R + T) - (R - T) = 50 - 2x\n2T = 50 - 2x\nDivide by 2: T = 25 - x\n\nSo, R is 25 + x, T is 25 - x, and Q is T + x, which would be (25 - x) + x = 25.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this age-related problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I think I need to parse that sentence. So, Q's age difference from R is the same as his age difference from T, but in the opposite direction. So, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he's older than T by the same number. \n\nLet me try to represent this with some variables. Let's let Q's age be q, R's age be r, and T's age be t. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, mathematically, that would be r - q = q - t. Because R is older than Q by (r - q) years, and Q is older than T by (q - t) years. So, these two differences are equal. \n\nSo, equation one: r - q = q - t. Let me rearrange that. If I bring the q's to one side and the others to the opposite, I get r + t = 2q. So, 2q equals r plus t. \n\nThe problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, equation two: r + t = 50. \n\nWait, from equation one, r + t = 2q, and equation two says r + t is 50. So substituting, 2q = 50. So, q = 25. That's Q's age. \n\nBut the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, what's r - q? Since we know q is 25, and r + t is 50. Let's think.\n\nWait, from equation one, r - q = q - t. Let me see. Let's compute r - q. Since r + t =50 and 2q=50, q=25. So r + t=50, and we can express t as 50 - r. \n\nSo, let's plug into equation one: r -25 = 25 - t. But t is 50 - r, so substituting: r -25 = 25 - (50 - r). \n\nLet me compute the right side: 25 -50 + r = -25 + r. So the equation is r -25 = r -25. Hmm, that simplifies to 0=0. Which means that the equation is an identity, and it doesn't give me any new information beyond what I already know.\n\nSo, all I know is that Q is 25, and R plus T is 50. But I don't know R's individual age or T's. So, R could be any value as long as T is 50 - R. For example, if R is 30, then T is 20. Then r - q is 5, and q - t is 5. So that works. \n\nBut wait, could R be 40 and T 10? Then r - q is 15, and q - t is 15. That also works. So the difference between R and Q is 15 in that case. Alternatively, if R is 25, then T is 25. Then r - q is 0, and q - t is 0. So in that case, the difference is zero. \n\nWait, but the problem says Q is younger than R and older than T. So, R must be older than Q, and T must be younger than Q. So, R must be greater than 25, and T must be less than 25. Because if Q is 25, then R is older, so R >25, and T <25. \n\nBut given that, can the difference between R and Q vary? Let's see. Let me take a few examples. \n\nCase 1: R =30, T=20. Then, R - Q =5. \n\nCase 2: R=35, T=15. Then, R - Q=10. \n\nCase 3: R=40, T=10. R-Q=15. \n\nCase 4: R=26, T=24. R-Q=1. \n\nCase 5: R=25, T=25. R-Q=0. Wait, but in this case, Q is 25, R is 25, so Q isn't younger than R. So that's not allowed. So R must be greater than 25, and T less than 25. \n\nSo in all these cases, the difference R-Q can be any value as long as R is greater than 25 and T is less than 25, and R + T=50. So, the difference could be 1, 5, 10, 15, etc., up to a maximum. What's the maximum possible R-Q difference?\n\nThe maximum R can be is when T is as small as possible. Since T has to be less than 25, the smallest T can be is 0 (assuming age can't be negative). If T is 0, then R would be 50. So R-Q would be 50-25=25. So the difference could be anything from 0 up to 25. But wait, R must be older than Q, so R-Q must be positive. So the difference ranges from 1 to 25. \n\nSo, the problem is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. But in the given information, the sum of R and T is 50, and the age differences are such that r - q = q - t. But from that, we can't find a specific value for r - q.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this age-related problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says, \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I think I need to parse that sentence. So, Q's age difference from R is the same as his age difference from T, but in the opposite direction. So, if Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, he's older than T by the same number. \n\nLet me try to represent this with some variables. Let's let Q's age be q, R's age be r, and T's age be t. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So, mathematically, that would be r - q = q - t. Because R is older than Q by (r - q) years, and Q is older than T by (q - t) years. So, these two differences are equal. \n\nSo, equation one: r - q = q - t. Let me rearrange that. If I bring the q's to one side and the others to the opposite, I get r + t = 2q. So, 2q equals r plus t. \n\nThe problem also states that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, equation two: r + t = 50. \n\nWait, from equation one, r + t = 2q, and equation two says r + t is 50. So substituting, 2q = 50. So, q = 25. That's Q's age. \n\nBut the question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, what's r - q? Since we know q is 25, and r + t is 50. Let's think.\n\nWait, from equation one, r - q = q - t. Let me see. Let's compute r - q. Since r + t =50 and 2q=50, q=25. So r + t=50, and we can express t as 50 - r. \n\nSo, let's plug into equation one: r -25 = 25 - t. But t is 50 - r, so substituting: r -25 = 25 - (50 - r). \n\nLet me compute the right side: 25 -50 + r = -25 + r. So the equation is r -25 = r -25. Hmm, that simplifies to 0=0. Which means that the equation is an identity, and it doesn't give me any new information beyond what I already know.\n\nSo, all I know is that Q is 25, and R plus T is 50. But I don't know R's individual age or T's. So, R could be any value as long as T is 50 - R. For example, if R is 30, then T is 20. Then r - q is 5, and q - t is 5. So that works. \n\nBut wait, could R be 40 and T 10? Then r - q is 15, and q - t is 15. That also works. So the difference between R and Q is 15 in that case. Alternatively, if R is 25, then T is 25. Then r - q is 0, and q - t is 0. So in that case, the difference is zero. \n\nWait, but the problem says Q is younger than R and older than T. So, R must be older than Q, and T must be younger than Q. So, R must be greater than 25, and T must be less than 25. Because if Q is 25, then R is older, so R >25, and T <25. \n\nBut given that, can the difference between R and Q vary? Let's see. Let me take a few examples. \n\nCase 1: R =30, T=20. Then, R - Q =5. \n\nCase 2: R=35, T=15. Then, R - Q=10. \n\nCase 3: R=40, T=10. R-Q=15. \n\nCase 4: R=26, T=24. R-Q=1. \n\nCase 5: R=25, T=25. R-Q=0. Wait, but in this case, Q is 25, R is 25, so Q isn't younger than R. So that's not allowed. So R must be greater than 25, and T less than 25. \n\nSo in all these cases, the difference R-Q can be any value as long as R is greater than 25 and T is less than 25, and R + T=50. So, the difference could be 1, 5, 10, 15, etc., up to a maximum. What's the maximum possible R-Q difference?\n\nThe maximum R can be is when T is as small as possible. Since T has to be less than 25, the smallest T can be is 0 (assuming age can't be negative). If T is 0, then R would be 50. So R-Q would be 50-25=25. So the difference could be anything from 0 up to 25. But wait, R must be older than Q, so R-Q must be positive. So the difference ranges from 1 to 25. \n\nSo, the problem is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. But in the given information, the sum of R and T is 50, and the age differences are such that r - q = q - t. But from that, we can't find a specific value for r - q. It could be any value depending on the actual ages of R and T as long as they sum to 50 and the differences are equal.\n\nSo, the answer must be that we cannot determine the exact difference.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about ages. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe question says: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but I think I can parse it. So, Q is younger than R by a certain number of years, and the same number of years makes Q older than T. So, the difference between Q and R is the same as the difference between Q and T, but in opposite directions. \n\nLet me think about how to represent this with variables. Let's let Q's age be q, R's age be r, and T's age be t. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. But wait, since Q is younger than R, R is older than Q by that difference. And Q is older than T, so Q is greater than T by that same difference. \n\nSo, mathematically, that would mean:\nr - q = q - t. \n\nBecause the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. \n\nLet me write that down: r - q = q - t.\n\nI can rearrange this equation. Let me bring like terms together. Adding q to both sides and adding t to both sides, I get r + t = 2q. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So the sum of R and T's ages is equal to twice Q's age. \n\nThe problem then states that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. So, r + t = 50.\n\nWait, but from the previous equation, r + t = 2q. So substituting, 2q =50. That means q=25. \n\nSo Q is 25 years old. \n\nBut the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find r - q. \n\nWait, but from the equation r - q = q - t. Since q is 25, let's see. \n\nWe can rearrange the equation r - q = q - t. So r = 2q - t. Alternatively, since r + t =50, and q=25, maybe I can find r in terms of t or vice versa.\n\nWait, since r + t =50, and we know that r = 2q - t (from r - q = q - t \u2192 r = 2q - t), substituting q=25 gives r = 50 - t.\n\nWait, but substituting into r + t =50: r + t =50, so r =50 - t. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, since r - q = q - t, and q is 25, then r -25 =25 - t. \n\nSo, r =25 + (25 - t) \u2192 r=50 - t. \n\nWhich is the same as before. But I don't see how that gives me the value of r - q without more info. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q's age, which is r - q. From the equation r - q = q - t. Since q is 25, and r + t=50, perhaps I can find r - q in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see: r + t =50. And from the first equation, r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t = 2q. Which we used to find q=25. So, r - q is equal to q - t. Since q=25, r -25 =25 - t. \n\nSo, the difference between R and Q is 25 - t. But wait, I don't know what t is. All I know is that t is part of the sum r + t=50. \n\nSo, without knowing the exact ages of R and T, I can't find the exact value of r - q. Because t could be any number, which would affect r and thus the difference. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the equations. \n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t = 2q \u2192 since r + t =50, then 2q=50 \u2192 q=25.\n\n2) So, q=25. The difference r - q is equal to q - t. So, r -25 =25 - t \u2192 r =50 - t. \n\nBut without knowing t, I can't find r. So, for example, if t is 20, then r would be 30, and the difference r - q would be 5. If t is 25, then r would be25, making r - q zero. Wait, but that can't be right because then Q would be as old as R, but that would make the difference zero, but the first statement says Q is younger than R. So, perhaps t has to be less than q. Because Q is older than T. So t must be less than 25. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give more information. So, I can't determine the exact difference between R and Q because t can vary. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to find a fixed value. But from the given info, I can't. \n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let's think: the difference is r - q =25 - t. So, the difference depends on t. But what is the maximum or minimum possible? \n\nIf t is as small as possible (say, 0), then the difference would be 25. If t approaches 25, the difference approaches zero. But since t must be less than 25 (since Q is older than T), the difference can range from 0 up to 25. \n\nBut the question is asking for the definite difference. Since the information doesn't fix t, we can't find a specific value. So the answer would be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, the sum of R and T is 50. From the first equation, r + t =50. And the difference is r - q =25 - t. So, since r + t =50, t=50 - r. Substituting into the difference: 25 - (50 - r) = r -25. So, the difference is r -25. \n\nWait, but that's the same as the difference. So, it's r -25. But without knowing r, we can't find the exact difference. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the difference in terms of known quantities. Wait, since r + t =50, and r - q = q - t \u2192 r + t=2q=50 \u2192 q=25. So, the difference is 25 -t. But since t can vary from 0 up to 25, the difference can vary from 25 down to zero. \n\nTherefore, without more information, the difference can't be determined. So the correct answer would be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. The options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D. But wait, am I missing something? Because the problem says \"definitely the difference between R and Q's age.\" But from the given data, the difference can't be determined uniquely. So, D is the correct choice.\n",
