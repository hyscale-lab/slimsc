      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an aeroplane flying around a square field, with different speeds on each side. I need to find the average speed around the field.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I can't just take the arithmetic mean of the speeds; I need to calculate it properly.\n\nThe square has four sides, each of equal length. Let's denote the length of each side as 's'. So, the total distance the plane flies is 4s. But since each side is covered at a different speed, the time taken for each side will vary.\n\nWait, but I don't know the actual length of each side. Oh, right, but since they're all the same, maybe I can just assume each side is 1 unit or something. Wait, no, maybe it's easier to let each side be of length 'd'. So, each side is 'd' km, and the total distance is 4d.\n\nSo, the time taken for each side would be distance divided by speed. For the first side, speed is 200 km/hr, so time is d/200. Second side: 400 km/hr, time is d/400. Third: 600, time is d/600. Fourth: 800, time is d/800.\n\nTotal time T is the sum of these individual times. So,\n\nT = (d/200) + (d/400) + (d/600) + (d/800)\n\nI can factor out 'd' since it's common:\n\nT = d * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)\n\nNow, to compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's see, 200 is 2*100, 400 is 4*100, 600 is 6*100, 800 is 8*100. So, 100 is a common factor. The least common multiple (LCM) would be 2400? Let me check:\n\nWait, 200 is 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^5 *5^2, 600 is 2^3*3*5^2, 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 * 3 *25 = 2400. Yeah, 2400 is the LCM.\n\nSo, converting each fraction to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n\n1/400 = 6/2400\n\n1/600 = 4/2400\n\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them together: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So sum is 25/2400.\n\nSo, T = d * (25/2400) = d*(5/480) = d/(96/5) = (5d)/96.\n\nWait, let me compute that again. 25/2400 is 5/(480), right? Because 25 divided by 5 is 5, 2400 divided by 5 is 480. So, 5/480 is 1/96. So, 25/2400 is 1/96.\n\nWait, no, 25/2400 = (25)/(2400) = (5*5)/(16*150) = wait, perhaps better to compute 25 divided by 2400. 2400 divided by 25 is 96. So, 25/2400 = 1/96.\n\nSo T = d * (1/96) = d/96.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate the fractions.\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n\n1/400 =6/2400\n\n1/600 =4/2400\n\n1/800=3/2400\n\nAdding: 12+6=18, +4=22, +3=25. So yes, 25/2400. Which is 5/480, which simplifies to 1/96. So yeah, T = d/96.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because 25/2400 is 5/480, which is 1/96. So, yes.\n\nSo total time is d/96 hours.\n\nWait, but wait, the total distance is 4d. So average speed V_avg is total distance divided by total time.\n\nV_avg = 4d / (d/96) ) = 4d * (96/d) ) = 4*96 = 384.\n\nWait, that's 384 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math because I might have made a mistake in the fractions.\n\nAlternative approach: Let each side be of length 'd' km. So four sides, 4d total.\n\nTime for each side:\n\nt1 = d/200\n\nt2 = d/400\n\nt3 = d/600\n\nt4 = d/800\n\nTotal time T = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = d (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 )\n\nCompute the sum inside:\n\nLet me compute each term as decimal:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n\n1/400 = 0.0025\n\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding these:\n\n0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075\n\n0.0075 + 0.0016667 \u2248 0.0091667\n\n0.0091667 + 0.00125 \u2248 0.0104167\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.0104167.\n\nSo T = d * 0.0104167 = d / 96 (since 1/96 \u2248 0.0104167)\n\nSo average speed = 4d / (d/96) ) = 4 *96 = 384.\n\nYes, same answer. So option A is correct.\n",

The plane flies each side at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. The options are given, so I need to pick the right one.\n\nWait, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. Oh right, that's the formula. So I can't just take the average of the four speeds because that would be incorrect. Instead, I have to calculate the time taken for each side and sum them up, then divide the total distance by that time.\n\nLet me think about the setup. The field is a square, so each side is of equal length. Let's denote the length of each side as 's'. So the total distance the plane travels is 4 times s, right? 4s.\n\nNow, for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So the time for each side is s divided by the respective speed.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Time for first side: s/200\n- Time for second side: s/400\n- Time for third side: s/600\n- Time for fourth side: s/800\n\nSo total time T is s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nI can factor out s from each term: T = s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow, let's compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let me find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let me see:\n\nBreaking down each into prime factors:\n\n- 200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n- 400 = 2^4 * 5^2\n- 600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2\n- 800 = 2^5 * 5^2\n\nSo the LCM would be the highest powers: 2^5 * 3 * 5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75 = 2400.\n\nSo, converting each fraction to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them up: 12 + 6 +4 +3 = 25. So 25/2400.\n\nWait, wait, 12 +6 is 18, plus 4 is 22, plus 3 is 25. Yep.\n\nSo the sum is 25/2400, which can be simplified. 25 divided by 2400 equals 1/96. Because 25 * 96 = 2400. So 25/2400 = 1/96.\n\nSo the total time T is s * (1/96) = s/96.\n\nBut wait, the total distance is 4s, so average speed V_avg = total distance / total time = 4s / (s/96).\n\nSimplify that: 4s divided by (s/96) is 4s * (96/s) = 4 *96 = 384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I compute the sum correctly?\n\n1/200 is 0.005, 1/400 is 0.0025, 1/600 is approximately 0.0016667, and 1/800 is 0.00125. Adding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075. Plus 0.0016667 is about 0.0091667. Plus 0.00125 is 0.0104167. Let me see what 1/96 is. 1/96 is approximately 0.0104167. So that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the sum is 1/96. So T = s/96. Then 4s/(s/96) is 384. So the answer is A.\n",

The field is a square, so each side is of equal length. Let's denote the length of each side as 's'. So the total distance the plane travels is 4 times s, right? 4s.\n\nNow, for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So the time for each side is s divided by the respective speed.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Time for first side: s/200\n- Time for second side: s/400\n- Time for third side: s/600\n- Time for fourth side: s/800\n\nSo total time T is s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nI can factor out s from each term: T = s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow, let's compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let me find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let me see:\n\nBreaking down each into prime factors:\n\n- 200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n- 400 = 2^4 * 5^2\n- 600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2\n- 800 = 2^5 * 5^2\n\nSo the LCM would be the highest powers: 2^5 * 3 * 5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75 = 2400.\n\nSo, converting each fraction to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them up: 12 + 6 +4 +3 = 25. So 25/2400.\n\nWait, wait, 12 +6 is 18, plus 4 is 22, plus 3 is 25. Yep.\n\nSo the sum is 25/2400, which can be simplified. 25 divided by 2400 equals 1/96. Because 25 * 96 = 2400. So 25/2400 = 1/96.\n\nSo the total time T is s * (1/96) = s/96.\n\nBut wait, the total distance is 4s, so average speed V_avg = total distance / total time = 4s / (s/96).\n\nSimplify that: 4s divided by (s/96) is 4s * (96/s) = 4 *96 = 384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations. Did I compute the sum correctly?\n\n1/200 is 0.005, 1/400 is 0.0025, 1/600 is approximately 0.0016667, and 1/800 is 0.00125. Adding them: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075. Plus 0.0016667 is about 0.0091667. Plus 0.00125 is 0.0104167. Let me see what 1/96 is. 1/96 is approximately 0.0104167. So that's correct.\n\nSo yes, the sum is 1/96. So T = s/96. Then 4s/(s/96) is 384. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the average speed of the aeroplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed: \n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nThe field is a square, so each side has length \\(s\\), and the total distance is \\(4s\\). The time taken to travel each side is given by \\(t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\\). For the four sides, the times are:\n\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{s}{200}, \\quad t_2 = \\frac{s}{400}, \\quad t_3 = \\frac{s}{600}, \\quad t_4 = \\frac{s}{800}.\n\\]\n\nThe total time is:\n\n\\[\nT = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 = s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right).\n\\]\n\nTo simplify the sum inside the parentheses, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400. Converting each fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{12}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{6}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{4}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{3}{2400}.\n\\]\n\nAdding these fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2400} + \\frac{6}{2400} + \\frac{4}{2400} + \\frac{3}{2400} = \\frac{25}{2400} = \\frac{1}{96}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total time is:\n\n\\[\nT = s \\cdot \\frac{1}{96} = \\frac{s}{96}.\n\\]\n\nThe total distance is \\(4s\\), so the average speed is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{4s}{T} = \\frac{4s}{\\frac{s}{96}} = 4 \\cdot 96 = 384 \\, \\text{km/hr}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the aeroplane is **384 km/hr**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an airplane flying around a square field. The question is asking for the average speed of the plane around the field. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says the plane flies along the four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, so each side of the square is being traversed at a different speed. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So I need to find the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes.\n\nSince it's a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let's say each side has a length of 's' kilometers. That means the total distance around the square is 4*s. But I don't know the actual value of 's', but maybe I can work without it.\n\nNow, for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So for the first side at 200 km/hr, the time is s/200. Similarly, the second side at 400 km/hr would take s/400 hours. The third side at 600 km/hr is s/600, and the fourth at 800 km/hr is s/800. \n\nAdding all these times together: (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). I can factor out 's' since it's a common factor. So it becomes s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nLet me compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, 400 is 200*2, 600 is 200*3, 800 is 200*4. So the least common multiple would be 2400 maybe? Wait, 200 is 2^3 *5^1, 400 is 2^4 *5^1, 600 is 2^3*3*5^1, 800 is 2^5*5^1. The LCM is 2^5 *3 *5 = 32*3*5= 480? Wait, 2^5 is 32, 32*3=96, 96*5=480. So 480 is the LCM.\n\nWait, but 2400 is also a multiple. Let's see: 200: 2400/200=12, 400:6, 600:4, 800:3. So each term can be converted to 2400 denominator.\n\nSo 1/200 = 12/2400, 1/400=6/2400, 1/600=4/2400, 1/800=3/2400. Adding those numerators: 12+6=18, 18+4=22, 22+3=25. So total is 25/2400. Therefore, the sum is 25/2400.\n\nSo the total time is s*(25/2400) = (25s)/(2400) hours.\n\nWait, but the total distance is 4s. So average speed is total distance divided by total time. That would be (4s) / (25s/2400).\n\nSimplify that: 4s * (2400)/(25s). The s cancels out. 4 * 2400 /25.\n\nCalculating that: 2400 divided by 25 is 96. 4*96 is 384.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 384. So the average speed should be 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember when dealing with average speeds around a square with different speeds on each side, the formula might involve harmonic mean or something else. Did I do that correctly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about each side's time and then compute total time. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nEach side is 's' km.\n\nTime for each side:\nt1 = s/200\nt2 = s/400\nt3 = s/600\nt4 = s/800\n\nTotal time T = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)\n\nAs before, sum inside is 25/2400.\n\nSo T = (25 s) / 2400.\n\nTotal distance D = 4s.\n\nAverage speed V_avg = D / T = 4s / (25s/2400) = (4 * 2400)/25.\n\n4*2400 = 9600. 9600/25 = 384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 384, which is option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about an aeroplane flying around a square field, and I need to find its average speed. Hmm, average speed can be a bit tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Right, so I should think in terms of that.\n\nThe problem says the plane flies along four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, so each side of the square is a different speed. But since it's a square, all the sides are equal in length, right? Let me denote each side as having a length 's'. That makes the perimeter 4s, but wait, no, actually, for average speed around the whole path, I think I need to consider each segment individually.\n\nSo, for each side, the time taken will be distance divided by speed. Since each side is length 's', the time for each side would be s/200, s/400, s/600, and s/800 hours respectively.\n\nThe total distance the plane travels is 4s, because it's going around the square once. The total time is the sum of the times for each side: s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nSo average speed V_avg is total distance divided by total time. So V_avg = (4s) / (s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800).\n\nHmm, I can factor out 's' from the denominator. So that becomes s * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). So when I divide 4s by that, the 's' cancels out. So the formula simplifies to 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow I need to compute the sum in the denominator. Let me find a common denominator for these fractions. Alternatively, I can compute each term and add them up.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016666667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075. Adding 0.0016666667 gives about 0.0091666667. Then adding 0.00125 gives around 0.0104166667.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition:\n\n0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075\n0.0075 + 0.0016666667 \u2248 0.0091666667\n0.0091666667 + 0.00125 = 0.0104166667\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 0.0104166667. Now, 4 divided by that is 4 / 0.0104166667.\n\nWait, 0.0104166667 is equal to 125/12000. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using fractions instead of decimals to avoid rounding errors.\n\nLet me compute the sum using fractions.\n\nThe denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers to add the fractions.\n\nBreaking down each into prime factors:\n\n200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n400 = 2^4 * 5^2\n600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2\n800 = 2^5 * 5^2\n\nThe LCM would be the maximum exponents: 2^5 * 3 * 5^2 = 32 * 3 *25 = 32 *75 = 2400.\n\nSo each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them up: 12 + 6 + 4 +3 = 25. So 25/2400.\n\nSo the denominator sum is 25/2400. Therefore, the average speed is 4 / (25/2400) = 4 * (2400/25) = (4 * 2400) /25.\n\nCompute that: 2400 /25 is 96, because 25*96=2400. So 4 * 96 is 384.\n\nWait, so the average speed is 384 km/hr. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about an aeroplane flying around a square field, and I need to find its average speed. Hmm, average speed can be a bit tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds; it's total distance divided by total time. Right, so I should think in terms of that.\n\nThe problem says the plane flies along four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Wait, so each side of the square is a different speed. But since it's a square, all the sides are equal in length, right? Let me denote each side as having a length 's'. That makes the perimeter 4s, but wait, no, actually, for average speed around the whole path, I think I need to consider each segment individually.\n\nSo, for each side, the time taken will be distance divided by speed. Since each side is length 's', the time for each side would be s/200, s/400, s/600, and s/800 hours respectively.\n\nThe total distance the plane travels is 4s, because it's going around the square once. The total time is the sum of the times for each side: s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nSo average speed V_avg is total distance divided by total time. So V_avg = (4s) / (s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800).\n\nHmm, I can factor out 's' from the denominator. So that becomes s * (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). So when I divide 4s by that, the 's' cancels out. So the formula simplifies to 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nNow I need to compute the sum in the denominator. Let me find a common denominator for these fractions. Alternatively, I can compute each term and add them up.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016666667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them up: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075. Adding 0.0016666667 gives about 0.0091666667. Then adding 0.00125 gives around 0.0104166667.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition:\n\n0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075\n0.0075 + 0.0016666667 \u2248 0.0091666667\n0.0091666667 + 0.00125 = 0.0104166667\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the denominator is approximately 0.0104166667. Now, 4 divided by that is 4 / 0.0104166667.\n\nWait, 0.0104166667 is equal to 125/12000. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using fractions instead of decimals to avoid rounding errors.\n\nLet me compute the sum using fractions.\n\nThe denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers to add the fractions.\n\nBreaking down each into prime factors:\n\n200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n400 = 2^4 * 5^2\n600 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^2\n800 = 2^5 * 5^2\n\nThe LCM would be the maximum exponents: 2^5 * 3 * 5^2 = 32 * 3 *25 = 32 *75 = 2400.\n\nSo each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them up: 12 + 6 + 4 +3 = 25. So 25/2400.\n\nSo the denominator sum is 25/2400. Therefore, the average speed is 4 / (25/2400) = 4 * (2400/25) = (4 * 2400) /25.\n\nCompute that: 2400 /25 is 96, because 25*96=2400. So 4 * 96 is 384.\n\nWait, so the average speed is 384 km/hr. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, I assumed each side is the same length. But in reality, when the plane goes around the square, it's not clear whether the four sides are equal in distance. Oh wait, the problem says \"four sides of a square\", which implies each side is equal. So my initial assumption is correct.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/h. So the correct option is A.\n\n\nTo find the average speed of the aeroplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\n\nSince the field is a square, each side has the same length \\(s\\). The total distance traveled by the aeroplane is \\(4s\\). The time taken to travel each side is the distance divided by the speed. For the four sides, the times are:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{200}, \\frac{s}{400}, \\frac{s}{600}, \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nThe total time is the sum of these times:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = \\frac{s}{200} + \\frac{s}{400} + \\frac{s}{600} + \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(s\\), the total time becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe average speed is then:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{4s}{s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)}\n\\]\n\nThe \\(s\\) cancels out, leaving:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800}}\n\\]\n\nTo compute the sum in the denominator, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, and 800 is 2400. Converting each fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} = \\frac{12}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{6}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{4}{2400}, \\quad \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{3}{2400}\n\\]\n\nAdding these fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{2400} + \\frac{6}{2400} + \\frac{4}{2400} + \\frac{3}{2400} = \\frac{25}{2400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator is \\(\\frac{25}{2400}\\), and the average speed becomes:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{25}{2400}} = 4 \\times \\frac{2400}{25} = \\frac{9600}{25} = 384 \\, \\text{km/hr}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the average speed of the aeroplane is **384 km/hr**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let's see what the question is.\n\nThe problem says: An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field.\n\nHmm, average speed. Right, average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? So I can't just average the four speeds because that would give a wrong answer. I remember that when dealing with average speeds for equal distances but different speeds, we use the harmonic mean. But wait, in this case, the distances are the same because it's a square, so each side is equal. So each side has the same length.\n\nLet me think. The square has four sides, all of equal length. Let's say each side is of length 's'. So the total distance the plane travels is 4s.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's a square, so four sides. Each side has the same length, so yes, each side is 's'. So the total distance is 4s.\n\nNow, for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So for each side, time is s divided by the respective speed.\n\nLet me write that down. The time taken for each side is:\n\nt1 = s / 200\nt2 = s / 400\nt3 = s / 600\nt4 = s / 800\n\nSo the total time is t1 + t2 + t3 + t4.\n\nSo total time T = s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.\n\nI can factor out s from the numerator since all terms have s.\n\nSo T = s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800)\n\nNow, the average speed is total distance divided by total time.\n\nTotal distance is 4s, as each side is s.\n\nSo average speed V_avg = (4s) / T.\n\nBut T is s multiplied by the sum of reciprocals. So substituting T:\n\nV_avg = 4s / [ s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) ) ]\n\nThe s cancels out, which is good because it means the average speed doesn't depend on the length of the sides, which makes sense since all sides are equal.\n\nSo now V_avg = 4 / [ (1/200) + (1/400) + (1/600) + (1/800) ]\n\nNow I need to compute the denominator.\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.00166666667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding these up:\n\n0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075\n\n0.0075 + 0.00166666667 \u2248 0.00916666667\n\n0.00916666667 + 0.00125 = 0.01041666667\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.01041666667.\n\nWait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately using fractions to avoid rounding errors.\n\nAlternatively, find a common denominator for all four fractions.\n\nThe denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800.\n\nLet me find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Let's see.\n\nBreaking down each number into prime factors:\n\n200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n400 = 2^4 *5^2\n600 = 2^3 *3*5^2\n800 = 2^5 *5^2\n\nThe LCM would take the highest exponents:\n\n2^5, 3^1, 5^2.\n\nSo 32 *3*25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo the common denominator is 2400.\n\nSo each term:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 =6/2400\n1/600=4/2400\n1/800=3/2400\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25.\n\nSo sum is 25/2400 = 5/(480) = 1/(96) approximately. Wait, 25/2400 simplifies to 5/480, which is 1/96.\n\nWait, 25/2400: Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5/480. Again, divide by 5: 1/96. Yes.\n\nSo the sum is 25/2400 = 1/96.\n\nWait, wait. 2400 divided by 25 is 96, so 25/2400 is 1/96.\n\nSo denominator is 1/96.\n\nSo V_avg =4 / (1/96) )=4 *96 =384.\n\nWait, 4 divided by (1/96) is 4 *96 =384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an airplane flying around a square field, and I need to find its average speed. Hmm, let's see what the question says again. The plane flies along each side of the square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. I'm a bit rusty on average speed calculations, but I remember it's not just the arithmetic mean.\n\nWait, right, average speed is total distance divided by total time. Oh yeah, that makes sense because it's about the overall rate over the entire journey. So I can't just average the four speeds directly. I need to find the total distance the plane travels and then the total time it takes, then divide one by the other.\n\nSince the field is a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let me denote the length of each side as 's'. So the total distance around the square would be 4 times s, right? So total distance is 4s.\n\nNow, for the time taken on each side. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So for each side, I'll calculate the time and sum them up.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- First side: speed is 200 km/hr. Time taken is s/200.\n- Second side: 400 km/hr. Time is s/400.\n- Third side: 600 km/hr. Time is s/600.\n- Fourth side: 800 km/hr. Time is s/800.\n\nSo the total time is (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). I can factor out 's' from each term, so it becomes s multiplied by (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\nTo compute this sum of reciprocals, I'll find a common denominator or maybe add them step by step. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.0016667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them together: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075. Then adding 0.0016667 gives about 0.0091667. Adding 0.00125, that totals 0.0104167.\n\nWait, but that's decimal. Maybe it's better to find a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Hmm, 200 factors into 2^3 *5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3*3*5^2. 800 is 2^5*5^2. So the LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32*3*25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each fraction to have denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400\n1/800 = 3/2400\n\nAdding them: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So the sum is 25/2400 = 5/480 = 1/96.\n\nWait, that's better. So the sum of the reciprocals is 25/2400 which simplifies to 5/480, which is 1/96. So the total time is s * (1/96) = s/96.\n\nWait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the sum is 25/2400. 25 divided by 2400 is 0.01041666..., which matches the earlier decimal addition. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo total time is s*(25/2400) = s*(1/96). Wait, because 25/2400 is 1/96, right? 2400 divided by 25 is 96. So yes.\n\nSo total time is s/96.\n\nTotal distance is 4s, as each side is s, four sides.\n\nSo average speed is total distance divided by total time. So 4s divided by (s/96) = 4s * (96/s) = 4 *96 = 384 km/hr.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 384. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the sum correctly? Let me redo the reciprocal part.\n\nWait, another approach: 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 +1/800.\n\nLet me factor each term as 1/(s) where s is a multiple of 100.\n\nSo 1/200 = 1/(2*100) = (1/2) * (1/100)\nSimilarly:\n\n1/200 = (1/2)* (1/100)\n1/400 = (1/4)* (1/100)\n1/600 = (1/6)* (1/100)\n1/800 = (1/8)* (1/100)\n\nSo sum is (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8) * (1/100)\n\nCompute the sum inside: Let's find a common denominator for 2,4,6,8. The LCM is 24.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n1/2 = 12/24\n1/4 = 6/24\n1/6 =4/24\n1/8=3/24\n\nSum is 12+6+4+3 =25 \u2192 25/24.\n\nSo the sum becomes (25/24) * (1/100) = 25/(24*100) =25/2400 = 5/480 =1/96. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the total time is s*(1/96) = s/96.\n\nTotal distance is 4s.\n\nAverage speed = 4s / (s/96) = 4 *96 = 384 km/h.\n\nSo the correct answer is A) 384.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aeroplane flying around a square field. The question is asking for the average speed of the plane around the field. Hmm, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. But wait, I should think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem states that the plane flies along the four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. So each side of the square is a straight path, and the plane is moving at different speeds on each side. Since it's a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let's say each side has a length of 's' kilometers.\n\nSo the total distance the plane travels is the perimeter of the square. That would be 4 times the length of one side, so 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the entire trip. Since the plane is moving at different speeds on each side, I can't just take the average of the speeds directly. Oh right, because average speed is total distance over total time, not the arithmetic mean of the speeds.\n\nSo for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\nTime1 = s / 200\nTime2 = s / 400\nTime3 = s / 600\nTime4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time is the sum of these four times.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nTotal time = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nHmm, I can factor out 's' from each term, so it becomes s multiplied by the sum of 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nCalculating that sum of reciprocals might be a bit tricky. Let me compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.00166667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them together: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075, plus 0.00166667 gives about 0.00916667, plus 0.00125 is 0.01041667.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.01041667. So total time is s * 0.01041667.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can find a more precise value by using fractions instead of decimals. Let's see. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. To add the fractions, I can find a common denominator. Let's see, the least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, 200 is 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^4*5^2, 600 is 2^3*3*5^2, 800 is 2^5*5^2. So the LCM would be the highest exponents: 2^5 and 5^2. So 32 *25 = 800. So 800 is the common denominator.\n\nSo each term:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) = 4/3? Wait, wait. Let me compute each fraction as over 800.\n\nWait, 1/200 = 4/800 because 200 *4 =800.\n\n1/400 = 2/800, since 400 *2=800.\n\n1/600: 600 * (4/3) =800. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, to get from 600 to 800, multiply by 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800? No, wait. Let me think. Alternatively, 1/600 = (800/600) /800 = (4/3) /800. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to compute each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n\n1/400 = 2/800\n\n1/600 = (800/600)= 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute each term as (1/x) = n/800. So 1/200 = (4)/800 \u2192 4.\n\n1/400 \u2192 2/800.\n\n1/600 \u2192 800/600 = 4/3 \u2192 so 1/600 = (4/3) * (1/800). So 4/3 is approximately 1.3333.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate each as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n\n1/400 = 0.0025\n\n1/600 \u2248 0.00166667\n\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them together: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; 0.0075 + 0.00166667 \u2248 0.00916667; +0.00125 \u2192 0.01041667.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.01041667. So 0.01041667 = 125/12000? Let me see. 125 \u00f7 12000 is 0.010416667, yes. So 125/12000 can be simplified. Let's see, 125 and 12000 are both divisible by 25. 125/25=5, 12000/25=480. So 5/480. Hmm, 5 and 480 can be divided by 5 again: 1/96. So 1/96.\n\nWait, wait, 125/12000 = (125 \u00f7 25)/(12000 \u00f725) =5/480. 5/480 is same as 1/96. Oh right, because 480 \u00f75=96. So 5/480 = 1/96. So the sum of 1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800 = 1/96.\n\nSo total time is s * (1/96) \u2192 s/96.\n\nWait, because total time is s*(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800) = s*(1/96). So s/96.\n\nSo the total distance is 4s.\n\nSo average speed is total distance divided by total time: (4s) / (s/96) = 4s * (96/s) \u2192 the s cancels out, so 4*96=384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aeroplane flying around a square field. The question is asking for the average speed of the plane around the field. Hmm, I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. But wait, I should think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem states that the plane flies along the four sides of a square at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. So each side of the square is a straight path, and the plane is moving at different speeds on each side. Since it's a square, all four sides are equal in length. Let's say each side has a length of 's' kilometers.\n\nSo the total distance the plane travels is the perimeter of the square. That would be 4 times the length of one side, so 4s.\n\nNow, I need to find the total time taken for the entire trip. Since the plane is moving at different speeds on each side, I can't just take the average of the speeds directly. Oh right, because average speed is total distance over total time, not the arithmetic mean of the speeds.\n\nSo for each side, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\nTime1 = s / 200\nTime2 = s / 400\nTime3 = s / 600\nTime4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time is the sum of these four times.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nTotal time = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800)\n\nHmm, I can factor out 's' from each term, so it becomes s multiplied by the sum of 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nCalculating that sum of reciprocals might be a bit tricky. Let me compute each term:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n1/400 = 0.0025\n1/600 \u2248 0.00166667\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them together: 0.005 + 0.0025 is 0.0075, plus 0.00166667 gives about 0.00916667, plus 0.00125 is 0.01041667.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.01041667. So total time is s * 0.01041667.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can find a more precise value by using fractions instead of decimals. Let's see. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. To add the fractions, I can find a common denominator. Let's see, the least common multiple of 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, 200 is 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^4*5^2, 600 is 2^3*3*5^2, 800 is 2^5*5^2. So the LCM would be the highest exponents: 2^5 and 5^2. So 32 *25 = 800. So 800 is the common denominator.\n\nSo each term:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n1/400 = 2/800\n1/600 = (800/600) = 4/3? Wait, wait. Let me compute each fraction as over 800.\n\nWait, 1/200 = 4/800 because 200 *4 =800.\n\n1/400 = 2/800, since 400 *2=800.\n\n1/600: 600 * (4/3) =800. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, to get from 600 to 800, multiply by 4/3. So 1/600 = (4/3)/800? No, wait. Let me think. Alternatively, 1/600 = (800/600) /800 = (4/3) /800. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to compute each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 4/800\n\n1/400 = 2/800\n\n1/600 = (800/600)= 4/3 * (1/800) \u2192 Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute each term as (1/x) = n/800. So 1/200 = (4)/800 \u2192 4.\n\n1/400 \u2192 2/800.\n\n1/600 \u2192 800/600 = 4/3 \u2192 so 1/600 = (4/3) * (1/800). So 4/3 is approximately 1.3333.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate each as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 0.005\n\n1/400 = 0.0025\n\n1/600 \u2248 0.00166667\n\n1/800 = 0.00125\n\nAdding them together: 0.005 + 0.0025 = 0.0075; 0.0075 + 0.00166667 \u2248 0.00916667; +0.00125 \u2192 0.01041667.\n\nSo the sum is approximately 0.01041667. So 0.01041667 = 125/12000? Let me see. 125 \u00f7 12000 is 0.010416667, yes. So 125/12000 can be simplified. Let's see, 125 and 12000 are both divisible by 25. 125/25=5, 12000/25=480. So 5/480. Hmm, 5 and 480 can be divided by 5 again: 1/96. So 1/96.\n\nWait, wait, 125/12000 = (125 \u00f7 25)/(12000 \u00f725) =5/480. 5/480 is same as 1/96. Oh right, because 480 \u00f75=96. So 5/480 = 1/96. So the sum of 1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800 = 1/96.\n\nSo total time is s * (1/96) \u2192 s/96.\n\nWait, because total time is s*(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800) = s*(1/96). So s/96.\n\nSo the total distance is 4s.\n\nSo average speed is total distance divided by total time: (4s) / (s/96) = 4s * (96/s) \u2192 the s cancels out, so 4*96=384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 384.\n\n\nTo determine the average speed of the aeroplane flying around the square field, we use the formula for average speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Total Distance\nThe aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square, so the total distance is the perimeter of the square.

Wait, but the order matters because the plane is moving along each side in sequence. Oh, but wait, maybe the order doesn't matter because each side is the same length. Hmm, no, I think the order does matter because each side has a different speed. So each side's time will vary based on their respective speeds.\n\nWait, but in a square, each side is the same length, right? So each side is 's' km. So for each side, the time taken is s divided by the speed for that side. So the total time would be the sum of each side's time.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the four sides are covered at speeds v1, v2, v3, v4. So the times for each side are t1 = s/v1, t2 = s/v2, t3 = s/v3, t4 = s/v4. The total time T is t1 + t2 + t3 + t4.\n\nSo, T = s(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 + 1/v4) ). \n\nAnd the total distance D is 4s.\n\nAverage speed V_avg is D divided by T. So V_avg = (4s) / [s(1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 + 1/v4)].\n\nOh wait, the s cancels out. So V_avg = 4 / (1/v1 + 1/v2 + 1/v3 + 1/v4).\n\nThat makes sense because the average speed around a closed path where each segment is equal in distance is the harmonic mean weighted by the number of segments. Since each segment is the same distance, the formula simplifies to 4 divided by the sum of reciprocals of each speed.\n\nSo plugging in the given speeds: 200, 400, 600, 800.\n\nLet me compute the sum of reciprocals:\n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800.\n\nTo add these, I need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, 800. Hmm, 200 factors into 2^3 *5^2. 400 is 2^4 *5^2. 600 is 2^3 *3 *5^2. 800 is 2^5 *5^2. So LCM would be 2^5 *3 *5^2 = 32 *3 *25 = 32*75=2400.\n\nSo converting each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400 (because 200 *12=2400)\n1/400 = 6/2400\n1/600 = 4/2400 (since 600 *4=2400)\n1/800 = 3/2400 (because 800 *3=2400)\n\nAdding them up: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So 25/2400.\n\nSo the sum of reciprocals is 25/2400.\n\nNow, V_avg =4 / (25/2400) )= 4 * (2400/25) )= (4 *2400 ) /25.\n\nCalculating that: 2400 divided by 25 is 96. 4 *96 is 384.\n\nSo the average speed is 384 km/hr.
