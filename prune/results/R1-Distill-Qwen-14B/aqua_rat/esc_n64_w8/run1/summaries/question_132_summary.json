      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem is: [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] divided by (17 multiplied by 15 minus 15). And the options are A to E, with E being none of these. Hmm, I need to compute this expression correctly.\n\nFirst, I think I'll break it down into smaller parts to make it easier. Let's look at the numerator first, which is the part before the division. The numerator is (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176).\n\nStarting with 272 minus 32. Let me do that subtraction. 272 minus 30 is 242, and then minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, the addition part: 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 plus 176... I can think of 176 as 170 + 6. So 124 + 170 is 294, and then adding 6 gives me 300. So the addition part is 300.\n\nNow, I need to multiply those two results together: 240 multiplied by 300. Hmm, 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and since both numbers have two zeros at the end, I add four zeros in total. Wait, no, 240 is 24*10, and 300 is 3*100. So 24*3 is 72, and 10*100 is 1000, so 72*1000 is 72,000. So the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow, the denominator is (17 multiplied by 15) minus 15. Let me compute that. 17 times 15. I know that 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 7 is 105. So adding those together: 150 + 105 is 255. So 17*15 is 255. Then subtract 15 from that. 255 minus 15 is 240. So the denominator is 240.\n\nNow the problem simplifies to 72,000 divided by 240. Let me calculate that. Dividing 72,000 by 240. Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10 first. That gives me 7200 divided by 24. Now, 24 times 300 is 7200, because 24*300 is 24*3*100=72*100=7200. So 7200 divided by 24 is 300. So the result is 300.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each calculation again.\n\n272 minus 32: 272 -30 is 242, minus 2 is 240. Correct.\n\n124 + 176: 124 + 176. 124 + 176 = 300. Yes, because 124 + 176 is 300 (since 124 + 176 is 300). Correct.\n\n240 * 300: 240 * 300. 240*3 is 720, times 100 is 72,000. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 17*15 is 255, minus 15 is 240. Correct.\n\nThen 72,000 / 240: 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute it differently. 240 times 300 is 72,000. Yes, so 72,000 /240 = 300. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 300, which is option C.\n",

Let me add those. 124 + 176. 120 + 170 is 290, and 4 +6 is 10. So 290 +10 is 300. So that part is 300.\n\nSo the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Let me compute that. 240 times 300.

And I have to choose the correct answer from the options A to E.\n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into smaller parts. Let's handle the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). I should calculate each part inside the parentheses first.\n\nSo, 272 minus 32. Let me subtract: 272 - 32. Hmm, 32 from 272... 272 minus 30 is 242, and then minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, the other parentheses: 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 + 176. Let's see, 124 + 170 is 294, and then plus 6 is 300. Oh, that's easy, that's 300.\n\nSo now the numerator becomes 240 multiplied by 300. Let me calculate that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then add the three zeros from 300 and the one zero from 240, so that's 72 followed by four zeros. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 240 * 300 = (240 * 3) * 100. 240 *3 is 720. So 720 * 100 is 72,000. Oh right, so the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator: (17 multiplied by 15) minus 15.

Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10. So 72000 \u00f7 240 is the same as 7200 \u00f7 24.

So 7200 /24 = 300.\n\nWait, so the result is 300. Now looking back at the options, option C is 300.

I should calculate each part inside the parentheses first.\n\nSo, 272 minus 32. Let me subtract: 272 - 32. Hmm, 32 from 272... 272 minus 30 is 242, and then minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, the other parentheses: 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 + 176. Let's see, 124 + 170 is 294, and then plus 6 is 300. Oh, that's easy, that's 300.\n\nSo now the numerator becomes 240 multiplied by 300. Let me calculate that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then add the three zeros from 300 and the one zero from 240, so that's 72 followed by four zeros. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 240 * 300 = (240 * 3) * 100. 240 *3 is 720. So 720 * 100 is 72,000. Oh right, so the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator: (17 multiplied by 15) minus 15. Let me compute 17 *15 first. Hmm, 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 7 is 105. So 150 + 105 is 255. Then subtract 15 from that: 255 -15 is 240. So denominator is 240.\n\nSo now the problem simplifies to 72,000 divided by 240. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 72,000 divided by 240.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10. So 72000 \u00f7 240 is the same as 7200 \u00f7 24. Because 72000 divided by 10 is 7200, and 240 divided by 10 is 24.\n\nSo 7200 divided by 24. Let me compute that. 24 times 300 is 7200, because 24 * 300 = 7200. So 7200 /24 = 300.\n\nWait, so the result is 300. Now looking back at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, I might mix up numbers.\n\nNumerator: (272-32)=240. Correct. (124+176)=300. Correct. 240 * 300 = 72,000. That's right.\n\nDenominator: 17*15=255. Correct. 255-15=240. Right.\n\n72,000 \u00f7240. Let me do this division another way. 240 * 300 is 72,000. Yes, so 72,000 /240 is 300.\n\nSo I think I did it right. So the answer should be option C, 300.\n\n\nThe problem is [(272 - 32) \u00d7 (124 + 176)] \u00f7 (17 \u00d7 15 - 15). To solve this, break it into smaller parts:\n\n1. **Numerator**:  \n   - (272 - 32) = 240  \n   - (124 + 176) = 300  \n   - Multiply these: 240 \u00d7 300 = 72,000  \n\n2. **Denominator**:  \n   - 17 \u00d7 15 = 255  \n   - Subtract 15: 255 - 15 = 240  \n\n3. **Final Calculation**:  \n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator: 72,000 \u00f7 240 = 300  \n\nThus, the result is 300, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the numerator and the denominator separately because that's usually how these problems are structured. So, the numerator is [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] and the denominator is (17 x 15 - 15).\n\nLet me start with the numerator. I'll compute each part inside the brackets first.\n\nFor (272 - 32), that's straightforward subtraction. 272 minus 32 is 240. Okay, so that part is done.\n\nNext, (124 + 176). Adding those together: 124 plus 176. Hmm, 124 + 176... Let me calculate that. 124 + 176, I can think of it as 120 + 170 = 290, and 4 + 6 = 10. So 290 +10 is 300. So that's 300.\n\nSo the numerator becomes (240) multiplied by (300). Let me compute that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then I have two zeros from 240 and two more from 300, making four zeros total. Wait, no, wait. 240 is 24 x10 and 300 is 30 x10. So when I multiply, 24 x30 is 720, and then two more zeros, so 72000. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 240 * 300 = 240 * 3 * 100. 240*3 is 720, so 720 *100 is 72,000. So the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow onto the denominator: (17 x 15 - 15). Let's compute this part. First, 17 multiplied by 15. Hmm, 17 x15. I can think of 15 as 10 +5, so 17x10=170, and 17x5=85. Adding those together, 170+85=255. So 17x15 is 255. Now subtract 15 from that: 255 -15 is 240. So the denominator is 240.\n\nSo now the problem simplifies to 72,000 divided by 240. Let's compute that. 72,000 \u00f7240.\n\nHmm, I can simplify this division. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 10, so divide numerator and denominator by 10: 7200 /24.\n\nNow, 24 times 300 is 7200, because 24 x300 = 7200. So 7200 divided by 24 is 300.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem is [(272 - 32) (124 + 176)] divided by (17 multiplied by 15 minus 15). The options are A through E, with E being none of these. Hmm, I should compute each part carefully.\n\nLet me break it down. First, I'll handle the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: It's (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). Let me compute each part inside the parentheses first.\n\n272 minus 32. Hmm, 272 minus 30 is 242, so minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, 124 plus 176. Let me add those together. 124 plus 176. I can think of 124 as 100 + 24, and 176 as 100 + 76. Adding the hundreds: 100 + 100 is 200. Then 24 +76 is 100. So 200 + 100 is 300. So the second part is 300.\n\nNow, multiply these two results: 240 multiplied by 300. Hmm, 240 times 3 is 720, so adding two zeros makes it 72,000. So the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow onto the denominator: (17 multiplied by 15) minus 15. Let me compute 17 times 15 first. I know that 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 7 is 105. Adding them together, 150 + 105 is 255. So 17 times 15 is 255.\n\nThen subtract 15 from that. 255 minus 15 is 240. So the denominator is 240.\n\nNow, the problem becomes 72,000 divided by 240. Let's compute that.\n\nI can simplify this division. Both numbers are divisible by 10, so I'll divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 7,200 divided by 24.\n\nWait, maybe I can find how many times 24 goes into 7,200. Let me see: 24 times 300 is 7,200 because 24 times 100 is 2,400, so 24 times 300 is 7,200.\n\nSo 7,200 divided by 24 is 300. So the result is 300.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumerator: 272 -32 is indeed 240. 124+176 is 300. 240 *300 is 72,000. Denominator: 17*15 is 255, minus 15 is 240. 72,000 /240 is 300. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be C)300.\n\n\nThe problem involves computing the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(272 - 32)(124 + 176)}{17 \\times 15 - 15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Compute the numerator\n1. Calculate \\(272 - 32\\):\n   \\[\n   272 - 32 = 240\n   \\]\n2. Calculate \\(124 + 176\\):\n   \\[\n   124 + 176 = 300\n   \\]\n3.

Subtract 15:\n   \\[\n   255 - 15 = 240\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Divide the numerator by the denominator\n\\[\n\\frac{72,000}{240} = 300\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe result of the expression is \\(300\\), which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me compute each part inside the brackets first.\n\n272 minus 32. Hmm, 272 minus 30 would be 242, then minus 2 more is 240. So that part is 240.\n\nThen, 124 plus 176. Let me add those together. 124 plus 176. Well, 124 plus 100 is 224, plus 70 is 294, plus 6 is 300. So that adds up to 300.\n\nSo the numerator becomes 240 multiplied by 300. Let's calculate that. 240 times 300. I can think of 24 times 3 is 72, and then add three zeros because 240 is 24*10 and 300 is 3*100. So 24*3=72, then 72 followed by three zeros is 72,000. Wait, no, wait: 240 * 300 is 72,000? Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because 240 * 300 is 240 * 3 * 100, which is 720 * 100 = 72,000. Yep, that's right.\n\nNow the denominator is (17 x 15 - 15). Let me compute that step by step. First, 17 multiplied by 15. Hmm, 17 *15. I know that 15 is 10 +5. So 17 *10 is 170, 17 *5 is 85. Adding those together, 170 +85=255. So 17 x15 is 255.\n\nThen subtract 15 from that. So 255 -15 is 240.\n\nSo the denominator is 240.\n\nNow putting it all together, the problem is (72,000) divided by (240). Let's compute that.\n\n72,000 \u00f7 240.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see. 240 times 300 is 72,000, because 240*300=72,000. So 72,000 \u00f7240 is 300.\n\nWait, so the result is 300. Looking at the options, option C is 300.
