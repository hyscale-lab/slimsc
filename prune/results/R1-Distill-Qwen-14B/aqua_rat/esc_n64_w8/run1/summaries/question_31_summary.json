      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the price of an appliance. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out what percentage more the appliance was sold for compared to its wholesale cost. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Let me think, so if the wholesale cost is, say, W dollars, then the retail price would be W plus 60% of W. Oh wait, yeah, that's the same as 1.6 times W. So, Retail Price (R) = 1.6 * W.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Oh right, so the selling price is 20% less than R. So, if the original R is 1.6W, then 20% of R is 0.2 * 1.6W = 0.32W. So, the selling price (S) is R minus that 20%, which is 1.6W - 0.32W. Let me calculate that: 1.6 minus 0.32 is 1.28. So S = 1.28 * W.\n\nWait, so S is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means the selling price is 28% higher than the wholesale cost because 0.28 is the decimal equivalent of 28%. So, the answer should be 28%, which is option B.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Let's assign a real number to W to make it concrete. Let's say the wholesale cost is $100. Then the original retail price is 60% more, so that's 100 + 60 = $160. Then, selling it for 20% less than $160 would be 160 - (20% of 160). 20% of 160 is 32, so 160-32=128. So the selling price is $128 when the wholesale is $100. So, 128 is 28% more than 100. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is B)28%.\n",

Oh right, if the wholesale cost is, say, $100, then the retail price would be $100 plus 60% of 100, which is $160. So, in general terms, the retail price is 1.6 times the wholesale cost.

Let the wholesale cost be W. Then the original retail price is W + 60% of W, which is W * 1.6. Right. Then, the selling price is 20% less than that.

Let me just double-check my math to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWholesale is W. Retail is 1.6W. Sold at 80% of that, so 0.8 * 1.6W. 1.6 * 0.8 is indeed 1.28. So 1.28W is 28% more than W. Yep, that checks out.\n\n\nLet the wholesale cost be \\( W \\). The original retail price is 60% more than \\( W \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retail Price (R)} = W + 0.6W = 1.6W\n\\]\n\nThe appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so the selling price \\( S \\) is:\n\n\\[\nS = R - 0.2R = 0.8R\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R = 1.6W \\) into the equation for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = 0.8 \\times 1.6W = 1.28W\n\\]\n\nThe selling price \\( S = 1.28W \\) is 128% of the wholesale cost, which means it is 28% more than the wholesale cost.\n\n**Answer: B**",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. Then, the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price. I need to find out what percent more the selling price is compared to the wholesale cost. The options are A to E, with E being 42%.\n\nHmm. So, I think I should start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let me think. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price is 60% more than W. How do I calculate that?\n\nOh right, if something is 60% more than W, it's W plus 60% of W. So that's W * (1 + 0.60) = 1.60 * W. So the original retail price is 1.6W.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is the original price minus 20% of it. Let me compute that.\n\nOriginal retail price is 1.6W. 20% of that is 0.20 * 1.6W = 0.32W. So the selling price is 1.6W - 0.32W = 1.28W.\n\nWait, so the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% more than the wholesale cost because 0.28 is the decimal part.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. So, W is the wholesale cost. Retail is 60% more, so 1.6W. Then, 20% off that would be selling it at 80% of 1.6W. Because 100% -20% =80%. So 0.8 * 1.6W is 1.28W. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo 1.28W is the same as 128% of W, which is 28% more than the wholesale cost. So the answer should be 28%, which is option B.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Wait, maybe I should consider if I'm comparing correctly. The question asks, \"sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost.\" So yes, comparing selling price to W. 1.28W is 28% more than W.
