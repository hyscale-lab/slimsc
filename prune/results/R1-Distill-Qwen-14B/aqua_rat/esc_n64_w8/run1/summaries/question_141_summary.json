      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day, it had 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, it had sold 80% of its inventory. So that means they sold 80% of 600, which I can calculate. But wait, I'll get to that in a second.\n\nIt also says that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Hmm, so the number of yellow balls sold is the same as the number of white balls sold. And importantly, by selling these, they sold all of their white golf balls. So whatever white balls they had at the beginning, they all got sold that day.\n\nThe question is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin with. The options are A)80, B)120, C)240, D)320, E)360.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's assign some variables to make it easier. Let me say:\n\nLet Y = the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning.\nLet W = the number of white golf balls at the beginning.\n\nSo, we know that Y + W = 600 because the total stock at the beginning was 600.\n\nNow, the store sold 80% of its inventory. So total sold = 80% of 600. Let me calculate that. 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nAnd since they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, let's say they sold X yellow and X white. So total sold is X + X = 2X. So 2X = 480. Therefore, X = 240. So they sold 240 yellow and 240 white balls.\n\nWait, but the problem says they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, right! So the number of white balls they had initially is exactly the number they sold. So W = 240, because they sold all of them. Because they started with W white balls and sold all, so W must be 240.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So if the store started with W white balls, and they sold all of them, then yes, W = 240.\n\nNow, since Y + W = 600, and W is 240, Y must be 600 - 240 = 360. So Y is 360. But wait, hold on. Wait, but that would mean the store started with 360 yellow balls. But wait, they sold 240 yellow balls. So after selling, how many are left? 360 - 240 = 120. Hmm, but that's not directly relevant to the question, which is about the initial count of yellow balls.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The initial yellow was Y = 360, and they sold 240, which is 240/360 = 2/3 of their yellow stock. So they have 120 left. That seems okay.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 360 is option E. So according to this, the answer should be E)360.\n\nWait, but let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when I do math quickly, I might miss a step.\n\nSo the total sold is 480, which is 240 yellow and 240 white. So since all white balls were sold, W = 240. So Y must be 600 - 240 = 360. So yes, Y is 360. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's see. Let me think about it differently. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming W = 240. Let me think again.\n\nThey sold all white balls, which implies that the number of white balls they had initially is equal to the number of white balls sold. And the number of white balls sold is X, which is 240. So yes, W = 240.\n\nSo Y is 600 - W = 360.\n\nBut let me think about the yellow balls sold. They sold 240 yellow. So if they started with Y = 360, then they have 360 - 240 = 120 left. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the remaining balls, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the total sold. 80% of 600 is indeed 480. And since they sold equal numbers of yellow and white, each is 240. So that's correct.\n\nSo the initial number of white balls is 240, so the initial number of yellow is 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer is E)360.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, E is 360, which is the initial number of yellow balls. So that's correct.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe store starts the day with 600 golf balls. By the end, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first I need to figure out how many they sold. 80% of 600 is... let's see, 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nNow, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and also, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the number of white golf balls they had at the beginning was exactly the number of white balls they sold. Because they sold all of them.\n\nWait, let me think. If they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, then the number of yellow balls sold equals the number of white balls sold. Let me denote the number of white balls sold as W. Then the number of yellow balls sold is also W.\n\nSo total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. And we know the total sold is 480, so 2W = 480. That means W is 240. So they sold 240 white balls and 240 yellow balls.\n\nSince all the white balls were sold, the store had exactly 240 white balls at the beginning. Now, the total initial stock was 600.

The store sold 80% of all the balls, so 480, which is 240 white and 240 yellow. But wait, does that mean they had 240 white to begin with? Because they sold all their white balls. So yes, initial white was 240, initial yellow was 600 - 240 = 360. So the answer should be 360, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, let me approach it another way.

By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first, I should calculate how many golf balls were sold.\n\nWait, 80% of 600 is... let me compute that. 80% is 0.8, so 0.8 * 600 equals 480. So they sold 480 golf balls. That means they have 600 - 480 = 120 left, right?\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Oh, and they sold all of their white balls. So that means all the white balls in stock were sold. Let's let W be the number of white balls they started with. Since they sold all of them, the number of white balls sold is W.\n\nSimilarly, they sold an equal number of yellow balls, so the number of yellow balls sold is also W. Wait, but wait. Because the total sold is 480, and that's the sum of white and yellow sold. So W (white) + W (yellow) = 480. That means 2W = 480, so W is 240. So they started with 240 white balls.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because they started with some white and some yellow. Let me denote Y as the initial number of yellow balls. So Y + W = 600. Because the total stock at the beginning was 600.\n\nFrom earlier, W is 240. So Y = 600 - 240 = 360. So the store started with 360 yellow balls. But wait, the options don't have 360 as the first option. Let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 360. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Because if they sold all white balls, then the remaining inventory would be Y - W. Because they started with Y yellow, sold W of them. So the remaining yellow balls would be Y - W. Which equals 600 - (W + Y) + (Y - W) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the store started with Y + W = 600. They sold W white balls and W yellow balls. So total sold is 2W = 480. So W = 240. So Y = 600 - 240 = 360. So the initial number of yellow balls is 360. So the answer should be E) 360.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. If the store started with 360 yellow and 240 white. They sold 240 white, which is all of them. And they sold 240 yellow. So total sold is 480, which matches the 80% sold. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct answer is E) 360.\n",

Hmm, so first I should calculate how many they sold. 80% of 600 is... let's see, 600 times 0.8. Let me do that. 600 * 0.8 = 480. So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nThe problem says that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, and importantly, they sold all of their white golf balls. So, if they sold the same number of each color, and all the white ones were sold, that means the number of white golf balls they had must be equal to half of the total sold. Wait, why? Because they sold equal numbers of both, right? So if they sold X white and X yellow, that's 2X total sold. Wait, no, the total sold is 480. So 2X = 480? No, wait, wait. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total sold is 480, and that's the sum of white and yellow sold. But since the number sold of each is equal, that would be Y (yellow sold) = W (white sold). So W + Y = 480. But since Y = W, then 2W = 480, so W = 240. So they sold 240 white golf balls and 240 yellow ones.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that by selling those, they sold all of their white golf balls. So that means the store had exactly 240 white golf balls at the beginning. Because they sold all of them. So W_initial = 240.\n\nNow, the total initial inventory is 600, which is the sum of yellow and white. So Y_initial + W_initial = 600.

They sold 240 white (all of them) and 240 yellow. So after selling, they have 360 - 240 = 120 yellow left, and 0 white left. So total inventory is 120. Wait, but the problem states that they sold 80% of the inventory. So 600 - 480 = 120, which matches.\n\nSo the number of yellow golf balls they had at the beginning is 360.

Let's re-calculate:\n\nTotal sold: 80% of 600 = 480.\n\nEqual number of yellow and white sold, so each is 480 / 2 = 240.\n\nSince all white were sold, initial white is 240.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, the store only has yellow and white golf balls. At the start of the day, they had 600 in stock. By the end, they sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first, I should find out how many they sold. Let me calculate that. \n\n80% of 600 is... well, 10% of 600 is 60, so 80% is 60*8 = 480. Oh wait, no, wait. 10% is 60, so 80% is 60 * 8? Wait, no, 10% is 60, so 20% is 120, 40% is 240, 60% is 360, 80% is 480. Yeah, that's right. So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Oh, and also, they sold all of their white golf balls. So whatever number of white balls they had, they sold them all. And the same number of yellow balls were sold. \n\nWait, so let's let W be the number of white golf balls they had at the start. So they sold all W white balls. And they sold the same number of yellow balls, so they sold W yellow balls as well. \n\nBut wait, the total sold is 480. So the total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. So 2W = 480. Solving for W, W = 240. So they had 240 white golf balls at the beginning. \n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the store only had a total of 600 at the beginning. So the initial stock was 600, which is yellow plus white. So if W is the number of white balls, then the yellow balls must be 600 - W.\n\nWait, but wait. They sold all the white balls, so W is the number of white balls in stock. So when they sold W white balls, that's all of them. So the number of white balls in stock was W, and they sold all, so W is the number of white balls sold.\n\nSimilarly, they sold W yellow balls. So the number of yellow balls they had in stock must have been more than or equal to W, because they sold W of them. But wait, they didn't necessarily sell all the yellow balls, right? Because the problem says they sold 80% of their total inventory, which is 480. But that 480 is split equally between yellow and white. So the number of white balls sold is W, and the number of yellow balls sold is W, so total 2W=480. So W=240.\n\nSo initial white balls: W=240. Initial yellow balls: Y=600 - W = 600-240=360. So they had 360 yellow balls at the start.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. If they sold 240 white balls and 240 yellow balls, that's 480 total, which is 80% of 600. And they had 360 yellow balls initially, so after selling 240, they have 120 left.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, the store only has yellow and white golf balls. At the start of the day, they had 600 in stock. By the end, they sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first, I should find out how many they sold. Let me calculate that. \n\n80% of 600 is... well, 10% of 600 is 60, so 80% is 60*8 = 480. Oh wait, no, wait. 10% is 60, so 80% is 60 * 8? Wait, no, 10% is 60, so 20% is 120, 40% is 240, 60% is 360, 80% is 480. Yeah, that's right. So they sold 480 golf balls in total.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Oh, and also, they sold all of their white golf balls. So whatever number of white balls they had, they sold them all. And the same number of yellow balls were sold. \n\nWait, so let's let W be the number of white golf balls they had at the start. So they sold all W white balls. And they sold the same number of yellow balls, so they sold W yellow balls as well. \n\nBut wait, the total sold is 480. So the total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. So 2W = 480. Solving for W, W = 240. So they had 240 white golf balls at the beginning. \n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the store only had a total of 600 at the beginning. So the initial stock was 600, which is yellow plus white. So if W is the number of white balls, then the yellow balls must be 600 - W.\n\nWait, but wait. They sold all the white balls, so W is the number of white balls in stock. So when they sold W white balls, that's all of them. So the number of white balls in stock was W, and they sold all, so W is the number of white balls sold.\n\nSimilarly, they sold W yellow balls. So the number of yellow balls they had in stock must have been more than or equal to W, because they sold W of them. But wait, they didn't necessarily sell all the yellow balls, right? Because the problem says they sold 80% of their total inventory, which is 480. But that 480 is split equally between yellow and white. So the number of white balls sold is W, and the number of yellow balls sold is W, so total 2W=480. So W=240.\n\nSo initial white balls: W=240. Initial yellow balls: Y=600 - W = 600-240=360. So they had 360 yellow balls at the start.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check. If they sold 240 white balls and 240 yellow balls, that's 480 total, which is 80% of 600. And they had 360 yellow balls initially, so after selling 240, they have 120 left. But the problem doesn't say anything about the remaining stock, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day. So that's 360.

Let's see what the question says. \n\nAt the beginning of the day, the store had 600 golf balls in stock. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm, so first, I need to find out how many golf balls were sold. 80% of 600 is... let me calculate that. 0.8 times 600 is 480. So they sold 480 golf balls.\n\nWait, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Oh, so the number of yellow balls sold is equal to the number of white balls sold. Also, it mentions that by selling these, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, so all the white balls were sold, but not all the yellow ones, because they sold only 480 total, which is 80% of 600.\n\nWait, let me think again. The store started with some yellow and white balls, and during the day, sold 480, which is 80% of 600. But the key point is that in those 480 sold, the number of yellow and white balls sold were equal. And importantly, all the white balls were sold. So that means the number of white balls they had initially must be equal to the number of white balls sold, which is half of 480.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the number of white balls sold is equal to the number of yellow balls sold. So, the total sold is 480, which is split equally between white and yellow. So 480 divided by 2 is 240. So they sold 240 white balls and 240 yellow balls.\n\nBut wait, the store sold all of its white balls. That means the initial number of white balls was exactly 240. Because they sold all of them. So the store had 240 white balls at the start.\n\nSince the total initial stock was 600, the rest must be yellow. So the initial yellow balls would be 600 minus 240, which is 360. Wait, but that's one of the options. Option E is 360. But wait, let me check again because that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck the problem. It says the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls. So the number of white balls they had is equal to the number of white balls sold, which is 240. So initial white balls = 240.\n\nTotal initial balls = 600, so initial yellow balls = 600 - 240 = 360. So that's option E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because they sold 480 balls total, which is 80% of 600. So they had 600, sold 480, so they have 120 left. Those 120 are the remaining yellow balls, because all white balls were sold.\n\nWait, wait, that's a different approach. Let me think: initial stock is Y (yellow) and W (white). Y + W = 600.\n\nThey sold 80% of the total, which is 480. And the number of yellow and white sold are equal. So they sold Ys and Ws, each in equal numbers. Also, all white were sold. So W = number of white sold, which is half of 480, because equal numbers of yellow and white were sold. So W = 240.\n\nSo Y + 240 = 600 \u2192 Y = 360. So the store had 360 yellow balls to begin with. So the answer is E)360.\n\nWait, but the options have E as 360. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: after selling, the store has 20% of stock left. 20% of 600 is 120. So 120 balls left, which are all yellow because all white were sold.\n\nSo initial yellow balls = 120 (remaining) + 240 (sold) = 360. So that's consistent.\n\nYes, that makes sense.
