      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Rahul borrowing money with simple interest. Hmm, I remember that simple interest is calculated using a specific formula. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nSo in this case, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. That's the principal, P = 500. The rate is 6% per annum, so R is 6%, which I should probably convert to a decimal. Oh right, 6% is 0.06. And the time is 4 years, so T=4.\n\nLet me plug these into the formula. I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me calculate that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500 * 0.06 is 30. Because 0.06 is 6%, and 6% of 500 is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years. 30 *4 is 120. So the interest is Rs. 120.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total amount he will pay, right? So the total amount is the principal plus the interest. So that's 500 + 120. 500 plus 100 is 600, plus 20 is 620. So the total amount is 620.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So that must be the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option A is 750, which seems too high. Option B is 700, also way too high. Option D is 600, which is just the principal plus 100, which doesn't match. So yeah, option C is the right one.\n",

Hmm, the question says that Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay back after 4 years, and I need to find out what amount he'll pay to clear the debt.\n\nWait, right. Simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nSo the principal here is Rs. 500. The rate is 6% per annum, so R is 6. And the time is 4 years. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nCalculating I: 500 * 6 * 4. Wait, but 6% is 0.06 in decimal form. Oh right, I remember that percentage needs to be converted to a decimal for the formula. So R is 0.06.\n\nSo I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me compute that. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30. Then 30 multiplied by 4 is 120. So the interest is Rs. 120.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Sometimes I get confused between simple and compound interest. Oh right, simple interest is just the interest on the principal, without compounding. So no need to worry about interest on the interest here.\n\nSo the total amount Rahul has to pay back is the principal plus the interest. That would be 500 + 120 = 620. So the amount is Rs. 620.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations. 500 * 0.06 is 30, that's correct. 30 for each year? So over 4 years, that's 30*4=120. Yep. So total is 500+120=620. So option C is correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in that. So the answer is C.\n",

Right?\n\nSo, the principal here is Rs. 500, the rate is 6% per annum, and the time is 4 years. Let me plug these numbers into the formula. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the interest. The rate is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal. So I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that step by step. \n\n500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500 * 0.06 equals 30. Oh right, because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years. 30 * 4 is 120. So the total interest is Rs. 120.\n\nNow, to find the total amount Rahul has to pay back, I need to add the principal and the interest. So 500 plus 120 is 620. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 620. So that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should compute it differently. \n\nAnother way: the interest each year is 6% of 500, which is 30. Over 4 years, that's 4 times 30, which is 120 again. Yep, same result. So total amount is 500 + 120 = 620. So the correct option should be C.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The options are A)750, which seems too high, B)700, also high, C)620, which matches my calculation, D)600, lower than what I got, and E)None of these. So definitely, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the total amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we use the simple interest formula:\n\n\\[\nI = P \\times R \\times T\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P = 500 \\) (principal amount),\n- \\( R = 6\\% = 0.06 \\) (annual interest rate),\n- \\( T = 4 \\) years.\n\nFirst, calculate the interest:\n\\[\nI = 500 \\times 0.06 \\times 4 = 30 \\times 4 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe total amount to be paid back is the sum of the principal and the interest:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Amount} = P + I = 500 + 120 = 620\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **C) 620**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let's see, I remember that simple interest is calculated using a specific formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll need to think it through carefully.\n\nThe problem says Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest. He needs to pay it back after 4 years. I need to find the total amount he'll pay. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None of these.\n\nWait, right, simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where P is the principal, R is the rate of interest per annum, and T is the time in years.\n\nSo, let me break this down. The principal P is 500 Rs. The rate R is 6% per annum, which I should probably convert to a decimal for calculation. So 6% is 0.06. Time T is 4 years.\n\nCalculating the interest: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is 30, right? Because 500 * 0.06 is the same as 500 * 6/100, which is 30. Then I multiply that by 4 years. 30 *4 is 120. So the interest over four years is 120 Rs.\n\nWait, so the total amount he has to pay back is the principal plus the interest. So that's 500 + 120. Which equals 620 Rs. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 620. So that's one of the choices, so the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I might miscalculate.\n\n500 * 0.06 = 30. Yes, that's correct. 30 *4 is 120. That's right. So adding 500 and 120 gives 620. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write out the formula again. The formula for the total amount (A) is A = P + (P*R*T). Or sometimes it's written as A = P(1 + R*T). Either way, the result should be the same.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: A = 500*(1 + 0.06*4). 0.06*4 is 0.24. 1 + 0.24 is 1.24. So 500 * 1.24. Hmm, what's 500 multiplied by 1.24?\n\nWell, 500 *1 is 500, 500 *0.24 is 120. So 500 + 120 is 620. Yep, same result. So the amount is definitely 620. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, C is 620. So the correct answer should be option C. But I just want to make sure I didn't overlook anything in the question. Did it ask for the total amount? Yes. And the interest is simple, which we've calculated correctly.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is C)620.\n",
