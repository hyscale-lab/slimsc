      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A through E.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to express m as a percentage of x, using y as the variable. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. x is m percent of 4y. So, m% of 4y equals x. I remember that \"percent\" means per hundred, so m% is the same as m divided by 100. So, mathematically, I can write that as:\n\nx = (m / 100) * 4y\n\nRight? Because m% of something is m/100 times that something. So, x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y.\n\nLet me write that equation again to make sure I got it right: x = (m * 4y) / 100.\n\nSimplifying that, it's x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nOkay, but I need to find m as a percentage of x. So, m is what percentage of x? That translates to (m / x) * 100%. Because when you want to find A as a percentage of B, you calculate (A/B)*100%.\n\nSo, let's compute m in terms of x. Wait, but x is already expressed in terms of m and y. So, maybe I can solve for m from the initial equation and then plug it into the percentage formula.\n\nStarting with x = (4 m y) / 100. Let me rearrange this to solve for m.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4 m y.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x) / (4y).\n\nSimplify that: 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, m = (25x)/y.\n\nWait, that's m equals (25x)/y. But I need to find m as a percentage of x. So, m is what percentage of x? So, the formula is (m / x) * 100%.\n\nPlugging m = (25x)/y into that, we get:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = [ (25x/y) / x ] * 100%.\n\nSimplify the x terms. The x in the numerator and the x in the denominator cancel each other out. So, that leaves (25/y) * 100%.\n\nSo, 25 times 100 is 2500, divided by y. So, (25 * 100) / y = 2500 / y.\n\nSo, that's 2500/y percent. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units.\n\nWait, no. Because m is expressed in terms of x and y, and we're finding m as a percentage of x, which is the same as (m/x)*100%. So, the steps look correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, m is (2500/y)% of x. So, the answer should be 2500/y, which is option D.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA) y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nYes, option D is 2500/y, which matches what I calculated.\n\nJust to recap, because I want to make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\n1. x is m% of 4y: x = (m/100)(4y) => x = (4 m y)/100.\n\n2. Solving for m: m = (100x)/(4y) = 25x/y.\n\n3. m is what percentage of x: (m/x)*100% = (25x/y)/(x) * 100% = 25/(y) * 100% = 2500/y%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n",

So, the formula is (m / x) * 100%.\n\nPlugging m = (25x)/y into that, we get:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = [ (25x/y) / x ] * 100%.\n\nSimplify the x terms. The x in the numerator and the x in the denominator cancel each other out. So, that leaves (25/y) * 100%.\n\nSo, 25 times 100 is 2500, divided by y.

I think that translates to an equation. Let me write that down.\n\nWait, when something is a certain percentage of another, we use the formula: part = (percentage/100) * whole. So, in this case, x is m% of 4y. So the equation would be x = (m/100) * 4y. That makes sense.\n\nLet me write that as x = (m * 4y) / 100.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y. Then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I need to find m as a percentage of x, expressed in terms of y. So, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for x to be m percent of 4y. I remember that when something is a certain percentage of another thing, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, m percent is m/100. So, x is equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y.\n\nLet me write that equation down: x = (m/100) * 4y. Simplifying that, x = (4m y)/100. Or, x = (m y) / 25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, so 4m y is 4m y, and 4m y divided by 100 is 0.04 m y. Hmm, maybe it's easier to keep it as (4m y)/100 for now.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, I need to find what percentage m is of x. The formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100%. In this case, the 'part' is m and the 'whole' is x. So, m is what percentage of x? So, the formula would be (m / x) * 100%.\n\nLet me plug in the expression I have for x. Since x = (4m y)/100, substituting that into the formula gives:\n\n(m / ((4m y)/100)) * 100%.\n\nLet me compute this. Let's first simplify the denominator. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So,\n\nm divided by (4m y / 100) is equal to m * (100 / (4m y)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, m cancels, leaving 100/(4y). So, that's (100/(4y)).\n\nNow, the entire expression is (100/(4y)) * 100% because we have that multiplied by 100%. Wait, let me re-express that. The initial calculation after substitution was (m / x) * 100%, which became (100/(4y)) * 100%? Wait, no. Wait, let me check that step again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation there. Let me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = [m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) ] * 100%.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y / 100) equals m multiplied by (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's in numerator and denominator cancel each other, so we have 100/(4 y).\n\nSo, that simplifies to (100 / (4y)).\n\nNow, that's the value of (m/x) * 100%, right? So, that's (100/(4y)) percent.\n\nWait, but 100/(4y) is equal to 25/y. Because 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, 25/y percent. But wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, I don't see 25/y. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again. Let's write it step by step.\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nSo, x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nNow, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) * 100%.\n\nSimplify the denominator: 4 m y / 100.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y / 100) is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's cancel out, giving 100/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nThen multiply by 100%: (25/y) * 100% = 2500% / y. So, that's 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because when I calculated (m/x)*100%, I substituted x and did the steps correctly. So, the result is 2500/y.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, and option E is 5000/y. So, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, when I have m divided by (4 m y / 100), that's m multiplied by (100/(4 m y)).\n\nYes, m cancels, leaving 100/(4 y). So that's 25/y.\n\nBut wait, that's the value of (m/x), right? So, then multiply by 100% to get the percentage.\n\nSo, 25/y * 100% = 2500/y %.\n\nSo, m is (2500/y)% of x.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, so that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y. Then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, I need to find m as a percentage of x, expressed in terms of y. So, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for x to be m percent of 4y. I remember that when something is a certain percentage of another thing, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So, m percent is m/100. So, x is equal to (m/100) multiplied by 4y.\n\nLet me write that equation down: x = (m/100) * 4y. Simplifying that, x = (4m y)/100. Or, x = (m y) / 25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, so 4m y is 4m y, and 4m y divided by 100 is 0.04 m y. Hmm, maybe it's easier to keep it as (4m y)/100 for now.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, I need to find what percentage m is of x. The formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100%. In this case, the 'part' is m and the 'whole' is x. So, m is what percentage of x? So, the formula would be (m / x) * 100%.\n\nLet me plug in the expression I have for x. Since x = (4m y)/100, substituting that into the formula gives:\n\n(m / ((4m y)/100)) * 100%.\n\nLet me compute this. Let's first simplify the denominator. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So,\n\nm divided by (4m y / 100) is equal to m * (100 / (4m y)).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, m cancels, leaving 100/(4y). So, that's (100/(4y)).\n\nNow, the entire expression is (100/(4y)) * 100% because we have that multiplied by 100%. Wait, let me re-express that. The initial calculation after substitution was (m / x) * 100%, which became (100/(4y)) * 100%? Wait, no. Wait, let me check that step again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation there. Let me go back.\n\nWe have:\n\n(m / x) * 100% = [m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) ] * 100%.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y / 100) equals m multiplied by (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's in numerator and denominator cancel each other, so we have 100/(4 y).\n\nSo, that simplifies to (100 / (4y)).\n\nNow, that's the value of (m/x) * 100%, right? So, that's (100/(4y)) percent.\n\nWait, but 100/(4y) is equal to 25/y. Because 100 divided by 4 is 25. So, 25/y percent. But wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, I don't see 25/y. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the substitution again. Let's write it step by step.\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nSo, x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nNow, m is what percentage of x? So, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) * 100%.\n\nSimplify the denominator: 4 m y / 100.\n\nSo, m divided by (4 m y / 100) is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nThe m's cancel out, giving 100/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nThen multiply by 100%: (25/y) * 100% = 2500% / y. So, that's 2500/y percent.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Because when I calculated (m/x)*100%, I substituted x and did the steps correctly. So, the result is 2500/y.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, and option E is 5000/y. So, I think option D is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, when I have m divided by (4 m y / 100), that's m multiplied by (100/(4 m y)).\n\nYes, m cancels, leaving 100/(4 y). So that's 25/y.\n\nBut wait, that's the value of (m/x), right? So, then multiply by 100% to get the percentage.\n\nSo, 25/y * 100% = 2500/y %.\n\nSo, m is (2500/y)% of x.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, so that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by interpreting the given information. We are told that \\( x \\) is \\( m \\% \\) of \\( 4y \\).

So:\n\n1. x is m% of 4y \u2192 x = (m/100)*4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100.\n\n2. Solve for m: m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m =25x/y.\n\n3. m is what percentage of x? So (m/x)*100% \u2192 (25x/y)/x *100 \u2192 25/y *100 \u2192 2500/y %.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the correct option is D, 2500/y.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into mathematical expressions. The problem states that \\( x \\) is \\( m\\% \\) of \\( 4y \\), which can be written as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100}\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( m \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Multiply both sides by 100:\n\n\\[\n100x = 4my\n\\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by \\( 4y \\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{100x}{4y} = \\frac{25x}{y}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). This is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( m = \\frac{25x}{y} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{25x}{y}}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\n\\]\n\nThe \\( x \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{25}{y} \\right) \\cdot 100 = \\frac{2500}{y}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y}\\% \\) of \\( x \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**D) \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\)**\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of percentages and algebra. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm. So I need to find m as a percentage of x, expressed in terms of y. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information given. It says x is m percent of 4y. I remember that \"A is B percent of C\" translates to A = (B/100) * C. So applying that here, x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that out:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nWait, let me compute that. So 4y multiplied by m over 100. So x equals (4 m y)/100. I can also write that as x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nBut I think I can simplify that. 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, so x = 0.04 m y. Hmm, but maybe I should keep it as fractions for easier manipulation later. So x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nNow the question is asking, m is what percentage of x. So I need to find m as a percentage of x. That translates to (m / x) * 100%, right? Because percentage is part over whole times 100.\n\nSo the formula is: (m / x) * 100%.\n\nBut I know x in terms of m and y. Let me substitute x from earlier. So x is (4 m y)/100. So substituting:\n\n(m / [(4 m y)/100]) * 100%.\n\nLet me compute this step by step. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, I think. Because m is m, and the denominator has 4 m y. So when I invert and multiply, m cancels.\n\nWait, so let's compute m divided by x. That's m divided by (4 m y / 100). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nSo that becomes (m * 100) / (4 m y). The m's cancel out, so it's 100/(4 y).\n\nThen multiply by 100% as per the percentage formula. Wait no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up a step.\n\nWait, let me re-express that. The expression is (m / x) * 100. So x is (4 m y)/100. So m/x is m divided by (4 m y /100). Let me write this as:\n\nm / [(4 m y)/100] = m * (100/(4 m y)).\n\nYes, because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So this becomes (m * 100) / (4 m y).\n\nNow, m in the numerator and denominator cancels. So (100)/(4 y).\n\n100 divided by 4 is 25. So this simplifies to 25 / y.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Because when I have (m * 100)/(4 m y), the m's cancel, leaving 100/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nBut that's the value of (m/x) * 100%, right? Because (m/x)*100 is the percentage.\n\nWait, so (m/x)*100% equals 25/y percent?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine my steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me go back.\n\nWe have x = (m/100)*4y. So x = (4 m y)/100.\n\nNow, to find m as a percentage of x, that's (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSo substituting x:\n\n(m / [ (4 m y)/100 ]) * 100%.\n\nLet me compute the division first. m divided by (4 m y /100) is equal to m multiplied by (100)/(4 m y).\n\nSo m * 100 / (4 m y). The m's cancel, so 100/(4 y) = 25/(y).\n\nSo that's 25/y, and then we have the *100% part.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the entire expression is (m/x)*100, which is 25/y * 100?\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, (m / x) = m / [ (4 m y)/100 ] = m * [100/(4 m y)] = (m * 100) / (4 m y) = (100)/(4 y) = 25/y.\n\nThen, (m/x)*100% is (25/y) * 100% = 2500/y %.\n\nWait, so that would be 2500 divided by y percent. So that's 2500/y %.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, and option E is 5000/y.\n\nWait, but I thought (m/x)*100 is the percentage. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the percentage calculation. Let's think again.\n\nIf I have m as a percentage of x, that's (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSo m/x is 25/y, so 25/y *100% is (25 *100)/(y) %, which is 2500/y %.\n\nSo the percentage is 2500/y percent.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, which would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assign some numbers to see if it makes sense.\n\nSuppose y is 2, m is 100. Then x is m% of 4y. So 4y is 8. x is 100% of 8, which is 8.\n\nThen, m is 100, x is 8. So m is what percentage of x? (100/8)*100% = 1250%.\n\nNow, according to the options, if y=2, option D is 2500/2=1250, which matches. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother example: y=5, m=200.\n\nx = (200/100) * 4*5 = 2 *20=40.\n\nm is 200, x is 40. m is what percentage of x? (200/40)*100=500%.\n\nAccording to option D, 2500/5=500, which matches.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is option D: 2500/y.\n",

So, (25x)/(y) divided by x is 25/(y) times (x/x), which is 1. So, it becomes 25/y.\n\nWait, so (m / x) is 25/y. Then, to express m as a percentage of x, I multiply by 100%. So, 25/y * 100% = (2500/y)%.\n\nWait, that's (2500 divided by y) percent. So, m is (2500/y)% of x. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y, and E is 5000/y. Oh wait, the options are given as expressions, not percentages. So, the percentage is (2500/y)%, so the value of m as a percentage of x is (2500/y)%. So, looking at the options, D is 2500/y, which would be 2500/y percent. So, that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nx = (m/100) *4y \u2192 x = (4 m y)/100 \u2192 100x = 4 m y \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m =25x/y.\n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So, (m/x)*100% \u2192 (25x/y)/x *100% \u2192 25/(y) *100% \u2192 2500/y%.\n\nSo, the answer is 2500/y, which is option D.\n\n\nThe problem states that \\( x \\) is \\( m \\)% of \\( 4y \\), which translates to the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\cdot 4y\n\\]\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for \\( m \\), we multiply both sides by 100:\n\n\\[\n100x = 4ym\n\\]\n\nThen, divide through by \\( 4y \\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{100x}{4y} = \\frac{25x}{y}\n\\]\n\nThe question asks for \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\), which is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\%\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( m = \\frac{25x}{y} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{25x}{y}}{x} \\right) \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{25}{y} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{2500}{y}\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2500}{y}\\% \\) of \\( x \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x? The options are A to E.\n\nHmm. So, I need to express m as a percentage of x, using y as the variable. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. x is m percent of 4y. So, I think that translates mathematically into x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Right? Because when something is a certain percentage of another, you divide by 100 to convert the percentage to a decimal.\n\nSo, x = (m/100) * 4y. Let me write that down. That's x = (4y * m)/100. Alternatively, x = (4 m y) / 100.\n\nNow, the question is asking, m is what percentage of x? So, we're looking for m as a percentage of x, which would be (m / x) * 100%. Because percentage is part over whole times 100. Wait, wait, actually, percentage of x would be (m divided by x) multiplied by 100. So, m is (m/x)*100 percent of x.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. So, if I want to find what percentage m is of x, the formula is (m / x) * 100%. So, I need to compute that expression.\n\nBut I know that x is (4 m y)/100. So, I can substitute that into the expression for (m/x)*100.\n\nSo, substituting x, we get:\n\n(m / [(4 m y)/100]) * 100.\n\nLet me simplify this. Let's compute the denominator first: (4 m y)/100.\n\nSo, when I divide m by that, it's m divided by (4 m y / 100). Which is the same as m multiplied by (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nSo, m * (100) / (4 m y). The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So, we're left with 100/(4 y).\n\nWait, because m/m is 1. So, 100 divided by (4 y) is 25/(y). Because 100/4 is 25. So, 25/(y) multiplied by 100%? Wait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, let's go back. The expression is (m / x) * 100. We substituted x as (4 m y)/100, so:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) * 100.\n\nWhich is m * (100/(4 m y)) * 100. Wait, no, because when you divide by a fraction, it's multiplying by its reciprocal. So, m divided by (4 m y / 100) is m * (100 / (4 m y)).\n\nSo that's (m * 100) / (4 m y). The m's cancel, so it's 100/(4 y) * 100? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the entire expression is (m/x)*100, and x is (4 m y)/100.\n\nSo, (m / (4 m y /100 )) *100.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step. So, m divided by (4 m y /100) equals m * (100)/(4 m y). The m in numerator and denominator cancels, so 100/(4 y) is 25/y.\n\nThen, multiply by 100: 25/y * 100 = 2500 / y.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, that's not correct. Let me double-check.\n\nBecause the expression is (m / x) * 100. And x is (4 m y)/100.\n\nSo, substitute x into the equation:\n\n(m / ((4 m y)/100)) * 100.\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n(m) divided by ( (4 m y)/100 ) is equal to m * (100/(4 m y)).\n\nSo, m cancels out, giving 100/(4 y) = 25/(y).\n\nThen, multiply by 100: 25/y * 100 = 2500 / y.\n\nWait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 25/y multiplied by 100 is 2500/y. So, m is (2500/y)% of x? Hmm.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me write down the steps again.\n\nWe have x = (m/100)*4y = (4 m y)/100.\n\nWe need to find m as a percentage of x. So, (m / x) * 100%.\n\nSubstitute x:\n\n(m / (4 m y / 100 )) * 100 = (m * 100/(4 m y)) * 100.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the expression is (m / x) * 100. So, substituting x:\n\n(m / ( (4 m y)/100 )) * 100.\n\nWhich is m * (100/(4 m y)) * 100.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n(m / x) = m / ( (4 m y)/100 ) = m * (100/(4 m y)).\n\nWhich simplifies to (m * 100) / (4 m y) = 100/(4 y) = 25/(y).\n\nThen, multiply by 100% to get the percentage: 25/y * 100% = 2500/y%.\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nOh, so option D is 2500/y, which matches what I just got. So, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but wait another moment.

So, m is (m/x) * 100% of x.\n\nSo, m = (25x/y). So, m is (25 x / y) \u2192 m is (25 x / y) = (25/y) x.\n\nSo, m is (25/y) times x, which is (25/y) *100% = (2500/y) percent of x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, m is equal to (25x)/y, which is the same as (25/y) * x.\n\nSo, to express m as a percentage of x, we have (m/x) * 100%.\n\nWhich is (25x/y / x) * 100% = (25/(y)) * 100% = 2500/(y)%.\n\nWhich is 2500/y percent.\n\nSo, the answer is D) 2500/y.\n\nWait, but another way: Let's plug in numbers to test.\n\nSuppose y = 1, m = 100 (so that x is 100% of 4*1=4, so x=4).\n\nThen, m is 100, x is 4.\n\nSo, m as a percentage of x is (100 /4)*100% = 2500%.\n\nWhich matches 2500/y when y=1, because 2500/1=2500%.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: Let y=2, m=50.\n\nx is 50% of 4*2=8 \u2192 x=4.\n\nSo, m is 50, x is 4.\n\nm as percentage of x is (50/4)*100% = 1250%.\n\n2500/y is 2500/2=1250%. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula works with these examples.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.\n",
