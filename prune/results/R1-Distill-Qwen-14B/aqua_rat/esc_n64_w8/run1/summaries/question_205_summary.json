      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. The question says a certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. They want to know how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain.\n\nHmm, so the rate is given in gallons per x seconds. I need to find the time in minutes. Right, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So, the rate (let's call it R) is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. I can write this as R = (w/25) / x, because rate is quantity over time. Alternatively, R = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think. If it's w/25 gallons every x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x, because rate is (amount)/(time). So yes, R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for time in minutes. So maybe I should convert the rate to gallons per minute instead. Let me see. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I can multiply the rate by 60 to get gallons per minute.\n\nSo R in gallons per minute would be (w/(25x)) * 60 = (60w)/(25x). Simplifying that, 60 divided by 25 is 12/5, so R = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's think about the units. I have gallons per x seconds, and I need to find the time in minutes for y gallons. \n\nAnother approach: Time is equal to the amount divided by the rate. So time = y / R. But I have to make sure the units work out.\n\nWait, R is in gallons per x seconds. So R = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gal/s. Hmm, no, wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So in one second, it's (w/25)/x gallons. So yes, R = w/(25x) gal/s.\n\nBut since we need the time in minutes, perhaps it's easier to find the time in seconds first and then convert to minutes.\n\nAlternatively, let me find the time in seconds. The time t (in seconds) would be the number of gallons y divided by the rate (in gal/s). So t = y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x)/w = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, that gives me t in seconds. I need to convert it to minutes, so I divide by 60. So time in minutes is (25xy)/(w * 60) = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w). Hmm, that looks familiar. Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gal/s.\n\n2. To find time in seconds to get y gallons: time (seconds) = y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) = 25xy/w seconds.\n\n3. Convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: (25xy)/(w*60) = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.\n",

The question says a liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. I need to find how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, so the rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. I think the first thing I should do is find the rate in gallons per second or maybe gallons per minute because the answer needs to be in minutes. Let's see.\n\nThe rate is w/25 gallons in x seconds. So, to get the rate per second, I can divide that by x. So the rate (let's call it r) would be (w/25) / x. Which simplifies to w/(25x) gallons per second. But wait, the problem is asking for time in minutes, so maybe it's better to convert the rate to gallons per minute.\n\nRight, because there are 60 seconds in a minute. So if it's w/(25x) gallons per second, then per minute it would be multiplied by 60. So gallons per minute (r) would be (w/(25x)) * 60. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, but maybe it's better to keep it as fractions. 60 is 60/1, so 60 * (w/(25x)) = (60w)/(25x). Simplify that: 60 divided by 25 is 12/5, because 25 times 12 is 300 and 25 times 5 is 125. Wait, 25 times 12 is 300? No, wait, 25 * 12 = 300? No, 25*12 is 300. Wait, wait, 25*12 is 300, and 25*5 is 125. Hmm, but maybe I can write 60/25 as 12/5. Because 60 divided by 5 is 12, and 25 divided by 5 is 5. So yes, 60/25 is 12/5. So the rate is (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me double-check. So the original rate is (w/25) gallons in x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second. Multiply by 60 to get gallons per minute: 60 * (w/(25x)) = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of time per gallon. Because the question is asking for the time it takes to pass y gallons. So, if the rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then the time for one gallon would be (x seconds) divided by (w/25) gallons. So time per gallon is (x) / (w/25) = (x * 25)/w seconds per gallon.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's think. If in x seconds, it passes w/25 gallons, then for each gallon, it would take x * (25/w) seconds. So for y gallons, it would take y multiplied by that. So y * (25x/w) seconds. But we need the time in minutes. So we divide by 60 to convert seconds to minutes. So time in minutes would be (25x y)/(w * 60). Let me compute that: 25 divided by 60 is 5/12. So (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that's one possibility.\n\nWait, but let me try the other approach, using rate. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the rate in gallons per second is (w)/(25x). To find how long it takes for y gallons, time is amount divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) seconds. Then convert to minutes by dividing by 60: (25x y)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. So same result.\n\nSo the answer should be option C: 5xy/(12w). Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA) y/(1200xy) \u2192 That can't be right, because units don't make sense. It would be 1/(x) when simplified, but units-wise, time should be proportional to y and inversely proportional to rate.\n\nB) 20xy/w \u2192 Hmm, that's a possibility but maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think about the units. The time should be in minutes. Let's check each option:\n\nOption C: 5xy/(12w). The units would be (x in seconds) * y (gallons) / w (gallons per x seconds?) Wait, no, w is in the numerator? Wait, let's think about the units.\n\nWait, in our calculation, the rate was w/25 gallons every x seconds. So w has units of gallons, x in seconds. So the units for the rate (w/25) / x would be (gallons) / (seconds). So the rate is (gallons per second). So when we compute time as y / rate, the units would be (gallons) / (gallons/second) ) = seconds. Then we convert to minutes by dividing by 60.\n\nBut when I look at the answer option C: 5xy/(12w). Let's see the units. x is in seconds, y in gallons, w in gallons. So (x * y) / (w) \u2192 (seconds * gallons) / gallons \u2192 seconds. Then multiplied by 5/12, which is unitless. So the unit is seconds. Wait, but we need the answer in minutes. So that would be (5xy/(12w)) seconds. Wait, that's not matching because I thought it's (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Did I make a mistake in the unit analysis?\n\nWait, let's go back. When we computed the time in seconds, we had (25x y)/(60 w) seconds. Because 25x y is in (seconds * gallons) and divided by w (gallons). So (25x y)/(w) is seconds. Then divided by 60 to get minutes, so 25/(60) is 5/12. So the time in minutes is (5x y) / (12 w). So the units for the answer are (x in seconds) * y (gallons) / (w in gallons) \u2192 seconds. So that's correct. So the unit is seconds. Wait, no, no, because the calculation gives us (5xy)/(12w) in minutes. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do a unit analysis. Let's see. Let me think in terms of dimensional analysis.\n\nThe given rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So rate is (w/25) / x = w/(25 x) gallons per second.\n\nWe have y gallons. Time in seconds is y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) seconds.\n\nConvert to minutes: (25 x y)/(w * 60) minutes.\n\nWhich is (25)/(60) * (x y)/(w) ) \u2192 (5/12) * (x y)/(w) \u2192 (5 x y)/(12 w) minutes.\n\nSo the unit is correct: (seconds * gallons) / (gallons) \u2192 seconds, but we've converted it to minutes. So yes, the units in the answer are correct.\n\nLooking at option C: 5xy/(12w). Which matches what we've got. So the correct answer is C.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: 20xy/w. Let's see the unit: (x is seconds, y is gallons, w is gallons. So 20xy/w is (20 * seconds * gallons) / gallons ) \u2192 20 seconds. So the unit is seconds, but the answer is in minutes. So that can't be right unless 20xy/w is in minutes, which it isn't. Because 20 is unitless, and x is seconds, y is gallons, w is gallons. So 20xy/w is 20 * (seconds * gallons)/gallons \u2192 20 seconds. So the unit is seconds, which is not what we need. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption E: 3y/(wx). Units: (y gallons) / (w gallons * x seconds) \u2192 1/(x seconds). Doesn't match the needed time in minutes.\n\nOption A: y/(1200xy) \u2192 1/(1200x), which is 1/(seconds), which doesn't make sense. So no.\n\nOption D: w/(3xy) \u2192 w is gallons, x is seconds, y is gallons. So (gallons)/(gallons * seconds) \u2192 1/seconds. Which is again, not matching.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is option C.\n",

Time in seconds is y / (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x/w) seconds.\n\nConvert to minutes: (25 x y)/(w * 60) minutes.\n\nWhich is (25)/(60) * (x y)/(w) ) \u2192 (5/12) * (x y)/(w) \u2192 (5 x y)/(12 w) minutes.\n\nSo the unit is correct: (seconds * gallons) / (gallons) \u2192 seconds, but we've converted it to minutes. So yes, the units in the answer are correct.\n\nLooking at option C: 5xy/(12w). Which matches what we've got. So the correct answer is C.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: 20xy/w. Let's see the unit: (x is seconds, y is gallons, w is gallons. So 20xy/w is (20 * seconds * gallons) / gallons ) \u2192 20 seconds. So the unit is seconds, but the answer is in minutes. So that can't be right unless 20xy/w is in minutes, which it isn't. Because 20 is unitless, and x is seconds, y is gallons, w is gallons. So 20xy/w is 20 * (seconds * gallons)/gallons \u2192 20 seconds. So the unit is seconds, which is not what we need. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption E: 3y/(wx). Units: (y gallons) / (w gallons * x seconds) \u2192 1/(x seconds). Doesn't match the needed time in minutes.\n\nOption A: y/(1200xy) \u2192 1/(1200x), which is 1/(seconds), which doesn't make sense. So no.\n\nOption D: w/(3xy) \u2192 w is gallons, x is seconds, y is gallons. So (gallons)/(gallons * seconds) \u2192 1/seconds. Which is again, not matching.\n\nSo yes, the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given rate: the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of \\( \\frac{w}{25} \\) gallons every \\( x \\) seconds. This can be expressed as \\( \\frac{w}{25x} \\) gallons per second. To convert this to gallons per minute, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate in gallons per minute} = \\frac{w}{25x} \\times 60 = \\frac{60w}{25x} = \\frac{12w}{5x}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the time it takes for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through the drain. Time is calculated as the amount divided by the rate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in seconds} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{w}{25x}} = y \\times \\frac{25x}{w} = \\frac{25xy}{w}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert this time into minutes, we divide by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{25xy}{w \\times 60} = \\frac{5xy}{12w}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\( \\frac{y}{1200xy} \\) has incorrect units and does not match the derived expression.\n- **Option B**: \\( \\frac{20xy}{w} \\) has incorrect units and does not match the derived expression.\n- **Option C**: \\( \\frac{5xy}{12w} \\) matches the derived expression exactly.\n- **Option D**: \\( \\frac{w}{3xy} \\) has incorrect units and does not match the derived expression.\n- **Option E**: \\( \\frac{3y}{wx} \\) has incorrect units and does not match the derived expression.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option C**.\n\nAnswer: C",

And they're asking how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through. The options are A to E.\n\nWait, let me break this down. So, the rate is given in gallons per some time. Rate is usually quantity over time, right? So here, the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, mathematically, that's rate = (w/25) / x. But wait, no, wait. No, rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) divided by x. Because if you have 5 gallons every 10 seconds, that's 0.5 gallons per second. So yeah, rate = (w/25) / x.\n\nWait, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the liquid passes w/25 gallons every x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) divided by x, which is (w)/(25x) gallons per second. Or wait, no, because if it's w/25 gallons in x seconds, then per second it's (w/25)/x. So yeah, that's right.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it as rate = (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nWait, but maybe I should convert that to gallons per minute since the question asks for time in minutes. Right, because the answer needs to be in minutes, not seconds.\n\nSo, let's convert the rate from gallons per second to gallons per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so multiply by 60. So rate in gallons per minute is (w/(25x)) * 60 = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x). Hmm, wait. Let me calculate that: 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, so 2.4w/(x). But maybe it's better to leave it as fractions for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach the problem differently. Instead of converting units first, maybe find the time in seconds and then convert to minutes.\n\nSo, if the rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then how long does it take to pass y gallons?\n\nTime is equal to amount divided by rate. So, time in seconds would be y / ( (w/25)/x ). Let me write that out.\n\nTime in seconds = y / ( (w/(25x)) ) = y * (25x / w) ) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me see. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, the rate is (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second. So, the time to pass y gallons is y / (w/(25x)) )= y * (25x/w) )= (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. Now, to get this into minutes, I need to divide by 60, because there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, time in minutes is (25xy/w) /60 = (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w).\n\nWait, let me check the math. 25 divided by 60 is 25/(60) which reduces to 5/12. So, 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w). That looks right.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches what I got. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think of the steps again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find the time in seconds first.\n\nThe rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, the time per gallon would be (x *25)/w seconds per gallon. Because if it takes x seconds to pass (w/25) gallons, then per gallon, it's x *25 /w seconds.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, time per gallon is x seconds per (w/25) gallons. So, time per gallon is x/(w/25) )= 25x/w seconds per gallon. So for y gallons, time is y * (25x/w) seconds. Which again is 25xy/w seconds. Then convert to minutes: 25xy/w /60 = 5xy/(12w). Yep, same as before.\n\nAnother way: Let me think about unit analysis.\n\nGiven rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So the units are gallons/(seconds). So rate is (w/25) /x = w/(25x) [gallons per second].\n\nWe have y gallons. Time in seconds is y / rate = y / (w/(25x)) )= y * (25x/w) )= 25xy/w seconds.\n\nConvert to minutes: 25xy/w * (1 minute/60 seconds) )= 25xy/(60w) minutes = 5xy/(12w) minutes.\n\nSo yes, that's consistent.

So first, I think I should find the rate in gallons per second, then maybe convert that into minutes because the question is asking for time in minutes.\n\nWait, the rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So that's like (w/25) gallons over x seconds. To get the rate in gallons per second, I should divide that amount by x. So the rate r would be (w/25) divided by x. Let me write that as r = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the time in minutes. Oh right, because the answer needs to be in minutes, not seconds. So I'll probably need to convert the time from seconds to minutes at some point.\n\nThe formula I remember for time is time = amount divided by rate. So the time t in seconds would be y divided by r. Let me write that out: t_seconds = y / r. Substituting r, that's t_seconds = y / (w/(25x)).\n\nWait, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, right?

So I take the time in seconds and divide by 60. So t_minutes = (25xy/w) / 60.\n\nLet me compute that. 25 divided by 60 is... wait, 25/60 can be simplified.

Time for y gallons is y divided by that rate, which is y * (25x)/w, giving 25xy/w seconds. Convert to minutes by dividing by 60, so (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) when simplified.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a liquid passing through a drain, and I need to figure out how long it takes for y gallons to pass through. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem says the liquid flows at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. Hmm, right. So first, I think I should find the rate in gallons per second, then maybe convert that into minutes because the question is asking for time in minutes.\n\nWait, the rate is given as w/25 gallons per x seconds. So that's like (w/25) gallons over x seconds. To get the rate in gallons per second, I should divide that amount by x. So the rate r would be (w/25) divided by x. Let me write that as r = (w)/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the time in minutes. Oh right, because the answer needs to be in minutes, not seconds. So I'll probably need to convert the time from seconds to minutes at some point.\n\nThe formula I remember for time is time = amount divided by rate. So the time t in seconds would be y divided by r. Let me write that out: t_seconds = y / r. Substituting r, that's t_seconds = y / (w/(25x)).\n\nWait, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, right? So that becomes y * (25x/w) = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nBut the question wants the time in minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I need to convert seconds to minutes. So I take the time in seconds and divide by 60. So t_minutes = (25xy/w) / 60.\n\nLet me compute that. 25 divided by 60 is... wait, 25/60 can be simplified. Both are divisible by 5. 25 \u00f75 is 5, 60 \u00f75 is 12. So that becomes (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w), which matches what I got. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the rate is w/25 per x seconds, which is (w)/(25x) per second. Time for y gallons is y divided by that rate, which is y * (25x)/w, giving 25xy/w seconds. Convert to minutes by dividing by 60, so (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) when simplified. Yep, that looks right.\n\nI think I got it. So the answer should be option C.\n\n\nThe liquid flows at a rate of \\( \\frac{w}{25} \\) gallons every \\( x \\) seconds, which translates to a rate of \\( \\frac{w}{25x} \\) gallons per second. To find the time in minutes for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through, we first calculate the time in seconds using the formula \\( t_{\\text{seconds}} = \\frac{y}{\\text{rate}} \\).

The question is asking how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through, given that the rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. I need to figure out the time in minutes.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I remember that rate is usually quantity over time. So the given rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. Wait, so in x seconds, w/25 gallons flow through. So to find the time for y gallons, I think I can set up a proportion or something.\n\nLet me write down the given rate. Rate = (w/25) gallons / x seconds. I can write this as (w/25)/x gallons per second, but maybe it's better to think in terms of how much flows in a second. So per second, it's (w/25) divided by x, which is w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for time in minutes, so maybe I should convert the rate to gallons per minute instead. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I can multiply the per-second rate by 60. So per minute, the rate is (w/(25x)) * 60 gallons. Let me calculate that: 60/(25x) * w. Simplify 60/25: that's 12/5. So the rate is (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this as a unit conversion problem. So, the rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. I need to find the time t in minutes such that the amount y gallons is passed.\n\nSo, the formula is: time = amount / rate.\n\nBut the rate needs to be in gallons per minute because the answer is in minutes. So, first, find the rate in gallons per minute.\n\nGiven rate is (w/25) gallons / x seconds. To convert to gallons per minute, multiply by 60 (since 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n(w/25) / x * 60 = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nNow, time t is y gallons divided by this rate.\n\nSo t = y / [(12w)/(5x)].\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that becomes y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). So that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Another approach: let's find how many x-second intervals are needed for y gallons, then convert that into minutes.\n\nEach x seconds, (w/25) gallons pass. So the number of intervals needed is y divided by (w/25) = (25y)/w. Each interval is x seconds, so total time in seconds is (25y/w) * x = (25xy)/w seconds.\n\nConvert seconds to minutes: divide by 60. So (25xy)/(w*60) = (25xy)/(60w) = simplifying, 5xy/(12w) minutes.

I think I need to find the time in minutes for y gallons to pass. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand the rate. Rate is usually quantity over time. So the rate here is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So that's (w/25) / x gallons per second. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Because if it's (w/25) gallons every x seconds, then the rate would be (w/25) divided by x, right? So rate = (w/25) / x gallons per second.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think in terms of units. Let's see: the units for rate would be gallons per second. So (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So the rate is (w/25) / x = w/(25x) gallons per second. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo the rate R is w/(25x) gallons per second. Now, I need to find the time T in minutes when y gallons pass through.\n\nTime is equal to quantity divided by rate. So T = y / R. But since R is in gallons per second, T will be in seconds.

Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I divide T_seconds by 60.\n\nSo T_minutes = (25 x y / w ) / 60 = (25xy) / (60w) = (5xy)/(12w) because 25/60 simplifies to 5/12.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 60 is 5/12?

First, calculate the flow rate in gallons per second:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Flow rate} = \\frac{w}{25x} \\, \\text{gallons per second}.\n\\]\n\nNext, use the formula \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{amount}}{\\text{rate}} \\) to find the time in seconds for \\( y \\) gallons to pass through:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in seconds} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{w}{25x}} = y \\cdot \\frac{25x}{w} = \\frac{25xy}{w}.\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in minutes} = \\frac{25xy}{w \\cdot 60} = \\frac{5xy}{12w}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\( \\frac{5xy}{12w} \\).**\n\nAnswer: C",
