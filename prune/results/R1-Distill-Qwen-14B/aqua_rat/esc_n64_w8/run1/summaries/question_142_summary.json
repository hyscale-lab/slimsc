      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about shadows and heights, right? It says a flagstaff that's 17.5 meters high casts a shadow of 40.25 meters. Then there's a building with a shadow of 28.75 meters, and I need to find its height. Hmm, I remember something about similar triangles here because the sun's angle would be the same for both objects, making their heights and shadows proportional.\n\nWait, so if the flagstaff and building are casting shadows at the same time, the ratio of their heights should be the same as the ratio of their shadows. Oh right, because the triangles formed by their heights and shadows are similar. So, the formula should be height of flagstaff over shadow length of flagstaff equals height of building over shadow length of building.\n\nLet me write that down. So, (Height of flagstaff) / (Shadow of flagstaff) = (Height of building) / (Shadow of building). Plugging in the numbers, 17.5 / 40.25 = H / 28.75, where H is the building's height.\n\nNow, I need to solve for H. Let's compute 17.5 divided by 40.25 first. Hmm, 17.5 is the same as 35/2, and 40.25 is like 161/4. Wait, 40.25 is 40 and 0.25, which is 40 + 1/4 = 161/4? Wait, 40 * 4 is 160, plus 1 is 161. Yeah, so 40.25 is 161/4. So 17.5 is 35/2.\n\nSo 17.5 / 40.25 is (35/2) divided by (161/4). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that's (35/2) * (4/161). Let me compute that: 35 *4 is 140, 2*161 is 322. So 140/322. Can this fraction be simplified? Let me see, 140 and 322. Hmm, 140 factors are 2*2*5*7. 322 divided by 2 is 161. Oh, wait, 322 is 2*161. And 161 is 7*23. So 322 is 2*7*23. So 140 is 2^2 *5 *7. So the common factors are 2 and 7. So, 140 divided by 14 is 10, 322 divided by 14 is 23. So the simplified fraction is 10/23. So 17.5 /40.25 = 10/23.\n\nNow, the ratio of the building's height to its shadow is the same. So H / 28.75 = 10/23. So H = (10/23) * 28.75.\n\nWait, what's 28.75 as a fraction? 28.75 is 28 and three quarters, which is 115/4. So, 10/23 multiplied by 115/4. Let me compute that. 10 *115 is 1150. 23*4 is 92. So 1150 /92. Let me see if this can be simplified. 1150 divided by 2 is 575, 92 divided by 2 is 46. So 575/46. Hmm, 575 divided by 23 is 25, because 23*25 is 575. And 46 is 2*23. So 575/46 = (25*23)/(2*23) )= 25/2. So 25/2 is 12.5. Oh, so H is 12.5 meters.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again to be sure. So 17.5 /40.25 is 10/23. Then 28.75 is 28.75. 10/23 *28.75 = ? Let me compute 28.75 *10 =287.5. Divide by 23: 287.5 /23. Hmm, 23*12=276. 23*12.5=287.5, because 23*12 is 276, 23*0.5 is 11.5, 276+11.5=287.5. So yeah, 287.5 /23=12.5. So H is 12.5 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 12.5. So the answer should be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about flagstaffs and buildings casting shadows. Hmm, I think it's a proportion problem. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nAlright, the flagstaff is 17.5 meters high, and its shadow is 40.25 meters long. Then there's a building with a shadow of 28.75 meters, and I need to find its height. The conditions are similar, so the sun's angle should be the same for both, right?\n\nWait, when the sun's angle is the same, the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. So the ratio of the height to the shadow length should be the same for both the flagstaff and the building.\n\nSo, for the flagstaff, the ratio is height divided by shadow. Let me write that down:\n\nHeight_flagstaff / Shadow_flagstaff = Height_building / Shadow_building\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = H / 28.75\n\nI need to solve for H. Hmm, how do I do that? Oh right, cross-multiplication. So:\n\nH = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25\n\nLet me calculate that. Wait, 17.5 times 28.75. Let's see. Maybe I can simplify the numbers. 17.5 is the same as 35/2, right? And 28.75 is 115/4. Let me compute 35/2 * 115/4 = (35*115)/(2*4) = 4025/8. Wait, 35 times 115... Let me compute that. 35 times 100 is 3500, 35 times 15 is 525, so total 4025. So 4025 divided by 8 is 503.125.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. 35 * 115 is 4025? Let me double-check. 35*100 is 3500, 35*15 is 525, adding gives 4025. Yes, right. So 4025/8 is 503.125.\n\nThen, divide that by 40.25. Hmm, 40.25 is the same as 161/4, because 40 is 160/4, plus 0.25 is 1/4, so 161/4.\n\nSo H = (4025/8) / (161/4) = (4025/8) * (4/161)\n\nSimplify this. 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 4025 * 0.5 / 161. Wait, 4025 * 0.5 is 2012.5. So 2012.5 divided by 161.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me divide 2012.5 by 161. What's 161 times 12? 161 *10 is 1610, plus 161*2 is 322, total 1932. 1932 is less than 2012.5. The difference is 2012.5 -1932=80.5.\n\nSo 12 plus something. 161 times 0.5 is 80.5. So 12.5? Because 12 +0.5=12.5. So 161*12.5=2012.5.\n\nWait, that's correct because 161 *12=1932, 161*0.5=80.5. 1932+80.5=2012.5. Exactly.\n\nSo H is 12.5 meters. Let me look at the options. Option B is 12.5. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Maybe I should try another approach. Let me think about ratios again.\n\nThe flagstaff is 17.5 m tall with a shadow of 40.25 m. So the ratio is 17.5 /40.25. Let me calculate that as a decimal.\n\n17.5 \u00f7 40.25. Hmm, let's see. 40.25 divided by 17.5 equals approximately 2.3 (since 17.5*2.3 is 40.25). Wait, wait, 17.5 multiplied by 2 is 35, 17.5*2.3 is 17.5*(2 + 0.3) = 35 +5.25=40.25. Oh right, so 17.5 * 2.3=40.25. So the ratio is 1/2.3.\n\nWait, so the ratio of height to shadow is 1/2.3. Because 17.5/40.25 = 1/2.3.\n\nSo for the building, the shadow is 28.75 m. Multiply that by the ratio (1/2.3) to get the height.\n\nSo H = 28.75 * (1/2.3) = 28.75 / 2.3.\n\nLet me compute that. 2.3 times 12 is 27.6. 28.75-27.6=1.15. 1.15 divided by 2.3 is 0.5. So 12 +0.5=12.5. So again, 12.5 meters. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, another way: maybe using unitary method. How long is the shadow per meter height?\n\nFor the flagstaff, 17.5 m height gives 40.25 m shadow. So per meter, the shadow is 40.25 /17.5 meters. Let me compute that.\n\n40.25 \u00f717.5. Let me see. 17.5 *2 is 35. 17.5*2.3 is 40.25, as before. So 40.25 \u00f717.5 =2.3 m per meter height.\n\nSo for the building, shadow is 28.75 m. So the height would be shadow divided by 2.3.\n\n28.75 /2.3=?\n\n28.75 \u00f7 2.3.\n\nHmm, 2.3 \u00d712=27.6. 28.75-27.6=1.15. 1.15 \u00f72.3=0.5. So 12.5 m. Yep, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident the answer is 12.5 meters, which is option B.\n",

Let me write that down:\n\nHeight_flagstaff / Shadow_flagstaff = Height_building / Shadow_building\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = H / 28.75\n\nI need to solve for H. Hmm, how do I do that? Oh right, cross-multiplication. So:\n\nH = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25\n\nLet me calculate that. Wait, 17.5 times 28.75. Let's see. Maybe I can simplify the numbers. 17.5 is the same as 35/2, right? And 28.75 is 115/4. Let me compute 35/2 * 115/4 = (35*115)/(2*4) = 4025/8. Wait, 35 times 115... Let me compute that. 35 times 100 is 3500, 35 times 15 is 525, so total 4025. So 4025 divided by 8 is 503.125.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. 35 * 115 is 4025? Let me double-check. 35*100 is 3500, 35*15 is 525, adding gives 4025. Yes, right. So 4025/8 is 503.125.\n\nThen, divide that by 40.25. Hmm, 40.25 is the same as 161/4, because 40 is 160/4, plus 0.25 is 1/4, so 161/4.\n\nSo H = (4025/8) / (161/4) = (4025/8) * (4/161)\n\nSimplify this. 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 4025 * 0.5 / 161. Wait, 4025 * 0.5 is 2012.5. So 2012.5 divided by 161.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me divide 2012.5 by 161. What's 161 times 12? 161 *10 is 1610, plus 161*2 is 322, total 1932. 1932 is less than 2012.5. The difference is 2012.5 -1932=80.5.\n\nSo 12 plus something. 161 times 0.5 is 80.5. So 12.5? Because 12 +0.5=12.5.

Hmm, let's see. 40.25 divided by 17.5 equals approximately 2.3 (since 17.5*2.3 is 40.25). Wait, wait, 17.5 multiplied by 2 is 35, 17.5*2.3 is 17.5*(2 + 0.3) = 35 +5.25=40.25. Oh right, so 17.5 * 2.3=40.25. So the ratio is 1/2.3.\n\nWait, so the ratio of height to shadow is 1/2.3. Because 17.5/40.25 = 1/2.3.\n\nSo for the building, the shadow is 28.75 m. Multiply that by the ratio (1/2.3) to get the height.\n\nSo H = 28.75 * (1/2.3) = 28.75 / 2.3.\n\nLet me compute that. 2.3 times 12 is 27.6. 28.75-27.6=1.15. 1.15 divided by 2.3 is 0.5. So 12 +0.5=12.5. So again, 12.5 meters. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, another way: maybe using unitary method. How long is the shadow per meter height?\n\nFor the flagstaff, 17.5 m height gives 40.25 m shadow. So per meter, the shadow is 40.25 /17.5 meters. Let me compute that.\n\n40.25 \u00f717.5. Let me see. 17.5 *2 is 35. 17.5*2.3 is 40.25, as before. So 40.25 \u00f717.5 =2.3 m per meter height.\n\nSo for the building, shadow is 28.75 m. So the height would be shadow divided by 2.3.\n\n28.75 /2.3=?\n\n28.75 \u00f7 2.3.\n\nHmm, 2.3 \u00d712=27.6. 28.75-27.6=1.15. 1.15 \u00f72.3=0.5. So 12.5 m. Yep, same result.\n\nSo I'm confident the answer is 12.5 meters, which is option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we recognize that the triangles formed by the flagstaff and its shadow, and the building and its shadow, are similar. This means the ratio of height to shadow length is constant for both objects. \n\nFor the flagstaff, the height is \\(17.5 \\, \\text{m}\\) and the shadow length is \\(40.25 \\, \\text{m}\\). Thus, the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Height of flagstaff}}{\\text{Shadow length of flagstaff}} = \\frac{17.5}{40.25}\n\\]\n\nFor the building, the shadow length is \\(28.75 \\, \\text{m}\\), and we need to find its height (\\(H\\)). Using the same ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{H}{28.75}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\nH = \\frac{17.5 \\times 28.75}{40.25}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(17.5 \\times 28.75\\). Breaking it down:\n\n\\[\n17.5 \\times 28.75 = 17.5 \\times \\left(28 + 0.75\\right) = 17.5 \\times 28 + 17.5 \\times 0.75\n\\]\n\n\\[\n17.5 \\times 28 = 490, \\quad 17.5 \\times 0.75 = 13.125\n\\]\n\n\\[\n17.5 \\times 28.75 = 490 + 13.125 = 503.125\n\\]\n\nNow divide by \\(40.25\\):\n\n\\[\nH = \\frac{503.125}{40.25} = 12.5 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the building is \\(12.5 \\, \\text{m}\\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with shadows and heights, it's probably related to similar triangles or something like that. Oh right, because the sun's angle would be the same for both objects, making the triangles similar.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high, and its shadow is 40.25 meters long. I need to find the height of a building that casts a shadow of 28.75 meters under the same conditions. \n\nSo, similar triangles mean the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to its shadow length should be the same as the ratio of the building's height to its shadow length. \n\nLet me write that out. So:\n\nHeight of flagstaff / Length of shadow = Height of building / Length of building's shadow\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75\n\nWait, what's h here? Oh right, h is the height of the building I need to find.\n\nSo I can rearrange the equation to solve for h. Cross-multiplying gives:\n\nh = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25\n\nNow I need to calculate that. Let me see. Maybe I can simplify the fractions first. Let's see, 17.5 is the same as 35/2, and 40.25 is 40 and a quarter, which is 161/4. Hmm, maybe I can convert them into fractions to make it easier.\n\nWait, 17.5 is 35/2, 40.25 is 161/4, and 28.75 is 115/4. Let me plug those in.\n\nSo h = (35/2) * (115/4) / (161/4)\n\nWait, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\nh = (35/2) * (115/4) * (4/161)\n\nWait, the 4 in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. So 4/4 is 1. So now it's:\n\n(35/2) * (115/161)\n\nLet me compute that. Let me see if 35 and 161 have a common factor. 35 is 5*7. 161 divided by 7 is 23, because 7*23 is 161. Oh right, so 35 and 161 can be reduced. 35 is 5*7, 161 is 7*23. So dividing both by 7 gives 5/23.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n(5/2) * (115/23) \n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck. 35/2 * 115/161 = (35 * 115) / (2 * 161) \n\nAfter factoring 35=5*7 and 161=7*23, the 7 cancels out. So it's (5 * 115) / (2 * 23). \n\nSo 5 *115 is 575, and 2 *23 is 46. So 575/46.\n\nLet me compute that division. 46 times 12 is 552 (because 46*10=460, 46*2=92, 460+92=552). 575 minus 552 is 23. So 23/46 is 0.5.

So total is 488.75 +14.375=503.125.\n\nThen divide by 40.25. So 503.125 /40.25.\n\nWait, 40.25 is the same as 161/4. So 503.125 is 503.125 = 4025/8? Wait, wait, 40.25 is 40 and 1/4, which is 161/4.

Oh right, because the flagstaff and the building are both casting shadows under similar conditions, their heights and shadow lengths should be proportional.\n\nSo the flagstaff is 17.5 meters tall and its shadow is 40.25 meters. The building's shadow is 28.75 meters, and I need to find its height. I think I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me write down the given values. Flagstaff height (H1) is 17.5 m, shadow length (S1) is 40.25 m. Building height (H2) is what I'm looking for, shadow length (S2) is 28.75 m.\n\nThe ratio of height to shadow length should be the same for both. So H1/S1 = H2/S2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 17.5 / 40.25 = H2 / 28.75.\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify that. Let's calculate 17.5 divided by 40.25 first. Hmm, let me compute that. 17.5 \u00f7 40.25. Let me see, 40.25 is like 161/4, because 40.25 = 40 + 0.25 = 40 + 1/4 = 160/4 + 1/4 = 161/4. Hmm, maybe it's easier as decimals. 17.5 divided by 40.25.\n\nWait, 40.25 divided by 17.5. Oh wait, no, I need 17.5 divided by 40.25. Let me think, 17.5 is 35/2, and 40.25 is 161/4. So 35/2 divided by 161/4 is same as 35/2 * 4/161 = (35 *4)/(2*161) = (140)/(322). Let me divide numerator and denominator by 14. 140 \u00f714=10, 322 \u00f714 is about 23. 10/23 is approximately 0.4348.\n\nWait, but maybe I should do it with decimals instead. 17.5 /40.25. Let me compute that. 17.5 \u00f740.25. Well, 40.25 \u00d7 0.43 is about 40.25 *0.4=16.1, 40.25 *0.03=1.2075. So 16.1 +1.2075=17.3075. Hmm, that's close to 17.5. So 0.43 gives about 17.3075, which is a bit less than 17.5. Let's see the difference. 17.5 -17.3075=0.1925. So I need a little more than 0.43.\n\nLet me try 0.434. 40.25 *0.434. Hmm, 40 *0.434 =17.36, and 0.25 *0.434=0.1085. So total is 17.36+0.1085=17.4685. Still a bit less than 17.5. The difference is 17.5-17.4685=0.0315. So I need to add a bit more. How much more? Let me see, per 0.001 increase, 40.25 *0.001=0.04025. So to cover 0.0315, 0.0315 /0.04025 \u22480.782. So about 0.434 +0.000782 \u22480.434782. So approximately 0.4348.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.4348. So H2 = 0.4348 * S2. Wait no, wait, the equation is H2 = (H1/S1) * S2. So H2 = (17.5/40.25) *28.75.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 17.5 *28.75 divided by 40.25. Let me try that.\n\n17.5 *28.75 = ? Let me calculate that. 17 *28.75 is 488.75, 0.5 *28.75 is 14.375. So total is 488.75 +14.375=503.125.\n\nThen divide by 40.25. So 503.125 \u00f740.25. Hmm, 40.25 \u00d712 is 483. 40.25 \u00d712.5 is 40.25 \u00d710=402.5, plus 40.25\u00d72.5=100.625. So 402.5 +100.625=503.125. Oh! So 40.25 \u00d712.5 equals exactly 503.125. So H2 is 12.5 meters.\n\nWait, so that would be option B) 12.5 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. Let me see, 17.5 is 35/2, 40.25 is 161/4, 28.75 is 115/4.\n\nSo H2 = (35/2) / (161/4) * (115/4).\n\nSimplify the fractions: (35/2) * (4/161) = (35 *4)/(2 *161) = (140)/(322) = 70/161 = 10/23.\n\nThen multiply by 115/4. So 10/23 *115/4. 115 divided by 23 is 5. So 10 *5=50. 50 divided by 4 is 12.5. So H2=12.5 m.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 12.5 metre.\n",

The building's shadow is 28.75 meters, and I need to find its height. I think I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me write down the given values. Flagstaff height (H1) is 17.5 m, shadow length (S1) is 40.25 m. Building height (H2) is what I'm looking for, shadow length (S2) is 28.75 m.\n\nThe ratio of height to shadow length should be the same for both. So H1/S1 = H2/S2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 17.5 / 40.25 = H2 / 28.75.\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify that. Let's calculate 17.5 divided by 40.25 first. Hmm, let me compute that. 17.5 \u00f7 40.25. Let me see, 40.25 is like 161/4, because 40.25 = 40 + 0.25 = 40 + 1/4 = 160/4 + 1/4 = 161/4. Hmm, maybe it's easier as decimals. 17.5 divided by 40.25.\n\nWait, 40.25 divided by 17.5. Oh wait, no, I need 17.5 divided by 40.25. Let me think, 17.5 is 35/2, and 40.25 is 161/4. So 35/2 divided by 161/4 is same as 35/2 * 4/161 = (35 *4)/(2*161) = (140)/(322). Let me divide numerator and denominator by 14. 140 \u00f714=10, 322 \u00f714 is about 23. 10/23 is approximately 0.4348.\n\nWait, but maybe I should do it with decimals instead. 17.5 /40.25. Let me compute that. 17.5 \u00f740.25. Well, 40.25 \u00d7 0.43 is about 40.25 *0.4=16.1, 40.25 *0.03=1.2075. So 16.1 +1.2075=17.3075. Hmm, that's close to 17.5. So 0.43 gives about 17.3075, which is a bit less than 17.5. Let's see the difference. 17.5 -17.3075=0.1925. So I need a little more than 0.43.\n\nLet me try 0.434. 40.25 *0.434. Hmm, 40 *0.434 =17.36, and 0.25 *0.434=0.1085. So total is 17.36+0.1085=17.4685. Still a bit less than 17.5. The difference is 17.5-17.4685=0.0315. So I need to add a bit more. How much more? Let me see, per 0.001 increase, 40.25 *0.001=0.04025. So to cover 0.0315, 0.0315 /0.04025 \u22480.782. So about 0.434 +0.000782 \u22480.434782. So approximately 0.4348.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 0.4348. So H2 = 0.4348 * S2. Wait no, wait, the equation is H2 = (H1/S1) * S2. So H2 = (17.5/40.25) *28.75.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 17.5 *28.75 divided by 40.25. Let me try that.\n\n17.5 *28.75 = ? Let me calculate that. 17 *28.75 is 488.75, 0.5 *28.75 is 14.375. So total is 488.75 +14.375=503.125.\n\nThen divide by 40.25. So 503.125 \u00f740.25. Hmm, 40.25 \u00d712 is 483. 40.25 \u00d712.5 is 40.25 \u00d710=402.5, plus 40.25\u00d72.5=100.625. So 402.5 +100.625=503.125. Oh! So 40.25 \u00d712.5 equals exactly 503.125. So H2 is 12.5 meters.\n\nWait, so that would be option B) 12.5 meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. Let me see, 17.5 is 35/2, 40.25 is 161/4, 28.75 is 115/4.\n\nSo H2 = (35/2) / (161/4) * (115/4).\n\nSimplify the fractions: (35/2) * (4/161) = (35 *4)/(2 *161) = (140)/(322) = 70/161 = 10/23.\n\nThen multiply by 115/4. So 10/23 *115/4. 115 divided by 23 is 5. So 10 *5=50. 50 divided by 4 is 12.5. So H2=12.5 m.\n\nSo the answer should be B) 12.5 metre.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of similar triangles. Since the flagstaff and the building cast shadows under similar conditions, their heights and shadow lengths are proportional. Let the height of the building be \\( H_2 \\). The given values are:\n\n- Height of flagstaff (\\( H_1 \\)) = 17.5 m  \n- Shadow length of flagstaff (\\( S_1 \\)) = 40.25 m  \n- Shadow length of building (\\( S_2 \\)) = 28.75 m  \n\nThe proportionality relationship is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{H_1}{S_1} = \\frac{H_2}{S_2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{H_2}{28.75}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the ratio \\( \\frac{17.5}{40.25} \\). Converting to fractions:\n\n\\[\n17.5 = \\frac{35}{2}, \\quad 40.25 = \\frac{161}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{\\frac{35}{2}}{\\frac{161}{4}} = \\frac{35 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 161} = \\frac{140}{322} = \\frac{70}{161} = \\frac{10}{23}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this ratio into the equation for \\( H_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nH_2 = \\frac{10}{23} \\cdot 28.75\n\\]\n\nConvert \\( 28.75 \\) to a fraction:\n\n\\[\n28.75 = \\frac{115}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nH_2 = \\frac{10}{23} \\cdot \\frac{115}{4}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\cdot 115}{23 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{1150}{92}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 115 \\div 23 = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\nH_2 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 5}{4} = \\frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the height of the building is **12.5 meters**.\n\nAnswer: B",

And there's a building with a shadow of 28.75 meters, and I need to find its height. \n\nWait, similar triangles... So the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow should be the same for both the flagstaff and the building. Because the sun's elevation angle is the same at the same time, the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. \n\nSo the formula should be: height1 / shadow1 = height2 / shadow2. Oh right, so I can set up a proportion here. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. For the flagstaff: height1 is 17.5, shadow1 is 40.25. For the building, shadow2 is 28.75, and height2 is what I'm solving for.\n\nSo, 17.5 / 40.25 = height / 28.75.\n\nWait, maybe I should rearrange that equation to solve for height. So height = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let me see, 17.5 times 28.75. Hmm, 17.5 * 28 is 490, and 17.5 * 0.75 is 13.125. So adding those together, 490 + 13.125 = 503.125. \n\nThen divide that by 40.25. So 503.125 \u00f7 40.25. Let me compute that. Let me see, 40.25 times 12 is 483. Because 40*12=480 and 0.25*12=3, so 483. Then 503.125 minus 483 is 20.125. \n\nSo 20.125 divided by 40.25 is 0.5, because 40.25 * 0.5 is 20.125.

Hmm, 40.25 goes into 503.125 how many times? \n\nWait, 40.25 *12 = 483, as before. Subtracting gives 20.125. So 20.125 is exactly half of 40.25, so that's 0.5. So 12.5 total.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the problem says a flagstaff that's 17.5 meters high casts a shadow of 40.25 meters. And there's another building that casts a shadow of 28.75 meters under the same conditions. I remember that when two objects cast shadows under similar lighting conditions, the triangles formed are similar. So, similar triangles have proportional sides.\n\nSo the idea is to set up a ratio between the height of the flagstaff and its shadow, and then use that same ratio to find the height of the building based on its shadow length. That makes sense because the angles of the sun would be the same for both, making the triangles similar.\n\nLet me write down the given values. The flagstaff's height is 17.5 m, and its shadow is 40.25 m. The building's shadow is 28.75 m, and I need to find its height, let's call it h.\n\nSo the ratio for the flagstaff would be height/shadow = 17.5 / 40.25. For the building, it's h / 28.75. Since the triangles are similar, these ratios should be equal.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75\n\nNow, I need to solve for h. Let's cross-multiply. That gives 40.25 * h = 17.5 * 28.75.\n\nWait, let me calculate the right side first. 17.5 multiplied by 28.75. Hmm, maybe I can break this down. Let me think, 17.5 is 35/2, and 28.75 is 115/4. So multiplying them would be (35/2) * (115/4) = (35*115) / (8). Let me compute 35 times 115.\n\n35 * 100 is 3500, 35*15 is 525, so 3500 + 525 = 4025. So the numerator is 4025, denominator is 8. So 4025 /8 is 503.125.\n\nSo 17.5 * 28.75 = 503.125.\n\nThen, the equation is 40.25 * h = 503.125.\n\nSo h = 503.125 / 40.25.\n\nWait, let me compute that. Hmm, 40.25 times 12 is 483, because 40*12=480, 0.25*12=3, so 483. 40.25 *12.5 would be 40.25 *12 + 40.25*0.5 = 483 + 20.125 = 503.125. Oh, that's convenient. So 40.25 multiplied by 12.5 is 503.125.\n\nSo h is 12.5 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 12.5 meters. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using ratios. Let me think. 40.25 divided by 17.5 is the ratio of shadow to height for the flagstaff. Let me compute that. 40.25 /17.5 = ?\n\nHmm, 17.5 times 2 is 35. So 40.25 minus 35 is 5.25. So 17.5 *2.3 is 17.5*(2 +0.3)=35 +5.25=40.25. So 40.25 is 17.5 *2.3. So the ratio is 2.3. So the shadow is 2.3 times the height.\n\nSo for the building, the shadow is 28.75 m. So the height h would be shadow divided by 2.3. So h= 28.75 /2.3.\n\nLet me compute that. 28.75 divided by 2.3. Let's see, 2.3 times 12 is 27.6. 28.75 -27.6 =1.15. 2.3 goes into 1.15 exactly 0.5 times. So 12 +0.5=12.5. So h is 12.5. Yep, same answer.\n",

Hmm, 40.25 times 12 is 483, because 40*12=480, 0.25*12=3, so 483. 40.25 *12.5 would be 40.25 *12 + 40.25*0.5 = 483 + 20.125 = 503.125. Oh, that's convenient. So 40.25 multiplied by 12.5 is 503.125.\n\nSo h is 12.5 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 12.5 meters. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using ratios. Let me think. 40.25 divided by 17.5 is the ratio of shadow to height for the flagstaff. Let me compute that. 40.25 /17.5 = ?\n\nHmm, 17.5 times 2 is 35. So 40.25 minus 35 is 5.25. So 17.5 *2.3 is 17.5*(2 +0.3)=35 +5.25=40.25. So 40.25 is 17.5 *2.3. So the ratio is 2.3. So the shadow is 2.3 times the height.\n\nSo for the building, the shadow is 28.75 m. So the height h would be shadow divided by 2.3. So h= 28.75 /2.3.\n\nLet me compute that. 28.75 divided by 2.3. Let's see, 2.3 times 12 is 27.6. 28.75 -27.6 =1.15. 2.3 goes into 1.15 exactly 0.5 times. So 12 +0.5=12.5. So h is 12.5. Yep, same answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of similar triangles. Since the flagstaff and the building cast shadows under similar conditions, the triangles formed are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.\n\n### Given:\n- Height of the flagstaff: \\( 17.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Shadow of the flagstaff: \\( 40.25 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Shadow of the building: \\( 28.75 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Height of the building: \\( h \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\n### Step 1: Set up the ratio\nThe ratio of height to shadow length for the flagstaff is:\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25}\n\\]\nFor the building, the ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{h}{28.75}\n\\]\nSince the triangles are similar, these ratios are equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{h}{28.75}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( h \\)\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n40.25 \\cdot h = 17.5 \\cdot 28.75\n\\]\nFirst, calculate \\( 17.5 \\cdot 28.75 \\):\n\\[\n17.5 \\cdot 28.75 = 503.125\n\\]\nNow, solve for \\( h \\):\n\\[\nh = \\frac{503.125}{40.25}\n\\]\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\nh = 12.5 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify using the shadow-to-height ratio\nThe shadow-to-height ratio for the flagstaff is:\n\\[\n\\frac{40.25}{17.5} = 2.3\n\\]\nFor the building, the height is:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{28.75}{2.3} = 12.5 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the height of the building is \\( 12.5 \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe height of the building is **12.5 meters**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Hmm, I think it's a similar triangles problem because the sun's rays are coming at the same angle for both the flagstaff and the building, right? \n\nLet me read the question again. The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high and casts a shadow of 40.25 meters. The building casts a shadow of 28.75 meters, and I need to find the building's height. So, similar triangles, so the ratios of the heights and their shadows should be equal.\n\nWait, right. So for similar triangles, the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow should be the same for both objects. So, if I set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me write that down. The ratio for the flagstaff is 17.5 meters height divided by 40.25 meters shadow. And the ratio for the building is h meters (which I need to find) divided by 28.75 meters shadow. So, 17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75.\n\nTo solve for h, I can cross-multiply. So h equals (17.5 * 28.75) divided by 40.25.\n\nWait, let me calculate that. Let me think about the numbers. 17.5 multiplied by 28.75. Hmm, maybe it's easier if I convert them into fractions or use decimal multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify the ratio first. Let's see, 17.5 over 40.25. Hmm, 40.25 is 17.5 multiplied by something. Let me see: 17.5 times 2 is 35, and 17.5 times 2.3 is 40.25? Wait, wait, 17.5 * 2.3? Let me calculate 17.5 * 2 =35, 17.5 * 0.3=5.25, so total 40.25. Oh right, so 17.5 *2.3 =40.25. So the ratio 17.5/40.25 is 1/2.3 because 17.5 is 1 times 17.5, and 40.25 is 2.3 times 17.5. So 1/2.3 is approximately 0.43478.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate using decimals. Let me do 17.5 *28.75. Hmm, 17.5 *28 is 490, and 17.5 *0.75 is 13.125. So 490 +13.125 is 503.125. Then divide that by 40.25.\n\nSo h = 503.125 /40.25. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me see, 40.25 times 12 is 483 (because 40*12=480 and 0.25*12=3, total 483). 503.125 minus 483 is 20.125.
