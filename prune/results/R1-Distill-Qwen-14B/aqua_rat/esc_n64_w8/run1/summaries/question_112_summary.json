      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a canal's cross-section shaped like a trapezium. Hmm, trapezium... wait, I think in the US it's called a trapezoid, but the shape is the same. So the problem gives me some dimensions and asks for the depth. Let me break it down.\n\nThe canal is 10 meters wide at the top and 6 meters wide at the bottom. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the cross-section is a trapezium. So the top and bottom are the two parallel sides. The top width is 10 m, bottom is 6 m. And the area is 640 square meters. We need to find the depth, which I think is the height of the trapezium.\n\nSo the formula for the area of a trapezium is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the height (which is the depth in this case). Right, so I can plug in the numbers.\n\nWait, let me get that right. Area = (sum of the two bases) divided by two, multiplied by the height. So, (10 + 6)/2 * h = 640.\n\nSo 16/2 is 8. So 8 * h = 640. Wait, 8h=640. So h = 640 /8. Let me calculate that. 640 divided by 8 is 80. Oh, that's one of the options. Option D is 80. So the depth should be 80 meters?\n\nWait, that seems really deep for a canal. Is that right? Let me check my steps again. Top width is 10, bottom is 6. So the two bases are 10 and 6. Area is 640. So area formula: (10 +6)/2 * h =640 \u2192 16/2=8, 8h=640 \u2192 h=80. Oh, so maybe it's correct. But 80 meters is 80 meters, which is pretty deep. But maybe the canal is big.\n\nWait, another thought: Did I mix up the top and bottom? Because sometimes the top is the larger side. Wait, the problem says the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom. So top is 10, bottom is 6. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be 80, which is option D.

The problem gives me the widths at the top and bottom, and the area, and I need to find the depth. \n\nWait, the top width is 10 meters, the bottom is 6 meters. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, actually, I think I might have that reversed. Because usually, canals are wider at the top so that water flows more smoothly, but I'm not sure. But in any case, the formula for the area of a trapezium is what's important here.\n\nThe area of a trapezium is calculated by the formula: (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height, divided by two. Oh right, so the formula is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the height (which in this case is the depth of the canal, I think).\n\nSo the problem says the cross-sectional area is 640 square meters. The two parallel sides are the top and bottom widths. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, in a trapezium, the two parallel sides are called the bases. So in a canal's cross-section, the top and bottom would be the two bases. So a is 10m, b is 6m? Or maybe the other way around? I think it doesn't matter because addition is commutative, so (10+6)/2 is the same as (6+10)/2. So the sum is 16, and 16/2 is 8. So the area is 8 times the height, which is the depth. \n\nSo the area is 640 = (10 + 6)/2 * depth. So 640 = (16/2)*depth \u2192 640 = 8 * depth. So to find the depth, I divide 640 by 8.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Wait, no, the formula is correct. Area = (a + b)/2 * h. So with a=10, b=6, h is the depth. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the depth is 80 meters. But looking at the options, D is 80. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but wait another thing.

Oh right, the area is calculated as (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height (which is the distance between them), all divided by two.

Maybe the numbers in the problem are correct, and the canal is indeed 80 meters deep.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a canal with a trapezium-shaped cross-section. Hmm, I remember that a trapezium is a four-sided figure with one pair of sides parallel. The problem says the canal is 10 meters wide at the top and 6 meters wide at the bottom. The area of the cross-section is 640 square meters, and I need to find the depth of the canal. \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about what's the depth here. Oh right, in a trapezium, the area is calculated using the formula: Area = (sum of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the height, then divided by two. So the formula is (a + b)/2 * h, where 'h' is the height, which in this case is the depth of the canal. \n\nSo the two parallel sides are the top and bottom widths. The top is 10m, the bottom is 6m. So a is 10, b is 6. The area is given as 640. Let me plug these into the formula. \n\nWait, let me write that down. Area = (10 + 6)/2 * depth. So that's (16)/2 * depth. 16 divided by 2 is 8. So 8 times depth equals 640. To find the depth, I divide 640 by 8. Let me do that calculation. 640 divided by 8... 8 times 80 is 640, right? So depth is 80 meters? \n\nWait, but the options don't have 80 as the correct answer. Let me look again. The options are A)26, B)28, C)21, D)80, E)23. Oh, wait, option D is 80. So that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but that seems really deep for a canal. Like, 80 meters deep? That's like the height of a skyscraper. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check. \n\nThe formula is correct, right? The area of a trapezium is indeed (a + b)/2 * height. So a=10, b=6, sum is 16. Half of that is 8. Multiply by height (depth) equals area. So 8 * depth = 640. Dividing both sides by 8 gives depth = 80. Hmm, maybe it's correct. Maybe the canal is very deep. \n\nI don't see any mistake in the calculations. So the answer should be D)80.\n",
