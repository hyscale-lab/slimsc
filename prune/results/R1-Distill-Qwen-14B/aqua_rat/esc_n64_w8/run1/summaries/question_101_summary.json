I know the total parts for green are 4, and that's equal to 120 sweets. Maybe I can find out how much one part is worth. If 4 parts equal 120, then one part is 120 divided by 4. Let me do that: 120 \u00f7 4 equals 30. Oh, right, so each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, since the red part is 3, I can multiply that by 30. So 3 times 30 is 90. That should be the number of red sweets. Let me check the options. Option A is 90, so that's probably the answer. \n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If 4 parts are 120, one part is 30. Then red is 3 parts, which is 3*30=90.

So each part is 30 sweets.\n\nNow, since the red sweets are 3 parts, I can multiply 3 parts by 30 to find the number of red sweets. 3 times 30 is 90. So that would mean there are 90 red sweets. Let me check the options. Option A is 90. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me go through it again. The ratio is 3:4 red to green. Green is 120. So 4 parts = 120, so each part is 30. Red is 3 parts, so 3*30=90. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could set it up using algebra. Let me try that approach to double-check. Let the number of red sweets be R and green sweets be G. The ratio R/G = 3/4. We know G is 120. So substituting, R/120 = 3/4. Solving for R, multiply both sides by 120: R = (3/4)*120.\n\nCalculating that: 3 times 120 is 360. Divided by 4 is 90. So R is 90. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be A)90.\n\n\nThe problem involves a ratio of red to green sweets as 3:4. Since there are 120 green sweets, we can determine the number of red sweets by analyzing the ratio. \n\nThe ratio 3:4 means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. Given that there are 120 green sweets, we can calculate the value of one part of the ratio. Since 4 parts correspond to 120 green sweets, each part equals \\( \\frac{120}{4} = 30 \\). Therefore, the number of red sweets, which are 3 parts, is \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\).\n\nTo confirm, we can use algebra. Let \\( R \\) represent the number of red sweets. The ratio can be expressed as \\( \\frac{R}{120} = \\frac{3}{4} \\). Solving for \\( R \\), we find \\( R = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 120 = 90 \\).\n\nThus, the number of red sweets is 90, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

I need to find out how many red sweets there are.\n\nWait, ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I remember they're about comparing quantities. So, the ratio 3:4 means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. So, the number of red is three parts and green is four parts. But how do I translate that into actual numbers?\n\nI think I can set it up as a proportion. If 3 parts red correspond to 4 parts green, then 3/4 should equal red/green. Or maybe I should think in terms of fractions. Let's see, the fraction of red sweets is 3/7 because 3+4 is 7 total parts. Wait, no, that's the fraction of the total sweets that are red. But wait, the question isn't about the fraction; it's about the number of red sweets given that there are 120 green ones.\n\nOh right, maybe I should set it up using the ratio. So, red:green is 3:4, which can be written as 3/4 = red / 120. So, red = (3/4)*120. Let me calculate that. 3 times 120 is 360, divided by 4 is 90. So that would make the red sweets 90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the ratio is 3:4, and green is 4 parts, each part must be 120 divided by 4. Oh wait, that makes sense. So each part is 30. Because 4 parts = 120, so 120 /4 =30 per part. So each part is 30. Then red is 3 parts, so 3 *30=90. Yeah, that's the same as before. So the answer should be 90, which is option A.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem correct. Another way to think about it: the ratio tells us for every 4 green, there are 3 red. So, if there are 4 green sweets, there are 3 red. So, scaling that up. 4 green = 3 red. So 120 green is how many times 4? 120 divided by 4 is 30. So, 30 times 3 is 90 red. Yep, same answer.\n",
