      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let's read it again. The question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers. Their product is equal to 727 plus 728 plus 729. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nHmm, wait, okay. So the product of three consecutive integers is the sum of those three numbers: 727 + 728 + 729. Let me calculate that first. Let's add them up. 727 plus 728 is... 727 + 700 is 1427, plus 28 is 1455. Then 1455 plus 729. Let me see, 1455 + 700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So the product is 2184.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the product of three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, 729. So 727+728+729 is 2184, so that's the product. So I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as n-1, n, n+1. So their product is (n-1)*n*(n+1) = n(n\u00b2 -1). And this equals 2184.\n\nSo I need to solve n(n\u00b2 -1) = 2184. Alternatively, n\u00b3 - n = 2184. So n\u00b3 = 2184 +n. Hmm. Hmm, maybe I can find n by trial and error, since the numbers are probably not too big.\n\nWait, let me compute 12 cubed. 12^3 is 1728. 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197. So 2197 is 13*13*13. So 2184 is just 13 less than that. Because 2197 minus 2184 is 13.\n\nSo if n is 13, then n\u00b3 is 2197. But 2197 minus n is 2197-13=2184. So that fits the equation n\u00b3 -n=2184. Because 13\u00b3 -13 = 2197-13=2184.\n\nSo n is 13. So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Wait, no, wait. Because I defined them as n-1, n, n+1. So if n is 13, then they are 12,13,14. Let me check the product: 12*13*14. 12*13 is 156, 156*14 is let's see, 156*10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624, so 1560+624=2184. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the three numbers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14. Let's add them up: 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. Oh, wait, no, I think I got it right. The product is 727+728+729=2184, which equals 12*13*14.

So the product of three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nSo I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the question says the product can be expressed as 727+728+729. So that sum is 2184, so the product is 2184. So the product is 2184, and we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and then find their sum.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So yeah, the product is 2184.\n\nSo now I need to find three consecutive integers, say n, n+1, n+2. Their product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184.\n\nHmm. Let me compute n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the cube of n+1 being roughly equal to the product, since n(n+1)(n+2) is approximately (n+1)^3. So cube root of 2184 is about, let me see.\n\nWhat's 12^3? 1728. 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So n+1 is around 12 or 13.\n\nWait, so let me test n+1 =12. Then the numbers would be 11,12,13. Their product is 11*12=132, *13=1716. Hmm, that's way less than 2184.\n\nIf n+1 is 13, then the numbers are 12,13,14. Product is 12*13=156, *14=2184. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the number we have.\n\nSo the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their product is 2184, which matches.\n\nSo their sum is 12+13+14. Let me add that. 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39.\n\nWait, but wait the options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nSo the correct answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate the product of 12,13,14. 12*13=156, 156*14: 156*10=1560, 156*4=624. 1560+624=2184. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo their sum is 12+13+14=39, which is option E.\n\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. First, calculate the sum of 727 + 728 + 729, which is 2184. Therefore, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be \\( n \\), \\( n+1 \\), and \\( n+2 \\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\nn(n+1)(n+2) = 2184\n\\]\n\nTo approximate \\( n \\), note that \\( n(n+1)(n+2) \\) is close to \\( (n+1)^3 \\). Taking the cube root of 2184 gives a value slightly less than 13, suggesting \\( n+1 \\) is around 12 or 13. Testing \\( n+1 = 13 \\), the integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their product is:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 13 \\times 14 = 2184\n\\]\n\nThis matches the required product. The sum of these three integers is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

The question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Hmm, wait, no. Let me read it again. Oh, right, the product is 727 + 728 + 729. Wait no, wait. The product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. Oh wait, no, the question says: \"the product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So, that part is the product. So the product of three consecutive integers is equal to 727+728+729.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me re-read the question. Oh, the way it's worded: \"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So the product of three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, 729. Then, once I find those three integers, I need to find their sum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, no. Let me parse the sentence again. The question is, what is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is equal to 727+728+729.\n\nSo first, let's calculate 727 + 728 + 729. Let's do that. 727 plus 728 is 1455, plus 729 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nSo now, the problem is: find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, then find their sum.\n\nSo, I need to find three consecutive integers a, a+1, a+2 such that a*(a+1)*(a+2) = 2184.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of them as n, n+1, n+2, so the product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184.\n\nI need to find n.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps I can find the cube root of 2184 to approximate n. Because for three consecutive numbers, their product is roughly n^3. So let's calculate cube root of 2184.\n\nI know that 12^3 is 1728, and 13^3 is 2197. Oh, 2197 is very close to 2184. So, 13 cubed is 2197. So 12^3 is 1728. So 2184 is between 12^3 and 13^3, but closer to 13^3. So maybe the middle number is around 12 or 13.\n\nWait, wait, the three consecutive numbers are n, n+1, n+2. So the middle number is n+1. So their product is (n+1-1)(n+1)(n+1+1) = (n)(n+1)(n+2). So the cube root of the product is approximately the middle number. So the cube root of 2184 is roughly 12.98, which is almost 13. So the middle number is around 13. Let me check if 12*13*14 equals 2184.\n\n12 * 13 = 156. 156 *14. Let's compute that. 156 *10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624. 1560+624=2184. Oh, exactly. So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, 14.\n\nSo their sum is 12 +13 +14 = 39.\n\nWait, but wait the options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is 39.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let me calculate 12 *13*14. 12*13=156, 156*14=2184. Correct. So the sum is 12+13+14=39. So the answer is E)39.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possibilities. For example, could there be negative integers that multiply to 2184? Let's think.\n\nIf the three consecutive integers are negative, their product would be negative if there are an odd number of negatives. But 2184 is positive, so either all three are positive or two are negative and one is positive. But three negative numbers multiplied would give a negative product. So for the product to be positive, either all three are positive or two are negative and one positive. Let's consider the case where two are negative and one is positive.\n\nSo, let's see. Suppose the numbers are a, a+1, a+2, where a is negative.\n\nBut their product would be positive if there are two negative numbers and one positive. So if a is negative, a+1 might be negative or positive, depending on a.\n\nWait, but for three consecutive integers, if two are negative, then the third would be a+2. Let's think of a=-14, then a+1=-13, a+2=-12. Their product would be (-14)*(-13)*(-12) = (-14)*(-13)=182, 182*(-12)=-2184. Which is negative, not 2184.\n\nHmm, so maybe a is less than -14. Let's see, for a=-15: (-15)*(-14)*(-13)= (-15* -14)=210 * (-13)= -2730. Which is way below 2184.\n\nWait, but 2184 is positive, so perhaps another scenario where two are negative and one positive. Let's see, for example, a=-1, then a+1=0, a+2=1. Their product is 0, which isn't 2184. a=-2: (-2)*(-1)*(0) = 0. a=-3: (-3)*(-2)*(-1)= -6. a=-4: (-4)*(-3)*(-2) = -24. Not matching. a=-5: (-5)*(-4)*(-3)= -60. a=-6: (-6)*(-5)*(-4)= -120. a=-7: (-7)*(-6)*(-5)= -210. a=-8: (-8)*(-7)*(-6)= -336. a=-9: (-9)*(-8)*(-7)= -504. a=-10: (-10)*(-9)*(-8)= -720. a=-11: (-11)*(-10)*(-9)= -990. a=-12: (-12)*(-11)*(-10)= -1320. a=-13: (-13)*(-12)*(-11)= -1716. a=-14: (-14)*(-13)*(-12)= -2184. Oh, wait, that's -2184. So if a=-14, the product is -2184. So to get 2184, perhaps a= -13? Let me check. a=-13: (-13)*(-12)*(-11)= (-13)*(-12)=156 * (-11)= -1716. Not 2184. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but the product of three consecutive integers when a is -14 is -2184. So that's the negative of the target. So the only way for the product to be 2184 is for the three numbers to be positive, so 12,13,14. Because when a is 12, the product is 2184. So the sum is 39. So the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, but let me check other possibilities just to be thorough. Maybe there's another set of three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. For example, perhaps n is 11? Let's see: 11*12*13= 1716, which is less than 2184. 13*14*15= 2730, which is higher than 2184. So the only possible triplet is 12,13,14.

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is asking: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. The options are A) 37, B) 38, C) 36, D) 30, E) 39.\n\nHmm, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. The way the question is phrased makes me think that the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. So first, I need to compute that sum to find out what number we're dealing with.\n\nLet me calculate that sum. 727 + 728 is 1455, right? Because 700+700=1400, 27+28=55, so 1400+55=1455. Then adding 729 to that: 1455 +729. Let me break that down. 1455 + 700 is 2155, then +29 makes 2184. So the sum is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, wait a second. No, the product is 727 +728 +729, which is 2184. So the product of three consecutive integers equals 2184. And the question is, what is the sum of those three integers?\n\nWait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. The problem states: \"the product can be expressed as 727 +728 +729.\" So the product equals 727+728+729, which is 2184. So, we're looking for three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and we need the sum of those integers.\n\nSo the steps are: find three consecutive integers (let's say n-1, n, n+1) such that (n-1)*n*(n+1) = 2184. Then, find the sum, which would be (n-1)+n+(n+1) = 3n. So once we find n, the sum is 3n.\n\nAlternatively, if the three consecutive integers are n, n+1, n+2, then their product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184, and their sum is 3n +3.\n\nWait, but regardless, the sum will be 3n plus or minus something, but perhaps it's easier to find the middle number first.\n\nLet me try to find the cube root of 2184 because the product of three consecutive integers around n is roughly n^3. So cube root of 2184.\n\nLet me compute: 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So the three consecutive numbers should be around 12, 13, 14 or 13,14,15? Wait, no, wait. Let me see.\n\nWait, 12 *13 *14: let's compute that. 12 *13 is 156, 156 *14: 156*10=1560, 156*4=624, total is 1560+624=2184. Oh! So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their product is 2184. So the sum is 12 +13 +14 = 39. So the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I get the product right? 12 *13 is 156, 156*14 is 2184. Yes. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Sum is 12+13=25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are 13,14,15? Let's see. 13*14=182, 182*15=2730, which is way larger than 2184. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Are the three consecutive integers in the middle of 2184's cube root?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here that I'm trying to solve. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is asking: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. The options are A) 37, B) 38, C) 36, D) 30, E) 39.\n\nHmm, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. The way the question is phrased makes me think that the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. So first, I need to compute that sum to find out what number we're dealing with.\n\nLet me calculate that sum. 727 + 728 is 1455, right? Because 700+700=1400, 27+28=55, so 1400+55=1455. Then adding 729 to that: 1455 +729. Let me break that down. 1455 + 700 is 2155, then +29 makes 2184. So the sum is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, wait a second. No, the product is 727 +728 +729, which is 2184. So the product of three consecutive integers equals 2184. And the question is, what is the sum of those three integers?\n\nWait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. The problem states: \"the product can be expressed as 727 +728 +729.\" So the product equals 727+728+729, which is 2184. So, we're looking for three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, and we need the sum of those integers.\n\nSo the steps are: find three consecutive integers (let's say n-1, n, n+1) such that (n-1)*n*(n+1) = 2184. Then, find the sum, which would be (n-1)+n+(n+1) = 3n. So once we find n, the sum is 3n.\n\nAlternatively, if the three consecutive integers are n, n+1, n+2, then their product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184, and their sum is 3n +3.\n\nWait, but regardless, the sum will be 3n plus or minus something, but perhaps it's easier to find the middle number first.\n\nLet me try to find the cube root of 2184 because the product of three consecutive integers around n is roughly n^3. So cube root of 2184.\n\nLet me compute: 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So the three consecutive numbers should be around 12, 13, 14 or 13,14,15? Wait, no, wait. Let me see.\n\nWait, 12 *13 *14: let's compute that. 12 *13 is 156, 156 *14: 156*10=1560, 156*4=624, total is 1560+624=2184. Oh! So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their product is 2184. So the sum is 12 +13 +14 = 39. So the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I get the product right? 12 *13 is 156, 156*14 is 2184. Yes. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Sum is 12+13=25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are 13,14,15? Let's see. 13*14=182, 182*15=2730, which is way larger than 2184. So that can't be.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: Are the three consecutive integers in the middle of 2184's cube root? The cube root is approximately 12.99, so around 13. So perhaps 12,13,14.\n\nYes, that's correct as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo the answer should be E)39.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Adding these together:\n\n\\[\n727 + 728 = 1455, \\quad 1455 + 729 = 2184.\n\\]\n\nThus, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Let the three consecutive integers be \\(n-1\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) \\cdot n \\cdot (n+1) = n^3 - n.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\(n\\) such that \\(n^3 - n = 2184\\). By estimating the cube root of 2184, we find it is slightly less than 13, since \\(12^3 = 1728\\) and \\(13^3 = 2197\\). Testing \\(n = 13\\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\n12 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 2184.\n\\]\n\nThus, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n12 + 13 + 14 = 39.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three consecutive integers is **39**, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",

So, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nSo, we have n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 2184. We need to find n, and then the sum would be 3n + 3, right? Because n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n +3.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach this by trying to find n. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the cube root of 2184 to approximate n, since n^3 is roughly equal to 2184, but that might not be exact.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's compute 12^3, which is 1728. 13^3 is 2197. Oh, wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So, the numbers must be around 12, 13, 14?

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39.\n\nWait, wait a second. Hmm. Wait, the product of three consecutive integers equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Or is it that the product is 727+728+729? Let me make sure. Oh right, the product can be expressed as 727+728+729. So I think that means the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to the sum of those three numbers. Or maybe not. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe product can be expressed as 727 +728 +729. So the product is 727 +728 +729. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, maybe the sum of the three consecutive integers is equal to the product of 727, 728, 729? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the product of 727, 728, 729 is a huge number, and the sum of three consecutive numbers would be much smaller. So that probably isn't the case.\n\nWait, no. Let me read it again. \"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So, the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 727+728+729. So first, I should compute what 727+728+729 is.\n\nLet me add those three numbers. 727 plus 728 is 1455. Then plus 729: 1455 +729. Let me calculate that. 1455 +700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. So I need to find three consecutive integers, say n, n+1, n+2. Their product is n(n+1)(n+2) = 2184. And the sum of these three numbers is n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n +3 = 3(n+1). So I need to find n such that n(n+1)(n+2) =2184, then compute 3(n+1).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding n where the product of three consecutive numbers is 2184.\n\nNow, to find n, perhaps I can approximate. Let's think about the cube root of 2184 because the product of three consecutive numbers is roughly n^3 when n is large. So cube root of 2184 is around... Let's see, 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, 2197 is very close to 2184. So n is probably around 12, 13.\n\nWait, wait, 12*13*14. Let me calculate that. 12*13 is 156, then 156*14. 156*10 is 1560, 156*4 is 624. 1560+624=2184. Oh, exactly. So n is 12, because 12*13*14=2184. So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14.\n\nSo their sum is 12+13+14. Let me add them. 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. So the sum is 39. Looking at the options, E is 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I compute the sum correctly? 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. Yes. So the answer should be E)39.\n",
