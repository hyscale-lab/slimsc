      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where Silu and Meenu are talking about their weights. Silu says she weighs 51 kg and asks Meenu how much she weighs. Meenu doesn't want to tell directly, but she gives a hint: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. I need to figure out what Meenu's actual weight is based on her statement.\n\nWait, let me try to break this down. So Meenu says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Oh, wait, that's a bit of a play on words, right? Because she's using her own weight in the statement. So she's saying her weight equals 29 kg plus half of her weight. That makes sense.\n\nLet me represent Meenu's weight with a variable to make it easier. Let's call her weight 'x' kg. According to her statement, x equals 29 plus half of x. So the equation would be:\n\nx = 29 + (1/2)x\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me subtract (1/2)x from both sides to get the terms involving x on one side. So,\n\nx - (1/2)x = 29\n\nSimplifying the left side, x is the same as (2/2)x, so (2/2)x - (1/2)x equals (1/2)x. So,\n\n(1/2)x = 29\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 29 * 2\nx = 58\n\nWait, so that would make Meenu's weight 58 kg? Let me double-check that. If her weight is 58, then half of that is 29. So 29 plus 29 is 58. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 58. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to approach this is to think about it as a riddle. If someone says they weigh a certain number plus half their weight, you can solve it by realizing that the number is the other half. So 29 is the other half. So 29 times 2 is 58. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo the correct answer is D)58.\n",

That sounds like she's describing her weight with an equation. Let me represent Meenu's weight with a variable to make it easier. Let's say Meenu's weight is M kg.\n\nSo according to her statement, M equals 29 plus half of M. So the equation would be M = 29 + (1/2)M. Yeah, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for M.\n\nLet me write that equation again: M = 29 + (1/2)M. I can rearrange this to find M. Let's subtract (1/2)M from both sides to get all the M terms on one side.\n\nSo, subtracting (1/2)M from both sides gives M - (1/2)M = 29. Simplifying the left side: M is the same as (2/2)M, so (2/2 - 1/2) is (1/2)M. So now I have (1/2)M = 29.\n\nTo find M, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. That would cancel out the 1/2 on the left. So, 2 * (1/2)M is M, and 2 * 29 is 58. So M = 58.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If Meenu's weight is 58 kg, then half of her weight is 29 kg. Adding that to 29 kg gives 58 kg, which matches. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 58. So the answer should be D.\n\nI think I've got it right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. The equation was M = 29 + (1/2)M. Subtracting (1/2)M gives (1/2)M =29, so M=58. Yep, that's correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let Meenu's weight be represented by \\( M \\). According to her statement, her weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight. This can be written as the equation:\n\n\\[\nM = 29 + \\frac{1}{2}M\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(\\frac{1}{2}M\\) from both sides to isolate \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM - \\frac{1}{2}M = 29\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}M = 29\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to solve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = 58\n\\]\n\nThus, Meenu's weight is 58 kg. Verifying, if \\( M = 58 \\), then half of her weight is \\( 29 \\), and adding this to 29 gives \\( 58 \\), which matches the equation. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",

I need to figure out Meenu's actual weight from this statement.\n\nWait, so Meenu is saying her weight is 29 plus half of her weight. Let me think about how to model that. Let's call Meenu's weight W. So according to her statement, W equals 29 plus half of W. So the equation would be W = 29 + (W/2).\n\nHmm, I need to solve for W. Let's rearrange this equation. If I subtract (W/2) from both sides, I get W - (W/2) = 29. Simplifying the left side, W is the same as 2W/2, so 2W/2 - W/2 is W/2. So W/2 equals 29.\n\nOh right, because W/2 =29, so W must be 58. That makes sense because 58 is 29 plus half of 58, which is 29. So 29 +29 is 58. So Meenu's weight is 58 kg.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91.
