      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about renting DVDs and memberships. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 per month, then each DVD only costs $2.00. I need to find the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent each month to make the membership worth it. So, when would it be cheaper or the same to get the membership?\n\nHmm, so I think I need to compare the total cost with and without the membership. Let me break it down.\n\nWithout the membership, each DVD is $4. So if I rent 'n' DVDs, the total cost is 4n dollars.\n\nWith the membership, it's a flat fee of $7 plus $2 per DVD. So the total cost would be 7 + 2n dollars.\n\nI need to find the smallest 'n' where the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without. So I can set up an inequality:\n\n7 + 2n \u2264 4n\n\nWait, let me solve that. Subtract 2n from both sides:\n\n7 \u2264 2n\n\nThen divide both sides by 2:\n\n7/2 \u2264 n\n\nWhich is 3.5 \u2264 n. Since n has to be a whole number (you can't rent half a DVD), the smallest integer greater than 3.5 is 4. So n=4.\n\nLet me check that. If I rent 4 DVDs without membership, it's 4*4 = $16. With membership, it's 7 + (4*2) = 7 +8 = $15. So $15 is less than $16, which means it's worth it.\n\nWait, but what about 3 DVDs? Let's see. 3 without is 12. With membership, 7 +6=13. Oh, that's more expensive. So 3 isn't enough. So the minimum is 4.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 4. So the answer must be D.\n",

Hmm, the question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent to make buying the membership worth it. \n\nAlright, let's break down the costs. Without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy the membership for $7.00 a month, each rental only costs $2.00. So I guess the idea is to find out when the total cost with the membership becomes less than or equal to the total cost without it.\n\nWait, so without membership, the total cost is just 4 times the number of DVDs I rent. Let's say I rent 'n' DVDs. Then, the cost is 4n dollars. \n\nWith the membership, it's a bit different. I have to pay the $7.00 membership fee plus $2.00 per DVD. So the total cost here would be 7 + 2n dollars.\n\nI need to find the smallest 'n' where the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without. So, the inequality I should set up is:\n\n4n \u2265 7 + 2n\n\nWait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because I want the membership to be worth it, meaning the total cost should be lower. So maybe I should write:\n\n7 + 2n \u2264 4n\n\nBecause if the cost with membership is less than or equal to the cost without, then it's better to get the membership.\n\nLet me solve this inequality. Subtract 2n from both sides:\n\n7 \u2264 2n\n\nThen divide both sides by 2:\n\n7/2 \u2264 n\n\n7 divided by 2 is 3.5. So n has to be greater than or equal to 3.5. But since you can't rent half a DVD, you round up to the next whole number. So n would be 4.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me plug in n=3 into both options. Without membership, 3 DVDs would cost 3*4=12 dollars. With membership, it's 7 + (3*2)=7+6=13. Oh, that's more. So 3 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about n=4? Without, it's 4*4=16. With, it's 7 + 4*2=7+8=15. So 15 is less than 16. So at 4 DVDs, the membership is cheaper.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the inequality. When is 7 + 2n less than 4n?\n\nSo 7 + 2n < 4n \u2192 7 < 2n \u2192 n > 3.5. So n must be 4 or more. So the minimum number is 4.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 4.

Let me write that down:\n\n7 + 2x \u2264 4x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n7 \u2264 2x\n\nThen divide both sides by 2:\n\n7/2 \u2264 x\n\nWhich is 3.5 \u2264 x.\n\nBut wait, x has to be an integer because you can't rent half a DVD. So x has to be at least 4? Or wait, 3.5 is the point where they're equal. So when x is 3, the cost without is 12, and with membership it's 7 + 6 = 13. So 13 is more than 12, so 3 isn't enough. At x=4, without is 16, with is 7 + 8=15. 15 is less than 16, so 4 is the minimum.\n\nSo the answer should be D)4.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of DVDs you need to rent to make the membership worth it, compare the total costs with and without the membership.\n\n- **Without membership:** The cost per DVD is $4. For renting \\( x \\) DVDs, the total cost is \\( 4x \\).\n- **With membership:** The cost includes a $7 monthly fee plus $2 per DVD. The total cost is \\( 7 + 2x \\).\n\nTo find when the membership becomes more economical, set up the inequality:\n\\[\n7 + 2x \\leq 4x\n\\]\nSubtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n7 \\leq 2x\n\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[\nx \\geq 3.5\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer (you can't rent half a DVD), \\( x \\) must be at least 4. At \\( x = 4 \\), the cost without membership is $16, and with membership, it is $15. Therefore, renting 4 DVDs makes the membership worth it.\n\nAnswer: D",

I need to find the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent so that getting the membership is worth it.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about renting DVDs and memberships. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nThe question says that without a membership, each DVD costs $4.00. But if I buy a membership for $7.00 a month, then each DVD only costs $2.00. I need to find the minimum number of DVDs I have to rent so that getting the membership is worth it. That is, when does the total cost with the membership become less than or equal to the cost without it?\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I should set it up so that the total cost with the membership is cheaper. So, I need to find the point where the cost of the membership plus the cost per DVD is less than or equal to the cost without the membership for the same number of DVDs.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let x be the number of DVDs rented. The cost without a membership is 4x dollars. With the membership, it's 7 dollars for the month plus 2x dollars for the DVDs. So the total cost with membership is 7 + 2x.\n\nI need to find the smallest x where 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes a better deal.\n\nSo, let's set up the inequality:\n\n7 + 2x < 4x\n\nHmm, let's solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n7 < 2x\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\n7/2 < x \u2192 3.5 < x.\n\nSo x has to be greater than 3.5. But since you can't rent half a DVD, I guess x needs to be 4 or more. So the minimum number is 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's plug in x=3 and x=4 to see.\n\nWithout membership, 3 DVDs would cost 3*4=12 dollars. With membership, it's 7 + 3*2=13. So 13 > 12, so 3 isn't enough.\n\nAt x=4: Without, it's 4*4=16. With membership, 7 + 4*2=15. 15 is less than 16, so yes, 4 is the minimum number.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of DVDs needed to make the membership worth it, we compare the total costs of renting DVDs with and without a membership. \n\nWithout a membership, the cost per DVD is $4.00.
