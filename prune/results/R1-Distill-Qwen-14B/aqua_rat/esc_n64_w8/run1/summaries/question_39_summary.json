      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about a shop assistant's salary. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says her monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. I need to find out what the monthly sales should be so that her salary reaches $1500. The options are from A to E, with E being none of these.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The formula for her salary would be S = 500 + 0.05 * sales, right? Because she gets a fixed 500 and 5% of the sales. So, S is the total salary, which we want to be 1500. So I can plug that into the equation.\n\nSo substituting S with 1500, the equation becomes 1500 = 500 + 0.05 * sales. Now, I need to solve for sales. Let me rearrange this equation.\n\nFirst, subtract 500 from both sides to get rid of the fixed part. So 1500 - 500 equals 0.05 * sales. That simplifies to 1000 = 0.05 * sales.\n\nNow, to find the sales, I should divide both sides by 0.05. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 0.05. Wait, what's 0.05 as a fraction? Oh right, 0.05 is the same as 5/100 or 1/20. So dividing by 1/20 is the same as multiplying by 20.\n\nSo 1000 * 20 equals 20,000. That means the sales need to be $20,000 for her salary to reach $1500. Let me check the options. Option D is $20,000, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my math. 5% of 20,000 is 0.05 * 20,000. 0.05 times 20,000 is 1000. Then adding the fixed 500, 500 + 1000 equals 1500. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D.\n",

The options given are A) $50,000, B) $40,000, C) $30,000, D) $20,000, and E) None of these.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. So the salary structure is fixed plus a percentage of sales. So mathematically, I can represent this as an equation. The fixed part is $500, and then 5% of sales. Let me denote the monthly sales as 'x'. So the equation would be:\n\nS = 500 + 0.05 * x\n\nAnd we want S to be $1500. So I can set up the equation:\n\n1500 = 500 + 0.05x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's do that step by step. First, subtract 500 from both sides to get the variable term by itself.\n\n1500 - 500 = 0.05x\n1000 = 0.05x\n\nSo now, I have 1000 equals 0.05 times x. To find x, I should divide both sides by 0.05. Alternatively, I can think of 0.05 as a fraction, which is 1/20. So dividing by 1/20 is the same as multiplying by 20.\n\nSo, x = 1000 / 0.05\nx = 20,000\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Because 0.05 is 5%, so 5% of 20,000 is 1000. So 500 plus 1000 is 1500. Oh, that makes sense. So the sales need to be $20,000. \n\nLooking back at the options, D is $20,000. So the answer should be D, right?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the math again. \n\nStarting with S = 500 + 0.05x.\n\nWe set S = 1500: 1500 = 500 + 0.05x.\n\nSubtract 500: 1000 = 0.05x.\n\nDivide both sides by 0.05: x = 1000 / 0.05.\n\nCalculating that, 0.05 goes into 1000 how many times? Well, 0.05 * 20,000 is 1000, because 0.05 * 100 is 5, so 0.05 * 2000 is 100, and 0.05 * 20,000 is 1000. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo x is 20,000, which is option D. So the answer should be D. \n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe by considering how much comes from the sales. The salary is 1500, and 500 is fixed. So the variable part is 1000. Since that's 5% of sales, then 5% of sales is 1000. So 1000 is 5%, so 100% would be 20 times that, which is 20,000. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer is D, $20,000.\n",
