The books are in different subjects: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. Hmm, let me think about this.\n\nWait, arranging books on a shelf... I remember something about permutations. Oh right, when you're arranging items where order matters and each item is unique, you use factorial. So if I have n distinct items, the number of ways to arrange them is n factorial, written as n!.\n\nIn this case, I have six different books. So n is 6. So I need to calculate 6! Let me compute that. 6! is 6 \u00d75 \u00d74 \u00d73 \u00d72 \u00d71. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 6\u00d75 is 30, then 30\u00d74 is 120, 120\u00d73 is 360, 360\u00d72 is 720, and 720\u00d71 is 720. So 6! equals 720. That should be the number of ways.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 720. So that's the answer. But wait, are there any other possibilities? Like, do any of the options say 'none of the above'? Oh yeah, option D is 'None' and E is 'Cannot be determined.' But since 720 is one of the options, E isn't applicable. So the correct answer must be B.\n",

The question is asking how many ways I can arrange six books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science. \n\nHmm, I remember something about permutations from my math class. Oh right, when you're arranging distinct items, the number of ways is called a permutation. The formula for permutations of n distinct items is n factorial, which is n! So n! equals n multiplied by n-1 multiplied by n-2, all the way down to 1.\n\nIn this case, there are six books. So I think I need to calculate 6 factorial. Let me do that step by step. \n\n6! = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. Let's compute that. 6 times 5 is 30. 30 times 4 is 120. 120 times 3 is 360. 360 times 2 is 720. 720 times 1 is still 720. So 6! equals 720.\n\nWait, but are all the books distinct? The problem lists each as a different subject, so I think they are distinct. So yeah, it's a straightforward permutation problem.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 720. So that should be the answer. The other options: A is 520, which doesn't make sense because 6! is 720. C is 920, which is even higher. D and E probably aren't right because the problem gives enough information to calculate it exactly.\n",
