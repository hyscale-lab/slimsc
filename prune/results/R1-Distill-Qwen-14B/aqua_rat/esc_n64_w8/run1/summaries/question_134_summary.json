      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the total bus fare for a group of people. Let me see. The question says that the bus fare for one adult is Rs. 140 from Ranchi to Patna. And the child's fare is half of the adult fare. We need to find the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, I'll calculate the child's fare. Since it's half of the adult fare, that would be 140 divided by 2. Let me do that: 140 / 2 equals 70. So each child ticket is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, for the adults, there are 4 of them. Each pays Rs. 140, so 4 times 140. Let me multiply that: 4 * 140 is 560. Right, because 140 times 4 is 560.\n\nThen for the children, there are 3. Each child is Rs. 70, so 3 * 70. That's 210. Because 70 times 3 is 210.\n\nNow, to find the total fare, I add the adult fare and the child fare together. So 560 (adults) plus 210 (children) equals 770. Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770.\n\nOh, E is 770, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. Adult fare is 140. Child is 70. 4 adults: 4*140=560. 3 children: 3*70=210. Total is 560+210=770. Yep, that's correct. So option E is the one.\n",

Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nAlright, the question says that the bus fare for one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140. Then it mentions that a child's fare is half of the adult fare. So first, I need to calculate the child's fare.\n\nWait, so if an adult is Rs. 140, then a child would be half of that. Let me do the math. Half of 140 is 70, right? So the child's fare is Rs. 70.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the total fare when there are 4 adults and 3 children. So I think I need to calculate the total for adults and the total for children separately and then add them together.\n\nLet's start with the adults. There are 4 adults, each paying Rs. 140. So 4 multiplied by 140. Hmm, 4 times 140. Let me calculate that. 140 * 4. Well, 100*4 is 400, 40*4 is 160. So 400+160=560. So the total for the adults is Rs. 560.\n\nNext, the children. There are 3 children, each paying half the adult fare, which we determined is Rs. 70. So 3 times 70. Let me compute that. 70 *3 is 210. So the children's total is Rs. 210.\n\nNow, adding both amounts together. 560 (adults) + 210 (children) equals... let's see. 560 plus 200 is 760, then plus 10 more is 770. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, option E is 770. But wait, the options given are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So E is an option.

Let me calculate it again. 140 *4: 100*4=400, 40*4=160, so 400+160=560. That's correct. For the children: 3 *70=210. So 560 +210 = 770. So that's Rs. 770. Looking at the options, E is 770. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The options include E as 770, which matches. So why am I doubting? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again.\n\nOptions are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So the correct answer is E.\n\nBut wait, why is the option C 700? Maybe I made a mistake in adding.

So I need to find out the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. First, the adult fare is Rs. 140. So for each adult, it's 140. If there are 4 adults, I'll multiply 140 by 4. Let me do that: 140 * 4 equals... 560. Right, because 140 times 4 is 560.\n\nNext, the children's fare is half of the adult's. So half of 140 is 70. So each child's ticket is Rs. 70. Now, there are 3 children, so I multiply 70 by 3. 70 * 3 is 210. Got it.\n\nNow, I need to add the two amounts together to get the total fare. So 560 (adults) plus 210 (children) equals... 560 plus 200 is 760, and then plus 10 makes 770. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, E is 770. But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my math.\n\nWait, no. 560 plus 210 is actually 770? Let me add it again. 560 + 210. 560 + 200 is 760, then plus 10 is 770. Yeah, that's correct. So the total would be Rs. 770.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 770. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. No, the question says 4 adults and 3 children. Child fare is half of adult. So 140 *4 =560. Child fare is 70 each. 70 *3=210. 560+210=770. Yep, that's right.\n\nWait, but the options also include C)700. Could I have made a mistake in calculation? Let me think. Oh, maybe I added wrong. 560 plus 210. Let me add digit by digit. 560 is 500 +60, 210 is 200 +10. So 500+200=700, 60+10=70. 700+70=770. No, that's correct. So the total is 770. So the correct option is E.\n",
