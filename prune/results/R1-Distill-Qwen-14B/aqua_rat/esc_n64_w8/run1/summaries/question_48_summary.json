      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper and his servant. Let me try to understand what it's asking. \n\nThe servant is employed with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Additionally, the shopkeeper agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The question is asking, how much sale in rupees should the servant make so that his total monthly income is 6000 rupees? The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The servant has a fixed salary and a variable commission based on sales. So his total income is the sum of his salary and his commission from sales. \n\nI think the formula would be: Total Income = Salary + (Commission Rate \u00d7 Sales). \n\nWe know the desired Total Income is 6000. The Salary is 1500. The commission rate is 15%, which is 0.15 in decimal.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 6000 = 1500 + 0.15 \u00d7 Sales.\n\nWait, I should solve for Sales. Let me subtract 1500 from both sides to isolate the commission part. \n\n6000 - 1500 = 0.15 \u00d7 Sales. \n\nThat gives 4500 = 0.15 \u00d7 Sales.\n\nTo find Sales, I'll divide both sides by 0.15. \n\nSales = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 10000 is 1500, so 0.15 *30000 is 4500. So Sales should be 30,000 rupees.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 30,000. So that's probably the answer. \n\nBut wait, did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me double-check. \n\nIf sales are 30,000, the commission is 15% of that, which is 4500. Adding the salary 1500 gives 6000. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option A) 30000.\n",

The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. The question is, what should the sale amount be in rupees to achieve this?\n\nHmm, okay. So the servant has a fixed salary of 1500, and then he earns 15% of the sales as commission. His total desired income is 6000. So I think I need to find out how much the sales need to be so that when you add 15% of that to 1500, the total is 6000.\n\nLet me break it down. The total income is the sum of the fixed salary and the commission. So, the equation should be:\n\nTotal Income = Salary + Commission\n6000 = 1500 + (15% of Sales)\n\nWait, right. So, substituting the numbers:\n\n6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * Sales\n\nI need to solve for Sales. Let's subtract 1500 from both sides to get the commission part by itself.\n\n6000 - 1500 = 0.15 * Sales\n4500 = 0.15 * Sales\n\nNow, to find the Sales, I can divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nSales = 4500 / 0.15\n\nLet me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15.

Because 30,000 * 0.1 is 3000, and 30,000 *0.05 is 1500. So 3000 + 1500 = 4500. Yes, that's right. So Sales is 30,000 rupees.\n\nWait, looking at the options, option A is 30000. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my math. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nLet me re-calculate the division. 4500 divided by 0.15. Alternatively, 4500 divided by 15/100 equals 4500 * (100/15).\n\n4500 * (100/15) = (4500 /15) *100. 4500 divided by 15 is 300. 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000.

So the servant's total income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission from sales. He wants his total income to be 6000 a month. So the equation would be:\n\nTotal Income = Salary + Commission\n\nWe know the salary is 1500. The commission is 15% of the sales. Let me denote the sales as S. So commission is 0.15 * S.\n\nSo putting it together: 1500 + 0.15S = 6000.\n\nI need to solve for S. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nFirst, subtract 1500 from both sides. 0.15S = 6000 - 1500. That's 4500.\n\nThen, S = 4500 / 0.15. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm. Let me think about this. 0.15 is 15/100, so dividing by 15/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/15.

So yeah, the commission is 0.15 * S.\n\nWait, another approach: 15% of S is the commission. So 15% of 30,000 is 4500. 4500 plus 1500 is 6000. That's correct.\n\nSo the correct option is A) 30000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: option A is 30000. So that's the answer. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but why is option C 31500? Did I miscalculate something? Let me think again.\n\nNo, because 0.15 * 31500 is 4725. Adding 1500 gives 6225, which is more than 6000.

Let me write that as an equation:\n\n6000 = 1500 + 0.15 * S\n\nWhere S is the sales amount. I need to solve for S.\n\nSubtracting 1500 from both sides gives: 6000 - 1500 = 0.15 * S. So that's 4500 = 0.15 S.\n\nNow, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.15. So S = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nCalculating that, 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me think. 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 30,000 = 4500. So S would be 30,000 rupees.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 30,000. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should re-calculate. 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me compute that step by step. 0.15 is the same as 15/100. So dividing by 15/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/15. So 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWell, 4500 divided by 15 is 300. Then 300 multiplied by 100 is 30,000.

The question is asking, what should the sale amount be so that the servant's total monthly income is 6000 rupees? \n\nWait, right, the servant's total income is the sum of his fixed salary and the commission from sales. So I think I need to calculate the required sales based on the commission percentage.\n\nLet me break it down. The servant wants his total income to be 6000. He already gets 1500 as a fixed salary. So the commission he needs must make up the difference. Let me subtract the salary from the total desired income: 6000 minus 1500. That gives 4500. So the commission earned needs to be 4500 rupees.\n\nNow, the commission is 15% of the sales. So I can set up an equation where 15% of the sales (let's call it S) equals 4500. So 15% of S is 0.15 * S. \n\nSo, 0.15 * S = 4500. To find S, I divide both sides by 0.15. Let's calculate that: 4500 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 goes into 4500 how many times? Let me think. 4500 / 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 15/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/15.

Let's see: 15 times 30,000 is 450,000. Oh, because 15 * 30,000 = 450,000. So S is 30,000 rupees.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 30,000.

Let me read it again and think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says a shopkeeper employs a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Additionally, the shopkeeper agrees to pay the servant a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The question is, how much sale in rupees should the servant do so that his monthly income is 6000 rupees? The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The servant's total income comes from two parts: his fixed salary and the commission based on sales. The fixed part is 1500 rupees every month. The commission is 15% of the sales, so that's a variable part depending on how much he sells.\n\nThe goal is for the servant's total income to be 6000 rupees. So, I need to find out what the sales amount (let's call it S) should be so that when I add 15% of S to 1500, the sum is 6000.\n\nLet me write the equation. Total income = salary + commission. So:\n\n1500 + (15% of S) = 6000.\n\nI can write 15% as 0.15 in decimal form. So,\n\n1500 + 0.15 * S = 6000.\n\nNow, I need to solve for S. Let's subtract 1500 from both sides to get the commission part by itself.\n\n0.15 * S = 6000 - 1500.\n\nWhat's 6000 minus 1500? Oh right, that's 4500.\n\nSo, 0.15 * S = 4500.\n\nTo find S, I'll divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 4500 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 15/100, so dividing by 0.15 is the same as multiplying by 100/15. So 4500 * (100/15) = ?\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to do it step by step. Let's see, 0.15 times what gives 4500. Let me think: 0.15 * 30000 is 4500 because 0.15 * 10000 is 1500, so times 3 is 4500. So 30000 * 0.15 is 4500. So S is 30000.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because 0.15 times 30,000 is indeed 4500. So then, adding the 1500 salary, 4500+1500=6000, which matches the target income.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30000, which would be S. So the correct answer should be A)30000.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check the options again. Option C is 31500. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, no, because the equation was 0.15 S =4500, so S=30000. So 30000 is correct. So option A is the right choice.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.\n\nThe problem says a shopkeeper employs a servant with a monthly salary of 1500 rupees. Additionally, the shopkeeper agrees to pay the servant a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. The question is, how much sale in rupees should the servant do so that his monthly income is 6000 rupees? The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The servant's total income comes from two parts: his fixed salary and the commission based on sales. The fixed part is 1500 rupees every month. The commission is 15% of the sales, so that's a variable part depending on how much he sells.\n\nThe goal is for the servant's total income to be 6000 rupees. So, I need to find out what the sales amount (let's call it S) should be so that when I add 15% of S to 1500, the sum is 6000.\n\nLet me write the equation. Total income = salary + commission. So:\n\n1500 + (15% of S) = 6000.\n\nI can write 15% as 0.15 in decimal form. So,\n\n1500 + 0.15 * S = 6000.\n\nNow, I need to solve for S. Let's subtract 1500 from both sides to get the commission part by itself.\n\n0.15 * S = 6000 - 1500.\n\nWhat's 6000 minus 1500? Oh right, that's 4500.\n\nSo, 0.15 * S = 4500.\n\nTo find S, I'll divide both sides by 0.15.\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 4500 divided by 0.15.
