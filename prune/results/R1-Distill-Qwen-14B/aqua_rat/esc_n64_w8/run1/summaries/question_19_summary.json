      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about exam scores and averages. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'll probably need to use some algebra to solve it.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. So if I call the highest score H and the lowest score L, then the average of H and L is (H + L)/2 = x. That means H + L = 2x. Got that part.\n\nThen, the average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all the scores must be z times y, right? So total sum S = z * y.\n\nThe question asks for the average when we exclude the highest and lowest scorers. So we're looking for the average of the remaining (z - 2) students. To find that, I'll need the sum of those (z-2) students' scores and then divide by (z-2).\n\nWait, how do I find that sum? Well, the total sum S is the sum of all z students. If I subtract the highest (H) and the lowest (L), then the sum of the rest is S - H - L. \n\nBut I know from earlier that H + L is 2x.

Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe average of the highest and lowest score is x. The overall class average is y, and there are z students. We need to find the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. The options are given, so I have to find the right expression in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So, for the entire class, the average is y. So, the total points for all students would be y multiplied by z. That makes sense. So total = y * z.\n\nNow, the average of the highest and lowest is x. So, the sum of the highest and lowest scores would be 2x. Because (highest + lowest)/2 = x, so multiplying both sides by 2 gives highest + lowest = 2x.\n\nThe problem asks for the average when we exclude these two. So, the number of students now is z - 2. The total points for these remaining students would be the overall total minus the highest and lowest.

So, we're looking at the average of (z - 2) students because we're removing two people. \n\nLet me denote the sum of all the scores as S. So S = y * z.

Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't overlook anything.\n\nOption A: (zy \u2013 2x)/z. Oh wait, that's dividing by the total z, which would be incorrect because we've excluded two students. So that's not right.\n\nOption B: (zy \u2013 2)/z. Hmm, that seems to subtract 2, not 2x. So that's not matching our equation.\n\nOption C: (zx \u2013 y)/(z \u2013 2). Let me see, if I expand this, it's (z x - y) divided by (z-2). But in our case, it's (y z - 2x)/(z-2). So unless x and y are related, this doesn't look right.\n\nOption E: (zy \u2013 x)/(z + 2). Again, this adds 2 in the denominator, which doesn't make sense because we're excluding two students, so the denominator should be z-2, not z+2.\n\nSo yeah, option D is the one that fits. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the average of the highest and lowest scores is given as \\( x \\). This implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{highest} + \\text{lowest}}{2} = x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{highest} + \\text{lowest} = 2x.\n\\]\n\nThe total score for the entire class is the average score \\( y \\) multiplied by the number of students \\( z \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total score} = y \\cdot z.\n\\]\n\nWhen excluding the highest and lowest scores, we are left with \\( z - 2 \\) students. The sum of their scores is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of middle scores} = \\text{Total score} - (\\text{highest} + \\text{lowest}) = y \\cdot z - 2x.\n\\]\n\nThe average score for these \\( z - 2 \\) students is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of middle scores}}{z - 2} = \\frac{y \\cdot z - 2x}{z - 2}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we compare this result with the given options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\(\\frac{zy - 2x}{z}\\) is incorrect because it divides by \\( z \\) instead of \\( z - 2 \\).\n- **Option B**: \\(\\frac{zy - 2}{z}\\) is incorrect because it subtracts 2 instead of \\( 2x \\).\n- **Option C**: \\(\\frac{zx - y}{z - 2}\\) is incorrect because it does not match the derived expression \\( \\frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2} \\).\n- **Option D**: \\(\\frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}\\) is correct as it matches the derived expression.\n- **Option E**: \\(\\frac{zy - x}{z + 2}\\) is incorrect because it adds 2 in the denominator instead of subtracting.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
