      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about making bouquets with white and red tulips. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says we have 28 white tulips and 98 red ones. We need to make as many identical bouquets as possible without leaving any flowers unused. Identical here means each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a problem about finding the greatest common divisor, or GCD, because the GCD will tell me the maximum number of bouquets we can make where each bouquet has an integer number of white and red tulips, and we use all the flowers.\n\nWait, right. The GCD of the two quantities (28 and 98) should give the maximum number of bouquets. Because each bouquet will then have 28/GCD white and 98/GCD red tulips.\n\nSo, let me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nBreaking them down into prime factors:\n- 28 factors: 2 * 2 * 7 \u2192 2\u00b2 * 7\u00b9\n- 98 factors: 2 * 7 * 7 \u2192 2\u00b9 * 7\u00b2\n\nThe GCD is the product of the smallest exponents of the common primes. So for 2, it's min(2,1) \u2192 1. For 7, it's min(1,2) \u21921. So GCD is 2^1 *7^1 = 2*7=14.\n\nWait, wait a second. But wait, 28 divided by 14 is 2, and 98 divided by 14 is 7. So each bouquet would have 2 white and 7 red tulips. But wait, 28 white divided into 14 bouquets gives 2 each, and 98 red divided into 14 bouquets gives 7 each. That makes sense.\n\nSo the maximum number of bouquets is 14. So looking at the options, option D is 14. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Could there be a larger number? Oh no, because 14 is the greatest common divisor, so no, it can't be higher. So the answer should be D)14.\n",

Because the GCD would tell me the largest number of bouquets I can make where each bouquet uses the same amount of each color.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate the GCD. I remember the Euclidean algorithm. So first, take the larger number and divide by the smaller. 98 divided by 28 is 3 with a remainder. 98 \u00f7 28 = 3, because 28*3=84.

So the maximum number of identical bouquets would be 14. So the answer is D)14.\n\nBut wait, the options also have 21. Hmm, can 21 bouquets be possible? Let's see. 21 bouquets would require 28 /21 = 1.333... white tulips per bouquet, which isn't possible because you can't have a fraction of a tulip. Similarly, 98/21 is about 4.666, which is also not an integer. So 21 isn't a divisor of either number. So the maximum is indeed 14.\n\nSo the answer should be D)14.\n\n\nTo determine the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out, we need to find the largest number that divides both 28 and 98 exactly. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.\n\nFirst, factorize the numbers:\n- \\( 28 = 2^2 \\times 7 \\)\n- \\( 98 = 2 \\times 7^2 \\)\n\nThe common prime factors are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 7 \\). Therefore, the GCD is:\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(28, 98) = 2 \\times 7 = 14\n\\]\n\nThis means that the maximum number of identical bouquets is 14. Each bouquet would contain:\n- \\( \\frac{28}{14} = 2 \\) white tulips\n- \\( \\frac{98}{14} = 7 \\) red tulips\n\nThis uses all 28 white and 98 red tulips without any leftovers. Checking the options, 14 is listed as option D. Other options, such as 21, are not valid because they do not divide both 28 and 98 exactly.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about making identical bouquets using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips. The key here is that no flowers can be left out, meaning all of them must be used in the bouquets. Also, the bouquets are identical if they have the same number of red and white tulips. So, I need to find the greatest number of such bouquets possible.\n\nHmm. I think this is a problem related to factors and maybe the greatest common divisor (GCD). Because we're trying to divide both the white and red tulips into equal parts without any leftovers. So, the number of bouquets will be the largest number that can divide both 28 and 98 exactly.\n\nWait, let me think. If we have 28 white tulips, how many bouquets can we make? Well, each bouquet will have a certain number of white tulips, and the total number of bouquets will be 28 divided by that number. Similarly, for red tulips, each bouquet will have some red ones, and the total bouquets will be 98 divided by that number. But since the number of bouquets has to be the same for both colors, we need a number that can divide both 28 and 98 without any remainder.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the greatest common divisor of 28 and 98. Because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers exactly.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. \n\nFirst, factorize both numbers. \n\n28 can be broken down into prime factors: 2 * 2 * 7, which is 2\u00b2 * 7\u00b9.\n98 can be broken down as 2 * 49, which is 2\u00b9 * 7\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor. So, the common primes are 2 and 7.\n\nFor 2, the smallest exponent is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2 and 98 has 2\u00b9).\nFor 7, the smallest exponent is 1 (28 has 7\u00b9, 98 has 7\u00b2).\n\nSo GCD = 2^1 * 7^1 = 2 *7=14.\n\nWait, but that would mean the maximum number of bouquets is 14. But let me think again. Each bouquet would then have 28/14=2 white tulips, and 98/14=7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red, and 14 bouquets in total. That uses all the flowers: 14*2=28 whites, 14*7=98 reds. That adds up.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 14. But why is there an option E which is 21? Oh, 21 is higher than 14, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, 21 is bigger than 14, but does 21 divide both 28 and 98?\n\nLet me check. 28 divided by 21 is 1.333..., which is not an integer. So 21 doesn't divide 28 exactly. So 21 can't be the number of bouquets because it leaves some white tulips unused. Similarly, 98 divided by 21 is approximately 4.666, which isn't an integer either. So 21 is out.\n\nSo the maximum is 14, which is option D.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let's consider another approach. Maybe the problem is about the number of bouquets per arrangement, but perhaps the bouquets can have different numbers of red and white as long as the ratio is same across all bouquets. No, wait, no. The problem says that two bouquets are identical if they have the same number of red and white. So each bouquet must have exactly the same count of red and white. So the number of bouquets must be a divisor of both 28 and 98. Therefore, the maximum number is the GCD, which is 14.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D)14.\n",

Each bouquet would contain \\( \\frac{28}{14} = 2 \\) white tulips and \\( \\frac{98}{14} = 7 \\) red tulips, using all the flowers without any leftovers.\n\nTo confirm, the GCD can also be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm:  \n- \\( 98 \\div 28 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 14 \\)  \n- \\( 28 \\div 14 = 2 \\) with no remainder  \n\nTherefore, the GCD is \\( 14 \\), and the maximum number of identical bouquets is \\( 14 \\).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about making identical bouquets with white and red tulips. The question is asking for the greatest number of bouquets I can make without leaving any flowers out. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"identical bouquets\" mean. Oh right, identical means each bouquet has the same number of white and red tulips. So, each bouquet will have a certain number of white and a certain number of red tulips, and all bouquets must match this.\n\nSo, I've got 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips. I can't have any left over, so the total number of white and red must be perfectly divided into these bouquets.\n\nWait, so this sounds like a problem involving factors and multiples. Maybe I should find how many bouquets I can make based on the number of each color. Since each bouquet takes some number of white and red, the total bouquets would be the same for both colors.\n\nLet me break it down. For the white tulips: I have 28. Each bouquet takes, say, w white tulips. So the number of bouquets would be 28 divided by w. Similarly, for the red tulips: 98 divided by r, where r is the number of red per bouquet.\n\nBut since the bouquets are identical, the number of bouquets from white and red must be the same. So, 28/w = 98/r = number of bouquets, let's call it n. So, n must be a divisor of both 28 and 98 because n must evenly divide both quantities.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So n has to be a common factor of 28 and 98. To find the maximum number of bouquets, I need the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 28 and 98. \n\nFirst, factor both numbers:\n\n28: 2 * 14, which is 2 * 2 * 7. So factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.\n\n98: Let's see, 98 divided by 2 is 49. 49 is 7 squared. So 98 = 2 * 7^2. Its factors are 1, 2, 7, 14, 49, 98.\n\nNow, the common factors between 28 and 98 are 1, 2, 7, 14. So the greatest common factor is 14.\n\nWait, so the maximum number of bouquets is 14? But wait, let me think again. Because each bouquet would then have 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 = 7 red tulips. That works because 2 *14 =28 and 7*14=98. So no flowers left.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So 14 is one of the options. So the answer should be D)14.\n\nBut wait, another approach: Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the maximum number of bouquets such that the number of bouquets is the same, but each bouquet has the same number of each color. So, perhaps it's the GCD of 28 and 98, which is 14. So the maximum is 14 bouquets.\n\nWait, but what if I try to make more bouquets? Like, could I make 21 bouquets? Well, 21 is a factor of 98 (since 98/21=4.666... no, that's not a whole number. Wait, 21*4=84, 21*5=105, which is over 98. So 21 isn't a divisor of 98. So 21 bouquets can't be made because 98 isn't divisible by 21. 98 divided by 21 is approximately 4.666, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nSo the GCD approach seems correct. So the answer is 14. So the option D.\n",
