      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a candidate's exam marks. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the candidate scored 504 marks out of a maximum M. Then, when the maximum mark M is converted to 800, the candidate's score becomes 420. I need to find the value of M. \n\nWait, let me break it down. The candidate's actual score is 504. But when the maximum possible score is scaled from M to 800, their score scales down to 420. So, it's like a proportion problem. The ratio of the candidate's marks to the maximum should remain the same before and after scaling.\n\nSo, before scaling, the ratio is 504/M. After scaling, the maximum becomes 800, and the candidate's score is 420. So the ratio is 420/800. Since the candidate's performance ratio doesn't change, these two ratios should be equal.\n\nSo setting them equal: 504/M = 420/800.\n\nNow I can solve for M. Let me cross-multiply. 504 * 800 = M * 420.\n\nCalculating 504 * 800. Let me see, 504 * 800. Well, 500*800 is 400,000, and 4*800 is 3,200. So adding those gives 403,200. So 504 * 800 = 403,200.\n\nOn the other side, M *420. So M = 403200 / 420.\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 403200 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 times 900 is 378,000. Because 420 * 900 = 378,000. Then, 403,200 minus 378,000 is 25,200. 420 goes into 25,200 how many times? 25,200 / 420. Let's see, 420 * 60 is 25,200. So 900 + 60 = 960. So M is 960?\n\nWait, but looking at the options, E is 960. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe I can simplify the fractions first. 504 over M equals 420 over 800. Let me write that as 504/M = 420/800.\n\nSimplify 420/800. Both numbers are divisible by 20. 420 \u00f720=21, 800 \u00f720=40. So 21/40. So 504/M =21/40.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 21*M = 504*40.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, 504 times 40 is? 500*40=20,000 and 4*40=160. So 20,160. So 21 M =20,160. Therefore, M = 20,160 /21.\n\n20,160 divided by 21. Let's calculate that. 21 * 900 is 18,900. 20,160 minus 18,900 is 1,260. 21 * 60 is 1,260. So 900 +60=960. So M is indeed 960.\n\nLooking back at the options, E is 960. So the correct answer should be E. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nAnother way: The candidate's percentage before scaling is (504/M)*100. After scaling, it's (420/800)*100. Since the percentage remains the same, set them equal.\n\n(504/M) = (420/800). Which is the same as before. So yes, same result.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be E)960.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum mark M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M?\n\nHmm. So, the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. But when the maximum is changed to 800, his score becomes 420. I need to find what M is.\n\nWait, I think this is about scaling or something. Like, when the maximum changes, the candidate's score is adjusted proportionally. So, the ratio of his score to the maximum remains the same in both cases, right?\n\nSo, the candidate's percentage or ratio would be the same whether the max is M or 800. So, 504/M should equal 420/800. Because both represent the same proportion of the maximum.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation. 504 divided by M equals 420 divided by 800. So, 504/M = 420/800.\n\nI can solve for M by cross-multiplying. So, 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nLet me calculate both sides. 504 times 800. Hmm. Let me break it down. 500*800 is 400,000, and 4*800 is 3,200. So, 400,000 + 3,200 = 403,200.\n\nOn the other side, 420 times M equals 403,200. So, M = 403,200 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute that. 403,200 / 420. Let's see, 420 times 900 is 378,000. Because 420*100=42,000, so 42*1000=420,000. Wait, wait, maybe a better approach.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 40320 / 42. Let's see, 42 * 900 is 37,800. Subtract that from 40,320: 40,320 - 37,800 = 2,520. Now, how many times does 42 go into 2,520? 42 * 60 = 2,520. So total is 900 + 60 = 960.\n\nSo M is 960. Looking at the options, option E is 960. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If M is 960, then the candidate scored 504 out of 960. What's the ratio? 504/960. Let me compute that. Divide numerator and denominator by 48: 504 \u00f748 is 10.5, 960 \u00f748 is 20. So 10.5/20 is 0.525. 0.525 is 52.5%.\n\nNow, when the maximum becomes 800, the candidate's score is 420. 420/800 is 0.525, same as before. So yes, the ratios match. So M is indeed 960.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M?\n\nHmm, so the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. Then, if M is converted to 800, his score becomes 420. So I guess this means that the percentage or ratio of his score stays the same, but the total marks change.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the idea is that the candidate's performance is a certain proportion of the maximum. When the maximum changes, his score also changes proportionally. So I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me think: the original score is 504 out of M. After conversion, the score is 420 out of 800. So these two fractions should be equal because the candidate's performance percentage hasn't changed.\n\nSo mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n504 / M = 420 / 800\n\nNow I can solve for M. Let me cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. That gives:\n\n504 * 800 = 420 * M\n\nLet me compute both sides. Wait, 504 times 800... Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down.\n\n504 * 800 = 504 * 8 * 100. 504 *8 is... let's see, 500*8=4000, 4*8=32, so 4032. Then multiply by 100: 403200.\n\nOn the other side, 420 * M = 420 * M. So 403200 = 420 * M.\n\nNow I need to solve for M. So M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 403200 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 times 1000 is 420,000, which is more than 403200. So maybe 960? Let me check: 420 * 960.\n\nWait, 420 * 960 = 420*(900+60) = 420*900 + 420*60. 420*900 is 378,000. 420*60 is 25,200. So adding those gives 378,000 +25,200=403,200. Oh, exactly the numerator. So M is 960.\n\nWait, looking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. If M is 960, then the candidate's score is 504. So the percentage would be (504/960)*100. Let me calculate that. 504 divided by 960: let's see, 960 goes into 504 zero times. Let me compute 504 \u00f7 960. Hmm, maybe 504/960 = 0.525, because 0.5 * 960 is 480, and 0.025 *960 is 24, so 480+24=504. So 0.525, which is 52.5%.\n\nThen, when M is converted to 800, the score would be 420. Let's check if 420/800 is also 0.525. 420 divided by 800: 420 \u00f7 800. Well, 800 *0.5 is 400, and 0.025 *800 is 20. So 400+20=420. So yes, 0.525. So the percentages match.

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M?\n\nHmm, so the candidate's score is 504 when the maximum is M. Then, if M is converted to 800, his score becomes 420. So I guess this means that the percentage or ratio of his score stays the same, but the total marks change.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the idea is that the candidate's performance is a certain proportion of the maximum. When the maximum changes, his score also changes proportionally. So I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me think: the original score is 504 out of M. After conversion, the score is 420 out of 800. So these two fractions should be equal because the candidate's performance percentage hasn't changed.\n\nSo mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n504 / M = 420 / 800\n\nNow I can solve for M. Let me cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions. That gives:\n\n504 * 800 = 420 * M\n\nLet me compute both sides. Wait, 504 times 800... Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down.\n\n504 * 800 = 504 * 8 * 100. 504 *8 is... let's see, 500*8=4000, 4*8=32, so 4032. Then multiply by 100: 403200.\n\nOn the other side, 420 * M = 420 * M. So 403200 = 420 * M.\n\nNow I need to solve for M. So M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 403200 divided by 420. Let's see, 420 times 1000 is 420,000, which is more than 403200. So maybe 960? Let me check: 420 * 960.\n\nWait, 420 * 960 = 420*(900+60) = 420*900 + 420*60. 420*900 is 378,000. 420*60 is 25,200. So adding those gives 378,000 +25,200=403,200. Oh, exactly the numerator. So M is 960.\n\nWait, looking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. If M is 960, then the candidate's score is 504. So the percentage would be (504/960)*100. Let me calculate that. 504 divided by 960: let's see, 960 goes into 504 zero times. Let me compute 504 \u00f7 960. Hmm, maybe 504/960 = 0.525, because 0.5 * 960 is 480, and 0.025 *960 is 24, so 480+24=504. So 0.525, which is 52.5%.\n\nThen, when M is converted to 800, the score would be 420. Let's check if 420/800 is also 0.525. 420 divided by 800: 420 \u00f7 800. Well, 800 *0.5 is 400, and 0.025 *800 is 20. So 400+20=420. So yes, 0.525. So the percentages match. So M is indeed 960, which is option E.\n\n\nThe candidate's score is given as 504 out of the maximum mark \\( M \\). When the maximum mark is converted to 800, the candidate's score becomes 420. This implies that the candidate's performance is a consistent proportion of the total marks. Therefore, we can set up the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{504}{M} = \\frac{420}{800}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 420 \\times M\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 504 \\times 800 \\):\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 403,200\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n403,200 = 420 \\times M\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{403,200}{420} = 960\n\\]\n\nTo verify, if \\( M = 960 \\), the candidate's score is \\( 504 \\), and the percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{504}{960} \\times 100 = 52.5\\%\n\\]\n\nWhen \\( M \\) is converted to 800, the score becomes \\( 420 \\), and the percentage is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{420}{800} \\times 100 = 52.5\\%\n\\]\n\nThe percentages match, confirming that \\( M = 960 \\).

Now, the problem says that if the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate's score would be 420. Hmm, so this must be a scaling or conversion of the marks.\n\nWait, I think it's about converting the original scale (which goes up to M) to a new scale that goes up to 800. So, the candidate's original percentage or ratio is being applied to this new scale.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. So, the candidate's original score is 504/M of the total.

Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says that a candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M. Then, if this maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have scored 420. I need to find the value of M from the given options.\n\nHmm, I think this is a problem about scaling marks. Like, when the total maximum changes from M to 800, the candidate's score also changes proportionally. So, maybe it's a ratio problem.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The candidate's original score is 504 out of M. When M is converted to 800, their score becomes 420. So, the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum should remain the same in both cases.\n\nSo, setting up the equation: 504/M = 420/800. That makes sense because both fractions represent the same proportion of the maximum mark.\n\nNow, I need to solve for M. Let me rearrange the equation. Cross-multiplying gives 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, let me calculate 504 * 800 first. Hmm, 504 * 800. 504 times 8 is 4032, so 504 * 800 should be 403200. Yeah, because 800 is 8*100, so 4032 *100=403200.\n\nOn the other side, it's 420 * M. So, 403200 = 420 M.\n\nTo find M, I'll divide both sides by 420. So, M = 403200 / 420.\n\nLet me do that division. 403200 divided by 420. Hmm. Let me see. 420 is 42*10, so maybe I can simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 403200 / 420. Well, 420 times 1000 is 420,000. But 403200 is less than that. Let's see, 420*900=378,000. Subtract that from 403200, that's 403200 -378000=25200. Now, 420 * 60 is 25200. So, 900+60=960.

So, the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum remains the same.\n\nRight, so the ratio of 504 to M should be equal to the ratio of 420 to 800. Because the candidate's performance as a percentage of the maximum should stay the same before and after the conversion. Oh, wait, no, maybe not exactly.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks, he would have secured 420 marks. What is the value of M?\n\nHmm, okay. So the candidate scored 504 marks when the maximum is M. But if the maximum is changed to 800, then the same candidate's score would be 420. Wait, so the candidate's actual performance is the same, but the scaling changes.\n\nI think this is a proportion problem.

Now I need to solve for M. To do that, I can cross-multiply.\n\nSo, cross-multiplying gives me 504 * 800 = 420 * M.\n\nWait, let me compute both sides. Let me calculate 504 multiplied by 800. Hmm, 504 * 800. Let's see, 500 * 800 is 400,000, and 4*800 is 3,200. So adding them together, 400,000 + 3,200 = 403,200.\n\nOn the other side, 420 * M. So 420 times M equals 403,200.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 504 * 800 = 403,200, and 420 * M = 403,200. So M would be 403,200 divided by 420.\n\nLet me compute that. 403,200 / 420. Hmm, 420 times 960 is 403,200 because 420*900=378,000, 420*60=25,200. 378,000+25,200=403,200. So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 960. So is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I might get confused with the scaling.\n\nAnother way to think: When the maximum is M, the candidate got 504. When the maximum is 800, he got 420. So the scaling factor is 800/M. Because the total marks are scaled from M to 800.\n\nSo, 420 should be equal to (504) multiplied by (800/M). Because when you scale the maximum, the candidate's score scales by the same factor.\n\nSo, 420 = 504 * (800 / M)\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before. So, 420 = (504 * 800) / M.\n\nSo, solving for M: M = (504 * 800) / 420.\n\nWait, same as before. Let me compute that again. 504 divided by 420 is 1.2, because 420 times 1.2 is 504. So 504 /420 = 1.2. Then 1.2 * 800 = 960. So M is 960. So that's E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the way the question is phrased could be tricky. The candidate's marks are scaled when M is converted to 800, but perhaps the marks are scaled proportionally.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the same performance, but the maximum changes. So 504 is the actual score, but when the maximum becomes 800, the same performance would be 420. So, 504 is to M as 420 is to 800.\n\nYes, that's the same as what I did earlier.

Hmm, 420 times 960 is 403,200 because 420*900=378,000, 420*60=25,200. 378,000+25,200=403,200. So M is 960.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 960. So is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I might get confused with the scaling.\n\nAnother way to think: When the maximum is M, the candidate got 504. When the maximum is 800, he got 420. So the scaling factor is 800/M. Because the total marks are scaled from M to 800.\n\nSo, 420 should be equal to (504) multiplied by (800/M). Because when you scale the maximum, the candidate's score scales by the same factor.\n\nSo, 420 = 504 * (800 / M)\n\nWait, that's the same equation as before. So, 420 = (504 * 800) / M.\n\nSo, solving for M: M = (504 * 800) / 420.\n\nWait, same as before. Let me compute that again. 504 divided by 420 is 1.2, because 420 times 1.2 is 504. So 504 /420 = 1.2. Then 1.2 * 800 = 960. So M is 960. So that's E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because the way the question is phrased could be tricky. The candidate's marks are scaled when M is converted to 800, but perhaps the marks are scaled proportionally.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the same performance, but the maximum changes. So 504 is the actual score, but when the maximum becomes 800, the same performance would be 420. So, 504 is to M as 420 is to 800.\n\nYes, that's the same as what I did earlier. So that should be correct.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 960. So that's the answer.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the maximum mark \\( M \\) such that a candidate's score of 504 marks corresponds to 420 marks when \\( M \\) is scaled to 800. This is a proportion problem where the ratio of the candidate's score to the maximum mark remains constant.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{504}{M} = \\frac{420}{800}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 420 \\times M\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 504 \\times 800 \\):\n\n\\[\n504 \\times 800 = 403,200\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( 420 \\times M = 403,200 \\). Solving for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[\nM = \\frac{403,200}{420} = 960\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( M \\) is 960, which corresponds to option E.\n\nAnswer: E",
