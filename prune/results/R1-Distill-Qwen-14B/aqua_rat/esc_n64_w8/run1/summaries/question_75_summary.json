      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a picket fence. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the length of the fence in feet. The options are all algebraic expressions, so I need to figure out the correct one.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The fence is straight, made of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space. Wait, so each space is 6 inches. Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the fence. There's x pickets, and between each, a space. So, how many spaces are there? Well, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than x. Because imagine two pickets: there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, and so on. So the number of spaces is (x-1).\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets is x times 1/2 inches. That's (x * 1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\nThen, each space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So the total space between pickets is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Do I add the spaces and the picket widths together? Yes, because the fence is a series of pickets and spaces. So the total length in inches would be the sum of all pickets and all spaces.\n\nSo total length in inches is (x/2) + 6*(x-1).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand it:\n\nx/2 + 6x - 6.\n\nWait, let's make it easier. Let me combine like terms. So, 6x is the same as (12x/2) because 6 is 12/2. So, x/2 + 12x/2 is (13x)/2. Then subtract 6.\n\nSo the total length in inches is (13x)/2 - 6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo, the expression in feet is [(13x/2) -6 ] / 12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as (13x -12)/24. Because:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x - 12)/24.\n\nWait, how? Let's see:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 12. Hmm, no, wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nSo, (13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is the same as (13x/2 -6) multiplied by 1/12.\n\nWhich is (13x)/(2*12) ) - 6/12.\n\nThat's 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, I don't see 13x/24 - 12/24, which is 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption C is 13x/24.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, wait, because when I have (13x/2 -6) divided by 12, that's the same as [13x/2 -6] * (1/12) = 13x/(2*12) -6/12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. Let me look again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total length in inches. Let me recheck.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each 1/2 inch. So x*(1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches. So (x-1)*6 = 6x -6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: x/2 + 6x -6 = (x/2 + 6x) -6.\n\nConvert 6x to halves: 6x = 12x/2. So x/2 +12x/2 = 13x/2. So total is 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nSo, in feet, divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is the same as (13x -12)/24. Because:\n\n(13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2, so 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x -12)/2.\n\nThen, dividing by 12: [(13x -12)/2 ] /12 = (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the expression is (13x -12)/24, which is option E.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E) (13x-12)/24.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Another way to think about it: each picket is 0.5 inches, and each space is 6 inches.\n\nSo for x pickets, the total picket length is x * 0.5 inches. And the spaces: since between x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces, each 6 inches. So spaces total 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches is 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\n6.5 is 13/2. So 6.5x is 13x/2. So 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: divide by 12. (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So the answer is E.\n",

If there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them would be x-1, right? Because if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's x-1 spaces.\n\nSo the total width would be the sum of all the picket widths and all the spaces. Each picket is 1/2 inch, so x pickets would be (x * 1/2) inches. The spaces are 6 inches each, and there are (x-1) spaces, so that's 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nAdding those together gives the total length in inches. Then I need to convert inches to feet because the answer is in feet. Oh wait, 12 inches make a foot, so I'll divide by 12.\n\nLet me write that out.

So the total inches are (13x/2) -6.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 6*(x-1) is 6x -6. And x/2 is from the pickets. So adding them together: x/2 +6x -6 = (0.5x +6x) is 6.5x, which is 13x/2. So 13x/2 -6 inches. Now to convert to feet, divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's factor the numerator. (13x/2 -6) is the same as (13x -12)/2.

Plugging x=2 into option E: (26-12)/24 =14/24=7/12. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another example. Suppose x=3. Pickets: 3*(1/2)=1.5 inches. Spaces: 2*(6)=12 inches.

Between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I need to figure out the total length in feet.\n\nWait, I should probably start by visualizing the fence. So, imagine a fence with multiple pickets. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And between each two adjacent pickets, there's a 6-inch space. So the pattern is picket, space, picket, space, and so on.\n\nBut wait, how many spaces are there between the pickets? Oh right, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them is (x - 1). Because if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, etc. So the number of spaces is x-1.\n\nSo the total width contributed by the pickets themselves is x multiplied by the width of each picket. Each picket is 0.5 inches, so that's x * 0.5 inches. \n\nAnd the total width from the spaces is (x-1) spaces multiplied by 6 inches each. So that's (x-1)*6 inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the pickets and the spaces. So total length in inches is (x * 0.5) + ((x-1)*6).\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: total_length_inches = (0.5x) + 6(x-1).\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's expand it:\n\n0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the equation becomes (13/2)x -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet, not inches. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is [(13/2)x -6 ] / 12.\n\nWait, let me write that as fractions to make it clearer. So:\n\nTotal length (feet) = [(13x/2) - 6 ] / 12.\n\nHmm, let's simplify that. Let's split the numerator:\n\n= (13x/2) /12  - 6/12.\n\nWhich is (13x)/(24) - (1/2). Wait, but 6/12 is 0.5 or 1/2.\n\nWait, but the answer options don't seem to have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 which is 6.5x, but that's in inches, right? So not the answer because we're supposed to have it in feet.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 Again, this is in inches, because 13x/2 is inches and 6 inches. So that's incorrect since we're looking for feet.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 Hmm, that's 13x divided by 24, which is (13x)/(24) in feet. But wait, that's only part of our equation. Because in the earlier step, we had (13x/2 -6) inches, which when converted to feet is (13x/2 -6)/12 = 13x/(2*12) - 6/12 = 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nSo C is 13x/24, but that's missing the -0.5 part. So that's not right.\n\nD) (13x +1)/24 \u2192 Hmm, that's (13x +1) over 24. Doesn't seem to match. Because our equation after conversion is (13x/24 - 0.5). Wait, 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, so that would be E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's re-express the equation.\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal length (feet) = (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is same as (13x/2 -6 ) multiplied by (1/12).\n\nSo, 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\nAnd 6/(12) is 0.5, which is 1/2. So,\n\nTotal length = (13x/24) - (6/12) = (13x/24) - (1/2).\n\nBut 1/2 is 12/24. So,\n\n= (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo that's the same as option E: (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches.\n\nTotal inches: 0.5x +6(x-1).\n\n= 0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(24) - 6/12 \u2192 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut 0.5 is 12/24. So 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x-12)/24.\n\nSo yes, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are:\n\nE) (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we have.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a picket fence, and I need to find the length of the fence in feet. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the fence is straight and made of x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. Between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. I need to figure out the total length in feet.\n\nWait, I should probably start by visualizing the fence. So, imagine a fence with multiple pickets. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. And between each two adjacent pickets, there's a 6-inch space. So the pattern is picket, space, picket, space, and so on.\n\nBut wait, how many spaces are there between the pickets? Oh right, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them is (x - 1). Because if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. Three pickets have two spaces, etc. So the number of spaces is x-1.\n\nSo the total width contributed by the pickets themselves is x multiplied by the width of each picket. Each picket is 0.5 inches, so that's x * 0.5 inches. \n\nAnd the total width from the spaces is (x-1) spaces multiplied by 6 inches each.

Let's expand it:\n\n0.5x + 6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x.

I need to find the total length in feet. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me visualize this. If there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them? Oh right, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them is one less than x. Like, for example, 2 pickets have 1 space, 3 pickets have 2 spaces, and so on. So the number of spaces is (x-1).\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches wide, so the total width of all the pickets together would be x multiplied by 0.5 inches. Let me write that: x * 0.5.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces, so the total space is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. That would be (x * 0.5) + (6*(x-1)).\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's expand the terms:\n\nx * 0.5 is 0.5x. And 6*(x-1) is 6x -6. So adding them together: 0.5x + 6x -6. Combine like terms: 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, so 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet, right? Because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nHmm, let me simplify that. 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So substituting that in, it becomes ( (13/2)x -6 ) /12.\n\nLet me split the numerator: [ (13x/2) -6 ] /12.\n\nDividing each term by 12: (13x/2)/12 = 13x/(24), and 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2.

Did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial setup. Let me go through it again.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each picket is 0.5 inches. So picket total is x * 0.5 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces: x-1. Each space is 6 inches, so total spaces is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal fence length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12 feet.\n\nWait, 6.5x is the same as 13x/2. So 13x/2 -6, divided by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (13x/2)/12 -6/12 \u2192 (13x)/(24) - 0.5.\n\nHmm, but that's not any of the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E is (13x-12)/24. Let's see what that equals. Let me compute (13x -12)/24.\n\nWait, perhaps I should factor the expression I have differently. My current expression is (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me combine those terms before dividing.\n\nWait, let me compute numerator: 13x/2 -6. To combine, I can write 6 as 12/2. So 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x -12)/2.\n\nThen, I divide by 12, which is same as multiplying by 1/12. So (13x-12)/2 * 1/12 = (13x-12)/(24).\n\nOh! So the expression (13x-12)/24 is the same as (13x/2 -6)/12. So the total length is (13x-12)/24 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's take a simple case. Suppose x=2 pickets. Then, how long is the fence?\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches. So 2 * 0.5 = 1 inch for pickets. Between them, 1 space of 6 inches. So total is 1 +6 =7 inches. 7 inches is 7/12 feet.\n\nNow, plug x=2 into option E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24 =7/12. Which matches. So that works.\n\nLet me check option A: 13x/2. For x=2, that's 26/2=13 inches, which is 13/12 feet, which is longer than 7 inches. So no, A isn't correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=3 pickets.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so 1.5 inches. Number of spaces: 2. So 2*6=12 inches. Total length 1.5 +12=13.5 inches = 13.5/12 = 1.125 feet.\n\nOption E: (13*3 -12)/24 = (39-12)/24 =27/24=9/8=1.125. Correct.\n\nSo E is the right choice. Therefore, the answer should be E.\n",

Suppose x=2 pickets. Then, how long is the fence?\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches. So 2 * 0.5 = 1 inch for pickets. Between them, 1 space of 6 inches. So total is 1 +6 =7 inches. 7 inches is 7/12 feet.\n\nNow, plug x=2 into option E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24 =7/12. Which matches. So that works.\n\nLet me check option A: 13x/2. For x=2, that's 26/2=13 inches, which is 13/12 feet, which is longer than 7 inches. So no, A isn't correct.\n\nAnother test case: x=3 pickets.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so 1.5 inches. Number of spaces: 2. So 2*6=12 inches. Total length 1.5 +12=13.5 inches = 13.5/12 = 1.125 feet.\n\nOption E: (13*3 -12)/24 = (39-12)/24 =27/24=9/8=1.125. Correct.\n\nSo E is the right choice. Therefore, the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by calculating the total length in inches. The fence consists of \\( x \\) pickets, each \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and \\( x-1 \\) spaces between the pickets, each \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) wide.\n\n1. **Total width of the pickets**:  \n   \\[\n   x \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total width of the spaces**:  \n   \\[\n   (x-1) \\times 6 = 6(x-1) \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total length of the fence in inches**:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} + 6(x-1) = \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = \\frac{13x}{2} - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to feet**:  \n   Since \\( 1 \\, \\text{foot} = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\), we divide by 12:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\, \\text{feet}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total length of the fence in feet is represented by the expression \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\), which corresponds to **Option E**.\n\n**Verification with test cases**:  \n- For \\( x = 2 \\), the total length is \\( \\frac{13(2) - 12}{24} = \\frac{14}{24} = \\frac{7}{12} \\, \\text{feet} \\), which matches the manual calculation.  \n- For \\( x = 3 \\), the total length is \\( \\frac{13(3) - 12}{24} = \\frac{27}{24} = \\frac{9}{8} \\, \\text{feet} \\), which also matches the manual calculation.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a picket fence, and I need to figure out the length in feet. Let me think through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says the fence is straight and has x pickets. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. And there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such problems, it's important to consider the total number of spaces between the pickets.\n\nWait, right, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets. Because, like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, spaces are x-1. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If x is the number of pickets, then the number of gaps between them is x-1. So, yeah, each gap is 6 inches.\n\nSo each picket is 1/2 inch, so the total picket width is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. And the total space between pickets is (x-1) multiplied by 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be the sum of these two parts. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal length in inches = (x * 1/2) + ((x - 1) * 6)\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Let's compute each part:\n\nx*(1/2) = x/2 inches.\n(x-1)*6 = 6x - 6 inches.\n\nAdding them together: x/2 + 6x -6. Let's combine like terms. Hmm, 6x is the same as 12x/2, right? So x/2 plus 12x/2 is 13x/2. Then minus 6. So total length is (13x/2 -6) inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is (13x/2 -6) / 12. Let me compute that. Let's see, (13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is the same as (13x/2 -6) * (1/12).\n\nLet me break that down. 13x/2 divided by 12 is 13x/(2*12) = 13x/24. And 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So wait, no, wait: 6/12 is 0.5, but because it's (something minus 6) over 12, maybe I should write it as (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nLet me think of it as two separate terms: (13x/2) /12 minus 6/12.\n\nSo that's (13x)/(24) minus (1/2). Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them seem to have a minus 1/2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me go back. The total length is (x/2 + 6*(x-1)) inches. So, x/2 + 6x -6. That's correct. So combining like terms, 6x is 12x/2, so x/2 +12x/2 is 13x/2. Then subtract 6 inches. So 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nNow, to convert inches to feet, divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nLet me write this as fractions:\n\n(13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/2)/(12) - 6/(12) = 13x/(24) - 1/2.\n\nHmm, looking at the options:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 that's inches, not feet. So no.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 that's inches, not feet. So no.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 that's only part of the feet calculation. But we have 13x/24 minus 1/2. So not matching.\n\nD)(13x +1)/24 \u2192 not sure.\n\nE)(13x -12)/24 \u2192 let's see, 13x/24 minus 12/24 (which is 0.5). So 13x/24 - 0.5. Which is what I have.\n\nWait, because 13x/24 - 1/2 is the same as (13x -12)/24. Because 1/2 is 12/24. So, 13x/24 -12/24 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the expression (13x/2 -6)/12 simplifies to (13x -12)/24. So the correct answer is option E.\n\nWait, let me check the options again.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. That's exactly what I have. So that's the right one.\n",

Wait, wait, so each space between two pickets is 6 inches. Got it.\n\nI think I need to model this. So imagine the fence as a series of pickets with spaces between them. Let's say there are x pickets. How many spaces are there between them? Well, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces would be x minus one. Oh, right, because each space is between two adjacent pickets. So if x is the number of pickets, the number of spaces is (x - 1).\n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets together is x multiplied by 1/2 inch. That would be (x * 1/2) inches.\n\nThen, each space is 6 inches, and there are (x - 1) spaces. So the total space taken up by the gaps is (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the picket widths and the spaces. That would be (x * 1/2) + (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nLet me write that out as an equation: Total length (in inches) = (x * 0.5) + (x-1)*6.\n\nNow, let's compute that. Let's expand the terms. \n\nFirst, x*0.5 is 0.5x.\n\nThen, (x-1)*6 is 6x -6.\n\nAdding them together: 0.5x +6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's simplify the numerator first. 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the numerator is (13/2 x) -6.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent 6 as 6/1 to make it easier. So the numerator is (13x/2) -6.\n\nSo the total length is [(13x/2) -6 ] / 12.\n\nHmm, let me break that down. Dividing by 12 is the same as multiplying by 1/12. So [(13x/2) -6 ] * (1/12) = (13x/2) * (1/12) -6 * (1/12).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(13x/2) * (1/12) = 13x / 24.\n\n6 * (1/12) = 0.5 or 1/2. So subtracting that gives 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut let me think about the options given. The options are all in fractions, so perhaps it's better to express 0.5 as 12/24 or something else.

Let's see if that can be rewritten as one of the options.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's go back.\n\nWait, the number of pickets is x, each 1/2 inch. So picket width: x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces between pickets is (x -1), each 6 inches. So space total: 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal inches: x/2 +6(x-1) = x/2 +6x -6.\n\nLet me compute that: x/2 is 0.5x. 6x is 6x.

So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is (6.5x -6)/12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's simplify the numerator first. 6.5 is the same as 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x. So the numerator is (13/2 x) -6.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent 6 as 6/1 to make it easier. So the numerator is (13x/2) -6.\n\nSo the total length is [(13x/2) -6 ] / 12.\n\nHmm, let me break that down. Dividing by 12 is the same as multiplying by 1/12. So [(13x/2) -6 ] * (1/12) = (13x/2) * (1/12) -6 * (1/12).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(13x/2) * (1/12) = 13x / 24.\n\n6 * (1/12) = 0.5 or 1/2. So subtracting that gives 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut let me think about the options given. The options are all in fractions, so perhaps it's better to express 0.5 as 12/24 or something else. Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, which is 12/24.\n\nWait, let me compute it again. Let's see:\n\nTotal length in inches: (13x/2 -6) inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (13x/2 -6) /12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2)/12 -6/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(2*12) - 6/12.\n\nSimplify 2*12 is 24, so 13x/24.\n\n6/12 is 0.5 or 1/2. So the total length is (13x/24) - (1/2) feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the answer options, none of them exactly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)13x/2\n\nB)13x/2 - 6\n\nC)13x/24\n\nD)(13x+1)/24\n\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nHmm, the expression I arrived at is (13x/24) - (1/2). Let's see if that can be rewritten as one of the options.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's go back.\n\nWait, the number of pickets is x, each 1/2 inch. So picket width: x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.\n\nNumber of spaces between pickets is (x -1), each 6 inches. So space total: 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal inches: x/2 +6(x-1) = x/2 +6x -6.\n\nLet me compute that: x/2 is 0.5x. 6x is 6x. So 0.5x +6x is 6.5x, which is 13x/2.\n\nSo total inches: (13x/2) -6 inches.\n\nConvert to feet: (13x/2 -6 ) /12.\n\nWhich is (13x/2)/(12) - 6/12.\n\nWhich is (13x)/(24) - 0.5.\n\nSo, 13x/24 - 1/2.\n\nHmm, looking for an option that matches this. Let me see.\n\nOption E is (13x-12)/24.\n\nWait, let me compute that. (13x-12)/24 equals (13x)/24 - 12/24, which is 13x/24 - 0.5. Exactly what I have.\n\nBecause 12/24 is 0.5. So 13x/24 -1/2 is the same as (13x -12)/24.\n\nSo the answer would be option E.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. Option E is (13x-12)/24. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we start by calculating the total length in inches and then convert it to feet. The fence consists of \\( x \\) pickets, each \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, and \\( x - 1 \\) spaces between the pickets, each \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) wide.\n\n1. **Total width of pickets**:  \n   Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\text{inch} \\) wide, so the total width of \\( x \\) pickets is:  \n   \\[\n   x \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total width of spaces**:  \n   There are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces between the pickets, each \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\) wide, so the total width of the spaces is:  \n   \\[\n   (x - 1) \\times 6 = 6x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total length in inches**:  \n   The total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the widths of the pickets and spaces:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = \\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6.\n   \\]  \n   Simplifying:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{2} + 6x = \\frac{x + 12x}{2} = \\frac{13x}{2}.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the total length in inches is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{13x}{2} - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to feet**:  \n   Since \\( 1 \\, \\text{foot} = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\), we divide the total length in inches by \\( 12 \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{6}{12}.\n   \\]  \n   Simplify \\( \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]  \n   To combine the terms into a single fraction, rewrite \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as \\( \\frac{12}{24} \\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{13x}{24} - \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Match with the options**:  \n   The expression \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\) matches option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let's read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Which option represents the length of the fence in feet?\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to calculate the total length based on the number of pickets and the spaces between them.\n\nLet me visualize this. If there are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide, and between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. Wait, but how many spaces are there? If there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets. Like, if you have 2 pickets, there's 1 space between them. So for x pickets, it's (x-1) spaces.\n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets themselves is x times 1/2 inch. And the total length from the spaces is (x-1) times 6 inches.\n\nWait, so the total length in inches would be (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6). Let me write that down:\n\nTotal inches = (x * 0.5) + (x-1)*6\n\nBut wait, maybe I should write it more precisely using fractions. 1/2 is the same as 0.5, so that's fine.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's expand the equation:\n\nTotal inches = (0.5x) + 6(x - 1)\n\nExpanding the second term: 6x -6.\n\nSo adding them together: 0.5x + 6x = 6.5x. Then subtract 6: 6.5x -6.\n\nBut 6.5 is the same as 13/2, right? Because 6 is 12/2, plus 0.5 is 1/2, so 13/2. So 6.5x is (13/2)x.\n\nSo the equation becomes: (13/2)x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So I need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo the total length in feet is [(13/2)x -6 ] / 12.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's write it as a fraction:\n\n( (13x/2) -6 ) / 12.\n\nWhich is the same as (13x -12)/24. Because:\n\nLet's see, 13x/2 divided by 12 is (13x)/(2*12) = 13x/24.\n\nAnd 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, which is 1/2. So 6/12 is 0.5, which is 1/2.\n\nWait, but wait, I have (13x/2 -6 ) all over 12. Let me compute that correctly.\n\nSo:\n\n[(13x/2) -6 ] /12 = (13x/2) /12 - 6/12.\n\nWhich simplifies to (13x)/(24) - (1/2).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to match (13x/24 - 1/2).

So this doesn't match.\n\nD) (13x+1)/24 \u2192 Doesn't look right.\n\nE) (13x-12)/24 \u2192 Let me compute what that would be. Let's see:\n\n(13x -12)/24 = (13x/24) - (12/24) = (13x/24) - 0.5.\n\nWhich is exactly what I have. So my total length in feet is (13x -12)/24.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is (13x-12)/24.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each 0.5 inches wide. So picket length: x * 0.5 inches.\n\nSpaces: Between each pair, so x-1 spaces. Each 6 inches. So spaces contribute (x-1)*6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6.\n\nConvert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n\n6.5 is 13/2, so (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n(13x/2 -6) /12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct.

So:\n\n( (13/2)x -6 ) / 12 = [13x/2 -6 ] / 12\n\nAlternatively, I can split this fraction into two parts: 13x/(2*12) -6/(12) = 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut looking at the answer options, let me see.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) 13x/2\nB)13x/2 -6\nC)13x/24\nD)(13x+1)/24\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nWait, my expression is (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator:\n\n(13x/2 -6) divided by 12 is equal to (13x/2)/12 minus 6/12.\n\nWhich is 13x/(2*12) - 0.5.\n\n2*12 is 24, so 13x/24 - 0.5.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have a -0.5. Let's see what the options are.\n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. Let me compute that: (13x -12)/24. Which is equal to 13x/24 - 12/24 = 13x/24 - 0.5. Oh, that's the same as my result!\n\nSo the total length in feet is (13x -12)/24. So the correct option is E.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Each picket is 0.5 inches. x pickets: 0.5x inches.\n2. Number of spaces: x-1. Each 6 inches. So spaces contribute 6*(x-1) inches.\n3. Total inches: 0.5x + 6x -6 = 6.5x -6 inches.\n4. Convert to feet: (6.5x -6)/12.\n5. 6.5 is 13/2, so (13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x -12)/24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the total length of the fence in feet, we start by calculating the total length in inches. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and there are \\( x \\) pickets, contributing \\( 0.5x \\) inches. Between each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space, and since there are \\( x \\) pickets, there are \\( x-1 \\) spaces. The total contribution from the spaces is \\( 6(x-1) \\) inches. Adding these together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in inches} = 0.5x + 6(x-1) = 0.5x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{6.5x - 6}{12}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, \\( 6.5 = \\frac{13}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total length in feet} = \\frac{\\frac{13}{2}x - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}.\n\\]\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**E) \\(\\frac{13x - 12}{24}\\)**.\n\nAnswer: E",
