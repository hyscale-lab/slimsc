      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the question is about Mark and John exchanging money and ending up with Rs.75 each under different conditions. Hmm, I need to find out how much money John originally had.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if John gives half of his money to Mark, Mark's total becomes 75. Then, John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if Mark gives John a third of his money, John ends up with 75.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. Let me think again. The first scenario is John giving half his money to Mark. The second scenario is Mark giving one third of his money to John. Both these scenarios result in each having 75, but under different conditions.\n\nLet me denote variables. Let's say Mark has M rupees, and John has J rupees.\n\nIn the first case: John gives half his money to Mark. So, John gives J/2 to Mark. After that, Mark's money becomes M + J/2. And according to Mark's statement, this amount is 75. So equation one is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75  --> Equation 1.\n\nIn the second case: Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. After that, John's money becomes J + M/3. According to John's statement, this is 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75  --> Equation 2.\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I can solve them simultaneously.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75  \n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI can solve these equations step by step. Let's rearrange equation 1 to express M in terms of J.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow, substitute this M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + [(75 - (J/2))/3] = 75\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, the numerator inside the brackets is (75 - J/2). So dividing by 3:\n\n(75/3) - (J/(2*3)) = 25 - J/6\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's combine J and J/6.\n\nJ is the same as 6J/6, so:\n\n6J/6 - J/6 = 5J/6\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n25 + (5J/6) = 75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nJ = 60\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check the options. Option B is 60. Hmm, but let me verify if this makes sense with both equations.\n\nIf J is 60, let's find M from equation 1.\n\nM = 75 - (60/2) = 75 - 30 = 45.\n\nSo Mark has 45, John has 60.\n\nNow, check scenario 1: John gives half his money (30) to Mark. Mark then has 45 +30=75. Correct.\n\nScenario 2: Mark gives a third of his money (15) to John. John then has 60 +15=75. Correct.\n\nWait, so that seems to fit. So John has 60. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, the options list B as 60. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA)22\nB)60\nC)28\nD)26\nE)18\n\nSo yes, B is 60. So the answer is B.\n",

I think I'll need to set up equations based on the information given.\n\nLet me denote the variables. Let\u2019s say John has J rupees, and Mark has M rupees. So, J and M are the amounts they have initially.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John gives away J/2 to Mark. After that, Mark's money becomes M + J/2. And according to Mark, that amount is 75. So the equation would be:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.  \u2014\u2014 Equation 1.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives John one third of his money. So Mark gives M/3 to John. After that, John's money becomes J + M/3, which equals 75. So the equation is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75. \u2014\u2014 Equation 2.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables.

Let me combine J terms.\n\nJ is the same as 6J/6. So,\n\n6J/6 - J/6 = (5J)/6.\n\nSo,\n\n(5J)/6 + 25 = 75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n(5J)/6 = 75 -25 =50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300.\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ = 60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSo, if J is 60, then from Equation 1, M =75 - (60/2) =75 -30 =45. So Mark has 45.\n\nLet me check the second scenario: Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark's money is 45, so 45/3 is 15. John gets 15, so his total becomes 60 +15=75. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the first scenario. If John gives half of 60, which is 30, to Mark. Then Mark's money becomes 45 +30=75.

So John is left with J/2, and Mark has M + J/2 =75.\n\nIn the second scenario, Mark gives a third of his money to John. So Mark is left with 2M/3, and John has J + M/3 =75.\n\nSo, the equations are correct.\n\nSo solving them, as I did before, gives J=60, M=45.\n\nWait, but wait a second, sometimes when you're dealing with these problems, you can get confused between who gives and who receives. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the first scenario, it's John giving to Mark. So John's money after giving is J - (J/2) = J/2.

Verifying this:\n\n- If \\( J = 60 \\), then \\( M = 75 - \\frac{60}{2} = 45 \\).\n- In the first scenario, John gives half (30) to Mark, so Mark has \\( 45 + 30 = 75 \\), which matches the condition.\n- In the second scenario, Mark gives one-third (15) to John, so John has \\( 60 + 15 = 75 \\), which also matches the condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B) 60**.\n\nAnswer: B",

The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nHmm, I think I need to set up some equations here. Let me denote Mark's money as M and John's money as J. So, we have two scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money to Mark. So John's money becomes J/2, and Mark's money becomes M + J/2. According to Mark, after this exchange, he will have Rs.75. So the equation is:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75. That's equation 1.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark's money becomes (2/3)M, and John's money becomes J + (M/3). John says that after this, he will have Rs.75.

So subtract J/2 from both sides:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2). Let's call this equation 1a.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2 can be rearranged to express J in terms of M. Subtract M/3 from both sides:\n\nJ = 75 - (M/3). Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nNow, substitute equation 1a into equation 2a. So replace M with (75 - J/2) in equation 2a.\n\nSo J = 75 - [ (75 - J/2) / 3 ].\n\nHmm, that looks a bit messy, but let's work through it step by step.\n\nLet me compute the term [ (75 - J/2) / 3 ].\n\nThat's equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3, which is 25 - (J)/(6).\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\nJ = 75 - [25 - (J/6)].\n\nSimplify inside the brackets first. 75 minus (25 - J/6) is the same as 75 -25 + J/6.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck that. So the equation is:\n\nJ = 75 - [25 - (J/6)].\n\nWhich can be rewritten as J = 75 -25 + (J/6).\n\nBecause subtracting (25 - x) is same as subtracting 25 and adding x. So:\n\nJ = 50 + (J/6).\n\nNow, let's bring the J/6 to the left side.\n\nJ - (J/6) = 50.\n\nTo subtract these, I can express J as 6J/6.\n\nSo 6J/6 - J/6 = (5J)/6 =50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 6: 5J = 300.\n\nDivide both sides by 5: J = 60.\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check this with the original equations.\n\nLet me compute M from equation 1a: M =75 - (60/2)=75-30=45. So Mark has 45.\n\nNow, let's test the first scenario: John gives half his money (30) to Mark. Mark would have 45 +30=75, which matches.\n\nNow the second scenario: Mark gives one third of his money to John. One third of 45 is 15. So Mark would have 30, and John would have 60+15=75. That also matches.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. So John has 60 rupees, which is option B.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 60. So the answer should be B.\n",

But according to Mark, after this exchange, Mark's money is 75. So:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.  [Equation 1]\n\nThat's the first equation. Now, John's statement: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if Mark gives one third of his money to John, then Mark would have M - (M/3) = (2M/3). John would receive M/3, so his new amount would be J + (M/3). According to John, this new amount is 75. So:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.  [Equation 2]\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J. Let's see.\n\nI can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nFrom Equation 1: Let's rearrange it to express M in terms of J.\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)  [Equation 1a]\n\nNow plug this into Equation 2. Equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + ( (75 - J/2) / 3 ) = 75\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. Let's compute the numerator first: 75 - J/2.\n\nSo, (75 - J/2) is the numerator, divided by 3. So:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ] = 75\n\nLet me rewrite this equation:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J/2)/3 = 75\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n75/3 is 25.\n\nAnd (J/2)/3 is J/(6).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's get all terms with J on one side and constants on the other.\n\nJ - (J/6) = 75 - 25\n\nCompute the left side: J is 6J/6, so 6J/6 - J/6 = (5J)/6.\n\nRight side: 75-25=50.\n\nSo:\n\n(5J)/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ = 60.\n\nSo John has 60 rupees. Let me check the options. Option B is 60, which seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because sometimes when setting up equations, I might have made a mistake.\n\nLet me plug J=60 into Equation 1a to find M.\n\nM =75 - (60/2) =75 -30=45. So Mark has 45.\n\nNow, let's check the first condition. If John gives half his money (30) to Mark, Mark gets 45+30=75. Correct. So that part works.\n\nNow the second condition: Mark gives John one third of his money. Mark has 45, so one third is 15. John gets 15, so John's total becomes 60+15=75. Correct again.\n\nSo yes, both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, John has 60 rupees. The answer should be B)60.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and we need to find out how much money John has. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again carefully. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, both of them are making statements about what would happen if they exchanged money in a certain way. Our goal is to find out how much money John currently has.\n\nWait, so there are two scenarios here. Let me denote the variables. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. \n\nIn the first scenario, John gives half of his money to Mark. So, John gives away J/2. That means John is left with J - J/2 = J/2. And Mark receives J/2, so Mark's new amount is M + J/2. According to Mark's statement, after this exchange, Mark will have Rs.75. So, M + J/2 = 75. That's our first equation.\n\nNow, the second scenario is when Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = (2/3)M. John receives M/3, so his new amount is J + M/3. According to John's statement, after this exchange, John will have Rs.75. So, J + M/3 = 75. That's our second equation.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again for clarity:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute. Let me try solving equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1:\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\nJ + [(75 - (J/2)) / 3] = 75\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. Let's compute the numerator first. (75 - J/2) divided by 3 is equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3, which is 25 - J/(6). So now the equation is:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's subtract 25 from both sides:\n\nJ - (J/6) = 75 -25\nJ - (J/6) =50\n\nLet me combine the J terms. J is the same as 6J/6, so 6J/6 - J/6 =5J/6.\n\nSo, 5J/6 =50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ=60\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into equation 1 to find M.\n\nM =75 - (60/2) =75 -30=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees, John has 60.\n\nNow, let's check both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money (30) to Mark.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Mark and John are talking about exchanging money, and we need to find out how much money John has. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again carefully. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, both of them are making statements about what would happen if they exchanged money in a certain way. Our goal is to find out how much money John currently has.\n\nWait, so there are two scenarios here. Let me denote the variables. Let's say Mark has M rupees and John has J rupees. \n\nIn the first scenario, John gives half of his money to Mark. So, John gives away J/2. That means John is left with J - J/2 = J/2. And Mark receives J/2, so Mark's new amount is M + J/2. According to Mark's statement, after this exchange, Mark will have Rs.75. So, M + J/2 = 75. That's our first equation.\n\nNow, the second scenario is when Mark gives one third of his money to John. So Mark gives M/3 to John. Mark's new amount is M - M/3 = (2/3)M. John receives M/3, so his new amount is J + M/3. According to John's statement, after this exchange, John will have Rs.75. So, J + M/3 = 75. That's our second equation.\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find J.\n\nLet me write them again for clarity:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) = 75\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) = 75\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute. Let me try solving equation 1 for M.\n\nFrom equation 1:\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow substitute this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\nJ + [(75 - (J/2)) / 3] = 75\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. Let's compute the numerator first. (75 - J/2) divided by 3 is equal to (75/3) - (J/2)/3, which is 25 - J/(6). So now the equation is:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) = 75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's subtract 25 from both sides:\n\nJ - (J/6) = 75 -25\nJ - (J/6) =50\n\nLet me combine the J terms. J is the same as 6J/6, so 6J/6 - J/6 =5J/6.\n\nSo, 5J/6 =50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nJ=60\n\nWait, so John has 60 rupees? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nLet me plug J=60 back into equation 1 to find M.\n\nM =75 - (60/2) =75 -30=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45 rupees, John has 60.\n\nNow, let's check both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his money (30) to Mark. Mark gets 45+30=75. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives one third of his money (45/3=15) to John. John gets 60+15=75. Correct.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, John has 60 rupees. Looking at the options, B is 60.\n\n\nLet \\( M \\) represent the amount of money Mark has, and \\( J \\) represent the amount John has. We are given two scenarios:\n\n1. If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75. This translates to:\n   \\[\n   M + \\frac{J}{2} = 75\n   \\]\n\n2. If Mark gives one third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75. This translates to:\n   \\[\n   J + \\frac{M}{3} = 75\n   \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\( M \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{75 - \\frac{J}{2}}{3} = 75\n\\]\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\\[\nJ + 25 - \\frac{J}{6} = 75\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{6} = 50\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( J \\):\n\\[\n5J = 300 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J = 60\n\\]\n\nTo verify, substitute \\( J = 60 \\) back into the first equation to find \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{60}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nCheck both scenarios:\n1. If John gives half his money (\\( 60/2 = 30 \\)) to Mark, Mark will have \\( 45 + 30 = 75 \\), which matches the first condition.\n2. If Mark gives one third of his money (\\( 45/3 = 15 \\)) to John, John will have \\( 60 + 15 = 75 \\), which matches the second condition.\n\nThus, John has Rs. 60.\n\n**Answer: B**",
