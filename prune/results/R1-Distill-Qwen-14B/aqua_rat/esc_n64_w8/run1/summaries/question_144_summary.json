      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. And the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A) 0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9.\n\nHmm, I remember that when events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Also, the formula for the probability of at least one of two events occurring is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Oh right, because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the overlap where both happen.\n\nSo let me write down what I know. P(A) is 0.6. Let's denote P(B) as x, which is what I'm trying to find. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B), which is 0.6 * x.\n\nThe formula for the probability that at least one occurs is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So substituting the values I have:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x).\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So yes, that's correct. Because P(A and B) is 0.6x. So the equation becomes 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x.\n\nLet me simplify that. 0.96 = 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6). Because x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides. 0.96 - 0.6 is 0.36. So 0.36 = 0.4x.\n\nThen, solving for x, I divide both sides by 0.4. 0.36 / 0.4 equals... let's see, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40. That's 0.9. Wait, no, wait. 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? No, wait, 40 times 0.9 is 36, yes. Oh wait, no, 40 times 0.9 is 36? Wait, 40 * 0.9 is 36. Yes, so 0.36 / 0.4 is 0.9.\n\nSo x is 0.9. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 0.9. But wait, that seems high because the combined probability is 0.96. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again. So P(A or B) is 0.96. P(A) is 0.6, P(B) is x. Since independent, P(A and B) is 0.6x.\n\nSo 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x.\n\nSimplify the right side: 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6) \u2192 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x \u2192 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x \u2192 0.36 = 0.4x \u2192 x = 0.36 / 0.4.\n\nWait, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me compute that. 0.4 is 4/10, so 0.36 is 36/100. Dividing 36/100 by 4/10 is the same as 36/100 * 10/4 = (36*10)/(100*4) \u2192 360 / 400 \u2192 which simplifies to 9/10, which is 0.9. So yes, x is 0.9.\n\nWait, but the options have E as 0.9. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Because if B has a 0.9 probability, then the probability that at least one occurs would be 0.96. Let me compute that to confirm.\n\nCompute P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9).\n\n0.6*0.9 is 0.54. So 0.6 + 0.9 is 1.5. Subtract 0.54 \u2192 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Which matches the given value.\n\nSo yes, that's correct. Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is option E.\n",

It's about at least one of them happening, which is P(A or B). \n\nOh right, the formula for the probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B). So putting that together, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer.

So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6x)\n\nSimplify the right side. 0.6 plus x minus 0.6x. Let's see, x is 1x, so 1x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nNow, I can subtract 0.6 from both sides to solve for x.\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4\nx = 0.9\n\nWait, that can't be right because if P(B) is 0.9, then when I plug it back into the original equation, let me check.\n\nP(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)\n= 1.5 - 0.54\n= 0.96.\n\nOh, right, that does add up.

Let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with P(A or B) = 0.96, which is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me factor out P(B):\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nYes, that's correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question says.\n\nThe question says that events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Also, the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9.\n\nHmm, I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). But wait, the question isn't directly asking about both A and B happening. It's about at least one of them happening, which is P(A or B). \n\nOh right, the formula for the probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B). So putting that together, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer. So,\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)\n\nWe know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A or B) is 0.96. Let me plug those values into the equation.\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nWait, let me simplify this equation. Let's denote P(B) as x for a moment. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6x)\n\nSimplify the right side. 0.6 plus x minus 0.6x. Let's see, x is 1x, so 1x - 0.6x is 0.4x. So,\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nNow, I can subtract 0.6 from both sides to solve for x.\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4\nx = 0.9\n\nWait, that can't be right because if P(B) is 0.9, then when I plug it back into the original equation, let me check.\n\nP(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9)\n= 1.5 - 0.54\n= 0.96.\n\nOh, right, that does add up. So P(B) is 0.9. Looking back at the options, E is 0.9, so that's the answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with P(A or B) = 0.96, which is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B).\n\nSo, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me factor out P(B):\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is option E.\n\n\nThe problem involves two independent events, A and B. The probability that event A occurs is given as \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\), and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\). The goal is to find \\( P(B) \\).\n\nFor independent events, the probability of both events occurring is \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) \\). The formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \\cdot P(B))\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( 0.4 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that event B occurs is \\( P(B) = 0.9 \\).

Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem states that events A and B are independent. I remember that independent events mean the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Got it.\n\nWe're given that the probability of event A occurring is 0.6. So, P(A) = 0.6. The other piece of information is that the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. So, P(A or B) = 0.96.\n\nWait, what's the formula for the probability of at least one event happening when dealing with two events? Oh right, for two events, it's P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Because if you just add them, you're double-counting the overlap where both happen, so you subtract that.\n\nSince A and B are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B). So substituting that in, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B).\n\nSo, plugging in the known values, we have 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).\n\nLet me write that out: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 P(B). Hmm, okay, let me simplify that equation.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms with P(B). So, P(B) minus 0.6 P(B) is 0.4 P(B). So the equation becomes 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B).\n\nNow, I'll subtract 0.6 from both sides to isolate the term with P(B). That gives 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B). Let me calculate that: 0.96 minus 0.6 is 0.36. So, 0.36 = 0.4 P(B).\n\nTo find P(B), I need to divide both sides by 0.4. So, 0.36 / 0.4 equals P(B). Let me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 9/10, which is 0.9. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, 0.9 is option E, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me double-check my steps. So, the equation was 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B). So, subtracting 0.6 gives 0.36 = 0.4 P(B). Then P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9. So that would mean P(B) is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nBut wait a minute, if P(B) is 0.9, then let's think about the probability of at least one event occurring. So, P(A or B) would be P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9). Let's compute that: 0.6 + 0.9 is 1.5, and 0.6 * 0.9 is 0.54. So 1.5 - 0.54 is 0.96. Oh, that's correct because the given probability is 0.96. So that seems right.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have E as 0.9, let me check the options again. Oh, the options are:\n\nA)0.5\nB)0.6\nC)0.7\nD)0.8\nE)0.9\n\nYes, E is 0.9. So the answer would be E. Hmm, but I thought sometimes probabilities can't be that high, but in this case, the calculation adds up. So maybe E is correct.\n\nWait another thought: if both A and B have high probabilities, it's possible that their union is 0.96. Because 0.6 and 0.9 are both high, so their union is high. So, yeah, the calculation seems correct.\n",

So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 P(B)\n\nNow I'll subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4 P(B)\n0.36 = 0.4 P(B)\n\nTo find P(B), divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nLet me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which is 0.9? Wait no, 36/40 is 0.9, but wait, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is actually 0.9 because 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36. So P(B) is 0.9? But wait, looking at the options, E is 0.9. But let me double-check my steps because that seems a bit high.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\n0.36 divided by 0.4. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, right? Yes, because 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36. So yes, P(B) is 0.9.\n\nWait, but the options include E) 0.9, so that would be the answer. But wait, let me think again. Did I apply the formula correctly?\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think about the probability of at least one occurring. So P(A \u222a B) = 1 - P(neither A nor B occurs). Because the probability that neither happens is 1 - P(A \u222a B). So:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 1 - [P(not A) * P(not B)] because A and B are independent, so their complements are independent too.\n\nSo, 0.96 = 1 - [ (1 - 0.6) * (1 - P(B)) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 * (1 - P(B)) )\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-0.04 = -0.4 * (1 - P(B))\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.04 = 0.4 * (1 - P(B))\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n0.04 / 0.4 = 1 - P(B)\n0.1 = 1 - P(B)\n\nSo, P(B) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. Same result. So yes, the probability is 0.9.\n\nLooking back at the options, E is 0.9. So the correct answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think if I can have a probability higher than 0.9. Suppose P(B) is 0.9, then the probability of at least one occurring is 0.96. Let's compute it:\n\nP(A or B) = 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6 * 0.9) = 0.6 + 0.9 = 1.5, minus 0.54, which is 0.96. Yes, that matches. So the calculation is correct.\n\n\nThe events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent. The probability of \\( A \\) occurring is \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\), and the probability of at least one of the events \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) occurring is \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\). We are tasked with finding \\( P(B) \\).\n\nThe formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\) and \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \\cdot P(B))\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4P(B)\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( 0.4 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(B) = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we can use an alternative approach. The probability of at least one event occurring can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 1 - P(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are independent, \\( P(\\text{neither } A \\text{ nor } B) = P(\\neg A) \\cdot P(\\neg B) \\). Substituting \\( P(A) = 0.6 \\), we have \\( P(\\neg A) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 \\). Let \\( P(B) = x \\), so \\( P(\\neg B) = 1 - x \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = 1 - (0.4 \\cdot (1 - x))\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.96 \\):\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 1 - (0.4 \\cdot (1 - x))\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 0.6 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( 0.4 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( P(B) = 0.9 \\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x\n\nSimplify the right-hand side. 0.6 + x*(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nNow, solve for x. Divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nHmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, because 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36. So x is 0.9.\n\nWait, that would mean P(B) is 0.9. Let me check the options. Option E is 0.9. So is that the correct answer?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x\n\nWhich is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSubtract 0.6: 0.36 = 0.4x.\n\nDivide by 0.4: x = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the probability of B is 0.9. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If B has a probability of 0.9, which is higher than A's 0.6, that makes sense because the probability that at least one occurs is 0.96, which is quite high. So if B is 0.9, then even without A, B has a high chance. But when combined, their probabilities cover almost everything except 0.04.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it another way. Let's think about the complement. The probability that neither A nor B occurs is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04.\n\nSince A and B are independent, the probability that both do not occur is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - 0.6) * (1 - x) = 0.4 * (1 - x) = 0.04\n\nSo,\n\n0.4*(1 - x) = 0.04\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n1 - x = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1\n\nSo,\n\nx = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nSame result. So that confirms it. So the probability of B is 0.9, which is option E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it carefully. The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6. And the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are A to E, with E being 0.9. \n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of events and their intersections, especially with independent events, there are some formulas I can use. Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nWait, the problem says the probability that at least one of A or B occurs is 0.96. I think the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Oh right, because when you add P(A) and P(B), you're counting the overlap twice, so you subtract it once.\n\nSince A and B are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)\n\nWe know P(A \u222a B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6.

So:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x\n\nSimplify the right-hand side. 0.6 + x*(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nNow, solve for x. Divide both sides by 0.4.\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nHmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, because 0.4 * 0.9 = 0.36. So x is 0.9.\n\nWait, that would mean P(B) is 0.9.
