Hmm, I remember something about this being a classic problem, maybe related to the Fibonacci sequence?\n\nWait, right! Because for each step, the boy can come from either the step before it (taking one step) or the step two before it (taking two steps). So the number of ways to get to step n is the sum of the ways to get to step n-1 and step n-2. That sounds exactly like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo, let's think about how to model this. For n steps, the number of ways is equal to the (n+1)th Fibonacci number, if I'm not mistaken. Or maybe it's the nth Fibonacci number? I might be mixing the starting points here.\n\nLet me think of small cases to get the pattern right. \n\nFor n=1 step, he can only take one step.

I think this is a classic problem that involves the Fibonacci sequence. Because each step can be reached either by taking a single step from the previous step or a double step from two steps before. So the number of ways to get to step n is the sum of the ways to get to step n-1 and step n-2.\n\nLet me think again. For example, for n=1, there's only one way: take a single step. For n=2, he can take two single steps or one double step, so that's two ways. For n=3, he can get there by going to step 2 and then taking a single step, or going to step 1 and then taking a double step. So the number of ways for n=3 is 2 +1=3. Wait, wait, no, that's n=3, which would be the sum of n=2 (2 ways) and n=1 (1 way), which is 3. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the pattern is that the number of ways for each step is the sum of the two previous steps. So the sequence would go like this:\n\nn=1: 1\nn=2: 2\nn=3: 3\nn=4: 5\nn=5: 8\nn=6: 13\nn=7: 21\nn=8: 34\nn=9: 55\nn=10: 89\n\nWait, let me count them step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from n=1 to n=10:\n\nn1: 1 way\nn2: 2 ways (1+1 or 2)\nn3: n2 +n1 = 2+1=3\nn4: n3 +n2 =3+2=5\nn5: 5+3=8\nn6: 8+5=13\nn7:13+8=21\nn8:21+13=34\nn9:34+21=55\nn10:55+34=89.\n\nSo for n=10, the number of ways is 89.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, f(2) was 2, which would be f(1)+f(0)=1+1=2. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to model this is using dynamic programming. Let me see:\n\nLet's compute f(0) = 1 (base case, no steps needed)\nf(1) = f(0) = 1\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1=2\nf(3)=f(2)+f(1)=2+1=3\nf(4)=3+2=5\nf(5)=5+3=8\nf(6)=8+5=13\nf(7)=13+8=21\nf(8)=21+13=34\nf(9)=34+21=55\nf(10)=55+34=89.\n\nYes, so f(10)=89.

Looking at the options, option B is 89. So the answer should be B)89.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount from n=0 to n=10.\n\nn=0: 1\nn=1: 1\nn=2: 1+1=2\nn=3: 2+1=3\nn=4: 3+2=5\nn=5: 5+3=8\nn=6: 8+5=13\nn=7: 13+8=21\nn=8: 21+13=34\nn=9: 34+21=55\nn=10:55+34=89\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So 89 is the number of ways for 10 steps. So the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of ways a boy can climb a 10-step staircase, taking either one or two steps at a time. This is a classic combinatorics problem that can be solved using the Fibonacci sequence. The number of ways to reach step \\( n \\), denoted as \\( f(n) \\), follows the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)\n\\]\n\nwith base cases:\n\\[\nf(0) = 1 \\quad \\text{(1 way to stay at the base)}\n\\]\n\\[\nf(1) = 1 \\quad \\text{(1 way to climb 1 step)}.\n\\]\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, the number of ways to climb each step up to \\( n = 10 \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2) &= f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, \\\\\nf(3) &= f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3, \\\\\nf(4) &= f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5, \\\\\nf(5) &= f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8, \\\\\nf(6) &= f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13, \\\\\nf(7) &= f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21, \\\\\nf(8) &= f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34, \\\\\nf(9) &= f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55, \\\\\nf(10) &= f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to reach the top of the 10-step staircase is 89. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

The question is asking how many different ways he can reach the top. The options are A)88, B)89, C)90, D)91, E)92.\n\nHmm, I remember this is a classic problem. It's something to do with combinations and maybe recursion. Let me think about smaller steps first to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's start with a simple case. If there's just 1 step, he can only take one step. So the number of ways is 1. For 2 steps, he can take two single steps or one double step. That's 2 ways. \n\nWait, wait. No, wait a second. For 2 steps, if he takes one double step, that's one way, and two single steps, that's another. So total 2 ways. So 2 steps: 2 ways.\n\nWhat about 3 steps? Let's see. He can take a single step first, then from step 1, he has the number of ways to reach step 3. Or he can take a double step first, then from step 2, he has the ways to reach step 3. So the number of ways for 3 steps would be the sum of ways for 1 step and ways for 2 steps. Which is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWait, that makes sense because for 3 steps, the possible step sequences are:\n1. 1+1+1\n2. 1+2\n3. 2+1\n\nSo yes, 3 ways. Okay, so I'm seeing a pattern here. It looks like the number of ways for each step is the sum of the ways for the previous step and the one before that.\n\nWait, that's the Fibonacci sequence! Because each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. So for n steps, the number of ways is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number or something like that.\n\nWait, let me think again. For n=1, ways=1. For n=2, ways=2. For n=3, ways=3. Let me check n=4. The ways would be ways(3) + ways(2) = 3+2=5. Let's list them:\n\n1. 1+1+1+1\n2. 1+1+2\n3. 1+2+1\n4. 2+1+1\n5. 2+2\n\nYes, 5 ways. So the pattern is indeed Fibonacci.\n\nSo the formula for the number of ways is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number? Or maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me think about how the Fibonacci sequence is defined.\n\nThe standard Fibonacci sequence starts with F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. So for n steps, the number of ways is F(n+1).\n\nWait, let's test that. For n=1: F(2) is 1. Correct. For n=2: F(3) is 2. Correct. For n=3: F(4)=3. Correct. For n=4: F(5)=5. Correct.\n\nSo yeah, the formula is F(n+1), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0)=0, F(1)=1.\n\nSo for n=10 steps, the number of ways is F(11). Let's compute the Fibonacci numbers up to F(11).\n\nLet me list them:\n\nF(0) = 0\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = F(0)+F(1) = 0+1=1\n\nF(3) = F(1)+F(2)=1+1=2\n\nF(4)= F(2)+F(3)=1+2=3\n\nF(5)=F(3)+F(4)=2+3=5\n\nF(6)=3+5=8\n\nF(7)=5+8=13\n\nF(8)=8+13=21\n\nF(9)=13+21=34\n\nF(10)=21+34=55\n\nF(11)=34+55=89\n\nSo F(11) is 89.
