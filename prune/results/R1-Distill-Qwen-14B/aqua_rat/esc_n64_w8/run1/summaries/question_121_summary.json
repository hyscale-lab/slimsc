      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThere are 64 boys and 40 girls in a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is asking how many members are in the group now. The options are A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168. Wait, I notice that option A and D are both 277. That might be a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls. Let's call the number of boys and girls that joined the group 'x'. So, after the drive, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls after the drive is 4:3. Ratios can be tricky, but I think I can set up an equation for that. So, (boys)/(girls) = 4/3.\n\nSo, (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nHmm, cross-multiplying to solve for x. Let's do that.\n\nMultiply both sides by (40 + x) and 3 to eliminate the denominator.\n\n3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x)\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nLeft side: 3*64 is 192, plus 3x.\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, plus 4x.\n\nSo, 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nWait, let me subtract 160 from both sides. 192-160=32. So, 32 +3x =4x.\n\nThen subtract 3x from both sides: 32 = x.\n\nSo x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nSo now, the number of boys is 64 +32 =96. Girls are 40 +32=72.\n\nNow, total members are 96 +72 = 168. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 168. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ratio. Because sometimes the order can matter. Oh wait, the ratio is boys to girls as 4:3. So yes, (64 +x)/(40 +x) =4/3 is correct.\n\nSo cross-multiplying gives 3*(64 +x) =4*(40 +x). Let me compute that again.\n\n3*64 = 192, 3*x=3x. So 192 +3x = 160 +4x.\n\nSubtract 160: 32 +3x=4x.\n\nSubtract 3x: 32 =x.\n\nSo yes, x is 32.\n\nSo boys now:64+32=96.\n\nGirls:40+32=72.\n\nTotal members:96+72=168.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but the options have A and D as 277, which is the same number. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the ratio is 4:3 of the entire group, not just boys to girls. No, the question says ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so that's the same as I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of members after the addition and express it in terms of the ratio. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the number of boys as 4k and girls as 3k, where k is a common multiplier. But wait, that's after the drive.\n\nSo, 4k = 64 +x, and 3k=40 +x.\n\nHmm, that's a different way to set up the equations. Let me write them:\n\n4k =64 +x   ...(1)\n\n3k=40 +x    ...(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from (1):\n\n4k -3k = (64 +x) - (40 +x) \u2192 k = 24.\n\nSo, substituting back into equation (2):\n\n3*24 =40 +x \u219272=40 +x \u2192x=32.\n\nSame result. So, x is 32. Then boys are 4k=4*24=96, girls 3k=72. Total 168. So the same answer as before.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E)168.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a group of boys and girls that changes after some new members join. Hmm. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nAlright, so initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Now, after that, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. We need to find out the total number of members in the group now.

Hmm, perhaps a mistake in the options, but maybe I'll proceed.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let me denote the number of boys and girls that joined as x. So, the same number of boys and girls joined. So, the new number of boys is 64 + x, and the new number of girls is 40 + x.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls after the addition is 4:3. So, (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3. Let me write that as an equation.\n\nSo, (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me compute both sides. On the left: 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. So left side is 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So right side is 160 +4x.\n\nSo the equation is 192 + 3x = 160 +4x.\n\nHmm, let me rearrange terms. Subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x.\n\nWait, 192 minus 160 is 32, so 32 = x.\n\nSo x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new total number of members. The original group had 64 +40 =104 people. Adding 32 boys and 32 girls adds 64 people. So 104 +64= 168. So the total is 168.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 168. But wait, let me double-check.

Correct.\n\nSo the total is 96+72=168, which is option E.\n\nWait, but the options have E as 168, which is correct.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about a group of boys and girls, and some people joining, then figuring out the total number of members now based on a given ratio. Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlright, the initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. So, let's say x boys and x girls joined. So, the new numbers would be 64 + x boys and 40 + x girls.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3. So, I can set up a ratio equation. The ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me compute both sides. 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. On the other side, 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange terms. Subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 32 = x. So, x is 32.\n\nWait, so 32 boys and 32 girls joined. So the new numbers are 64 + 32 = 96 boys, and 40 +32=72 girls.\n\nNow, the total number of members is 96 +72.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about a group of boys and girls, and some people joining, then figuring out the total number of members now based on a given ratio. Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlright, the initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls. Then, during their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. So, let's say x boys and x girls joined. So, the new numbers would be 64 + x boys and 40 + x girls.\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3. So, I can set up a ratio equation. The ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation: (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply. So, 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x).\n\nLet me compute both sides. 3*64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. On the other side, 4*40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So, the equation becomes 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange terms. Subtract 3x from both sides: 192 = 160 + x. Then subtract 160 from both sides: 32 = x. So, x is 32.\n\nWait, so 32 boys and 32 girls joined. So the new numbers are 64 + 32 = 96 boys, and 40 +32=72 girls.\n\nNow, the total number of members is 96 +72. Let me add that up. 96 +70 is 166, plus 2 is 168. So total is 168.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake. So the initial boys are 64, girls 40.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: There's a group of social workers with 64 boys and 40 girls. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members does the group have now? The options are A) 277, B) 288, C) 200, D) 277 again, and E) 168.\n\nHmm, okay. So initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Then, some boys and girls join, but the number added from each group is the same. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined as 'x'. So after the addition, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls after this addition is 4:3. So I can set up an equation based on ratios. The ratio of (64 + x) to (40 + x) is 4 to 3. So the equation would be:\n\n(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply. That gives 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3 * 64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. So 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4 *40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So 160 +4x.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x\n\nNow, I'll subtract 3x from both sides to get:\n\n192 = 160 + x\n\nThen subtract 160 from both sides:\n\n192 -160 = x \u2192 32 = x\n\nSo x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nNow, let's calculate the current numbers. Boys: 64 +32 =96. Girls:40 +32=72.\n\nTotal members now are 96 +72 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option E is 168. But wait, the options have D) 277 again. Hmm, did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, let me double-check the math. Maybe I missed a step.\n\nSo, initial boys:64, initial girls:40.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: There's a group of social workers with 64 boys and 40 girls. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Now, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. The question is, how many members does the group have now? The options are A) 277, B) 288, C) 200, D) 277 again, and E) 168.\n\nHmm, okay. So initially, there are 64 boys and 40 girls. Then, some boys and girls join, but the number added from each group is the same. Let's denote the number of boys and girls that joined as 'x'. So after the addition, the number of boys becomes 64 + x, and the number of girls becomes 40 + x.\n\nNow, the ratio of boys to girls after this addition is 4:3. So I can set up an equation based on ratios. The ratio of (64 + x) to (40 + x) is 4 to 3. So the equation would be:\n\n(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply. That gives 3*(64 + x) = 4*(40 + x). Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 3 * 64 is 192, and 3*x is 3x. So 192 + 3x.\n\nRight side: 4 *40 is 160, and 4*x is 4x. So 160 +4x.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x\n\nNow, I'll subtract 3x from both sides to get:\n\n192 = 160 + x\n\nThen subtract 160 from both sides:\n\n192 -160 = x \u2192 32 = x\n\nSo x is 32. That means 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.\n\nNow, let's calculate the current numbers. Boys: 64 +32 =96. Girls:40 +32=72.\n\nTotal members now are 96 +72 = 168.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option E is 168. But wait, the options have D) 277 again. Hmm, did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, let me double-check the math. Maybe I missed a step.\n\nSo, initial boys:64, initial girls:40. Added x boys and x girls.\n\nRatio (64+x)/(40+x) =4/3.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*(64 +x) =4*(40 +x)\n\n3*64=192, 3x=3x. 4*40=160, 4x=4x.\n\nSo 192 +3x =160 +4x \u2192 subtract 3x from both sides:192=160 +x \u2192 x=32.\n\nYes, that's correct. So boys now are 64+32=96, girls 40+32=72. Total 96+72=168. So option E is 168.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, A and D are 277. Did I miscalculate the total?\n\nWait, 96 +72 is 168. So why is the option E 168. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me think again.\n\nThe ratio is boys to girls as 4:3. So 4 parts boys and 3 parts girls. So 4 parts correspond to 96 boys, 3 parts to 72 girls. Let me check if 96/72 is indeed 4/3.\n\nDividing 96 by 72: 96 \u00f772 = 4/3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number is 168. So the correct option is E.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, I see that option E is 168, which is what I calculated. So why are options A and D the same?
