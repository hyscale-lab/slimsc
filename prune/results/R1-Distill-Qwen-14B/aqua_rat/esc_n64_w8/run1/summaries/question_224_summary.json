      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts on tyres, and I need to figure out the total discount when a retailer adds another 20% off after the manufacturer's discount. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nWait, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount. So, if a tyre originally costs, say, $100, the manufacturer's discount would take it down by 20%. That means the price after manufacturer's discount is 80% of the original. So 100 * 0.8 = $80.\n\nNow, the retailer is offering an additional 20% discount on that already discounted price. Oh wait, so it's 20% off the new price of $80, not the original $100. So I need to calculate 20% of $80 and subtract that. Let's see, 20% of 80 is 16. So the new price is 80 - 16 = $64.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total discount available. So the original price was $100, and now it's $64. So the total discount is 100 - 64 = $36. So the discount is 36% of the original price. So the total discount available is 36%, right?\n\nWait a second, but sometimes when you have two discounts, you can't just add the percentages because the second discount is applied to the reduced price. So 20% then another 20% isn't 40%, it's less. Oh wait, no, the question isn't asking for the combined rate, but the total discount in terms of the original price. So in this case, 36% off the original.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 36%. So the answer should be E. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me do the math again. \n\nOriginal price: $100.\n\nAfter manufacturer's 20% discount: 100 * 0.8 = 80.\n\nRetailer's 20% off: 80 * 0.2 = 16. So subtract that from 80, giving 64.\n\nTotal paid is 64, so discount is 36. 36/100 = 36%. Yep, that's correct. So the total discount is 36%.\n",

Hmm, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and the retailer is adding another 20% off. I need to find the total discount available.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you apply two successive discounts, you can't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied on the already discounted price. So it's not as simple as 20% + 20% = 40%. That's a common mistake, I think.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. The manufacturer gives a 20% discount first. So 20% of 100 is 20, making the new price $80.\n\nNow, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. But wait, this 20% is on the already discounted price of $80, not the original $100. So 20% of 80 is 16. Subtracting that from $80 gives $64.\n\nSo the final price is $64. What's the total discount from the original? The original was $100, so the discount is 100 - 64 = $36. So that's a 36% discount overall. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total discount available. So the options are A)10, B)25, C)28, D)30, E)36. So the correct answer should be E)36%.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate it algebraically to make sure. Let's let P be the original price. After a 20% discount from the manufacturer, the price becomes P*(1 - 0.20) = 0.80P.\n\nThen the retailer applies another 20% discount. So that's 0.80P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P * 0.80 = 0.64P.\n\nSo the final price is 64% of the original. Which means the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. Yep, that matches my earlier example.\n\nSo the answer should be E)36%. Looking back at the options, E is 36, so that's the correct choice.\n",

After the manufacturer's 20% discount, the price becomes $80 (80% of $100).\n2. The retailer's additional 20% discount is applied to the $80, reducing it by $16 (20% of $80), resulting in a final price of $64.\n3. The total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36, which is 36% of the original price.\n\nAlgebraically, if the original price is \\( P \\), after the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes \\( 0.80P \\). The retailer's discount further reduces it to \\( 0.80P \\times 0.80 = 0.64P \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this question about discounts on tyres. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount, and the retailer is adding another 20% off. I need to find the total discount available.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you apply two successive discounts, you can't just add them up. Because the second discount is applied on the already discounted price. So it's not as simple as 20% + 20% = 40%. That's a common mistake, I think.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. The manufacturer gives a 20% discount first. So 20% of 100 is 20, making the new price $80.\n\nNow, the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. But wait, this 20% is on the already discounted price of $80, not the original $100. So 20% of 80 is 16. Subtracting that from $80 gives $64.\n\nSo the final price is $64. What's the total discount from the original? The original was $100, so the discount is 100 - 64 = $36. So that's a 36% discount overall. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the total discount available. So the options are A)10, B)25, C)28, D)30, E)36. So the correct answer should be E)36%.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate it algebraically to make sure. Let's let P be the original price. After a 20% discount from the manufacturer, the price becomes P*(1 - 0.20) = 0.80P.\n\nThen the retailer applies another 20% discount. So that's 0.80P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P * 0.80 = 0.64P.\n\nSo the final price is 64% of the original. Which means the total discount is 100% - 64% = 36%. Yep, that matches my earlier example.\n\nSo the answer should be E)36%. Looking back at the options, E is 36, so that's the correct choice.\n\n\nThe manufacturer offers a 20% discount, reducing the price to 80% of the original. The retailer then applies an additional 20% discount, which is calculated on the already discounted price. To determine the total discount, we can use the example of an original price of $100:\n\n1. After the manufacturer's 20% discount, the price becomes $80 (80% of $100).\n2. The retailer's additional 20% discount is applied to the $80, reducing it by $16 (20% of $80), resulting in a final price of $64.\n3. The total discount from the original price is $100 - $64 = $36, which is 36% of the original price.\n\nAlgebraically, if the original price is \\( P \\), after the manufacturer's discount, the price becomes \\( 0.80P \\). The retailer's discount further reduces it to \\( 0.80P \\times 0.80 = 0.64P \\). The final price is 64% of the original, meaning the total discount is \\( 100\\% - 64\\% = 36\\% \\).\n\nThus, the total discount available at the retailer is **36%**.\n\nAnswer: E",
