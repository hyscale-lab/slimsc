And now, Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. I need to find out how old Ajay is today.\n\nWait, let me break it down. First, let's think about Sachin's current age. The problem says that in 10 years, he'll be 40. So if I subtract 10 years from 40, that's his current age. Oh right, because 10 years from now, he's 40, so now he's 30. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 40 in 10 years means he's 30 now. Because 30 + 10 is 40. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow, 10 years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. Let me calculate their ages 10 years ago. So Sachin's age then was 30 - 10 = 20 years old.\n\nAt that time, Ajay's age was half of Sachin's age. Because Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So Ajay was 20 / 2 = 10 years old, 10 years ago.\n\nWait, so if Ajay was 10 ten years ago, then today he is 10 + 10 = 20 years old. So Ajay is 20 now. Let me check the options. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. So D is 20.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me go through it again. Sachin's future age is 40 in 10 years, so he's 30 now. 10 years ago, he was 20. Ajay was half that age, so 10. So Ajay is 20 now. Yeah, that seems correct. So the answer should be D.\n",

So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would have been S - 10, and Ajay's would have been A - 10. According to the problem, S - 10 equals twice (A - 10).

So Sachin's age back then (20) equals two times Ajay's age back then (A-10).\n\nSo the equation would be:\n20 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nHmm, let me solve this equation for A. \n\nFirst, expand the right side: 2*(A-10) is 2A minus 20. So the equation becomes:\n20 = 2A - 20\n\nNow, I'll add 20 to both sides to get rid of the -20 on the right:\n20 + 20 = 2A\n40 = 2A\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 to solve for A:\n40 / 2 = A\n20 = A\n\nWait, so Ajay is 20 years old today? That's one of the options. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSachin's current age: 30. Ten years ago, 20. Ajay's current age: 20. Ten years ago, Ajay was 10. So Sachin was twice Ajay's age then because 20 is twice of 10. That checks out.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 20. So the answer should be D.\n\n\nSachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so his current age is \\( 40 - 10 = 30 \\). Ten years ago, Sachin was \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\) years old. Let Ajay's current age be \\( A \\). Ten years ago, Ajay was \\( A - 10 \\) years old. According to the problem, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay ten years ago, so:\n\n\\[\n20 = 2(A - 10)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and solving for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\n20 = 2A - 20 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 40 = 2A \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, Ajay is 20 years old today. The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
