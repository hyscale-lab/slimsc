Oh right, for a rectangle, you can calculate it by adding up all the sides.\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. Wait, rectangles have two lengths and two widths. So each pair of opposite sides are equal. That means the perimeter should be 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.\n\nLet me write that down. Perimeter = 2*(length + width). Oh, wait no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh yeah, no, wait, no, actually, perimeter is 2*(length + width).

So the formula should be something like 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Or wait, maybe it's 2*(length + width). Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nThe problem says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. So plugging those numbers into the formula. Let me think: 2*(8 + 3). Wait, 8 plus 3 is 11. Then multiply by 2 gives 22. So the perimeter should be 22 centimeters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22cm. That must be the correct answer. Oh wait, but let me double-check in case I mixed up the formula. Alternatively, I could add all four sides. So two lengths and two widths. So 8 + 8 is 16, and 3 +3 is 6. 16 plus 6 equals 22. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that B is the right choice.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangle. Hmm, let's see. The question says the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. I need to find the perimeter. Alright, I remember that the perimeter of a shape is the total distance around it. For a rectangle, I think the formula is something like adding up all the sides.\n\nWait, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. Oh right, so the opposite sides are equal. So if the length is 8 cm, then the other length must also be 8 cm. And the width is 3 cm, so the other width is 3 cm too. So the perimeter is the sum of all four sides.\n\nLet me think, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. Oh yeah, I remember it's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So the formula is P = 2(L + W). Alternatively, it can be written as P = 2L + 2W. Either way, it's the same result.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers. Length is 8, width is 3. Let's calculate 2 times (8 plus 3). Wait, 8 plus 3 is 11. Then 2 times 11 is 22. So the perimeter should be 22 centimeters.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 22 cm. So that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my math. 8 cm length, 3 cm width. Each pair contributes 8 and 3. So two lengths would be 16 cm, and two widths would be 6 cm. Adding 16 plus 6 gives 22 cm. Yep, that's right.
