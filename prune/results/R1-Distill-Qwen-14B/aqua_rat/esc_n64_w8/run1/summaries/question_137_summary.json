      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought up. Let's see what the question says again.\n\nThe diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she made $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought.\n\nHmm, right. So, the total money she got is $3.40, which is 340 cents. Because dealing with cents might make the calculations easier, I'll convert that right away.\n\nLet me define variables for the number of copper and brass coins. Let\u2019s say:\n\nLet c = number of copper coins\nLet b = number of brass coins\n\nSo, the total amount she earned would be 20c + 25b cents. And this equals 340 cents.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nI need to find possible integer values of c and b that satisfy this equation, and among those, find the smallest possible c (since the question is about the minimum number of copper coins).\n\nBut wait, I should remember that both c and b must be non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins.\n\nSo, to solve this, maybe I can express the equation in terms of one variable and see what possible solutions exist.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n20c = 340 - 25b\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nc = (340 - 25b) / 20\n\nSimplify that:\n\nc = (340/20) - (25b)/20\nc = 17 - (5b)/4\n\nWait, but c must be an integer. So (5b)/4 must also be an integer because 17 minus an integer gives an integer.\n\nSo, 5b must be divisible by 4. Let me think about that. 5 and 4 are coprime, so b must be a multiple of 4. Because 5b mod4 must be 0. So 5b \u2261 0 mod4 \u2192 since 5 \u22611 mod4, this implies b \u22610 mod4. So b is a multiple of 4.\n\nSo possible values of b are 0,4,8,... but considering the maximum possible coins she could have, let's think about the maximum possible b.\n\nThe maximum b would be when c is as small as possible, but let's see.\n\nEach b contributes 25 cents. So, 340 /25 is 13.6. So maximum possible b is 13, but since b must be a multiple of 4, the possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nWait, 12 is 12*25=300, which is less than 340, so possible. Let me list all possible b values:\n\nb=0 \u2192 c=(340-0)/20=17 \u2192 c=17\nb=4 \u2192 25*4=100 \u2192 340-100=240 \u2192 240/20=12 \u2192 c=12\nb=8 \u2192 25*8=200 \u2192 340-200=140 \u2192140/20=7 \u2192c=7\nb=12 \u219225*12=300 \u2192340-300=40 \u219240/20=2 \u2192c=2\nb=16 \u219225*16=400 \u2192 which is more than 340, so 340-400 negative \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the possible (c, b) pairs are:\n\n(17,0), (12,4), (7,8), (2,12)\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check each:\n\nWhen b=0: 20c=340 \u2192 c=17, which is valid.\n\nb=4: 25*4=100. 340-100=240. 240/20=12. Correct.\n\nb=8: 25*8=200. 340-200=140 \u2192140/20=7. Correct.\n\nb=12: 25*12=300. 340-300=40 \u219240/20=2. Correct.\n\nSo the possible c values are 17,12,7,2. So the smallest c in these is 2. But wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest possible c is 2? But wait, let me check if there are any other possible b's that are multiples of 4 beyond 12. Wait, no, because 16 is 400, which is more than 340, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. What if b is a negative number? Oh, no, because the number of coins can't be negative. So b can't be less than zero.\n\nSo from the possible c values, the smallest is 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. Looking at the options, option C is 2.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because sometimes in these problems, you might have overlooked something.\n\nWait, another approach: the equation 20c +25b =340 can be simplified by dividing both sides by 5.\n\nSo 4c +5b =68.\n\nNow, this equation: 4c +5b =68.\n\nWe can rearrange this as 4c =68 -5b \u2192 c=(68 -5b)/4.\n\nSince c must be an integer, (68 -5b) must be divisible by 4.\n\nSo 68 mod4 is 0, because 68=17*4. So 68-5b must be divisible by 4.\n\nWhich means 5b mod4 must equal 0. Because 68 mod4 is 0, so 0 -5b mod4 = 0 \u2192 5b mod4 =0.\n\nBut 5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 is same as (1*b) mod4. So 5b mod4 = b mod4. So for 5b mod4 to be 0, b mod4 must be 0.\n\nSo again, same conclusion: b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nWhich brings us back to the same possible b values: 0,4,8,12.\n\nSo the c values are 17,12,7,2.\n\nSo the minimum c is 2. So the answer should be option C.\n\nWait, but the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the minimum is 2, which is option C. So that's the answer.\n",

The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she brought up, given that she earned $3.40 after one dive. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, so the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. So, let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. The total amount she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. So, the equation would be 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find the minimum number of copper coins, 'c'. So, I'm looking for the smallest possible value of 'c' such that 'b' is a non-negative integer (since you can't have negative coins). \n\nLet me rearrange the equation to express 'b' in terms of 'c'. So, 25b = 340 - 20c. Dividing both sides by 5, I get 5b = 68 - 4c. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of modular arithmetic here to find possible values of 'c'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to express it as 20c + 25b = 340. Let me factor this equation a bit. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5, so divide the entire equation by 5: 4c + 5b = 68. Now, the equation is simpler: 4c +5b =68.\n\nI need to find integer solutions (c and b are non-negative integers) to this equation. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b: 5b = 68 -4c \u2192 b = (68 -4c)/5. Since 'b' must be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, 68 -4c \u2261 0 mod5. Let's compute 68 mod5. 5*13=65, so 68-65=3 \u2192 68 \u22613 mod5. So, 3 -4c \u22610 mod5 \u2192 -4c \u2261-3 mod5 \u2192 4c \u22613 mod5. \n\nHmm, I need to find c such that 4c \u22613 mod5. Let's find the modular inverse of 4 mod5. 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so inverse is 4. Multiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c\u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5. So possible c values are 2,7,12,... but since c must be as small as possible, and we can't have c larger than a certain point because 4c can't exceed 68.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because 4c +5b=68, so 4c \u226468 \u2192 c \u226417. So the possible c values that satisfy c \u22612 mod5 are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo let's check each of these to find the minimal c. The minimal possible c is 2, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf c=2, then 4*2=8. So 5b=68-8=60 \u2192 b=12. That's a valid solution. So she could have 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins, giving her 2*20 +12*25=40 +300=340 cents, which is $3.40. So c=2 is possible.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So is there a possibility of having a smaller c? Let me think, because perhaps I made a mistake in my modular approach.\n\nWait, when I did the modular part, I concluded that c must be \u22612 mod5, meaning the possible c's are 2,7,12,17. So the smallest c in this set is 2. So the minimal c is 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about it differently. Maybe trying possible c values starting from 0 upwards and see if 340-20c is divisible by 25.\n\nSo c=0: 340-0=340. 340/25=13.6 \u2192 not integer. So c can't be 0.\n\nc=1: 340-20=320. 320/25=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=2: 340-40=300 \u2192 300/25=12 \u2192 integer. So yes, c=2 is possible.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the correct answer would be C)2.\n\nWait, but the options include E)0, so why is that not possible? Because when c=0, 340/25=13.6 which is not an integer, so it's impossible. So yes, the minimal c is 2.\n",

Let's find the modular inverse of 4 mod5. 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so inverse is 4. Multiply both sides by 4: c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c\u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5. So possible c values are 2,7,12,... but since c must be as small as possible, and we can't have c larger than a certain point because 4c can't exceed 68.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because 4c +5b=68, so 4c \u226468 \u2192 c \u226417. So the possible c values that satisfy c \u22612 mod5 are 2,7,12,17.\n\nSo let's check each of these to find the minimal c. The minimal possible c is 2, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nIf c=2, then 4*2=8. So 5b=68-8=60 \u2192 b=12. That's a valid solution. So she could have 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins, giving her 2*20 +12*25=40 +300=340 cents, which is $3.40. So c=2 is possible.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So is there a possibility of having a smaller c? Let me think, because perhaps I made a mistake in my modular approach.\n\nWait, when I did the modular part, I concluded that c must be \u22612 mod5, meaning the possible c's are 2,7,12,17. So the smallest c in this set is 2. So the minimal c is 2, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about it differently. Maybe trying possible c values starting from 0 upwards and see if 340-20c is divisible by 25.\n\nSo c=0: 340-0=340. 340/25=13.6 \u2192 not integer. So c can't be 0.\n\nc=1: 340-20=320. 320/25=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=2: 340-40=300 \u2192 300/25=12 \u2192 integer. So yes, c=2 is possible.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the correct answer would be C)2.\n\nWait, but the options include E)0, so why is that not possible? Because when c=0, 340/25=13.6 which is not an integer, so it's impossible. So yes, the minimal c is 2.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver brought, we start by defining the number of copper coins as \\( c \\) and brass coins as \\( b \\). The total earnings are $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. The equation for the total earnings is:\n\n\\[\n20c + 25b = 340\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n4c + 5b = 68\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{68 - 4c}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( b \\) to be a non-negative integer, \\( 68 - 4c \\) must be divisible by 5. This implies:\n\n\\[\n68 - 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 68 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 - 4c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4c \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThe modular inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, so multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nc \\equiv 12 \\pmod{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( c \\) can take values \\( 2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots \\). However, \\( c \\) must also satisfy \\( 4c \\leq 68 \\), so \\( c \\leq 17 \\). The smallest possible value of \\( c \\) is 2.\n\nTo verify, if \\( c = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\n4(2) + 5b = 68 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 8 + 5b = 68 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 5b = 60 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 12\n\\]\n\nThis is valid, as \\( b = 12 \\) is a non-negative integer. Checking smaller values of \\( c \\):\n\n- \\( c = 0 \\): \\( 68 - 4(0) = 68 \\), \\( 68 / 5 = 13.6 \\) (not an integer).\n- \\( c = 1 \\): \\( 68 - 4(1) = 64 \\), \\( 64 / 5 = 12.8 \\) (not an integer).\n\nThus, the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question is about a coin-diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from a river. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, right. So I need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins that would lead to a total of $3.40 when considering both copper and brass coins.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Each copper is 20 cents, so that's 0.20 dollars each, and each brass is 25 cents, which is 0.25 dollars. The total she made is 3.40 dollars.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40\n\nI need to find integer solutions (since you can't have a fraction of a coin) for c and b that satisfy this equation. And among those solutions, I need the one with the smallest possible value of c.\n\nWait, but 0.20 and 0.25 are in dollars. Alternatively, to avoid decimals, maybe I can multiply the entire equation by 100 to convert it into cents. That might make the calculations easier.\n\nMultiplying each term by 100:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nYes, that's better. So 20c plus 25b equals 340 cents.\n\nNow, I can simplify this equation. Let's see if I can factor it or find a common divisor. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5.\n\nDividing each term by 5:\n\n4c + 5b = 68\n\nSo now the equation is 4c +5b =68.\n\nI need to find non-negative integers c and b that satisfy this equation. And I want the smallest possible c.\n\nSo, let's think about this. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other. Maybe express c in terms of b.\n\n4c = 68 -5b\n\nc = (68 -5b)/4\n\nSince c must be an integer, (68 -5b) must be divisible by 4. So 68 mod 4 is 0, because 4*17=68. So 5b must leave a remainder that, when subtracted from 68, gives a multiple of 4.\n\nWait, 5b mod 4. Let's think about 5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 is (1*b) mod4. So 5b mod4 = b mod4.\n\nSo 68 -5b must be divisible by 4. Since 68 is 0 mod4, then 5b must be congruent to 0 mod4. So (5b) mod4 =0 \u2192 which is the same as b mod4=0.\n\nSo b must be a multiple of 4. Because when you take b mod4, it's 0 only if b is 0,4,8,12,... etc.\n\nSo possible values of b are 0,4,8,12,... but we also have to make sure that when we calculate c, it's non-negative.\n\nSo let's consider possible b values that are multiples of 4, and see which ones give a non-negative c.\n\nLet's try b=0:\n\nc=(68-0)/4=17 \u2192 c=17. That's possible. So 17 copper coins, 0 brass. But we're looking for the minimum c, so maybe a lower c exists with a higher b.\n\nWait, but since c is 17 in this case, perhaps with higher b, c could be smaller.\n\nLet's try b=4:\n\nc=(68 -5*4)/4 \u2192 (68-20)=48 \u219248/4=12 \u2192 c=12. So 12 copper, 4 brass.\n\nStill, c is 12, which is lower than 17. But can we go lower?\n\nNext, b=8:\n\nc=(68-5*8)/4 \u2192 68-40=28 \u2192 28/4=7 \u2192 c=7.\n\nEven lower c. Let's go on.\n\nb=12:\n\nc=(68-60)/4 \u2192 8/4=2 \u2192 c=2.\n\nSo now c is 2. That's lower. Can we go even lower?\n\nNext possible b is 16:\n\nc=(68-80)/4 \u2192 (68-80)= -12 \u2192 -12/4= -3. That's negative. Not possible because you can't have negative coins.\n\nSo b can't be 16. So the maximum possible b is 12, giving c=2.\n\nWait, but let's check if there are any other possible b's that are not multiples of 4 but still make (68-5b) divisible by 4.\n\nBecause earlier, I assumed that since 5b mod4 = b mod4, and to get 68-5b divisible by 4, 5b mod4 must be 0, so b mod4=0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine that.\n\nBecause 68 mod4 is 0. So 5b mod4 must also be 0.\n\nBut 5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 is (1*b) mod4 \u2192 which is b mod4.\n\nSo 5b mod4 = (b mod4) \u2192 so for 5b to be 0 mod4, b mod4 must be 0.\n\nSo b must be a multiple of 4. So the earlier approach is correct.\n\nSo the possible values of b are 0,4,8,12, etc., but beyond 12, c becomes negative.\n\nSo the possible (b,c) pairs are:\n\nb=0 \u2192 c=17\n\nb=4 \u2192 c=12\n\nb=8 \u2192 c=7\n\nb=12 \u2192 c=2\n\nb=16 \u2192 c= -3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the possible c values are 17,12,7,2. So the smallest possible c is 2.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The options given are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo in the options, C is 2, which is the minimum c I found here. So is that the answer?\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any possibilities. Because perhaps there are other ways to get a smaller c.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I can represent the equation 4c +5b=68 and find all possible non-negative integer solutions, then pick the one with the smallest c.\n\nLet me try solving for b in terms of c.\n\n5b = 68 -4c \u2192 b = (68 -4c)/5.\n\nSo (68-4c) must be divisible by 5. So 68 mod5 is 68/5=13*5=65, so remainder 3. So 68 mod5=3.\n\nSo 4c must be congruent to 3 mod5.\n\nBecause 68 -4c must be divisible by 5 \u2192 68 \u22614c mod5 \u2192 3 \u22614c mod5.\n\nSo 4c \u22613 mod5. Let's find c such that this holds.\n\nWe can write 4c \u22613 mod5 \u2192 Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, because 4*4=16\u22611 mod5.\n\nSo c \u2261 3*4 mod5 \u2192 c \u226112 mod5 \u2192 c \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo c can be 2,7,12,17, etc. But since c has to be non-negative and 4c can't exceed 68, let's find the possible c values.\n\nc=2 \u2192 4*2=8 \u2192 68-8=60 \u219260/5=12 \u2192b=12.\n\nc=7 \u21924*7=28 \u219268-28=40 \u219240/5=8 \u2192b=8.\n\nc=12 \u21924*12=48 \u219268-48=20 \u219220/5=4 \u2192b=4.\n\nc=17 \u21924*17=68 \u219268-68=0 \u2192b=0.\n\nSo the possible (c, b) pairs are (2,12), (7,8), (12,4), (17,0).\n\nSo the minimum c is 2. So the answer should be C)2.\n\nBut wait, looking back, in the options, the minimum c is 2, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the minimum number of copper coins. So the minimum is 2. So the correct answer is C)2.\n",

Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: A coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin she brings up from the bottom of a river, and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nHmm, I think I should approach this as a system of equations problem. Let me define variables for the number of each type of coin.\n\nLet\u2019s say c is the number of copper coins, and b is the number of brass coins. Each copper gives 20 cents, so total for copper is 20c cents. Each brass is 25 cents, so total for brass is 25b cents. The total she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents.\n\nSo the equation is: 20c + 25b = 340.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of c such that both c and b are non-negative integers. Because you can't have a negative number of coins.\n\nLet me think about how to solve this. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve for b in terms of c.\n\n25b = 340 - 20c  \nDivide both sides by 5: 5b = 68 - 4c  \nThen, b = (68 -4c)/5\n\nSince b must be an integer, (68 -4c) must be divisible by 5. So, (68 -4c) mod 5 should be 0.\n\nLet me compute 68 mod 5 first. 5*13=65, so 68-65=3. So 68 mod5 is 3. So 3 - (4c mod5) should be 0 mod5. So, 4c mod5 should equal 3.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the possible values of c that make (68 -4c) divisible by 5. So 4c must be congruent to 3 mod5. So 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nI can solve for c in this congruence. Let's find c such that 4c mod5 is 3.\n\n4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod5. The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5.\n\nSo, c \u22613*4 mod5 \u2192 c\u226112 mod5 \u2192 c\u22612 mod5. So c can be 2,7,12,... but since the total is 340 cents, let's see what's possible.\n\nWait, but 20c can't be more than 340, so c \u2264340/20=17. So c can be 2,7,12,17.\n\nBut since we\u2019re looking for the minimum number of copper coins, the smallest possible c is 2. But wait, maybe I should check each possible c and see if b is an integer.\n\nLet me test c=2. Then:\n\n20*2=40 cents. So 340-40=300. 300/25=12. So b=12. That's an integer. So c=2 is possible.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So is there a possibility of c being even smaller?\n\nWait, let me check c=0. Then 20*0=0, so 340=25b \u2192 b=13.6. Wait, that's not an integer. So c=0 isn't possible.\n\nWhat about c=1? Let's see: 20*1=20, so 340-20=320. 320/25=12.8. Not an integer, so c=1 is invalid.\n\nSo the next possible c is 2, which gives b=12, which is valid. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. But wait, wait a minute. Let me check if I missed any possible c between 0 and 2 that could work. But 0 and 1 don't, so the next is 2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: the modular solution said c must be \u22612 mod5, so possible c's are 2,7,12,17. But 17 would give 20*17=340, so 340-340=0, so b=0. So that's another possible solution, but c=17 is higher than 2, so the minimum is 2.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: maybe I can find a lower c than 2 that works. Let me see.\n\nWait, c=2 is the first possible solution, but what if I didn't account for all possibilities? Let me check c=7. 20*7=140. 340-140=200. 200/25=8. So b=8. That's a valid solution. So c=7 is another solution, but it's higher than 2, so 2 is still the minimum.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the modular approach. Let me double-check.\n\nI had 4c \u22613 mod5.

So c=2 is the smallest possible.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the correct answer should be C)2.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's list possible values of c and see which ones make b an integer.\n\nc can be 0,1,2,...17.\n\nc=0 \u2192 340=25b \u2192 b=13.6 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=1 \u2192 340-20=320 \u2192 320/25=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nc=2 \u2192 40 \u2192 300 \u219212 \u2192 valid.\n\nc=3 \u2192 60 \u2192 280 \u2192280/25=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nc=4 \u219280 \u2192260 \u2192260/25=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nc=5 \u2192100 \u2192240 \u2192240/25=9.6 \u2192 no.\n\nc=6 \u2192120 \u2192220 \u2192220/25=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nc=7 \u2192140 \u2192200 \u2192200/25=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nThus, the smallest is 2.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about a coin-diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from the river. Specifically, she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned a total of $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from A to E, with E being 0, which would mean no copper coins at all.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I think the first thing I should do is convert the total amount she earned into cents because the payments per coin are in cents. That makes calculations easier. Since $1 is 100 cents, $3.40 would be 340 cents. So, the total is 340 cents.\n\nNow, the problem is about finding the number of copper and brass coins that add up to 340 cents. Let me define variables for this. Let's say the number of copper coins is 'c' and the number of brass coins is 'b'. So, each copper gives 20c, so total from copper is 20c cents. Each brass gives 25b, so total from brass is 25b cents. So the equation would be:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nThe question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins, so I need to find the smallest possible integer value of c that makes b also an integer (since you can't have a fraction of a coin).\n\nWait, but both c and b have to be non-negative integers because you can't have negative coins. So, I need to solve this equation for integers c and b \u2265 0.\n\nI think I can approach this by rearranging the equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c.\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\nb = (340 - 20c) / 25\n\nSince b must be an integer, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25. So, let's think about this. 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So, the term (340 -20c) must be a multiple of 25.\n\nAnother approach is to factor out common terms. Let me see: 20c +25b =340. Both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5. So, let's divide the entire equation by 5:\n\n(20c)/5 + (25b)/5 = 340/5\nWhich simplifies to 4c +5b =68.\n\nSo now the equation is 4c +5b =68. We're looking for non-negative integers c and b.\n\nI need to find the minimum c such that 5b =68 -4c, and 68 -4c must be non-negative and divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 68 -4c \u22650 \u2192 4c \u226468 \u2192 c \u226417. So, c can be from 0 up to 17.\n\nBut we need 68 -4c to be divisible by 5. So, 68 mod 5 is 3, because 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So, 68 \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo, 4c must be congruent to 3 mod5 for 68-4c to be 0 mod5. Because 68 is 3 mod5, and 4c must be 3 mod5 as well. Because 3 - 3 = 0 mod5.\n\nSo, 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWe can solve for c in this congruence. Let's find the smallest non-negative c that satisfies 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nLet me think. 4c mod5 =3.\n\nWhat values of c will make this true?\n\nLet's test c= 0: 0 \u2192 no.\nc=1:4 \u2192 4 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=2:8 mod5=3 \u2192 yes! Because 8 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 3.\n\nSo, c=2 is a solution. So, c can be 2, and then add 5 each time because the modulus is 5. So, the possible c values are 2,7,12,17, etc. But since c can't be more than 17 (from earlier), the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the minimal c. So, the smallest c is 2. So, the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n\nWait, but let me check. If c=2, then 4c=8. So, 5b=68-8=60 \u2192 b=12. So, 12 brass coins. That's valid.\n\nIf c=0, let's see: 4c=0 \u21925b=68 \u2192b=13.6, which is not an integer. So, c=0 is not possible.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because 68 divided by 5 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So, c=0 is invalid.\n\nSo, the next possible c is 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus part. Let me check.\n\nWe have 4c \u22613 mod5. Let's compute 4c mod5 for c=0 to 4 to see which gives 3.\n\nc=0:0 \u21920 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=1:4 \u21924 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=2:8 \u21923 mod5 \u2192 yes.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, the question is about a coin-diver who gets paid for bringing up coins from the river. Specifically, she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned a total of $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from A to E, with E being 0, which would mean no copper coins at all.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I think the first thing I should do is convert the total amount she earned into cents because the payments per coin are in cents. That makes calculations easier. Since $1 is 100 cents, $3.40 would be 340 cents. So, the total is 340 cents.\n\nNow, the problem is about finding the number of copper and brass coins that add up to 340 cents. Let me define variables for this. Let's say the number of copper coins is 'c' and the number of brass coins is 'b'. So, each copper gives 20c, so total from copper is 20c cents. Each brass gives 25b, so total from brass is 25b cents. So the equation would be:\n\n20c + 25b = 340\n\nThe question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins, so I need to find the smallest possible integer value of c that makes b also an integer (since you can't have a fraction of a coin).\n\nWait, but both c and b have to be non-negative integers because you can't have negative coins. So, I need to solve this equation for integers c and b \u2265 0.\n\nI think I can approach this by rearranging the equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of c.\n\n25b = 340 - 20c\nb = (340 - 20c) / 25\n\nSince b must be an integer, (340 - 20c) must be divisible by 25. So, let's think about this. 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So, the term (340 -20c) must be a multiple of 25.\n\nAnother approach is to factor out common terms. Let me see: 20c +25b =340. Both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5. So, let's divide the entire equation by 5:\n\n(20c)/5 + (25b)/5 = 340/5\nWhich simplifies to 4c +5b =68.\n\nSo now the equation is 4c +5b =68. We're looking for non-negative integers c and b.\n\nI need to find the minimum c such that 5b =68 -4c, and 68 -4c must be non-negative and divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 68 -4c \u22650 \u2192 4c \u226468 \u2192 c \u226417. So, c can be from 0 up to 17.\n\nBut we need 68 -4c to be divisible by 5. So, 68 mod 5 is 3, because 5*13=65, 68-65=3. So, 68 \u22613 mod5.\n\nSo, 4c must be congruent to 3 mod5 for 68-4c to be 0 mod5. Because 68 is 3 mod5, and 4c must be 3 mod5 as well. Because 3 - 3 = 0 mod5.\n\nSo, 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nWe can solve for c in this congruence. Let's find the smallest non-negative c that satisfies 4c \u22613 mod5.\n\nLet me think. 4c mod5 =3.\n\nWhat values of c will make this true?\n\nLet's test c= 0: 0 \u2192 no.\nc=1:4 \u2192 4 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=2:8 mod5=3 \u2192 yes! Because 8 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 3.\n\nSo, c=2 is a solution. So, c can be 2, and then add 5 each time because the modulus is 5. So, the possible c values are 2,7,12,17, etc. But since c can't be more than 17 (from earlier), the possible c values are 2,7,12,17.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the minimal c. So, the smallest c is 2. So, the minimum number of copper coins is 2.\n\nWait, but let me check. If c=2, then 4c=8. So, 5b=68-8=60 \u2192 b=12. So, 12 brass coins. That's valid.\n\nIf c=0, let's see: 4c=0 \u21925b=68 \u2192b=13.6, which is not an integer. So, c=0 is not possible.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because 68 divided by 5 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So, c=0 is invalid.\n\nSo, the next possible c is 2.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the modulus part. Let me check.\n\nWe have 4c \u22613 mod5. Let's compute 4c mod5 for c=0 to 4 to see which gives 3.\n\nc=0:0 \u21920 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=1:4 \u21924 mod5 \u2192 no.\nc=2:8 \u21923 mod5 \u2192 yes. So, c=2 is the smallest.\n\nSo, the minimal c is 2. So, the answer should be option C)2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the problem says \"the minimum number of copper coins.\" So, perhaps 0 is possible? But in that case, 25b=340 \u2192b=13.6, which is impossible. So, c can't be 0.\n\nWait, no, 340/25 is 13.6, which is not an integer, so c can't be 0. So, the next possible is c=2, which gives b=12.\n\nWait, let me check for c=2: 20*2=40, 25*12=300. 40+300=340.

Let's see, both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5.

So among the C values, the smallest is 2. So the minimum number is 2.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing any lower C. Because sometimes, the modulus approach gives the minimal C, but perhaps there are smaller C values that also satisfy the condition. Let me check.\n\nWait, the modulus approach says C\u22612 mod5, so the smallest C is 2. But maybe if I didn't use that method, I could find a smaller C?\n\nWait, let's try C=0: then 4*0 +5B=68 \u2192 B=68/5=13.6, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nC=1: 4*1=4. 68-4=64. 64/5=12.8 \u2192 not integer.\n\nC=2: works as above.\n\nC=3: 4*3=12 \u2192 68-12=56 \u2192 56/5=11.2 \u2192 no.\n\nC=4: 16 \u2192 68-16=52 \u2192 52/5=10.4 \u2192 no.\n\nC=5: 20 \u2192 68-20=48 \u2192 48/5=9.6 \u2192 no.\n\nC=6: 24 \u2192 68-24=44 \u219244/5=8.8 \u2192 no.\n\nC=7: works, as above.\n\nSo yes, the possible C values are 2,7,12,17. So the smallest is 2.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So the answer would be C)2.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other possible way. Suppose the diver found a combination of coins where C is less than 2. Let me check C=1 and C=0.\n\nAs I saw earlier, C=1 gives B=(68-4)/5=64/5=12.8, which is not an integer. So B=12.8, which isn't possible.\n\nC=0: B=68/5=13.6 \u2192 not integer.\n\nSo the next possible C is 2, which gives B=12, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by converting $3.40 into cents, which gives 340 cents. Let \\( C \\) represent the number of copper coins and \\( B \\) represent the number of brass coins. The equation for the total earnings is:\n\n\\[\n20C + 25B = 340\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 5 simplifies it to:\n\n\\[\n4C + 5B = 68\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{68 - 4C}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( B \\) to be an integer, \\( 68 - 4C \\) must be divisible by 5. This implies:\n\n\\[\n4C \\equiv 68 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 68 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n4C \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThe modular inverse of 4 modulo 5 is 4, as \\( 4 \\times 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\). Multiplying both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nC \\equiv 3 \\times 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies C \\equiv 12 \\pmod{5} \\implies C \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( C \\) must be congruent to 2 modulo 5, meaning \\( C \\) can take values like 2, 7, 12, 17, etc. However, since \\( C \\) must be as small as possible, we start with \\( C = 2 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( C = 2 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{68 - 4(2)}{5} = \\frac{68 - 8}{5} = \\frac{60}{5} = 12\n\\]\n\nThis gives a valid solution: \\( C = 2 \\), \\( B = 12 \\). Checking smaller values of \\( C \\) (e.g., \\( C = 0, 1 \\)) results in non-integer values for \\( B \\), confirming that \\( C = 2 \\) is the smallest valid number of copper coins.\n\nThus, the minimum number of copper coins is **2**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says that a coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin she brings up from the bottom of a river, and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she earned $3.40. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are from A to E, with the possible numbers being 4,3,2,1, or 0.\n\nHmm. So I need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins that would allow the total earnings to be $3.40, considering the earnings from both copper and brass coins.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'. Each copper coin gives 20 cents, so that's 0.20 dollars, and each brass is 25 cents, which is 0.25 dollars. The total she made is 3.40 dollars.\n\nSo the equation would be: 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40.\n\nWait, but working with decimals can sometimes be tricky. Maybe I should convert everything into cents to avoid dealing with fractions. Let's see: 0.20 dollars is 20 cents, 0.25 is 25, and 3.40 is 340 cents. So the equation becomes 20c +25b = 340.\n\nThat's better. Now, I need to find all possible non-negative integer solutions (c and b must be whole numbers, since you can't have a fraction of a coin) to this equation, and then find the smallest possible value of c.\n\nSo the equation is 20c +25b = 340.\n\nI can simplify this equation. Let's factor out 5: 5(4c +5b) = 340. Dividing both sides by 5, we get 4c +5b = 68.\n\nNow, we have 4c +5b =68. We're looking for integer solutions where c and b are non-negative integers.\n\nOur goal is to minimize c. So we can approach this by trying to maximize b, because for each additional b, we can reduce c. But since 5b must be less than or equal to 68, the maximum possible b would be 68/5 =13.6, so 13 at maximum. But let's see.\n\nWait, but since 4c has to be a non-negative integer as well, let's think about how to express c in terms of b.\n\nFrom 4c =68 -5b \u2192 c=(68-5b)/4. For c to be an integer, (68-5b) must be divisible by 4. So 68 mod 4 is 0 (since 4*17=68). So 5b must also leave a remainder that, when subtracted, gives a multiple of 4.\n\nWait, let's think about it this way: 5b mod 4 must be equal to (68 mod4) \u2192 but 68 mod4 is 0, so 5b mod4 must be 0.\n\nBut 5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 is equivalent to (1*b) mod4, which is b mod4. So for 5b mod4 to be 0, b mod4 must be 0. So b must be a multiple of 4.\n\nSo possible values of b are 0,4,8,12, etc., but we also have to ensure that 5b \u226468 \u2192 b \u226413.6 \u2192 b can be up to 13.\n\nWait, but b can be up to 13, but since b must be a multiple of 4, the possible b values are 0,4,8,12.\n\nLet me list the possible b's and compute c for each.\n\nCase 1: b=0.\n\nThen 4c =68 \u2192 c=17. So c=17, b=0. Total coins: 17. So possible, but perhaps a higher b would allow a lower c.\n\nCase 2: b=4.\n\nThen 5*4=20. 68-20=48. 4c=48 \u2192 c=12. So c=12, b=4.\n\nCase3: b=8.\n\n5*8=40. 68-40=28. 4c=28 \u2192 c=7.\n\nCase4: b=12.\n\n5*12=60. 68-60=8. 4c=8 \u2192 c=2.\n\nCase5: b=16? Wait, 5*16=80, which is larger than 68. So b can't be 16. So the maximum b we can take is 12.\n\nWait, what about b=13? Let me check. 5*13=65. 68-65=3. 3 divided by4 is 0.75, which is not an integer. So c can't be 0.75, so this is not a valid solution. So b=13 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, trying b=1: 5*1=5. 68-5=63 \u2192 63/4=15.75 \u2192 not integer.\n\nb=2: 5*2=10 \u2192 68-10=58 \u219258/4=14.5 \u2192 no.\n\nb=3: 5*3=15 \u219268-15=53 \u219253/4=13.25 \u2192 no.\n\nb=4: as above, works.\n\nb=5: 5*5=25 \u219268-25=43 \u219243/4=10.75 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the only valid b's are multiples of 4, as we thought: 0,4,8,12.\n\nSo for each of these, c is 17,12,7,2 respectively.\n\nSo the question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins. So looking at the possible c's, the smallest is 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. So the answer would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible b's. Because perhaps b isn't a multiple of 4, but the equation still allows c to be integer.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that b must be a multiple of 4 because 5b mod4 must be 0. But perhaps I made a mistake in that reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nWe have 4c +5b =68.\n\nWe can write this as 4c =68 -5b \u2192 4c must be an integer, so (68 -5b) must be divisible by 4.\n\nSo 68 mod4 is 0. So 5b mod4 must also be 0.\n\nBut 5 mod4 is 1, so 5b mod4 is (1*b) mod4. So 5b mod4 = b mod4.\n\nSo for 5b mod4 to be 0, b mod4 must be 0.\n\nSo yes, b must be a multiple of 4. Therefore, the only possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nSo the minimal c is 2, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Could there be a case where b is not a multiple of 4, but 68-5b is still divisible by 4?\n\nFor example, suppose b is 12: 68-5*12=68-60=8 \u2192 8/4=2 \u2192 yes.\n\nWhat about b=8: 68-40=28 \u2192 28/4=7.\n\nBut what if b= 4k + r, where r is 1,2,3?\n\nWait, for example, let's take b=1: 5*1=5 \u2192 68-5=63 \u219263/4=15.75 \u2192 not integer.\n\nb=2:5*2=10 \u219268-10=58 \u219258/4=14.5 \u2192 no.\n\nb=3:5*3=15 \u219268-15=53 \u219253/4=13.25 \u2192 no.\n\nb=5:5*5=25 \u219268-25=43 \u219243/4=10.75 \u2192 no.\n\nb=6:5*6=30 \u219268-30=38 \u219238/4=9.5 \u2192 no.\n\nb=7:5*7=35 \u219268-35=33 \u219233/4=8.25 \u2192 no.\n\nb=9:5*9=45 \u219268-45=23 \u219223/4=5.75 \u2192 no.\n\nb=10:5*10=50 \u219268-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 \u2192 no.\n\nb=11:5*11=55 \u219268-55=13 \u219213/4=3.25 \u2192 no.\n\nb=13:5*13=65 \u219268-65=3 \u21923/4=0.75 \u2192 no.\n\nSo none of the other b's give an integer c. So the only possible b's are 0,4,8,12.\n\nThus, the minimal c is 2. So the answer is C)2.\n",

The possible values of \\(b\\) are \\(0, 4, 8, 12\\), as higher values would exceed the total earnings.\n\nFor each valid \\(b\\), we calculate \\(c\\):\n\n1. **\\(b = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   4c = 68 - 5(0) \\implies c = 17\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\(b = 4\\):**\n   \\[\n   4c = 68 - 5(4) \\implies 4c = 48 \\implies c = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\(b = 8\\):**\n   \\[\n   4c = 68 - 5(8) \\implies 4c = 28 \\implies c = 7\n   \\]\n\n4. **\\(b = 12\\):**\n   \\[\n   4c = 68 - 5(12) \\implies 4c = 8 \\implies c = 2\n   \\]\n\nThe smallest value of \\(c\\) is 2, which occurs when \\(b = 12\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a coin diver who gets money for each copper and brass coin she brings up. Each copper coin gives her 20 cents, and each brass is 25 cents. After one dive, she made $3.40. I need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought.\n\nWait, wait, $3.40 is the total. So that's 340 cents. Right, because a dollar is 100 cents, so 3 times 100 is 300, plus 40 is 340.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the number of copper (let's call them C) and brass (B) coins such that 20C + 25B = 340 cents. And we're looking for the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest possible C.\n\nHmm, I think I can set up an equation here. 20C + 25B = 340. I can try to simplify this equation to make it easier to work with. Let's see, both 20 and 25 are multiples of 5. So dividing the entire equation by 5 gives 4C + 5B = 68. That's better.\n\nNow, I'm looking for integer solutions where C and B are non-negative integers. Because you can't have negative coins.\n\nSo the equation is 4C +5B =68. I need to find possible values of C and B that satisfy this.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So I should find the smallest possible C such that B is also an integer.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to solve for B. 5B = 68 -4C. So B must be an integer, so 68 -4C must be divisible by 5. So 68 mod 5 is 3 (since 5*13=65, 68-65=3). So 68-4C \u2261 3 - (4C mod 5) \u2261 0 mod 5. So 4C mod5 should be equal to 3.\n\nWait, 4C \u22613 mod5. Let me think about what C mod5 would give 4C mod5 =3.\n\nSo 4C mod5 =3. Let's find C such that when multiplied by 4, it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.\n\nLet me try C=2: 4*2=8. 8 mod5 is 3. Oh, that works. So C=2 is a solution. Let me check.\n\nIf C=2, then 4*2=8. So 5B=68-8=60. So B=12. So that's possible. So that gives 2 copper coins and 12 brass, totaling 20*2 +25*12 =40 +300=340. Yep, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, can I get a lower C than 2? Let's see. Let's try C=1.\n\nIf C=1, then 4*1=4. 68-4=64. 64 divided by 5 is 12.8. Oh, that's not an integer. So B would be 12.8, which isn't possible. So C=1 isn't a valid solution.\n\nWhat about C=0? Then 4*0=0. 68-0=68. 68/5 is 13.6. Not an integer. So B can't be 13.6. So C=0 isn't a solution either.\n\nSo the next possible C after 2 would be... Well, wait, let's think about how C increases. Since we're looking for the minimum C, the next higher C would be 2, but wait, perhaps I should check if there are any smaller C's. But C can't be less than zero, so we've already checked 0 and 1. Both don't work.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another solution with a lower C? Let's think again. Let me consider all possible C's and see which ones give B as an integer.\n\nSo C can be from 0 upwards, but let's see:\n\nC=0: 5B=68 \u2192 B=13.6 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=1: 5B=64 \u2192 B=12.8 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=2: 5B=60 \u2192 B=12 \u2192 yes.\n\nC=3: 5B=68-12=56 \u2192 B=56/5=11.2 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=4: 5B=68-16=52 \u2192 B=10.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=5: 5B=68-20=48 \u2192 48/5=9.6 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=6: 5B=68-24=44 \u2192 44/5=8.8 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=7: 5B=68-28=40 \u2192 B=8 \u2192 yes.\n\nAh, so when C=7, B=8. That's another solution. So 7 copper coins and 8 brass.\n\nWait, but the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So between C=2 and C=7, 2 is smaller. So the minimum is 2.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me see if there are any other C's between 2 and 7 that work.\n\nC=3: 5B=68-12=56 \u2192 B=11.2 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=4: 5B=52 \u2192 10.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=5: 5B=48 \u2192 9.6 \u2192 nope.\n\nC=6: 5B=44 \u2192 8.8 \u2192 nope.\n\nSo the next C after 2 that works is 7. So the possible C's are 2,7,12, etc., but wait, let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, because the equation is 4C +5B=68. So for each increment in C by 5, perhaps B decreases by 4. Let me see: from C=2 (B=12) to C=7 (B=8), that's an increase of 5 in C and a decrease of 4 in B. Because 4*5=20, and 5*4=20, so 4*5 +5*(-4) =20-20=0. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the general solution would be C=2+5k, B=12-4k, where k is a non-negative integer, and B must be >=0.\n\nSo let's check for k=0: C=2, B=12 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=1: C=7, B=8 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=2: C=12, B=4 \u2192 valid.\n\nk=3: C=17, B=0 \u2192 valid. So 17 copper coins, 0 brass.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the minimum number of copper coins. So the smallest possible C is 2, as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought C=2 is the minimum, but let me make sure there's no C less than 2 that works. As we saw, C=0 and C=1 don't work because B becomes a non-integer. So the minimum is 2.\n\nSo the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0.\n\nSo the answer should be C)2.\n",
