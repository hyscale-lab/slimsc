      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about M men agreeing to purchase a gift for Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute. The options are given, and I need to find the correct one.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Initially, there are M men, and they're sharing the cost D equally. So each man's contribution is D divided by M. That makes sense because if you have a total amount and you split it equally among M people, each pays D/M.\n\nNow, the problem says 3 men drop out. So the new number of men is M minus 3. So now there are M-3 men left. They still have to pay the same total amount D, right? Because the gift's cost doesn't change. So the new contribution per person would be D divided by (M-3).\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution.\n\nThe original contribution per man was D/M. After 3 drop out, each contributes D/(M-3). So the increase per person is D/(M-3) minus D/M.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find the difference:\n\nDifference = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M)\n\nI can factor out D:\n\nDifference = D [ 1/(M-3) - 1/M ]\n\nTo subtract the fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M, so the common denominator is M(M-3).\n\nSo, 1/(M-3) is equal to M / [M(M-3)], and 1/M is (M-3)/[M(M-3)]. So subtracting them:\n\n[ M - (M-3) ] / [ M(M-3) ) ] = [ M - M +3 ] / [ M(M-3) ) ] = 3 / [ M(M-3) ]\n\nSo putting it back, the difference is D multiplied by this:\n\nDifference = D * [ 3 / (M(M-3)) ) ] = (3D) / [ M(M-3) ]\n\nHmm, let's look at the options. Option D is 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). Oh wait, because M(M-3) is M\u00b2-3M. So yeah, that's the same as option D.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.\n\nOption D says 3D/(M2-3M). I think that's a typo, but in the problem statement, it's written as M2-3M, which I think is intended to be M squared minus 3M. So yes, that matches.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's double-check the math.\n\nOriginal contribution: D/M.\n\nAfter 3 drop out: D/(M-3).\n\nDifference: D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nCompute that:\n\n= D [ (M - (M-3)) / (M(M-3)) ) ]\n\n= D [ (M - M +3) / (M(M-3)) ) ]\n\n= D [ 3/(M(M-3)) ) ]\n\nWhich is 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M), which is option D.\n\nSo yeah, the answer should be D. But wait, wait a second. Let me look at the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) D/(M-3)\n\nB) MD/3\n\nC) M/(D-3)\n\nD)3D/(M2-3M)\n\nE) None of these.\n\nWait, so option D is written as 3D/(M2-3M). So that's correct because M squared minus 3M is M(M-3). So yes, option D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the problem differently, perhaps I can approach it with numbers to test.\n\nLet's take M=5, D=15.\n\nSo initially, each contributes 15/5 = 3 Rs.\n\nIf 3 drop out, M becomes 2. Each now contributes 15/2 =7.5 Rs.\n\nSo the increase per person is 7.5 -3 =4.5.\n\nNow, let's compute option D: 3D/(M\u00b2-3M) = (3*15)/(25 -15) =45/10=4.5.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?\n\nHmm. So, initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. Then, 3 of them leave, so there are M-3 left. I need to find out how much more each remaining person has to pay compared to before.\n\nLet me think about how this works. Initially, each person was supposed to pay a certain amount. After some drop out, the remaining people have to cover the same total cost D, but with fewer people, so each person's share increases.\n\nSo, first, I should calculate the initial contribution per person. That's straightforward: total cost divided by the number of people. So, initial contribution per person is D divided by M, which is D/M.\n\nThen, when 3 men drop out, the number of people becomes M-3. Now, each person's contribution becomes D divided by (M-3), which is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each person has to contribute. So, I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution.\n\nSo, the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M].\n\nLet me compute that difference. Let's write it out:\n\nIncrease = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) \n\nTo subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M, so the common denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nSo,\n\nIncrease = [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*(M-3) = D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, and the denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nTherefore, the increase is 3D / [M*(M-3)].\n\nWait, let me check that again. Yes, expanding D*(M-3) gives D*M -3D. So when subtracting, D*M - (D*M -3D) = D*M - D*M +3D =3D. Correct.\n\nSo the increase is 3D/(M(M-3)).

So not this.\n\nB) MD/3 \u2192 Hmm, that's M*D divided by 3. Doesn't match 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nC) M/(D-3) \u2192 Doesn't look right. Maybe if I had swapped variables, but no, this doesn't fit.\n\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M) \u2192 Oh, wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M-3). So 3D/(M(M-3)) is same as 3D/(M\u00b2-3M).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?\n\nHmm. So, initially, there are M men sharing the cost D. Then, 3 of them leave, so there are M-3 left. I need to find out how much more each remaining person has to pay compared to before.\n\nLet me think about how this works. Initially, each person was supposed to pay a certain amount. After some drop out, the remaining people have to cover the same total cost D, but with fewer people, so each person's share increases.\n\nSo, first, I should calculate the initial contribution per person. That's straightforward: total cost divided by the number of people. So, initial contribution per person is D divided by M, which is D/M.\n\nThen, when 3 men drop out, the number of people becomes M-3. Now, each person's contribution becomes D divided by (M-3), which is D/(M-3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each person has to contribute. So, I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution.\n\nSo, the increase per person is [D/(M-3)] minus [D/M].\n\nLet me compute that difference. Let's write it out:\n\nIncrease = (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) \n\nTo subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M, so the common denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nSo,\n\nIncrease = [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*(M-3) = D*M - D*M + 3D = 3D\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, and the denominator is M*(M-3).\n\nTherefore, the increase is 3D / [M*(M-3)].\n\nWait, let me check that again. Yes, expanding D*(M-3) gives D*M -3D. So when subtracting, D*M - (D*M -3D) = D*M - D*M +3D =3D. Correct.\n\nSo the increase is 3D/(M(M-3)). Let me look at the options to see which one matches this.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) D/(M-3) \u2192 That's the new contribution, not the increase. So not this.\n\nB) MD/3 \u2192 Hmm, that's M*D divided by 3. Doesn't match 3D/(M(M-3)).\n\nC) M/(D-3) \u2192 Doesn't look right. Maybe if I had swapped variables, but no, this doesn't fit.\n\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M) \u2192 Oh, wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M-3). So 3D/(M(M-3)) is same as 3D/(M\u00b2-3M). So option D is that.\n\nE) None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option D.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nSo, initial per person: D/M.\n\nAfter 3 drop, per person: D/(M-3).\n\nDifference: D/(M-3) - D/M.\n\nWhich is [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)].\n\nWhich is [DM - DM +3D]/denominator \u2192 3D/[M(M-3)] \u2192 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M).\n\nYes, that's exactly option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial contribution per person when there are M men.

Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nSo, originally, there are M men contributing to the total amount D. That means each man was supposed to pay D divided by M, right? So the initial contribution per man is D/M.\n\nBut then, 3 men drop out. So the number of men remaining is M minus 3.

So the new contribution per man would be D divided by (M-3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each will have to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution.\n\nLet me write this down. Original contribution per man: D/M. New contribution: D/(M-3). So the additional amount each has to pay is D/(M-3) minus D/M.\n\nLet me compute that difference. D/(M-3) - D/M. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be M*(M-3).

The increase in contribution per person is the difference between the new and original contributions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase per person} = \\frac{D}{M - 3} - \\frac{D}{M}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this, we find a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{M - 3} - \\frac{D}{M} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{M - 3} - \\frac{1}{M} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{M - (M - 3)}{M(M - 3)} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{3}{M(M - 3)} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThus, the increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Increase per person} = \\frac{3D}{M(M - 3)}.\n\\]\n\nRewriting \\( M(M - 3) \\) as \\( M^2 - 3M \\), the increase becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we check the options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\( \\frac{D}{M - 3} \\) represents the new contribution, not the increase.\n- **Option B**: \\( \\frac{MD}{3} \\) is unrelated to the problem.\n- **Option C**: \\( \\frac{M}{D - 3} \\) is incorrect.\n- **Option D**: \\( \\frac{3D}{M^2 - 3M} \\) matches the derived expression for the increase.\n- **Option E**: \"None of these\" is not applicable since Option D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: D**",
