      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs to create unique codes for all 10 books. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, each book can be represented by a single letter or a pair of letters. Since the order doesn't matter in the pair, the pair is just a combination, not a permutation. So, for example, AB is the same as BA for this problem.\n\nI remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. The number of possible pairs from n letters is given by the combination formula C(n,2) which is n(n-1)/2. Also, each single letter is just n possibilities.\n\nSo the total number of unique codes available would be the sum of the single letters and the possible pairs. So total codes = n + C(n,2) = n + (n(n-1))/2.\n\nWe need this total to be at least 10 because there are 10 books. So we can set up the equation: n + (n(n-1))/2 \u2265 10.\n\nLet me try plugging in the options given. The options are 3,4,5,10,20.\n\nOption A is 3. Let's compute for n=3.\n\nTotal codes: 3 + (3*2)/2 = 3 +3=6. That's only 6 codes, which is less than 10. So that's not enough. So A is too small.\n\nOption B is 4. Let's calculate.\n\nn=4: 4 + (4*3)/2 =4 +6=10. Oh, that's exactly 10. Wait, does that mean 4 letters would give us exactly 10 codes? Let me double-check. Single letters: 4. Pairs: 6. 4+6=10. Perfect, because Amy has exactly 10 books. So 4 letters would suffice, right?\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Does each code have to be unique, and each book must have a unique code. So if we have 4 letters, all single letters are unique, and all pairs are unique. So 4 letters give 10 codes, which is exactly what we need.\n\nSo why is option B)4 the answer? Because with 4 letters, we can create 10 unique codes, which covers all 10 books.\n\nLet me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption C is 5. Let's compute: 5 + (5*4)/2 =5 +10=15. That's more than 10, but since we're looking for the smallest number, 4 is better than 5.\n\nOption D is 10 letters. That would give 10 + (10*9)/2=10+45=55, which is way more than needed, but the question is about the smallest.\n\nOption E is 20, which is even larger, so definitely not the minimal.\n\nSo the minimal number is 4 letters.\n",

So that works.\n\nWait, so with 4 letters, she can create 4 single-letter codes and 6 two-letter codes, totaling 10. So that's exactly enough for 10 books.\n\nSo the minimal number is 4 letters. So the answer should be B)4.\n\n\nTo determine the smallest number of letters Amy needs to create unique codes for all 10 books, we calculate the total number of possible codes for a given number of letters \\( n \\). Each code can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. \n\n- For single-letter codes, there are \\( n \\) possibilities.\n- For two-letter pairs, since the order does not matter, there are \\( \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) possibilities.\n\nThe total number of codes is therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Total codes} = n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n\\]\n\nWe need this total to be at least 10. Let's evaluate for different values of \\( n \\):\n\n1. **For \\( n = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total codes} = 3 + \\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   \\]\n   This is less than 10, so \\( n = 3 \\) is insufficient.\n\n2. **For \\( n = 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total codes} = 4 + \\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10.\n   \\]\n   This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.\n\nThus, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.\n\nAnswer: B",

The goal is to find the smallest number of letters she needs. Hmm, I think this is a combinatorics problem.\n\nWait, right. So each code is either one letter or a two-letter pair, and each type of book gets a unique code. So we need to cover all 10 books with as few letters as possible, using these codes.\n\nLet me think. Let's say she uses 'n' letters. Then, the number of possible single-letter codes is n. For the pairs, since the order doesn't matter, the number of possible pairs is n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo the total number of possible codes is n + (n choose 2) = n + n(n-1)/2. This should be at least 10, because she has 10 books to code.\n\nSo the equation is n + (n*(n-1))/2 \u2265 10.\n\nI need to find the smallest integer n that satisfies this.\n\nLet me try plugging in the options given. The options are A)3, B)4, C)5, D)10, E)20.\n\nStarting with A)3: n=3.\n\nn + n(n-1)/2 = 3 + (3*2)/2 = 3+3=6. That's only 6 codes, but she needs 10. So 3 is too small.\n\nNext, B)4: n=4.\n\nCalculating: 4 + (4*3)/2 = 4 + 6 = 10. Oh, that's exactly 10. So with 4 letters, she can have 4 single codes and 6 two-letter codes, making 10 in total. That should be enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Each two-letter code uses two different letters. So the letters are used in both single and pair codes, but each pair is unique and unordered.\n\nSo for 4 letters, the number of pairs is 6. So 4 single-letter codes and 6 two-letter codes. Together, 10 codes, which matches the number of books. So that works.\n\nSo the minimum number of letters needed is 4, which is option B.\n",
