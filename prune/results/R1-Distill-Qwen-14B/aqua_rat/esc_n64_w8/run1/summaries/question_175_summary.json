      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a rope that's 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. The question is about figuring out the length of the longer piece. Hmm, I remember from school that these kinds of problems usually involve setting up some equations based on the information given.\n\nSo, the rope is 20 meters in total. It's cut into two pieces, and one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. Wait, so one is longer by 3 meters than the other. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nMaybe I should assign variables to the lengths. Let's say the longer piece is of length x meters. Then, the shorter piece would be x - 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter. Oh wait, no, wait. If the longer is x, then the shorter is x minus 3, right? Because the shorter is 3 meters less than the longer.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. The problem says one piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. So, if the longer is x, the shorter is x - 3. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the total length of both pieces is 20 meters. So, the sum of the two pieces should be 20. So, x + (x - 3) = 20. Let me write that equation down.\n\nx + (x - 3) = 20.\n\nCombining like terms: 2x - 3 = 20. Hmm, then I can solve for x.\n\nAdding 3 to both sides: 2x = 23.\n\nDividing both sides by 2: x = 11.5. So, the longer piece is 11.5 meters. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, 11.5 plus (11.5 -3) equals 11.5 +8.5, which is 20. Yes, that adds up. So the longer piece is 11.5 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 11.5. So the answer should be D.\n",

Now, subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 17. Then, divide both sides by 2: x = 8.5.\n\nWait, x is the shorter piece, so the longer piece is x +3 = 8.5 +3 = 11.5 meters. Oh, so the longer piece is 11.5 meters long.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 11.5. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the shorter is 8.5, longer is 11.5, adding them together: 8.5 +11.5 is 20. Yep, that's correct. And the longer is indeed 3 meters longer than the shorter. Because 11.5 minus 8.5 is 3. So everything checks out.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be D)11.5.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the length of the shorter piece be \\( x \\) meters. Since the longer piece is 3 meters longer than the shorter piece, its length is \\( x + 3 \\) meters. The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 3) = 20\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 3 = 20\n\\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 17\n\\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 8.5\n\\]\n\nThe shorter piece is 8.5 meters, and the longer piece is:\n\n\\[\nx + 3 = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5 \\, \\text{meters}.\n\\]\n\nVerifying, the total length is \\( 8.5 + 11.5 = 20 \\) meters, and the longer piece is indeed 3 meters longer than the shorter piece. Thus, the length of the longer piece is:\n\n**Answer: D**",

Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe problem says: A rope that's 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece.\n\nHmm, okay, so the total length is 20 meters, and it's split into two parts. Let me think about how to model this. Maybe using algebra would help. I'll assign variables to each part.\n\nLet me call the longer piece 'L' and the shorter one 'S'. The problem says that one is 3 meters shorter than the other. So S must be L minus 3 meters because the shorter piece is 3m less than the longer. So S = L - 3.\n\nWait, but I also know that the sum of the two pieces should be 20 meters. So L + S = 20. Oh right, that makes sense because when you cut the rope, the two pieces add up to the original length.\n\nSince I have S in terms of L, I can substitute that into the equation. So replacing S with (L-3), the equation becomes L + (L-3) = 20.\n\nLet me simplify that. Combine like terms: L + L is 2L, and then minus 3. So 2L -3 = 20.\n\nNow, I'll solve for L. Add 3 to both sides to get rid of the -3. That gives me 2L = 23. Then, divide both sides by 2. So L = 23/2. Let me calculate that: 23 divided by 2 is 11.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If the longer piece is 11.5 meters, then the shorter would be 11.5 -3 = 8.5 meters. Adding them together: 11.5 + 8.5 = 20, which matches the total length.

Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let's say the longer piece has a length of 'x' meters. Then the shorter piece would be 'x - 3' meters because it's 3 meters shorter than the longer one. \n\nWait, wait. Because the rope is cut into two pieces, the sum of the lengths of both pieces should equal the total length, which is 20 meters. So, I can write an equation: x + (x - 3) = 20. \n\nLet me compute that. So, x plus x is 2x, and then minus 3. So the equation becomes 2x - 3 = 20.

So that makes sense. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. 20 meters total. If one is 3 meters shorter, the difference is 3. So the two pieces differ by 3. So the average would be when you split the total length, but wait, maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the two pieces as being such that the longer is L and shorter is S.
