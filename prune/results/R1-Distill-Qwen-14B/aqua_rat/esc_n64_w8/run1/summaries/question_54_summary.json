      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. There are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket. The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180.\n\nHmm, right. So, this sounds like a combinations problem because the order in which we pick the oranges doesn't matter. Like, whether I pick orange A first and then orange B is the same as picking B first and then A. So combinations, not permutations.\n\nWait, what's the formula for combinations again? Oh right, it's n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n -k)! ), right? So n is 10 and k is 2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So 10 choose 2 is 10! / (2! * (10-2)! ). Simplify that. 10-2 is 8, so it's 10!/(2! *8! ). \n\nBut wait, calculating factorials for 10 and 8 might be tedious. Let me think of a smarter way. Oh, right, because 10! is 10 \u00d79 \u00d78! So when I write 10! over 8!, the 8! cancels out. So that leaves me with (10 \u00d79)/ (2 \u00d71 ). \n\nSo 10 times 9 is 90. Divided by 2 is 45. So the answer should be 45.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 45. So the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but why aren't the other options correct? Let me think. Option B is 90, which would be if we considered order, like permutations. Because permutations of 10 choose 2 is 10*9=90. But since the question is about choosing, not arranging, it's combinations.

The options given are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember from my classes that when you're choosing items from a group without considering the order, it's a combination problem. Oh right! Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. So if I'm picking two oranges, it doesn't matter which one I pick first or second; the pair is the same.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! * (n - k)!). So here, n is 10 and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nCalculating that: 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)! ). Wait, 10! is a big number, but maybe I can simplify it before calculating. Let's see, 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! because 10! = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, which is the same as 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!. And the denominator is 2! times 8!, right? So the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. That leaves me with (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1). \n\nLet's compute that. 10 times 9 is 90. And 2 times 1 is 2. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. So the answer should be 45, which is option A.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Another way to think about it is, how many ways can I pick the first orange? There are 10 choices. Then for the second, since one is already taken, there are 9 left. So 10 times 9 equals 90. But wait, that counts each pair twice because selecting orange A then B is the same as B then A. So I need to divide by 2 to account for the duplicates. So 90 divided by 2 is indeed 45. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is 45, which is option A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket. The options given are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember from my classes that when you're choosing items from a group without considering the order, it's a combination problem. Oh right! Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. So if I'm picking two oranges, it doesn't matter which one I pick first or second; the pair is the same.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k! * (n - k)!). So here, n is 10 and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nCalculating that: 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)! ). Wait, 10! is a big number, but maybe I can simplify it before calculating. Let's see, 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! because 10! = 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 1, which is the same as 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8!. And the denominator is 2! times 8!, right? So the 8! in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. That leaves me with (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1). \n\nLet's compute that. 10 times 9 is 90. And 2 times 1 is 2. So 90 divided by 2 is 45. So the answer should be 45, which is option A.\n\nWait a second, did I do that right? Another way to think about it is, how many ways can I pick the first orange? There are 10 choices. Then for the second, since one is already taken, there are 9 left. So 10 times 9 equals 90. But wait, that counts each pair twice because selecting orange A then B is the same as B then A. So I need to divide by 2 to account for the duplicates. So 90 divided by 2 is indeed 45. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is 45, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 without considering the order, we use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of combinations} = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( n = 10 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).

Hmm, I think this is a combinations problem because the order doesn't matter when you're choosing oranges. Like, whether I pick orange A first or orange B first, it's the same pair.\n\nWait, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? So yeah, this is definitely a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!). So here, n is 10 and k is 2.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So 10 choose 2 is 10! divided by (2! times (10-2)! ). Oh wait, 10-2 is 8, so that's 8! So the equation becomes 10!/(2! * 8!). \n\nBut wait, 10! is 10 \u00d79 \u00d78! because 10! is 10\u00d79\u00d78\u00d77\u00d7...\u00d71, which is the same as 10\u00d79\u00d78!. So when I divide by 8! in the denominator, it cancels out. So now I have (10 \u00d79 \u00d78! ) / (2! \u00d78!) which simplifies to (10 \u00d79 ) / 2!.\n\nWhat's 2! equal to? Oh right, 2\u00d71=2. So now it's (10\u00d79)/2. Let me compute that. 10 multiplied by 9 is 90. Then 90 divided by 2 is 45. So the number of ways is 45.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45.
