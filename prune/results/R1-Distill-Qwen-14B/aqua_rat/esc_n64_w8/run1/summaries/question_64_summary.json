      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, let me think through this. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the question says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out the total number of matches he's played in this season.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated by total runs divided by the number of innings, right? Or is it matches? Oh wait, in cricket, a match can have two innings, but here maybe each match is counted as one innings for a player if they bat once. So, I think the average is total runs divided by the number of matches he's batted in.\n\nWait, the problem says \"matches played\", so perhaps each match he plays, he bats once. So, the number of innings is equal to the number of matches played.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of matches he has played before the finals as n. So, his total runs before the finals would be 51 multiplied by n. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So, his new total runs are 51n + 78.\n\nThe number of matches he's played now is n + 1. His new average is 54, so:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nOkay, so I can set up that equation and solve for n.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(51n +78)/(n+1) =54.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n51n +78 =54(n+1).\n\nExpand the right side: 54n +54.\n\nSo, 51n +78 =54n +54.\n\nLet me subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 =3n +54.\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n24 =3n.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn=8.\n\nSo, n is 8. That means before the finals, he played 8 matches. But then he played one more in the finals, so the total matches are 8 +1 =9.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, let me think again. Because when he played the finals, that's the (n+1)th match. So, the total matches is n +1, which is 9. So, the answer should be 9. Looking at the options, C is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. So, initial average is 51, n=8. So total runs were 51*8=408. After scoring 78, total runs are 408+78=486. Number of matches is 9. 486 divided by 9 is 54. That's correct. So yeah, the total is 9 matches.\n",

Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he's played in total this season. The options are from 6 to 11, so not too many possibilities.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches, right? So if his average is 51 before the finals, that means total runs before = 51 multiplied by the number of matches he's played up to that point. Let's call the number of matches he's played before the finals as 'n'. So, total runs before finals = 51n.\n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his total runs become 51n + 78. And the number of matches increases by 1, so now he's played 'n+1' matches. His new average is 54, which is the total runs divided by the new number of matches. So, the equation would be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nNow I can solve this equation for 'n'. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by (n +1) to get rid of the denominator:\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54.\n\nHmm, let's subtract 51n from both sides:\n78 = 3n + 54.\n\nThen, subtract 54 from both sides:\n24 = 3n.\n\nSo, n = 8. Oh wait, that's the number of matches before the finals. But the question asks for the total number of matches after the finals, which is n +1.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on averages, but let me think this through.\n\nAlright, the question says that Sachin's current batting average is 51. Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. I need to find out how many matches he's played in total this season. The options are from 6 to 11, so not too many possibilities.\n\nWait, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches, right? So if his average is 51 before the finals, that means total runs before = 51 multiplied by the number of matches he's played up to that point. Let's call the number of matches he's played before the finals as 'n'. So, total runs before finals = 51n.\n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his total runs become 51n + 78. And the number of matches increases by 1, so now he's played 'n+1' matches. His new average is 54, which is the total runs divided by the new number of matches. So, the equation would be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54.\n\nNow I can solve this equation for 'n'. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by (n +1) to get rid of the denominator:\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n51n + 78 = 54n + 54.\n\nHmm, let's subtract 51n from both sides:\n78 = 3n + 54.\n\nThen, subtract 54 from both sides:\n24 = 3n.\n\nSo, n = 8. Oh wait, that's the number of matches before the finals. But the question asks for the total number of matches after the finals, which is n +1. So 8 +1 =9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's plug back into the original numbers.\n\nIf n=8 before finals:\nTotal runs before =51 *8=408.\n\nAfter finals, total runs=408+78=486.\n\nNumber of matches now=9.\n\nAverage=486/9=54, which matches the given condition.

Because average = total runs / number of innings. So total runs = average * innings. So runs_before = 51 * n.\n\nAfter the finals, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs become runs_before + 78. And his number of innings is now n+1. His new average is 54, so:\n\n54 = (51n + 78) / (n + 1)\n\nI can set up this equation and solve for n.\n\nMultiplying both sides by (n+1):\n\n54(n + 1) = 51n + 78\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n54n + 54 = 51n + 78\n\nSubtract 51n from both sides:\n\n3n +54 =78\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n3n = 24\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nn = 8\n\nWait, so n is 8. But wait, that's the number of matches before the finals. So total matches is n +1, which is 9. So the answer should be 9, which is option C.\n\nLet me double-check. Before finals, he played 8 matches, total runs 51 *8 = 408. Then he scores 78, so total runs 486. Number of innings is 9. 486 /9 =54. Yep, that works.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of matches Sachin played in the IPL season, we start by using the concept of batting average. The batting average is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Runs}}{\\text{Number of Innings}}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( n \\) represent the number of matches Sachin played before the finals. His total runs before the finals would then be \\( 51n \\), since his average is 51. After the finals, he scores 78 runs, making his total runs \\( 51n + 78 \\). The total number of innings becomes \\( n + 1 \\), and his new average is 54. Using the formula for the new average:\n\n\\[\n54 = \\frac{51n + 78}{n + 1}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( n + 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n54(n + 1) = 51n + 78\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n54n + 54 = 51n + 78\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 51n \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3n + 54 = 78\n\\]\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3n = 24\n\\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n\\[\nn = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, Sachin played 8 matches before the finals. Including the finals, the total number of matches is \\( n + 1 = 9 \\). Verifying, his total runs before the finals are \\( 51 \\times 8 = 408 \\), and after scoring 78 runs, his total runs are \\( 408 + 78 = 486 \\). Dividing by the total innings \\( 9 \\), his average is \\( 486 / 9 = 54 \\), confirming the solution.\n\nAnswer: C",

Then, in the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his average goes up to 54. We need to find out how many matches he's played in total this season.\n\nHmm, batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of matches, right? So, average = total runs / number of matches. \n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'n'. His current average is 51, so the total runs he has before the finals would be 51 * n. \n\nThen, in the finals, he scores 78 runs. So, his new total runs become 51n + 78. And the number of matches becomes n + 1 because he played one more match.\n\nNow, his new average is 54. So, the equation should be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54\n\nI think that's the right setup. Now I need to solve for n.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (n+1):\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n + 1)\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54\n\nSo,\n\n51n +78 =54n +54\n\nHmm, let's subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n +54\n\nThen subtract 54 from both sides:\n\n78-54 =3n \u2192 24=3n \u2192 n=8\n\nWait, so n is 8. That means he played 8 matches before the finals. Then, after the finals, the total matches are 8+1=9.\n\nSo the total number of matches is 9. Looking at the options, option C is 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, initial average is 51, n=8. So runs before finals: 51*8=408.\n\nAfter finals, runs are 408+78=486.\n\nNumber of matches now is 9. So 486 /9 = 54. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of matches is 9, which is option C.\n",
