      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking, \"What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams?\" Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle it. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that \"of\" in math usually means multiplication. So, I need to calculate 60% of 30% and then multiply that by 1400 grams. Wait, no, actually, maybe it's 60% multiplied by 30% and then multiplied by 1400 grams. Or wait, maybe it's 60% of (30% of 1400 grams). Yeah, that makes sense because percentages are calculated in order. So first, find 30% of 1400, then take 60% of that result.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. So, 30% of 1400 grams. To find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal. So 30% is 0.3. Then, 0.3 times 1400. Let me calculate that: 1400 * 0.3. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1000 * 0.3 is 300, and 400 * 0.3 is 120, so adding them together, 300 + 120 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nNow, I need to find 60% of that 420 grams. Again, converting 60% to a decimal is 0.6. So, 420 * 0.6. Let me compute that. 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. Adding them together, 240 +12 equals 252. So, 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part: 30% of 1400. 1400 * 0.3 is indeed 420. Then, 60% of 420 is 420 * 0.6, which is 252. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options provided: A is 450, which is way too high. B is 100, which is way too low. C is 252, which matches my calculation. D is 240, which is close but not exactly what I got. E is none of these, but since C is correct, E isn't the right choice.\n\nSo the answer should be option C) 252 grams.\n",

First, I need to find 30% of 1400 grams, and then take 60% of that result. So it's a two-step process.\n\nWait, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh right, percentage means per hundred.

Let me think. \n\nWait, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I get it. So, the problem is asking for two successive percentages. First, 30% of 1400 grams, and then 60% of that result. Right?\n\nLet me break it down. First, find 30% of 1400 grams. I remember that to find a percentage, I can multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number. So, 30% is 0.3. So, 0.3 times 1400. Let me calculate that. 0.3 * 1400. Hmm, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 30% is 140 *3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 10% of 1400 is 140. So 30% is 3 times that, which is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. Again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.6. So 0.6 multiplied by 420. Let me calculate that. 420 *0.6. Let's see, 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20 *0.6 is 12. So 240 +12 is 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe I can do this in one step. Because 60% of 30% is the same as 0.6 *0.3, which is 0.18. So 18% of 1400 grams. Let me check that way. 1400 *0.18. Hmm, 1400 *0.1 is 140, and 1400 *0.08 is 112. So 140 +112 is 252. Oh, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 252 grams. Looking at the options, option C is 252 gms. So the correct answer is C.\n",

And there are five options to choose from, A to E. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that \"of\" in math problems usually means multiplication. So when they say 60% of something, that's 60% multiplied by that something. Same with 30% of something else. So the structure here is a bit nested. Let me rephrase the problem: I need to find 60% of (30% of 1400 grams).\n\nWait, so I should start by finding 30% of 1400 grams first, right? Because that's the inner part. Then take 60% of that result. That makes sense because percentages are applied sequentially.\n\nLet me calculate 30% of 1400 grams. To find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 30% is 0.30 in decimal form. So 0.30 multiplied by 1400 grams.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 1400 * 0.30. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 140 times 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nWait, that seems right. So the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. So again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.60. Now, multiply 420 by 0.60.\n\nWhat's 420 times 0.6? Well, 400 times 0.6 is 240, and 20 times 0.6 is 12. So 240 + 12 is 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, so the final result is 252 grams. Let me check the options. Option C is 252 gms. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. First, 30% of 1400. 1400 * 0.3. Let me compute that again. 1400 * 0.3 is indeed 420. Then 60% of 420: 420 * 0.6. 420 times 0.6. Let me compute it as (400 *0.6) + (20*0.6) = 240 +12 = 252. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied 0.6 * 0.3 first and then multiplied by 1400. Because 60% of 30% is the same as (0.6 * 0.3) = 0.18. Then 0.18 * 1400 = ?\n\nLet me try that approach. 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, 1400 * 0.08 is 112. So 140 + 112 is 252. Oh, same result. So that's another way to approach it, which confirms the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is 252 grams, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is: What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? And there are five options to choose from, A to E. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this by breaking it down step by step.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that \"of\" in math problems usually means multiplication. So when they say 60% of something, that's 60% multiplied by that something. Same with 30% of something else. So the structure here is a bit nested. Let me rephrase the problem: I need to find 60% of (30% of 1400 grams).\n\nWait, so I should start by finding 30% of 1400 grams first, right? Because that's the inner part. Then take 60% of that result. That makes sense because percentages are applied sequentially.\n\nLet me calculate 30% of 1400 grams. To find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 30% is 0.30 in decimal form. So 0.30 multiplied by 1400 grams.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 1400 * 0.30. Hmm, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 divided by 10 is 140, so 140 times 3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.\n\nWait, that seems right. So the next step is to find 60% of that 420 grams. So again, I'll convert 60% to a decimal, which is 0.60. Now, multiply 420 by 0.60.\n\nWhat's 420 times 0.6? Well, 400 times 0.6 is 240, and 20 times 0.6 is 12. So 240 + 12 is 252. So 60% of 420 grams is 252 grams.\n\nWait, so the final result is 252 grams. Let me check the options. Option C is 252 gms. So that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. First, 30% of 1400. 1400 * 0.3. Let me compute that again. 1400 * 0.3 is indeed 420. Then 60% of 420: 420 * 0.6. 420 times 0.6. Let me compute it as (400 *0.6) + (20*0.6) = 240 +12 = 252. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied 0.6 * 0.3 first and then multiplied by 1400. Because 60% of 30% is the same as (0.6 * 0.3) = 0.18. Then 0.18 * 1400 = ?\n\nLet me try that approach. 1400 * 0.18. Hmm, 1400 * 0.1 is 140, 1400 * 0.08 is 112. So 140 + 112 is 252. Oh, same result. So that's another way to approach it, which confirms the answer.\n\nSo the correct answer is 252 grams, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. \n\n1.
