Then, find the number?\" The options are A)84, B)66, C)28, D)19, E)11.\n\nHmm, I think I can solve this by breaking it down step by step. Let me see. The problem involves fractions of a number, so I need to translate the words into an equation.\n\nSo the problem says one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Let me represent the number as 'x' for easier calculation. So, 3/4 of x would be (3/4)x. Then, one third of that is (1/3) of (3/4)x. So the equation would be (1/3)*(3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me write that out: (1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21. Hmm, maybe I can simplify that. The 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator will cancel each other out. So, (1/3)*(3/4) becomes (1/4). So the equation simplifies to (1/4)x = 21.\n\nOh, right! So to find x, I need to multiply both sides by 4. Let's do that. 4*(1/4)x = 4*21. That simplifies to x = 84. So the number must be 84.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, 3/4 of x is (3/4)x. Then, one third of that is (1/3)*(3/4)x. Multiplying those fractions: 1/3 times 3/4. The 3s cancel, leaving 1/4. So yes, that's (1/4)x =21. Multiply both sides by 4, x=84. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by working backward. If 21 is one third of 3/4 of the number, then 21 is (1/3)*(3/4)x. So, 21 is (1/4)x, so x is 84. Yep, same result. I think I'm confident now that the correct answer is 84, which is option A.\n",

Let me represent the unknown number with a variable. Let's say the number is 'x'. So, the problem is saying that when we take one third of three fourths of x, the result is 21. \n\nWait, let me write that down in equation form. So, one third of (3/4 of x) equals 21. That would be (1/3) * (3/4 * x) = 21. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me compute the left side of the equation first. So, (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 x). Let me calculate that. Multiplying 1/3 and 3/4. The 3s cancel out, right? Because 1/3 times 3 is 1, and then 1 times 1/4 is 1/4. So, the equation simplifies to (1/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, no, wait a minute. Let me double-check that. So, (1/3) multiplied by (3/4 x) equals (1/3)*(3/4) x. The 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator cancel each other out.

So I'm confident that A is the correct answer.\n\n\nThe problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Let the unknown number be \\( x \\). \n\n1. Translate the condition into an equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}x = 21\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the fractions:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   So, the equation becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}x = 21\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( x \\):  \n   Multiply both sides by 4:  \n   \\[\n   x = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n   \\]\n\n4. Verify the solution:  \n   - 3/4 of 84 is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 84 = 63 \\).  \n   - One third of 63 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 63 = 21 \\), which matches the given condition.\n\nThus, the number is **84**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

Let's call that number 'x' for now.\n\nThe problem says one third of 3/4 of x is 21. Wait, so I'm taking a portion of another portion of x. Let me write that out in equation form. One third of something is 21. That something is 3/4 of x. So, the equation would be (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, first, I take 3/4 of x.

If I take 3/4 of x, that's (3/4)x. Then, one third of that is (1/3)*(3/4 x). The 3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving (1/4)x. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as percentages. 3/4 is 75%, and one third is about 33.33%. So 75% of x is multiplied by 33.33% to get 21. But that might complicate things more. Let's stick to fractions.\n\nAnother way: Let's compute 3/4 of x. Let's say x is 84. Then 3/4 of 84 is (3*84)/4. 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 is 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21. Yep, that matches the given condition. So 84 is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be option A.\n",

Let's call that number 'x' for now.\n\nThe problem says one third of 3/4 of x is 21. Wait, so I'm taking a portion of another portion of x. Let me write that out in equation form. One third of something is 21. That something is 3/4 of x. So, the equation would be (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, first, I take 3/4 of x. Let's call that part A. Then, I take one third of part A, and that equals 21. So yeah, the equation is (1/3)*(3/4 x) = 21.\n\nNow, let's compute that. Multiplying 1/3 and 3/4. Hmm, 1/3 times 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12. Oh wait, 3/12 simplifies to 1/4. So the equation becomes (1/4)x = 21.\n\nSo, (1/4)x equals 21. To find x, I need to solve for it. That means I multiply both sides of the equation by 4. So, x = 21 *4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is 84. So x is 84.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 84. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the problem: one third of 3/4 of x is 21. So, (1/3)*(3/4 x) = 21. Simplifying the fractions: 1/3 *3/4 is 3/12, which is 1/4. So 1/4 x =21. Multiply both sides by 4: x=84. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach it step by step. Let me think. If I take 3/4 of x, that's (3/4)x. Then, one third of that is (1/3)*(3/4 x). The 3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving (1/4)x. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as percentages. 3/4 is 75%, and one third is about 33.33%. So 75% of x is multiplied by 33.33% to get 21. But that might complicate things more. Let's stick to fractions.\n\nAnother way: Let's compute 3/4 of x. Let's say x is 84. Then 3/4 of 84 is (3*84)/4. 84 divided by 4 is 21, multiplied by 3 is 63. Then, one third of 63 is 21. Yep, that matches the given condition. So 84 is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the unknown number be \\( x \\). The problem states that one third of 3/4 of \\( x \\) is 21. This can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4}x = 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}x = 21\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nx = 21 \\times 4 = 84\n\\]\n\nThus, the number is 84, which corresponds to option A. Verifying, 3/4 of 84 is 63, and one third of 63 is indeed 21, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: A",
