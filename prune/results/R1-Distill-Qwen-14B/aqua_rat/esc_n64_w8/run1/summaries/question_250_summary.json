Hmm, right, capacity usually refers to the volume, so I need to calculate the volume of the tank.\n\nWait, volume of a rectangular tank is length multiplied by width multiplied by height. So the formula is V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h. Let me plug in the numbers. Length is 8m, width is 6m, height is 2.5m. So 8 times 6 is 48, then 48 times 2.5.\n\nHmm, what's 48 times 2.5? Well, 48 times 2 is 96, and 48 times 0.5 is 24. So adding them together, 96 + 24 = 120. So the volume is 120 cubic meters. But wait, the options are in liters. Oh right, I need to convert cubic meters to liters.\n\nWait, I remember that 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters. Because a liter is 1000 cubic centimeters, and 1m\u00b3 is 1,000,000 cm\u00b3, which is 1000 liters. So if the volume is 120 m\u00b3, then it's 120 \u00d7 1000 liters. That would be 120,000 liters.

So the correct answer should be D.\n\nWait a second, did I make any mistakes in the calculation? Let me double-check. 8\u00d76 is 48, that's right. 48\u00d72.5: 2.5 is the same as 5/2, so 48 \u00d75 is 240, divided by 2 is 120. Yes, that's correct. Then 120 m\u00b3 is 120,000 liters.

Wait, but 1 liter is 1000 cm\u00b3. So 120,000,000 cm\u00b3 is 120,000 liters. So same result. So either way, same answer.\n\nSo the correct option is D.\n\n\nThe capacity of the tank refers to its volume, which can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}.\n\\]\n\nGiven the dimensions of the tank as \\(8 \\, \\text{m} \\times 6 \\, \\text{m} \\times 2.5 \\, \\text{m}\\), the volume is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = 8 \\times 6 \\times 2.5 = 120 \\, \\text{cubic meters}.\n\\]\n\nTo convert the volume from cubic meters to liters, note that \\(1 \\, \\text{cubic meter} = 1000 \\, \\text{liters}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n120 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{liters/cubic meter} = 120,000 \\, \\text{liters}.\n\\]\n\nAmong the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 120 litres**  \n**B) 1200 litres**  \n**C) 12000 litres**  \n**D) 120000 litres**  \n**E) None of these**\n\nThe calculated volume matches option D, \\(120,000 \\, \\text{liters}\\). Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
