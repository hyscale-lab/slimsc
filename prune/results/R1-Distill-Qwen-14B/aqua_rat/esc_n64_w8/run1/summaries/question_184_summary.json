      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nWait, so the number is greater than 36 by some amount, and that same amount is how much less it is than 86. So, like, if the number is X, then X is 36 plus something, and also 86 minus the same something. Oh right, because it's as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. So that something must be the same in both cases.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the number is X. So X = 36 + a, where 'a' is the amount it's greater than 36. And also, X is equal to 86 - a, because that same 'a' is the amount it's less than 86. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because if X is a above 36, then it's also a below 86. So those two equations should be equal.\n\nSo putting it together: 36 + a = X and 86 - a = X. Since both equal X, they should be equal to each other. So 36 + a = 86 - a. Now I can solve for a. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nAdding a to both sides: 36 + a + a = 86. That's 36 + 2a = 86. Then subtract 36 from both sides: 2a = 86 - 36. 86 minus 36 is 50. So 2a = 50. Dividing both sides by 2 gives a = 25.\n\nOkay, so the number X is 36 + 25, which is 61. Let me check that. If X is 61, then it's 25 greater than 36 (36 +25=61) and 25 less than 86 (86-25=61). Yeah, that works.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 61. So the answer should be D.\n",

The number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and it's also less than 86 by the same amount. So the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. Oh, right, that makes sense.\n\nSo if I let the number be x, then the amount it's greater than 36 is x - 36. And the amount it's less than 86 is 86 - x. And these two amounts are equal because the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. So I can set up an equation: x - 36 = 86 - x.\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's add x to both sides to get rid of the negative x on the right. So x + x -36 = 86. That simplifies to 2x -36 =86.\n\nThen, I'll add 36 to both sides: 2x = 86 +36.

The question says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down.\n\nSo, the number is greater than 36 by a certain amount, and at the same time, it's less than 86 by the same amount. Wait, so the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. That makes sense because it's saying the number is equally distant from 36 and 86 in some way.\n\nLet me think in terms of equations. Let's call the number x. The problem states that x is greater than 36 by some amount, let's say 'd'. So, x = 36 + d. Similarly, since it's less than 86 by the same amount d, that would mean x = 86 - d. Oh, wait, because if it's less than 86 by d, then 86 minus x is d, so x is 86 minus d.\n\nSo now I have two expressions for x:\n\n1. x = 36 + d\n2. x = 86 - d\n\nSince both equal x, I can set them equal to each other. So, 36 + d = 86 - d. Now I can solve for d.\n\nLet me subtract 36 from both sides: d = 86 - d - 36. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step. So, 36 + d = 86 - d. Let's bring all the d terms to one side and the numbers to the other. So, I'll add d to both sides: 36 + d + d = 86. That becomes 36 + 2d = 86. Then, subtract 36 from both sides: 2d = 86 - 36, which is 50. So, 2d = 50. Divide both sides by 2: d = 25.\n\nNow that I know d is 25, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find x. Let's take the first one: x = 36 + d. So, x = 36 + 25 = 61. Alternatively, using the second equation, x = 86 - d = 86 -25 = 61. Both give the same result, which is good.\n\nSo the number should be 61. Looking at the options, option D is 61. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check. If the number is 61, how much greater is it than 36? 61 - 36 is 25. And how much less is it than 86? 86 - 61 is 25. Oh yeah, that's correct. Both differences are the same. So that's definitely right.\n",
