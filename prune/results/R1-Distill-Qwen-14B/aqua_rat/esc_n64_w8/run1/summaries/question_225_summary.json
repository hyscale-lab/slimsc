      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a rectangular parking space. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that a rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space in square feet.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. A rectangle has four sides: two lengths and two widths. If three sides are painted, that means one side is not painted. So, the unpainted side is 9 feet. But wait, which side is unpainted? It could be either a length or a width.\n\nI think I should draw a rectangle. Let's assume the rectangle has length L and width W. Now, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So two sides are length L, and two are width W.\n\nIf three sides are painted, that could mean either:\n1. Two lengths and one width are painted. So the unpainted side is the other width.\nOR\n2. Two widths and one length are painted. So the unpainted side is the other length.\n\nWait, the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So depending on which case we're in, the 9 feet is either a length or a width.\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is a width (W =9). Then the painted sides would be two lengths (each L) and one width (W). So the total painted length would be L + L + W = 2L + W.\n\nWe know the sum of painted sides is 37 feet. So:\n\n2L + W =37\n\nAnd since W is 9, substitute:\n\n2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14.\n\nThen the area would be L * W =14 *9=126 square feet.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is a length (L=9). Then the painted sides would be two widths (each W) and one length (L). So total painted length is W + W + L = 2W + L.\n\nSum is 37, so:\n\n2W + L =37\n\nBut L is 9, so:\n\n2W +9=37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14.\n\nThen area is L * W =9 *14=126.\n\nWait, so both cases give the same area.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a rectangular parking space. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that three of its sides are painted, and the unpainted side is 9 feet long. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space in square feet.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, a rectangle has four sides, right? Two sides are of one length, and the other two are of another length. So, if it's a rectangle, let's say the lengths are length and width. Let me denote them as L and W for now.\n\nThe problem mentions that three sides are painted. Wait, but which sides? Since it's a rectangle, if they paint three sides, the fourth one is left unpainted. So, the unpainted side is 9 feet. I need to figure out whether this unpainted side is a length or a width.\n\nHmm, there are two possibilities here. Either the unpainted side is the length (L) or the width (W). Let me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unpainted side is the length (L) = 9 feet. Then, the painted sides would consist of the other three sides. In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So, if one side is length L, the opposite is also L. Similarly for the width W.\n\nWait, but if three sides are painted, that would include two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width, depending on which side is unpainted.\n\nWait, let me think. If the rectangle is like a long strip, the three painted sides could be two of the widths and one length. Or if the rectangle is tall and narrow, the three painted sides could be two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. Let's imagine the rectangle as a standard one. Let's say the top and bottom are lengths, and the left and right are widths.\n\nIf the unpainted side is a length (the bottom, for example), then the painted sides would be the top length, the left width, and the right width. So, that would be L + W + W = L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width (the left side, for example), then the painted sides would be the top length, the bottom length, and the right width. So, that would be 2L + W.\n\nSo, the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, depending on which side is unpainted, the equation changes.\n\nLet me write this down.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted side is length (L) = 9 ft.\n\nThen, painted sides are L + 2W = 37 ft.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the unpainted side is the length, then the other painted sides would be the two widths and the other length. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, that's not right. If the unpainted side is a length, then the other length is painted. So, the painted sides are the two widths and the other length.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the rectangle is ABCD, with AB and CD as the lengths, and BC and DA as the widths.\n\nIf the side AB is unpainted, then the painted sides are BC, CD, and DA. So, that would be BC (width W) + CD (length L) + DA (width W). So, sum is L + 2W = 37.\n\nBut in this case, since AB is unpainted, AB = L = 9.\n\nSo, substituting L =9, equation becomes 9 + 2W = 37. So, 2W = 37-9 =28. So W=14.\n\nThen, the area would be L * W =9 *14=126 sq ft.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is a width (W) =9 ft.\n\nIn this case, the painted sides would be two lengths and one width.\n\nSo, equation would be 2L + W =37.\n\nSince W=9, substituting: 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14.\n\nThen, area is L*W=14*9=126 again.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is the same? That's interesting. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area comes out to 126.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the equations.\n\nIn case 1: Unpainted side is L=9. Painted sum is L +2W=37 \u2192 9+2W=37 \u2192 W=14. Area=9*14=126.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is W=9. Painted sum is 2L + W=37 \u2192 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area=14*9=126.\n\nSo, either way, the area is 126. So the answer should be option C) 126.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is 126. So the correct answer is C.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the painted sides could be arranged differently? For example, if the rectangle is a square, but that's a different case. But in this problem, it's a rectangle, so length and width are different.\n\nAnother point: The problem says three sides are painted. So it's possible that the configuration is two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. So the two cases I considered earlier. But in both cases, the area ends up the same.\n\nSo, the area is 126 square feet. So the correct answer is C.\n",

I need to find the area of the parking space in square feet.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, a rectangle has four sides, right? Two sides are of one length, and the other two are of another length. So, if it's a rectangle, let's say the lengths are length and width. Let me denote them as L and W for now.\n\nThe problem mentions that three sides are painted. Wait, but which sides? Since it's a rectangle, if they paint three sides, the fourth one is left unpainted. So, the unpainted side is 9 feet. I need to figure out whether this unpainted side is a length or a width.\n\nHmm, there are two possibilities here. Either the unpainted side is the length (L) or the width (W). Let me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unpainted side is the length (L) = 9 feet. Then, the painted sides would consist of the other three sides. In a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So, if one side is length L, the opposite is also L. Similarly for the width W.\n\nWait, but if three sides are painted, that would include two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width, depending on which side is unpainted.\n\nWait, let me think. If the rectangle is like a long strip, the three painted sides could be two of the widths and one length. Or if the rectangle is tall and narrow, the three painted sides could be two lengths and one width.\n\nWait, no. Let me get this straight. Let's imagine the rectangle as a standard one. Let's say the top and bottom are lengths, and the left and right are widths.\n\nIf the unpainted side is a length (the bottom, for example), then the painted sides would be the top length, the left width, and the right width. So, that would be L + W + W = L + 2W.\n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width (the left side, for example), then the painted sides would be the top length, the bottom length, and the right width. So, that would be 2L + W.\n\nSo, the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, depending on which side is unpainted, the equation changes.\n\nLet me write this down.\n\nCase 1: Unpainted side is length (L) = 9 ft.\n\nThen, painted sides are L + 2W = 37 ft.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the unpainted side is the length, then the other painted sides would be the two widths and the other length. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, that's not right. If the unpainted side is a length, then the other length is painted. So, the painted sides are the two widths and the other length.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the rectangle is ABCD, with AB and CD as the lengths, and BC and DA as the widths.\n\nIf the side AB is unpainted, then the painted sides are BC, CD, and DA. So, that would be BC (width W) + CD (length L) + DA (width W). So, sum is L + 2W = 37.\n\nBut in this case, since AB is unpainted, AB = L = 9.\n\nSo, substituting L =9, equation becomes 9 + 2W = 37. So, 2W = 37-9 =28. So W=14.\n\nThen, the area would be L * W =9 *14=126 sq ft.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is a width (W) =9 ft.\n\nIn this case, the painted sides would be two lengths and one width.\n\nSo, equation would be 2L + W =37.\n\nSince W=9, substituting: 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14.\n\nThen, area is L*W=14*9=126 again.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is the same? That's interesting. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area comes out to 126.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the equations.\n\nIn case 1: Unpainted side is L=9. Painted sum is L +2W=37 \u2192 9+2W=37 \u2192 W=14. Area=9*14=126.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted side is W=9. Painted sum is 2L + W=37 \u2192 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area=14*9=126.\n\nSo, either way, the area is 126. So the answer should be option C) 126.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is 126. So the correct answer is C.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the painted sides could be arranged differently? For example, if the rectangle is a square, but that's a different case. But in this problem, it's a rectangle, so length and width are different.\n\nAnother point: The problem says three sides are painted. So it's possible that the configuration is two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. So the two cases I considered earlier. But in both cases, the area ends up the same.\n\nSo, the area is 126 square feet. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given information about the rectangular parking space. A rectangle has two lengths (L) and two widths (W). The problem states that three sides are painted, and the unpainted side is 9 feet. The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. We need to determine the area of the parking space.\n\n### Case 1: Unpainted side is the length (L = 9 ft)\nIf the unpainted side is the length, the painted sides consist of the other length and both widths. Thus, the equation for the painted sides is:\n\\[\nL + 2W = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( L = 9 \\):\n\\[\n9 + 2W = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14\n\\]\nThe area of the parking space is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126 \\, \\text{sq ft}\n\\]\n\n### Case 2: Unpainted side is the width (W = 9 ft)\nIf the unpainted side is the width, the painted sides consist of both lengths and the other width. Thus, the equation for the painted sides is:\n\\[\n2L + W = 37\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( W = 9 \\):\n\\[\n2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14\n\\]\nThe area of the parking space is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126 \\, \\text{sq ft}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIn both cases, whether the unpainted side is the length or the width, the area of the parking space is \\( 126 \\, \\text{sq ft} \\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular parking space. Hmm, let's see. They painted three of its sides, right? So the fourth side is unpainted. The length of that unpainted side is 9 feet. Also, the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space in square feet.\n\nWait, rectangles have two pairs of equal sides. So, let me think: in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if they painted three sides, maybe two of them are one length and the third is the other length. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, let's visualize this. Suppose the rectangle has length L and width W. Let's say the sides are arranged as L, W, L, W. So, if three sides are painted, which sides are they? Maybe two of one dimension and one of the other. So, either the two lengths and one width are painted, leaving the other width unpainted, or the two widths and one length are painted, leaving the other length unpainted.\n\nThe problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So, if the unpainted side is the width, then W =9. Or if it's the length, then L=9. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the sum of the painted sides. If the unpainted side is a length, then the painted sides would be two widths and one length. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the unpainted side is a length, then the painted sides would include both widths and one length. Because the three painted sides would be two widths and one length. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the rectangle has four sides: L, W, L, W. If the unpainted side is a length (L), then the other three sides are both W and one L. So the painted sides would be W + L + W = 2W + L. And the sum of these is 37. So 2W + L =37. And the unpainted side is L=9.\n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width (W=9), then the painted sides are L + W + L = 2L + W. So the sum would be 2L +9 =37. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: unpainted is L=9. Then painted sum is 2W +9=37. So 2W=37-9=28, so W=14. Then the area would be L*W=9*14=126.\n\nSecond scenario: unpainted is W=9. Then painted sum is 2L +9=37. So 2L=28, L=14. Then area is 14*9=126 again.\n\nWait, so in both cases, the area is 126. So regardless of which side is unpainted, the area remains the same. Interesting.\n\nSo the options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None. So the correct answer would be C)126.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the first case: if the unpainted side is L=9, then painted sides are two W and one L. So 2W + L=37. So 2W +9=37. 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9 *14=126.\n\nSecond case: unpainted is W=9, so painted sides are two L and one W. 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126. Yeah, same result.\n\nSo either way, the area is 126. So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, consider a rectangular parking space with length \\( L \\) and width \\( W \\). Since three sides are painted and one side is unpainted, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Unpainted side is the length (\\( L = 9 \\)):**  \n   The painted sides would include two widths and one length.
