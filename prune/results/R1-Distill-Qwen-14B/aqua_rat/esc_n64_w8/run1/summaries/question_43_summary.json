      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question here: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Hmm, I remember that percentage reduction involves figuring out how much the value has decreased relative to the original. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the amount of reduction. The original number is 120, and it's reduced to 96. So the reduction is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that: 120 - 96 equals 24. Oh wait, right, so the reduction amount is 24.\n\nNow, I need to find what percentage 24 is of the original number, which is 120. I think the formula for percentage reduction is (Reduction / Original) multiplied by 100. So that would be (24 / 120) * 100.\n\nLet me compute that. 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 24 divided by 120. Well, 120 goes into 24 zero times, but wait, maybe I should think of it as 24/120. Oh, that's the same as 1/5, because 24 times 5 is 120. So 1/5 is 0.2. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, that's 20%. \n\nSo the reduction is 20%. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes I get confused whether to use the original or the new value for the percentage. Oh right, percentage reduction is always based on the original value, so yes, it's 24 over 120.\n\nLooking at the options: A is 30%, B is 40%, C is 20%, D is 10%, E is 5%. So the correct answer should be option C, 20%.\n",

Hmm, I need to figure this out.\n\nWait, reduction percentage. So I think that's asking what percentage decrease happened when 120 went down to 96. Right, so the formula for percentage decrease is [(Original - New)/Original] * 100, right? So I subtract the new value from the original, then divide by the original, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The original is 120, and the new is 96.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? Hmm, let me think. I remember that percentage reduction involves figuring out how much the original number was decreased by, then expressing that decrease as a percentage of the original.\n\nWait, right. So the formula I think is: percentage reduction = (decrease / original) \u00d7 100. So first, I need to find the amount of decrease. The original number is 120, and it's reduced to 96. So the decrease is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that: 120 - 96 is 24. Oh right, so the decrease is 24.\n\nNow, I take that decrease and divide by the original number. So 24 divided by 120. Let me do that division. 24 \u00f7 120 equals... Hmm, 24 divided by 120 is the same as 24/120. Let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 12. 24 \u00f712 is 2, and 120 \u00f712 is 10. So it's 2/10, which is 0.2.\n\nThen I multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 0.2 \u00d7 100 is 20. So the reduction is 20%.\n\nLet me double-check. If 20% of 120 is subtracted, what's the result? 20% of 120 is (20/100)*120 = 24. So 120 -24 is 96. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So the answer should be 20%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%. So C is 20% which is what I calculated. I think that's correct.\n\n\nTo determine the reduction percentage when 120 is reduced to 96, we first calculate the decrease:  \n\\[\n\\text{Decrease} = 120 - 96 = 24\n\\]  \nNext, we find the percentage reduction using the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Reduction} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Decrease}}{\\text{Original}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]  \nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Reduction} = \\left( \\frac{24}{120} \\right) \\times 100 = 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\%\n\\]  \nThus, the reduction percentage is **20%**, which corresponds to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",

The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%.\n\nHmm, right. I think this is about percentage decrease. So when something is reduced, the percentage reduction is calculated based on the original amount. I remember the formula for percentage decrease is ((Original Value - New Value)/Original Value) * 100%. That makes sense because you're finding out how much has been taken away relative to the original.\n\nSo the original value here is 120, and the new value is 96. Let me plug these into the formula. Subtracting the new from the original: 120 minus 96. Let me do that math. 120 minus 96 is 24. So the decrease is 24. Now, I need to find what percentage 24 is of the original 120.\n\nSo I take 24 divided by 120. Let me compute that. 24 divided by 120. Hmm, 120 goes into 24 0.2 times because 120 times 0.2 is 24. Alternatively, 24 divided by 120 is the same as 0.2. To convert that to a percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.2 * 100 equals 20%. So the reduction is 20%. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I take 20% of 120, that's 0.2 * 120 = 24. So subtracting 24 from 120 gives 96, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%, so that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the formula. No, because percentage decrease is always based on the original value, so I did it right. So the answer should be C.\n",
