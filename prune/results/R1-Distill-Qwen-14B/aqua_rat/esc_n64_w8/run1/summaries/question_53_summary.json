      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box, and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round?\n\nHmm, so I think I need to break this down. First, let's parse the numbers.\n\nFive dozen toys per box. Wait, a dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that. 5 * 12 equals 60. So each box holds 60 toys.\n\nThen, each tempo carries 98 boxes. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. But each box has 60 toys, so how many toys can one tempo carry? Oh right, I need to multiply 98 boxes by 60 toys per box.\n\nLet me do that math. 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 * 60. Let me think: 98 times 6 is 588, so adding a zero makes it 5880. So one tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nWait, wait. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys. Now, the question is asking how many tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys in one round.\n\nSo I need to find how many times 5880 goes into 29400. That's the same as dividing 29400 by 5880.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 5880 times 5 is 29400 because 5880 *5 is 29400. So that means 5 tempos would be needed.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If one tempo is 5880, then 2 tempos would be 11760, 3 tempos would be 17640, 4 tempos would be 23520, 5 tempos would be 29400. Yep, that adds up. So 5 tempos are needed.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5. So the answer should be B.\n",

So, first, I should figure out how many toys each tempo can carry.\n\nWait, each box has five dozen toys. A dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 * 12. Let me calculate that. 5 times 12 is 60. So each box contains 60 toys.\n\nNext, each tempo has 98 boxes. So the number of toys per tempo would be 98 boxes multiplied by 60 toys per box. Let me do that math: 98 * 60.

Hmm, I think a tempo is like a type of vehicle, maybe a truck or van used for transporting goods. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. Since each box has 60 toys, I should find out how many toys one tempo can carry in one round. That would be the number of boxes in a tempo multiplied by the number of toys per box.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. \n\nThe question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box, and 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round? The options are A)4, B)5, C)7, D)6, E)8.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break this down. First, I need to find out how many toys each tempo can carry. Then, see how many tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys in total.\n\nWait, so the first part is about toys per box. It says five dozen toys per box. Oh right, a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 5 * 12 is 60. So each box holds 60 toys.\n\nNext, each tempo carries 98 boxes. So if each box has 60 toys, then 98 boxes would have 98 multiplied by 60 toys. Let me do that multiplication. Hmm, 98 * 60. I can think of 100 *60 is 6000, so subtract 2*60, which is 120. So 6000-120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nWait, the question is asking how many tempos are needed to carry 29400 toys. So I need to find how many times 5880 goes into 29400. That's the number of tempos required.\n\nSo I'll divide 29400 by 5880. Let me write that as 29400 \u00f7 5880. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this division. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 10 first. 29400 \u00f710 is 2940, and 5880 \u00f710 is 588. So now it's 2940 \u00f7 588.\n\nHmm, let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 12. Wait, 588 \u00f712 is 49 because 49*12 is 588. And 2940 \u00f712 is 245 because 245 *12 is 2940. So now it's 245 \u00f749. Which is 5. Because 49*5=245. \n\nWait, so that means each tempo carries 5880 toys, and 29400 divided by 5880 is 5. So 5 tempos are needed. So the answer should be option B)5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Sometimes I might make a mistake in division.\n\nAlternative approach: 5880 *5 = 29400. Yes, that's correct. So 5 tempos would carry exactly 29400 toys. So the answer is 5, which is option B.\n",

I think \"tempo\" here refers to a type of vehicle, maybe a truck or something used for transporting goods. So, the problem is probably about calculating how many such vehicles are needed to carry a certain number of toys.\n\nAlright, the question says: Five dozen toys are packed in a box. So, first, I need to find out how many toys are in each box. Wait, a dozen is 12, right? So five dozen would be 5 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 5 * 12 = 60. So each box contains 60 toys.\n\nNext part: 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. Oh, so one tempo can carry 98 boxes. Since each box has 60 toys, I can find out how many toys a single tempo can carry. That would be 98 boxes * 60 toys per box. Let me do that multiplication. 98 * 60. Hmm, 98 * 60 is the same as 98 * 6 * 10. 98 * 6 is... 588, right? Because 100*6 is 600, minus 2*6 which is 12, so 600-12=588. Then multiply by 10 gives 5880. So one tempo can carry 5880 toys in one round.\n\nThe question is asking how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. So I need to find out how many tempos are required to carry a total of 29,400 toys. \n\nSo, I think I should divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry. That is, 29400 divided by 5880. Let me calculate that. \n\nLet me see, 5880 times 5 is 29,400 because 5000*5 is 25,000 and 880*5 is 4400, so 25,000 + 4,400 = 29,400. Oh, wait, that can't be right because 5880 * 5 would be 29,400. Wait, yes, 5880 * 5 = 29,400. So that would mean 5 tempos are needed.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. 5880 multiplied by 5: 5000*5=25,000; 800*5=4,000; 80*5=400. Wait, no, wait, 5880 is 5000 + 800 + 80? No, 5880 is 5000 + 800 + 80? Wait, 5000 + 800 is 5800, plus 80 is 5880. So 5000 *5=25,000. 800*5=4,000. 80*5=400. Adding them together: 25,000 + 4,000 is 29,000 plus 400 is 29,400. Yes, that's correct. So 5880 *5=29,400.\n\nSo that means 5 tempos can carry 29,400 toys. So the answer should be option B, which is 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Because sometimes when I do math quickly, I might miss a step.\n\nAlternative approach: 29400 divided by 5880. Let's do that division. 29400 \u00f7 5880.\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying the division. Both numbers are divisible by 10, so that becomes 2940 \u00f7 588.\n\nWait, 588 *5 = 2940. Because 500 *5=2500, 88*5=440, so 2500+440=2940. So yes, 588 *5 =2940. Therefore, 5880 *5 =29400.\n\nSo the number of tempos needed is 5. That's option B.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be B)5.\n\n\nTo determine how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round, we start by calculating the number of toys per box and per tempo. \n\n1. **Toys per box**: Since five dozen toys are packed in a box, and one dozen equals 12, the number of toys per box is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ toys per box.}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Toys per tempo**: Each tempo carries 98 boxes. Therefore, the number of toys one tempo can carry is:\n   \\[\n   98 \\times 60 = 5880 \\text{ toys per tempo.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of tempos needed**: To find how many tempos are required to carry 29,400 toys, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys one tempo can carry:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{29400}{5880} = 5.\n   \\]\n\nThus, 5 tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round.\n\nAnswer: B",
