      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the new man's weight.\n\nWait, average weight. So the average is total weight divided by the number of people. So, the original average must be the total weight of the 10 oarsmen divided by 10. When one person leaves and a new one comes in, the total number remains 10, right? So the average goes up by 1.8 kg.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the original total weight is T. So the original average is T/10. After replacing one person, the new total weight is T - 53 + new man's weight. Let's call the new man's weight x. So the new average is (T -53 + x)/10.\n\nThe problem says this new average is 1.8 kg higher than the original. So,\n\n(T -53 + x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8\n\nHmm, let me write that equation down. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nT -53 + x = T + 18\n\nWait, because 1.8 times 10 is 18. So,\n\nT -53 + x = T + 18\n\nI can subtract T from both sides, so T cancels out. That leaves:\n\n-53 + x = 18\n\nThen, adding 53 to both sides:\n\nx = 18 +53 = 71.\n\nSo the new man must weigh 71 kg. Let me check the options. Option A is 71. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the setup. The original average is T/10. The new average is (T -53 + x)/10, which is (T -53 +x)/10. The difference is 1.8, so (T -53 +x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8. That's correct. Then, multiplying both sides by 10 gives T -53 +x = T + 18. Subtract T, get -53 +x=18, so x=71. Yep, that makes sense. So the new man is 71 kg. So the correct option is A.\n",

Oh right, there are 10 oarsmen in a boat, and their average weight increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find out the weight of this new man. The options are A to E, with some numbers. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. The average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So initially, there are 10 oarsmen, right? Let me think about the initial average. The average increases by 1.8 kg when one person is replaced. \n\nWait, so the new average is the old average plus 1.8. But how does replacing one person affect the total weight? Oh, right, because when you replace someone, you subtract their weight and add the new person's weight. So the change in total weight is the difference between the new person's weight and the old person's weight. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote the old total weight as T. So the initial average is T/10. When we replace the 53 kg man with someone new, the new total weight becomes T - 53 + W, where W is the new man's weight. The new average is (T -53 + W)/10. \n\nThe problem says that the average increases by 1.8 kg. So the new average is (T/10) + 1.8. \n\nLet me write that as an equation. \n\n(T -53 + W)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8 \n\nHmm, okay. Let me solve this. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators. \n\nT -53 + W = T + 18 \n\nWait, because 1.8 *10 is 18. \n\nNow, subtract T from both sides. \n\n-53 + W = 18 \n\nSo, W = 18 +53 \n\nWhich is 71. So the new man weighs 71 kg. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 71. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. \n\nThe initial total is T. After replacement, it's T -53 + W. The change in average is 1.8 kg over 10 people, so the total increases by 1.8 *10 =18 kg. \n\nSo, (T -53 + W) - T =18 \u2192 W -53 =18 \u2192 W=71.

So the new man is 71 kg.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the weight of a new man who replaces one of the oarsmen, causing the average weight of 10 oarsmen to increase by 1.8 kg. \n\nTo solve this, note that the average weight increase for 10 oarsmen implies a total weight increase of:\n\n\\[\n1.8 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 10 = 18 \\, \\text{kg}.\n\\]\n\nThe old man weighed 53 kg, and his replacement caused the total weight to increase by 18 kg. Let the weight of the new man be \\( X \\). The net change in total weight is:\n\n\\[\nX - 53 = 18.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[\nX = 53 + 18 = 71 \\, \\text{kg}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So the average weight is the total weight of all the men divided by 10.

Oh right, the new man's weight plus the total of the other nine equals the new total. So the original total was 10A. The new total is (10A - 53) + new man's weight.

Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, the average is going up when someone is replaced. So, the total weight must have gone up by a certain amount. Let me think about averages. The average is the total weight divided by the number of people. Since the number of oarsmen remains the same (10), the change in average will be due to the change in total weight.\n\nOriginally, the average was (Total weight)/10. After replacing one person, the average becomes (Total weight - 53 + new weight)/10. And this new average is 1.8 kg more than the original.\n\nSo, the equation would be: original average + 1.8 = new average.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of total weight. The original total is 10 times the original average. When we replace one person, the total becomes original total minus 53 plus the new weight. The new average is (original total -53 + new weight)/10.\n\nThe difference between the new average and the old average is 1.8 kg. So, the new average is original average + 1.8.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( (Total -53 + x) ) /10 = (Total /10) +1.8\n\nWait, because the average increases by 1.8, so the new average is old average plus 1.8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the difference in total weight. The average increases by 1.8 kg for 10 people, so the total increase is 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nBecause when the average increases by 1.8 kg, the total increases by 1.8 * number of people. Since the number is 10, 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nSo the total weight after replacement is 18 kg more than before. But the only change is replacing someone who weighed 53 kg with a new person. So the new total is original total minus 53 plus x, where x is the new man's weight.\n\nSo the difference between the new total and the old total is (new total) - (old total) = x -53.\n\nBut we know that this difference is 18 kg. So x -53 =18.\n\nSolving for x: x= 53+18 =71 kg.\n\nSo the new man's weight is 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about oarsmen's weights. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nWait, the average is going up when someone is replaced. So, the total weight must have gone up by a certain amount. Let me think about averages. The average is the total weight divided by the number of people. Since the number of oarsmen remains the same (10), the change in average will be due to the change in total weight.\n\nOriginally, the average was (Total weight)/10. After replacing one person, the average becomes (Total weight - 53 + new weight)/10. And this new average is 1.8 kg more than the original.\n\nSo, the equation would be: original average + 1.8 = new average.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think in terms of total weight. The original total is 10 times the original average. When we replace one person, the total becomes original total minus 53 plus the new weight. The new average is (original total -53 + new weight)/10.\n\nThe difference between the new average and the old average is 1.8 kg. So, the new average is original average + 1.8.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n( (Total -53 + x) ) /10 = (Total /10) +1.8\n\nWait, because the average increases by 1.8, so the new average is old average plus 1.8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the difference in total weight. The average increases by 1.8 kg for 10 people, so the total increase is 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nBecause when the average increases by 1.8 kg, the total increases by 1.8 * number of people. Since the number is 10, 1.8 *10 = 18 kg.\n\nSo the total weight after replacement is 18 kg more than before. But the only change is replacing someone who weighed 53 kg with a new person. So the new total is original total minus 53 plus x, where x is the new man's weight.\n\nSo the difference between the new total and the old total is (new total) - (old total) = x -53.\n\nBut we know that this difference is 18 kg. So x -53 =18.\n\nSolving for x: x= 53+18 =71 kg.\n\nSo the new man's weight is 71 kg. Looking at the options, option A is 71.\n\n\nThe average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one crew member weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man. To find the new man's weight, we calculate the total increase in weight. Since the average increases by 1.8 kg for 10 oarsmen, the total increase is:\n\n\\[\n1.8 \\times 10 = 18 \\, \\text{kg}.\n\\]\n\nThis total increase comes from replacing the 53 kg crew member with the new man. Let the new man's weight be \\( x \\). The difference in weight is:\n\n\\[\nx - 53 = 18.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 53 + 18 = 71 \\, \\text{kg}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the new man is 71 kg, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
