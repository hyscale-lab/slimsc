      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit nervous because ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe problem says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. Hmm, right. So if the ratio is 3:5, that means the first number is 3 parts and the second is 5 parts. I remember that ratios can be represented as fractions or by using variables. Maybe I should assign variables to these numbers.\n\nLet me call the smaller number 3x and the larger one 5x. Yeah, that makes sense because if I take x as a common factor, then 3x:5x simplifies to 3:5. That should work.\n\nNow, the next part of the problem says if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. Oh wait, so both numbers are reduced by 9. So the new numbers become (3x - 9) and (5x - 9), and their ratio is 12:23.\n\nSo I can set up an equation here. The ratio of (3x -9) to (5x -9) is 12/23. So, (3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. To do that, I'll cross-multiply. Let's see:\n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow the equation is 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nLet me get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Subtract 60x from both sides:\n\n69x -60x -207 = -108 \u2192 9x -207 = -108.\n\nNow add 207 to both sides:\n\n9x = (-108) + 207. Let me calculate that. 207 minus 108 is 99. So 9x = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nSo x is 11. Now, the smaller number is 3x, which is 3*11=33. Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me plug the numbers back into the original problem to verify.\n\nOriginal numbers: 3x=33, 5x=55. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46.\n\nNow, 24:46 simplifies. Let's see, both are divisible by 2. 24/2=12, 46/2=23. So the ratio is 12:23, which matches the problem statement. That's correct.\n\nWait a second, but looking at the options given, option B is 33, which is the smaller number. So the answer should be B.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nLet me recount the cross-multiplication step.\n\n(3x -9)/(5x -9) = 12/23 \u2192 23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\nSo 23*3x is 69x, 23*(-9)= -207. On the right, 12*5x=60x, 12*(-9)= -108.\n\nSo equation is 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nSubtract 60x: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdd 207: 9x = 99 \u2192 x=11. Correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 3x=33. So yes, the answer is B.\n",

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me think about ratios. When two numbers are in a ratio, I can represent them as multiples of some common factor. So if the original ratio is 3:5, maybe the numbers are 3k and 5k, where k is a positive integer. That makes sense because multiplying both parts by the same number keeps the ratio the same.\n\nSo, let's assign variables. Let the two numbers be 3k and 5k. Now, the problem says that when we subtract 9 from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So after subtracting 9, the numbers become (3k - 9) and (5k - 9). The ratio of these new numbers is 12:23.\n\nI can set up an equation based on this ratio. The ratio of (3k -9) to (5k -9) is 12/23. So, (3k -9)/(5k -9) = 12/23.\n\nTo solve for k, I can cross-multiply. So, 23*(3k -9) = 12*(5k -9). Let me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: 23*3k is 69k, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69k -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5k is 60k, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60k -108.\n\nNow, the equation is 69k -207 = 60k -108.\n\nLet me bring like terms together. Subtract 60k from both sides: 9k -207 = -108.\n\nThen add 207 to both sides: 9k = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: k = 11.\n\nWait, so k is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3k and 5k. So 3*11 is 33, and 5*11 is 55. So the two numbers are 33 and 55. The question asks for the smaller number, which is 33.\n\nLet me double-check. Subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24, 55-9=46. What's the ratio of 24:46? Let's see, both are divisible by 2. 24/2=12, 46/2=23. Yep, that gives 12:23, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33.

That's correct.\n\nSo the smaller number is 33, which is option B.\n\n\nThe two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, so let the numbers be \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\). When 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes \\(12:23\\). Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9).\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n9x - 207 = -108 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 9x = 99 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 11.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 11\\) into the original numbers, the smaller number is \\(3x = 3 \\times 11 = 33\\).

Because ratios can be represented by multiplying a common factor. So, if the ratio is 3:5, then any multiple of these would maintain the ratio. So, the numbers are 3x and 5x.\n\nThe problem says that if 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from both, the new numbers are (3x-9) and (5x-9).

Wait, no, 108 + 90 is 198, plus 9 is 207. So 207 -108 is 99.\n\nSo 9x = 99. Then x = 11.\n\nSo the original numbers are 3x and 5x. So 3*11 is 33, and 5*11 is 55.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. We need to find the smaller number. Hmm, okay, I'll break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two numbers are in a ratio, we can represent them as multiples of that ratio. So, if the ratio is 3:5, I can write the numbers as 3x and 5x, where x is some common multiplier. That makes sense because 3x divided by 5x is 3/5, which is the given ratio.\n\nNext, the problem states that if 9 is subtracted from each number, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So, subtracting 9 from the first number gives 3x - 9, and from the second gives 5x - 9. The ratio of these new numbers is 12:23. So, I can set up an equation: (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I'll cross-multiply. So, 23*(3x - 9) equals 12*(5x - 9). Let's compute both sides.\n\nCalculating the left side: 23*(3x) is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So, left side is 69x - 207.\n\nRight side: 12*(5x) is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So, right side is 60x - 108.\n\nNow, bringing all terms to one side. Let me subtract 60x from both sides and add 108 to both sides. So:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108\n69x - 60x = -108 + 207\n9x = 99\n\nWait, let me check that subtraction again. 69x minus 60x is 9x. On the right side, -108 + 207 is 99, so 9x = 99. So, x is 99 divided by 9, which is 11. So, x equals 11.\n\nNow that I have x, I can find the original numbers. The smaller number is 3x, so 3*11 is 33. The larger is 5x, which is 55. Let me check if subtracting 9 gives the new ratio.\n\n33 minus 9 is 24, and 55 minus 9 is 46. So the new ratio is 24:46. Let me simplify that. Both numbers are divisible by 2, so 12:23. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So the calculations are correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, B is 33. So the smaller number is 33, right? Let me double-check the options. The options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58. So yes, B is the answer.\n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that ratios can be expressed using variables. Since the original ratio is 3:5, I can let the numbers be 3k and 5k, where k is some constant. That makes sense because 3k divided by 5k is 3/5, which is the given ratio.\n\nNow, the problem says when we subtract 9 from each number, the new ratio is 12:23. So, the new numbers would be (3k -9) and (5k -9). The ratio of these new numbers is 12:23. So I can set up an equation based on that.\n\nLet me write that out: (3k - 9)/(5k - 9) = 12/23. Hmm, now I need to solve for k. Cross-multiplying should work here. So, 23*(3k-9) equals 12*(5k-9).\n\nLet me compute both sides. On the left side: 23*3k is 69k, and 23*(-9) is -207. On the right side: 12*5k is 60k, and 12*(-9) is -108.\n\nSo the equation becomes 69k -207 = 60k -108. Now I need to collect like terms. Let's subtract 60k from both sides: 69k -60k is 9k, so 9k -207 = -108.\n\nThen, add 207 to both sides: 9k = (-108) + 207. Let me calculate that: 207 minus 108 is 99. So 9k = 99. Dividing both sides by 9, k = 11.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. 99 divided by 9 is 11, yeah. So k is 11. Now, the original numbers were 3k and 5k. So the smaller number is 3k, which is 3*11=33.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 33. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.
