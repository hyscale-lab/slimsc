      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about a square piece of cloth that's being trimmed and then cut into triangles, and we're supposed to find the original perimeter. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original shape is a square. So all sides are equal. Let's say each side is of length 's' feet. Then, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, trimming on one edge\u2014does that mean that one of the sides is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle? Because a square has four edges, so if you trim one edge by 4, the adjacent edges would still be the same, right?\n\nSo after trimming, the piece becomes a rectangle. The original square's sides were 's', so trimming one edge by 4 feet would make that side 's-4'. The other side remains 's' because we only trimmed one edge. So the rectangle has sides of 's' and 's-4' feet.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70 square feet. Since the rectangle is being cut diagonally, each triangle would have an area equal to half the area of the rectangle. So, the area of each triangle is 70, which means the area of the rectangle is 140.\n\nLet me write this down. The area of the rectangle is length times width. So that's s multiplied by (s-4). So:\n\ns * (s - 4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, it's s\u00b2 -4s = 140. So, s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for 's'. Let's see, using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (\u22124)^2 \u22124*1*(-140) ) ] / 2*1\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(576)] / 2\nsqrt(576) is 24, so:\n\ns = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n1) (4 +24)/2 = 28/2 =14.\n\n2) (4-24)/2= (-20)/2= -10.\n\nBut since length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet each. Therefore, the perimeter of the original square is 4 times the side, which is 4*14 =56 feet.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 56 is option A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes these problems can have a twist.\n\nWait, the problem says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. So when we trim one edge, the other edges are still the same. So the rectangle's sides are s and s-4. Then the area is s*(s-4)=140. Then s^2 -4s=140, leading to s^2-4s-140=0.\n\nSolving that gives s=14 as positive solution. So the original square has sides 14, perimeter 56, which is option A. But wait, the options don't have 56 as the first option? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A)56, B)58, etc. So 56 is an option. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else. Let me think again. Oh wait, the problem says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So the rectangle is s-4 by s. Then the area is 140. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but when the rectangle is cut diagonally, the area of each triangle is half the rectangle's area. So 140/2=70. So that's correct.\n\nSo yeah, the perimeter is 56, which is option A.\n",

When you trim 4 feet from one edge, you're making a rectangle. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. So if I trim 4 feet from one side, the new dimensions would be (original side length minus 4) and the original side length. Because you're only trimming one edge, the adjacent edge remains the same.\n\nSo, let me denote the original side length of the square as 's'. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangle's sides become (s - 4) and s. Because a square has all sides equal, right? So the rectangle is s by (s -4).\n\nNext, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. So the area of the rectangle must be twice that, which is 140 square feet. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle, their combined area is 140.\n\nWait, that makes sense.

So, s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me think about how to factor this, or maybe use the quadratic formula. Hmm, the quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 + 4*1*140 ) ] / (2*1). Let's compute the discriminant: 16 + 560 = 576. Oh, sqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2. So two possibilities: (4 +24)/2=28/2=14; (4-24)/2=-20/2=-10. Since length can't be negative, s must be 14 feet.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14 feet each.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then it's cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the original cloth is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's' feet. Then, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, which changes it into a rectangle. Wait, which edge? Oh, probably one pair of opposite edges, right? Because if you trim one edge, you might be reducing the length on both sides of that edge. Or wait, maybe it's just one side? Hmm, the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" So perhaps one edge is reduced by 4 feet. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the original square has sides of length 's'. If you trim one edge by 4 feet, the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and 's' feet on the adjacent side. Because you're only trimming one edge, so the opposite edge remains 's' feet, and the other two edges become 's-4' feet. So the rectangle is s by (s-4).\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. Since the rectangle is cut diagonally, each triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the sides of the rectangle.\n\nWait, the area of each triangle is 70. So the area of the entire rectangle must be 140, because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So area of rectangle is 140.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is length times width, so s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo, s(s-4) = 140 \u2192 s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. Hmm, let me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2 \u2192 because 4\u00b2 is 16, and 4*140 is 560. So sqrt(576) is 24. So s = [4 + 24]/2 = 28/2=14, or [4-24]/2=-10. Since length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square has sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4*14 =56 feet. Hmm, but wait, 56 is one of the options, option A. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the rectangle's sides are s and s-4. So if s=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10 (because 14-4=10). So area is 14*10=140, which makes each triangle 70. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe the trimming is done on one edge, which would affect two sides, each being reduced by 4 feet. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the original square is s on each side. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, does that make the rectangle have dimensions (s-4) and s? Or perhaps s and (s-4*2), because trimming 4 feet from each end of one side. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me visualize it.\n\nImagine a square cloth. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, say the left edge, then you're cutting off 4 feet from the left side, making the length along that side (s-4). The opposite side remains s feet. So the rectangle becomes s-4 by s.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to s=14. So the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. But I have a feeling that the correct answer might be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the quadratic equation.\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140=0. The discriminant is 16 + 560=576. sqrt(576)=24. So s=(4+24)/2=28/2=14. So yes, s=14.\n\nSo the perimeter is 4*14=56, option A. So why am I doubting this? Maybe because sometimes in these problems, the trimming is on both edges, but the question says only one edge.\n\nWait, another thought: when you trim 4 feet from one edge of a square, perhaps the resulting rectangle has sides (s-4) and s. So that's correct. Then the area is s*(s-4)=140. So s^2 -4s -140=0, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has sides 14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Maybe I'm miscalculating the area of the triangle. Each triangle has area 70, so the rectangle must be 140.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then it's cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\"\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, the original cloth is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's' feet. Then, it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, which changes it into a rectangle. Wait, which edge? Oh, probably one pair of opposite edges, right? Because if you trim one edge, you might be reducing the length on both sides of that edge. Or wait, maybe it's just one side? Hmm, the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" So perhaps one edge is reduced by 4 feet. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, the original square has sides of length 's'. If you trim one edge by 4 feet, the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and 's' feet on the adjacent side. Because you're only trimming one edge, so the opposite edge remains 's' feet, and the other two edges become 's-4' feet. So the rectangle is s by (s-4).\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, making two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. Since the rectangle is cut diagonally, each triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the sides of the rectangle.\n\nWait, the area of each triangle is 70. So the area of the entire rectangle must be 140, because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So area of rectangle is 140.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is length times width, so s*(s-4) = 140.\n\nSo, s(s-4) = 140 \u2192 s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. Hmm, let me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2 \u2192 because 4\u00b2 is 16, and 4*140 is 560. So sqrt(576) is 24. So s = [4 + 24]/2 = 28/2=14, or [4-24]/2=-10. Since length can't be negative, s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square has sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4*14 =56 feet. Hmm, but wait, 56 is one of the options, option A. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the rectangle's sides are s and s-4. So if s=14, the rectangle is 14 by 10 (because 14-4=10). So area is 14*10=140, which makes each triangle 70. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So perhaps I misunderstood. Maybe the trimming is done on one edge, which would affect two sides, each being reduced by 4 feet. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the original square is s on each side. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, does that make the rectangle have dimensions (s-4) and s? Or perhaps s and (s-4*2), because trimming 4 feet from each end of one side. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me visualize it.\n\nImagine a square cloth. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, say the left edge, then you're cutting off 4 feet from the left side, making the length along that side (s-4). The opposite side remains s feet. So the rectangle becomes s-4 by s.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to s=14. So the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. But I have a feeling that the correct answer might be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the quadratic equation.\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140=0. The discriminant is 16 + 560=576. sqrt(576)=24. So s=(4+24)/2=28/2=14. So yes, s=14.\n\nSo the perimeter is 4*14=56, option A. So why am I doubting this? Maybe because sometimes in these problems, the trimming is on both edges, but the question says only one edge.\n\nWait, another thought: when you trim 4 feet from one edge of a square, perhaps the resulting rectangle has sides (s-4) and s. So that's correct. Then the area is s*(s-4)=140. So s^2 -4s -140=0, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has sides 14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check another approach. Maybe I'm miscalculating the area of the triangle. Each triangle has area 70, so the rectangle must be 140. So rectangle's area is 140.\n\nBut if the rectangle is s by (s-4), then yes, s(s-4)=140.\n\nWait, but maybe the rectangle is (s-4) by (s-4), but that would make it a square again, which doesn't make sense unless you trim both edges. Hmm, no, because the problem says it's trimmed on one edge, making a rectangle, not a square.\n\nSo I think my original approach is correct. So the perimeter is 56, option A.\n\n\nThe original piece of cloth is a square with side length \\( s \\). After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the resulting rectangle has dimensions \\( s \\) (unchanged side) and \\( s - 4 \\) (trimmed side). The area of this rectangle is \\( s(s - 4) \\). Since the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each triangle has an area of \\( 70 \\, \\text{ft}^2 \\), making the total area of the rectangle \\( 140 \\, \\text{ft}^2 \\). Thus, we solve the equation:\n\n\\[\ns(s - 4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\), the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-140)} = \\sqrt{16 + 560} = \\sqrt{576} = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-(-4) + 24}{2} = \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\quad \\text{(valid, as length cannot be negative)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-(-4) - 24}{2} = \\frac{-20}{2} = -10 \\quad \\text{(invalid, as length cannot be negative)}\n\\]\n\nSo, the original square has side length \\( s = 14 \\, \\text{ft} \\).

Let's read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the original shape is a square. Let's denote the side length of the square as 's' feet. So, the area of the square is s\u00b2, right?\n\nNow, the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, trimming by 4 feet on one edge... So, I think that means one side is reduced by 4 feet, making it a rectangle. Since the original is a square, all sides are equal. So, after trimming one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and s feet on the other. Because it's trimmed on one edge, I assume it's only one side that's cut by 4 feet, so the adjacent side remains the same.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. If it's a square, all four sides are the same. If we trim 4 feet from one edge, perhaps one pair of sides is reduced by 4. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me visualize it. Imagine a square, and you cut off 4 feet from one of its edges. So, the resulting shape is a rectangle where one pair of sides is shorter by 4 feet, and the other pair remains the same as the original square's sides.\n\nSo, the original square has sides of length s. After trimming, the rectangle has sides of (s) and (s - 4). Because you've taken away 4 feet from one edge, making that side shorter.\n\nNext step: this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet.\n\nWait, so each triangle's area is 70. Since the rectangle is cut diagonally, each triangle is a right-angled triangle. The area of a right triangle is (base * height) / 2. But in this case, the base and height would be the sides of the rectangle.\n\nWait, no, the base and height of the triangle are the same as the sides of the rectangle. So, the area of the rectangle would be (s) * (s -4), right? Because the area of the rectangle is length times width, which are s and (s-4).\n\nBut when you cut it diagonally, each triangle's area is half of the rectangle's area. So, area of each triangle is (s*(s-4))/2. And according to the problem, this is 70.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation: (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(s(s - 4)) / 2 = 70\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\ns(s - 4) = 140\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s = 140\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for s.\n\nQuadratic equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0\n\nI can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (-4)^2 -4*1*(-140) ) ] / 2*1\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\nb\u00b2 -4ac = 16 -4*(1)*(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576\n\nsqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo,\n\ns = [4 \u00b124 ] / 2\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\ns = (4 +24)/2 =28/2=14\n\ns = (4-24)/2 = (-20)/2= -10\n\nBut since the side length can't be negative, we discard s = -10. So, s=14.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if s is 14, then the rectangle would be 14 by 10 (since 14-4=10). The area of the rectangle would be 14*10=140. So each triangle would be 70, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the perimeter of the original square. The original square has side length s=14. The perimeter of a square is 4*s, so 4*14=56.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in my initial setup?\n\nWait, the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So, the rectangle's dimensions are s and (s-4). So, if s=14, then the rectangle is 14x10, which gives area 140. Then each triangle would be 70, which is correct.\n\nSo the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. Did I interpret the trimming correctly?\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the trimming is done on both edges, but that doesn't make much sense because the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\"\n\nAnother thought: Oh wait, perhaps the square is trimmed on one pair of edges, each by 4 feet. So, if the original square is s, after trimming, the rectangle would be (s-4) by (s-4). No, that can't be right because then it would still be a square, not a rectangle.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you trim 4 feet off one edge, you're only trimming one side, so the other side remains s. So the rectangle is s by (s-4). That's what I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: If the original square is s by s, and you trim 4 feet from each end of one side. Wait, but that would make the length of that side (s - 8). Hmm, but the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" That's a bit ambiguous. Does it mean you cut off 4 feet from one edge, making that side s-4, or 4 feet from each end of that edge, making that side s-8?\n\nWait, the wording says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" So, for a square, each edge is a side. So trimming 4 feet on one edge would mean that one side is reduced by 4 feet, making it s-4, while the adjacent side remains s. So the rectangle becomes s by (s-4).\n\nSo that brings us back to the original approach, leading to s=14, perimeter 56, option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because 56 is a lower number, and sometimes these problems have a twist. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. So the rectangle has sides s and (s-4). Then, the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each with area 70. So the area of the rectangle is 140, as each triangle is 70.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but I just thought about the diagonal cut. When you cut the rectangle diagonally, each triangle's area is half of the rectangle's area, which is correct. So the setup is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.\n\nLet me go through the quadratic again. s^2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2.\n\nWait, 16 + 560 is 576. sqrt(576)=24.\n\nSo s=(4+24)/2=28/2=14, and the other solution is negative, which we discard. So yes, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has a perimeter of 4*14=56. So the correct answer is option A, 56.\n",

Setting this equal to 70 gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s(s - 4)}{2} = 70\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 2:\n\n\\[\ns(s - 4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a square piece of cloth. Let me try to visualize it step by step. Hmm, the problem says the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, turning it into a rectangle. Then that rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, the original shape is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's' feet. So the area of the square is s squared, right?\n\nThen, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Wait, so trimming one edge by 4 feet would reduce the length of that side. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. So if you trim one edge by 4 feet, the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and s feet on the adjacent side. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So, perhaps it's either length or width that's reduced. But since it's a square, the original length and width are the same. Let me think: trimming one edge by 4 feet would make that side shorter by 4 feet, so the rectangle's dimensions are (s - 4) and s. Or wait, maybe it's s and (s - 4). Because when you trim one edge, you're reducing the length of that edge, so the adjacent side remains the same. So the rectangle becomes (s) by (s-4), because one side is s and the other is s minus 4.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. So each triangle is half of the rectangle's area. So the area of the rectangle is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet.\n\nWait, no. Because when you cut a rectangle into two triangles along the diagonal, each triangle has half the area of the rectangle. So if each triangle is 70, the rectangle's area is 140. So yes, the area of the rectangle is 140.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is (s) multiplied by (s-4), right? So:\n\ns * (s - 4) = 140.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\ns(s - 4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\ns^2 - 4s = 140.\n\nThen, bringing 140 to the left:\n\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0.\n\nHmm, so I need to solve this quadratic equation for s. Let's see, quadratic equation is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2. Wait, because the equation is s\u00b2 -4s -140=0. So a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nThe discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4(1)(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSquare root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative. So (4 + 24)/2 = 28/2 = 14. So s is 14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square had sides of 14 feet. Then the perimeter of the square would be 4 times that, which is 4*14=56 feet. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, A is 56. So that's one of the options. But wait, let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in setting up the equation? Let me double-check.\n\nThe rectangle after trimming has dimensions s and (s-4). So area s*(s-4)=140.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So s^2 -4s -140=0. Solving gives s=14. So the square was 14x14. Trimmed to 14x10, since 14-4=10. Area of rectangle is 14*10=140, which is correct. Then each triangle is 70. So that's correct.\n\nSo the original square's perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 56. But wait, the problem says the original cloth is a square. Let me see: is there any other possibility? Oh wait, perhaps I got the trimming wrong. Because the problem says it's trimmed on one edge, but which edge? Like, maybe it's trimmed on two edges? Or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.\" So it's just one edge that's trimmed. So the original square is s x s. After trimming one edge by 4, the rectangle is s x (s-4). So that's what I used. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo the perimeter is 4*s = 56, which is option A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Did I get the rectangle's dimensions correctly? Because the problem says the cloth is trimmed on one edge, so perhaps it's s-4 and s-4? No, wait, that can't be. Because if you trim one edge, only one dimension is reduced. Let me think again.\n\nImagine the square as a cloth. You have four edges. If you trim one edge by 4 feet, you're reducing the length of that edge. So, for example, the original square is s x s. If you trim one of the sides, say, the top edge, by 4 feet, the top edge becomes (s-4) in length. But the adjacent side remains s. So the rectangle's dimensions are s and (s-4). So when you cut this rectangle diagonally, each triangle has area 70.\n\nWait, no. Because when you cut a rectangle diagonally, the area of each triangle is half of the rectangle's area. So the rectangle's area must be 140, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo yes, the rectangle is s*(s-4)=140.\n\nSo solving s^2 -4s -140=0 gives s=14. So the perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A. So the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 60, which is the perimeter of a square with side 15. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me re-solve the quadratic equation.\n\ns\u00b2 -4s -140=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 + 4 * 140 ) ] / 2.\n\nWait, because the formula is (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)) / (2a). Here, a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nSo discriminant is (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSo sqrt(576)=24.\n\nSo s = [4 + 24]/2 = 28/2=14. So s=14. Correct.\n\nSo perimeter is 4*14=56. So answer is A.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the original cloth is a square, and after trimming, it's a rectangle. So when you cut the rectangle diagonally, you get two triangles each of area 70. So each triangle's area is (base * height)/2. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonal divides it into two congruent right-angled triangles. The area of each triangle is (length * width)/2.\n\nWait, so the area of the triangle is (s*(s-4))/2 =70.\n\nSo s*(s-4) =140.\n\nWhich brings me back to the same equation. So yes, s=14.\n\nSo the original square had sides of 14, perimeter 56. So the answer should be A)56.\n",

Hmm. \n\nThe question says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. The original shape is a square, so all sides are equal. Let's denote the length of each side of the square as 's'. So, the original perimeter would be 4s, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nFirst, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Since it's a square, trimming one edge by 4 feet would make that side shorter. So, the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and s feet on the adjacent side. Wait, no, wait a second. If you trim one edge, which is a side of the square, then the other side remains the same. So, if the square was s by s, trimming 4 feet from one side would make it (s -4) by s. Because you only trim one edge, so one dimension decreases by 4, the other stays the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you have a square, all sides are the same. If you trim 4 feet on one edge, that edge becomes (s-4) feet. But then, the adjacent edge is still s feet because you only trimmed one edge. So the rectangle becomes (s-4) by s. Because when you trim one edge, you're reducing one side but the other remains as it was.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is (s-4) * s. But then this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. So the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. Because when you cut a rectangle along the diagonal, each triangle is exactly half of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is twice the area of one triangle. So, area of rectangle = 2 * 70 = 140.\n\nSo, (s-4) * s = 140.\n\nNow, I need to solve for s. Let's write the equation:\n\ns*(s-4) = 140\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let's try to solve this. The quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 + 4*140 ) ] / 2. Because the equation is ax\u00b2 + bx +c=0, so here a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nWait, wait, the formula is s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a). Oh right, so in this case, b is -4.\n\nSo, b squared is (-4)^2 = 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140) = -560. So the discriminant is 16 + 560 (because 4ac is negative, so when you subtract it, it's 16 - (-560) which is 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSo sqrt(576) is 24. So, s = [4 \u00b124]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative. So, [4 +24]/2 = 28/2 =14. The other solution is [4-24]/2= (-20)/2= -10, which doesn't make sense. So s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square had sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 56. So that's the answer? But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, s=14. The rectangle is 14 by (14-4)=10. So 14*10=140, which is correct because each triangle is 70. So that's right.\n\nBut wait, the perimeter of the original square is 4*s=56. So the answer is 56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64. So 56 is option A. Hmm, but I thought maybe the answer is different. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, did I get the trimming correctly? The problem says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So if the original square is s, then the rectangle is s by (s-4). So area is s(s-4). That's correct.\n\nWait another thought: When you cut a rectangle diagonally into two triangles, the area of each triangle is half of the rectangle. So each triangle's area is (s*(s-4))/2 =70. So, s(s-4)=140, which is what I had. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo s=14, perimeter is 56, which is option A. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but why is option A the first one? Sometimes problems might have tricky parts. Did I miss something in the problem statement?\n\nLet me read the problem again. A square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to make a rectangle. Then, it's cut diagonally in half to make two triangles. Each triangle has area 70. So the area of the rectangle is 140, which is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the perimeter is 4*s=56.\n",

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. I need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. The original shape is a square, so all sides are equal. Let's denote the length of each side of the square as 's'. So, the original perimeter would be 4s, which is what we're trying to find.\n\nFirst, the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Since it's a square, trimming one edge by 4 feet would make that side shorter. So, the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet on one side and s feet on the adjacent side. Wait, no, wait a second. If you trim one edge, which is a side of the square, then the other side remains the same. So, if the square was s by s, trimming 4 feet from one side would make it (s -4) by s. Because you only trim one edge, so one dimension decreases by 4, the other stays the same.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if you have a square, all sides are the same. If you trim 4 feet on one edge, that edge becomes (s-4) feet. But then, the adjacent edge is still s feet because you only trimmed one edge. So the rectangle becomes (s-4) by s. Because when you trim one edge, you're reducing one side but the other remains as it was.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is (s-4) * s. But then this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. So the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle. Because when you cut a rectangle along the diagonal, each triangle is exactly half of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is twice the area of one triangle. So, area of rectangle = 2 * 70 = 140.\n\nSo, (s-4) * s = 140.\n\nNow, I need to solve for s. Let's write the equation:\n\ns*(s-4) = 140\ns\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let's try to solve this. The quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 =0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt( (4)^2 + 4*140 ) ] / 2. Because the equation is ax\u00b2 + bx +c=0, so here a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nWait, wait, the formula is s = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac) ] / (2a). Oh right, so in this case, b is -4.\n\nSo, b squared is (-4)^2 = 16. 4ac is 4*1*(-140) = -560. So the discriminant is 16 + 560 (because 4ac is negative, so when you subtract it, it's 16 - (-560) which is 16 + 560 = 576.\n\nSo sqrt(576) is 24. So, s = [4 \u00b124]/2.\n\nWe can ignore the negative solution because length can't be negative. So, [4 +24]/2 = 28/2 =14. The other solution is [4-24]/2= (-20)/2= -10, which doesn't make sense. So s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square had sides of 14 feet. So the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option A is 56. So that's the answer? But wait, let me check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, s=14. The rectangle is 14 by (14-4)=10. So 14*10=140, which is correct because each triangle is 70. So that's right.\n\nBut wait, the perimeter of the original square is 4*s=56. So the answer is 56, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, the choices are A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64. So 56 is option A. Hmm, but I thought maybe the answer is different. Let me see if I missed anything.\n\nWait, did I get the trimming correctly? The problem says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So if the original square is s, then the rectangle is s by (s-4). So area is s(s-4). That's correct.\n\nWait another thought: When you cut a rectangle diagonally into two triangles, the area of each triangle is half of the rectangle. So each triangle's area is (s*(s-4))/2 =70. So, s(s-4)=140, which is what I had. So the equation is correct.\n\nSo s=14, perimeter is 56, which is option A. So the answer is A.\n\nWait, but why is option A the first one? Sometimes problems might have tricky parts. Did I miss something in the problem statement?\n\nLet me read the problem again. A square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to make a rectangle. Then, it's cut diagonally in half to make two triangles. Each triangle has area 70. So the area of the rectangle is 140, which is correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the perimeter is 4*s=56.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the perimeter of the original square cloth. Let the side length of the square be \\( s \\). After trimming one edge by 4 feet, the dimensions of the resulting rectangle become \\( s \\) and \\( s - 4 \\). The area of the rectangle is therefore \\( s(s - 4) \\).\n\nThe rectangle is then cut diagonally into two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet. Since the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle, the total area of the rectangle is \\( 2 \\times 70 = 140 \\). Thus, we have the equation:\n\n\\[\ns(s - 4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging gives:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -140 \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-140)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 560}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis yields two solutions: \\( s = \\frac{4 + 24}{2} = 14 \\) and \\( s = \\frac{4 - 24}{2} = -10 \\). Since the side length cannot be negative, we have \\( s = 14 \\) feet.\n\nThe perimeter of the original square is \\( 4s = 4 \\times 14 = 56 \\) feet. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: A**",

Then this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break it down. First, the original shape is a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square 's'. So the original area is s squared, right?\n\nThen, they trim 4 feet from one edge. Wait, trimming on one edge would mean that one side becomes shorter. So if it's a square, all sides are equal. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, you're making that side (let's say the length) 4 feet shorter. So the new dimensions of the rectangle would be (s - 4) feet by s feet? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait a second. Because if you trim 4 feet from one edge, like maybe you have a square, and you cut off 4 feet from one of the sides, making that side shorter by 4. So the rectangle's length would be (s - 4) and the width would be s. Or is it the other way around? Hmm. Wait, the original is a square, so all sides are s. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, you're reducing the length of that edge by 4. So the rectangle's sides would be s and (s - 4). Wait, but which side is which? Like, if it's a square, the original is s by s. If you trim 4 feet from, say, the length, then the new length is s-4, and the width remains s. Or if you trim 4 from the width, then the width becomes s-4 and length remains s. Either way, the rectangle is s by (s-4). So that part I think is okay.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle's area is 70 square feet. So each triangle has area 70. Since the rectangle is being cut in half, the area of the rectangle would be twice that, so 140 square feet.\n\nWait, yes. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is 2 * 70 = 140.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is length times width, which is s * (s - 4) = 140.\n\nSo now I have an equation: s(s - 4) = 140. Let's write that as s^2 -4s = 140. Then, moving 140 to the left: s^2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for s. Hmm, quadratic equation. Let's see.\n\nThe quadratic is s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2. Because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-4, c=-140. So discriminant is (16) + 560 = 576. Square root of 576 is 24.\n\nSo s = [4 \u00b124]/2. So two solutions: (4+24)/2 = 28/2=14, and (4-24)/2= (-20)/2= -10. But since s is a length, it can't be negative. So s=14 feet.\n\nWait, so the original square was 14 feet on each side. So the perimeter of the square would be 4*s = 4*14=56 feet. But wait, the options given are A)56, B)58, etc. So 56 is option A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps. Original square of side s. Trim 4 feet on one edge, so the rectangle is s by (s-4). Area of rectangle is s*(s-4) =140. So s\u00b2 -4s =140. So s\u00b2-4s-140=0. Quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 +560)]/2. 16+560=576, sqrt is 24. So s=(4+24)/2=14. So perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. The question says it's trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. Does that mean that the new rectangle's sides are (s-4) and s, or is it (s-4) on both edges? No, no, because it's a square. Trimming 4 feet on one edge would only affect one side, making that side shorter by 4. So yes, the rectangle is s by (s-4), as I thought.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you cut the rectangle diagonally, you get two right-angled triangles. Each triangle's area is 70. So the area of the rectangle is 140. So my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the area of the triangle. The area of a right-angled triangle is (base * height)/2. The base and height would be the sides of the rectangle. So for the rectangle, length is s, width is (s-4). So the area is s*(s-4). So each triangle's area is (s*(s-4))/2 =70. So s*(s-4)=140. So the same equation as before. So yeah, s=14.\n\nSo the original square has sides of 14. So the perimeter is 4*14=56, which is option A. So the answer should be A)56.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options: the options are A)56, B)58, etc. So 56 is an option, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I got the rectangle dimensions wrong. Suppose the square is trimmed on one edge, meaning that one side is reduced by 4, but perhaps the other dimension is something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, the original cloth is a square. So all four sides are s. If you trim 4 feet from one edge, you're cutting off 4 feet from one side, but the adjacent sides remain the same. So the rectangle after trimming would have two sides of s, and two sides of (s-4). So the rectangle is s by (s-4). So that part is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw a diagram. Imagine a square: each side is s. Trim 4 feet from one edge, so that side becomes (s-4). So the rectangle has length s and width (s-4). So area is s*(s-4)=140.\n\nSo solving s^2 -4s -140=0. Solution s=14. So perimeter is 56.\n\nSo the answer should be A)56.\n",

Since the rectangle is being cut in half, the area of the rectangle would be twice that, so 140 square feet.\n\nWait, yes. Because each triangle is half of the rectangle. So the area of the rectangle is 2 * 70 = 140.\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is length times width, which is s * (s - 4) = 140.\n\nSo now I have an equation: s(s - 4) = 140.

Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. So, the original is a square. Let's say each side is length 's' feet. Then, one edge is trimmed by 4 feet. Wait, does that mean one side becomes shorter by 4 feet? Because when you trim one edge, you're reducing its length. So the original square has sides of 's' each. After trimming, one side becomes 's - 4' and the other remains 's', right? So the rectangle is s by (s-4) feet.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. Since the rectangle is split into two congruent triangles, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.\n\nWait, the area of the rectangle would be length times width, which is s*(s-4). So the area of each triangle is (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nSo, let's write that equation: (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nI can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. So, s(s-4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, s\u00b2 -4s = 140.\n\nThen, bringing 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nSo that's a quadratic equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2, because the equation is a s\u00b2 + b s + c = 0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nWait, let's compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4(1)(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576. Oh, 576 is a perfect square, because 24^2 is 576. So sqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo, s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2=14, and (4-24)/2 = (-20)/2 = -10.

Option A is 56. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nOriginal square: s=14. After trimming one edge by 4, the rectangle is 14 by 10. Area of rectangle is 14*10=140. Split into two triangles, each has area 70. That matches the given information. So the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)56, B)58, etc. So why is option A 56, which is the perimeter of the square. So that would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I'm solving quadratics, I might make a mistake.\n\nThe area of each triangle is 70. So the rectangle area is 140.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangle. Then, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half, creating two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. We need to find the perimeter of the original square cloth.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. So, the original is a square. Let's say each side is length 's' feet. Then, one edge is trimmed by 4 feet. Wait, does that mean one side becomes shorter by 4 feet? Because when you trim one edge, you're reducing its length. So the original square has sides of 's' each. After trimming, one side becomes 's - 4' and the other remains 's', right? So the rectangle is s by (s-4) feet.\n\nThen, this rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70. Since the rectangle is split into two congruent triangles, the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.\n\nWait, the area of the rectangle would be length times width, which is s*(s-4). So the area of each triangle is (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nSo, let's write that equation: (s*(s-4))/2 = 70.\n\nI can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator. So, s(s-4) = 140.\n\nExpanding that, s\u00b2 -4s = 140.\n\nThen, bringing 140 to the left: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nSo that's a quadratic equation: s\u00b2 -4s -140 = 0.\n\nI can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2, because the equation is a s\u00b2 + b s + c = 0, where a=1, b=-4, c=-140.\n\nWait, let's compute the discriminant: b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4(1)(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576. Oh, 576 is a perfect square, because 24^2 is 576. So sqrt(576) is 24.\n\nSo, s = [4 \u00b1 24]/2.\n\nWe have two solutions: (4 +24)/2 = 28/2=14, and (4-24)/2 = (-20)/2 = -10. But since length can't be negative, we take s=14 feet.\n\nSo the original square has sides of 14 feet. Therefore, the perimeter is 4*14=56 feet. Wait, but wait, let me check the options. Option A is 56. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me recheck the steps.\n\nOriginal square: s=14. After trimming one edge by 4, the rectangle is 14 by 10. Area of rectangle is 14*10=140. Split into two triangles, each has area 70. That matches the given information. So the perimeter of the original square is 4*14=56, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)56, B)58, etc. So why is option A 56, which is the perimeter of the square. So that would be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes when I'm solving quadratics, I might make a mistake.\n\nThe area of each triangle is 70. So the rectangle area is 140. The rectangle's area is s*(s-4)=140.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -4s -140=0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: s = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 560)] / 2. Oh yeah, sqrt(576)=24. So [4+24]/2=28/2=14. So s=14.\n\nPerimeter is 4*14=56. So yes, option A is correct.\n\n\nThe original piece of cloth is a square with side length \\( s \\). After trimming one edge by 4 feet, the dimensions of the resulting rectangle become \\( s \\) and \\( s-4 \\). The area of the rectangle is then \\( s \\cdot (s-4) \\). When the rectangle is cut diagonally into two triangles, each triangle has an area of 70 square feet. Since the area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s \\cdot (s-4)}{2} = 70\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 2 gives:\n\n\\[\ns \\cdot (s-4) = 140\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging:\n\n\\[\ns^2 - 4s - 140 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation.
