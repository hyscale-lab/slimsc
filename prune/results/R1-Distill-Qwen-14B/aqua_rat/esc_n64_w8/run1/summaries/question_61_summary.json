      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nAlright, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class. There are some percentages given for students interested in different sports, and some students aren't interested in any. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nSo, the problem states:\n- 8% of the total students are interested in Football.\n- 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket.\n- 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball.\n- The remaining 20 students aren't interested in any games.\n\nWait, I need to find the total number of students. Let's denote the total number as N. That might make it easier.\n\nLet me write down each part:\n\n1. Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n2. Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 0.8N\n3. Basketball: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N\n4. Not interested in any: 20 students \u2192 20\n\nWait, but wait a minute. If I add up all the students interested in the sports, plus the ones not interested, it should equal the total N. Because every student is either interested in at least one sport or none. So, the sum of all those should be N.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nFootball + Cricket + Basketball + Not interested = N\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n0.08N + 0.8N + 0.10N + 20 = N\n\nLet me compute the left side. Let's add the terms with N:\n\n0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 = (0.08 + 0.8) is 0.88, plus 0.10 is 0.98. So that's 0.98N.\n\nSo, the equation is 0.98N + 20 = N.\n\nHmm, now I can rearrange this to solve for N.\n\nSubtract 0.98N from both sides:\n\n20 = N - 0.98N\n20 = 0.02N\n\nSo, 0.02 times N equals 20. To find N, I divide both sides by 0.02.\n\nN = 20 / 0.02\n\nCalculating that: 20 divided by 0.02. Let's see, 0.02 is the same as 2 cents, so 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 *50 is 1000.\n\nWait, so N is 1000. Let me check the options. Option E is 1000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with percentages.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n0.08N (Football) + 0.8N (Cricket) + 0.10N (Basketball) = (0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10) N = 0.98N.\n\nSo, 0.98N + 20 = N \u2192 20 = 0.02N \u2192 N=20 / 0.02 \u2192 N=1000.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the total number of students is 1000. Looking at the options, E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says 4/5 are interested in Cricket. 4/5 is 0.8, which is 80%. So, 80% on Cricket, 8% on Football, 10% on Basketball. So adding up those percentages: 80 + 8 +10 = 98%. So 98% are interested in at least one sport, and 2% aren't, which is 20 students. So 2% of N is 20. So N is 20 / 0.02 = 1000. Yep, that makes sense.\n",

Let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, it says 8% of the total students are interested in Football. So if I let the total number of students be, say, N, then 8% of N is the number of football-interested students. That would be 0.08 * N.\n\nNext, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. So that's (4/5) * N. Hmm, 4/5 is the same as 0.8, so 80% of N are into cricket.\n\nThen, 10% of the total students are interested in Basketball. So that's 0.10 * N.\n\nAnd the remaining students, which is 20 students, are not interested in any games. So these are the students who don't like football, cricket, or basketball.\n\nWait a minute, but wait. Are the percentages given for football, cricket, and basketball overlapping? Like, could some students be interested in more than one sport? The way the question is phrased, I think it's assuming that each student is only counted once for each sport. Or maybe it's considering the total percentages without overlaps. Hmm, that's a bit unclear. But since the question doesn't mention any overlaps, perhaps it's intended that these percentages are mutually exclusive, except for the remaining 20 students. So, perhaps the sum of the interested students plus the 20 equals the total.\n\nWait, but that might not add up correctly. Let me think again. So, the problem states that 8% are interested in football, 80% in cricket, 10% in basketball, and the remaining 20 are not interested in any. So, the total percentage of interested students (football + cricket + basketball) plus the 20 uninterested should equal 100% of the total students.\n\nWait, but 8% + 80% + 10% is 98%. So that leaves 2%, right? Because 100% -98% is 2%. But the problem says that 20 students are not interested in any. So 2% of N equals 20 students. Oh, that makes sense. So, let's write that as an equation.\n\nSo, 2% of N is 20 students. That is, 0.02 * N = 20. Solving for N, we can divide both sides by 0.02. N equals 20 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 / 0.02 is the same as 20 * (100/2) = 20 * 50 = 1000. So N is 1000 students.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option E is 1000. So that would be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, 8% of 1000 is 80 students interested in football. 4/5 is 800 for cricket, 10% is 100 for basketball. Adding those up: 80 + 800 + 100 = 980. Then, the remaining students are 1000 - 980 = 20. Which matches the given information.

Let's convert all of these into percentages so it's easier to add them up.\n\n4/5 as a percentage is (4/5)*100 = 80%. So 80% are interested in Cricket. Football is 8%, Basketball is 10%.\n\nSo adding these up: 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. Oh, right, because 8+80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So 98% of the students are interested in at least one of these sports.

Therefore, the total number of students would be 100%, which is 100 times 1%, so 100 *10 =1000 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So 2% is 20. So the total is 20 / (2/100) ) = 20 * (100/2) ) = 20*50=1000. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, E is 1000. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says 4/5 are interested in Cricket. 4/5 is 0.8, which is 80%. So the percentages add up correctly. 8% +80%+10% is 98%, which leaves 2% for none, which is 20 students. So 2% =20, so 100% is 1000. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the total number of students is 1000, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, we analyze the given percentages and the remaining 20 students who are not interested in any games.\n\n1. **Convert the fractions and percentages to a common format**:\n   - 8% of students are interested in Football.\n   - \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) of students are interested in Cricket, which is equivalent to \\( 80\\% \\).\n   - 10% of students are interested in Basketball.\n\n2. **Calculate the total percentage of students interested in the sports**:\n   \\[\n   8\\% + 80\\% + 10\\% = 98\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the percentage of students not interested in any sports**:\n   \\[\n   100\\% - 98\\% = 2\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate the remaining 2% to the 20 students**:\n   \\[\n   2\\% \\text{ corresponds to } 20 \\text{ students.}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of students**:\n   \\[\n   1\\% \\text{ corresponds to } \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\text{ students.}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   100\\% \\text{ corresponds to } 10 \\times 100 = 1000 \\text{ students.}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of students in the class is **1000**, which corresponds to option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nHmm, so I need to find the total number of students. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's note down the given data:\n\n- Football: 8%\n- Cricket: 4/5 of total\n- Basketball: 10%\n- Not interested in any: 20 students\n\nSo, the total percentage of students interested in at least one of the games plus the 20 students not interested should add up to 100% of the total students.\n\nWait, but wait. Are all the percentages for the different games mutually exclusive? Or could there be overlaps? The question doesn't specify, but since it's asking for the total, and the remaining are 20, I think it's safe to assume that these percentages don't overlap, or that the sum of the interested percentages plus the 20 gives 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20 students are those not interested in any, so the sum of all the interested percentages should equal 100% minus the 20, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nTotal students = A + B + C + D, where D is the 20 students not interested.\n\nBut wait, A is 8% of total, B is 4/5, C is 10%, and D is 20. So, adding A + B + C + D should equal the total? No, that can't be right because A, B, C might have overlaps. But without information about overlaps, perhaps the problem assumes that all interested students are in one of the three categories, and the rest are 20. So, the sum of percentages (8% + 4/5 + 10%) plus the 20 equals 100% of total.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because percentages are parts of the total. Let me think in terms of equations.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as T.\n\nThen:\n\n- Number interested in Football = 0.08 T\n- Number interested in Cricket = (4/5) T\n- Number interested in Basketball = 0.10 T\n- Number not interested in any = 20\n\nAssuming that all students are either interested in at least one sport or not interested in any, so:\n\n0.08 T + (4/5) T + 0.10 T + 20 = T\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if all the students in the first three categories are distinct, then adding them plus 20 gives T. But if there are overlaps, this equation would overcount. But since the problem doesn't specify any overlaps and just asks for the total, perhaps this is the intended approach.\n\nSo, let me set up the equation:\n\n0.08 T + (4/5) T + 0.10 T + 20 = T\n\nLet me compute the sum of the coefficients:\n\n0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 = ?\n\nWait, 4/5 is 0.8.\n\nSo 0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, plus 0.10 is 0.98.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n0.98 T + 20 = T\n\nSubtract 0.98 T from both sides:\n\n20 = T - 0.98 T \u2192 20 = 0.02 T\n\nSo, T = 20 / 0.02 \u2192 20 divided by 0.02 is 1000.\n\nWait, 0.02 T =20 \u2192 T=20/0.02 \u2192 20 /0.02= 1000.\n\nSo T is 1000. So the answer should be E)1000.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if I did the percentages correctly.\n\nWait, 8% is 0.08, 4/5 is 0.8, 10% is 0.1. Adding those gives 0.98. So 0.98 T +20=T \u2192 T=1000.\n\nBut let me see the options. Option E is 1000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the sum of the percentages of students interested in each sport plus the uninterested students equals 100% of T.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the sum of the percentages could be more than 100% if there are overlaps. But without knowing the overlaps, perhaps the problem is intended to sum the percentages and add the uninterested 20 to get 100% T.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nThe percentage interested in any of the three sports is (8% + 4/5 + 10%) \u2192 but that would be 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. So 98% of the students are interested in at least one sport, and 2% (which is 20 students) are not. So 2% equals 20 \u2192 so T=20 / 0.02=1000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class?\n\nThe options are A) 850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the total number of students. Let's denote the total number as N. Because all the given percentages and fractions are of the total students, I can express each group in terms of N.\n\nFirst, the students interested in Football are 8% of N, which is 0.08N.\n\nThen, those interested in Cricket are 4/5 of N. Let me compute 4/5 as a decimal: 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. So that's 0.8N.\n\nBasketball is 10% of N, so that's 0.10N.\n\nThe remaining students, which is 20, are not interested in any. So that's N minus all the interested students equals 20.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Are there any overlaps? Like, are some students interested in more than one sport? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I should assume that each student is only counted once for their interests. Or wait, no, the question might not be about the union of the groups. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the sum of the interested students plus the uninterested equals the total. Because if the interested groups are overlapping, the sum could be more than N. But since the problem says 'interested in' each sport, perhaps it's the number of students in each category, possibly with overlaps. Oh, but the way the question is phrased, it's adding up the percentages and the remaining. So perhaps the way to approach this is to add up the percentages and see what's left.\n\nWait, let me think. The problem states that 8% are interested in Football, 4/5 (which is 80%) in Cricket, 10% in Basketball. The rest are 20 students.\n\nSo, the sum of the percentages of students interested in each sport plus the uninterested 20 should equal the total N.\n\nWait no, that's not right. Because if a student is interested in both Football and Cricket, they would be counted in both percentages. But the problem states that the remaining 20 are not interested in any games. So perhaps the total number of students is the sum of those interested in Football, Cricket, Basketball, and the 20 uninterested.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because if students can be interested in multiple sports, the sum of the percentages would be more than 100%, which would complicate things. But the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps, so maybe each student is only interested in one sport. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply adding the percentages and the remaining 20, so that the sum of the percentages plus 20 equals N.\n\nWait, let's calculate the sum of the percentages: 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%. So 98% of N are interested in at least one sport, and 2% are uninterested, which equals 20 students.\n\nSo, 2% of N equals 20.\n\nLet me write that equation: 0.02 * N = 20.\n\nTo find N, I can rearrange that: N = 20 / 0.02.\n\nCalculating that, 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 * 50, which is 1000.\n\nSo N is 1000 students. Looking at the options, E is 1000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If N is 1000, then:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 is 80 students.\n\nCricket: 80% is 800 students.\n\nBasketball: 10% is 100 students.\n\nAdding those up: 80 + 800 = 880, plus 100 is 980. Then the uninterested are 20, so 980 +20 =1000. That adds up correctly. So the answer should be E)1000.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. 0.08*1000=80, 0.8*1000=800, 0.1*1000=100. 80+800+100=980, and 20 uninterested. 980+20=1000.

The question says that 8% are interested in Football, 4/5 in Cricket, 10% in Basketball, and the remaining 20 students aren't interested in any games. I need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, let me break it down. So, percentages and fractions are involved. Maybe I should represent the total number of students as a variable, like let's say the total is N.\n\nFirst, 8% of N are into Football. So that's 0.08*N students. Then, 4/5 of N are interested in Cricket. 4/5 is the same as 0.8, so that's 0.8*N. Basketball has 10%, which is 0.10*N. \n\nNow, the rest are not interested in any games. So, the sum of all interested students plus the 20 students equals the total N. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the interested students plus the uninterested ones equal N. But the problem says the remaining 20 are not interested in any. So the sum of all interested categories should be N minus 20.\n\nLet me write this out as an equation. The sum of Football, Cricket, Basketball, and the uninterested students should be N. So:\n\n0.08N (Football) + (4/5)N (Cricket) + 0.10N (Basketball) + 20 (uninterested) = N.\n\nWait, but let me check: 4/5 is 0.8, so 0.8N is Cricket. So adding up all the interested groups: 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 equals what? Let me calculate that. 0.08 + 0.8 is 0.88, plus 0.10 makes 0.98. So 0.98N are interested in at least one sport.\n\nBut wait, the remaining 20 students are not interested in any, so that's N - 0.98N = 0.02N. And according to the problem, that's 20 students. So 0.02N = 20.\n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.02. So N = 20 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20 *50 is 1000. So N would be 1000 students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can have overlaps. Oh, wait! The problem doesn't specify whether the percentages are for students interested ONLY in those sports or the total interested in each. Oh, right, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the total interested in each sport, which could include overlaps. But since the problem doesn't provide information about overlaps, I think we're supposed to assume that the percentages are additive, even though that's not realistic in real life. Because in reality, some students might be interested in more than one sport, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can ignore that and just sum the percentages.\n\nSo according to that, 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.98, so 2% are uninterested, which is 20 students. So 2% of N is 20, so N is 1000. So looking at the options, E is 1000.

Another 10% like Basketball. And the rest, which is 20 students, aren't interested in any games. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, let me break this down. So, percentages and fractions are given for three sports, and the remaining are 20 students. I think I can model this with an equation.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. That's probably the variable I'll work with. \n\nSo, 8% of N are into Football. That's 0.08N. Then, 4/5 of N for Cricket. 4/5 is 0.8, so that's 0.8N. Basketball is 10%, which is 0.10N. And the remaining are 20 students who don't like any.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Do these percentages and fractions add up to more than 100%? Because if they do, that could complicate things. Let me check.\n\nAdding up the sports: 8% + (4/5) which is 80% + 10%. Oh wait, 8% is 0.08, 4/5 is 0.8, and 10% is 0.10. So adding them up: 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 equals 0.98, or 98%. So that leaves 2% of the students uninterested in any games. But the problem says the remaining 20 students are not interested. So 2% equals 20 students. That makes sense.\n\nWait, so 2% of N is 20. So I can write that equation: 0.02N = 20. Then, solving for N would give me the total number.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02N = 20 \u2192 N = 20 / 0.02. 20 divided by 0.02. Hmm, 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 20 divided by 2 hundredths is 20 * (100/2) \u2192 20 * 50 \u2192 1000. So N is 1000. \n\nWait, but let me double-check because the options are given. Option E is 1000.

So the sum of the sports-interested students is 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%, so 2% are 20 students. That makes N=1000.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many students are in the class. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAlright, the problem states that 8% of the total students are interested in Football. Then, 4/5 of the total are interested in Cricket. Another 10% like Basketball. And the rest, which is 20 students, aren't interested in any games. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of students.\n\nWait, let me break this down. So, percentages and fractions are given for three sports, and the remaining are 20 students. I think I can model this with an equation.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. That's probably the variable I'll work with. \n\nSo, 8% of N are into Football. That's 0.08N. Then, 4/5 of N for Cricket. 4/5 is 0.8, so that's 0.8N. Basketball is 10%, which is 0.10N. And the remaining are 20 students who don't like any.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Do these percentages and fractions add up to more than 100%? Because if they do, that could complicate things. Let me check.\n\nAdding up the sports: 8% + (4/5) which is 80% + 10%. Oh wait, 8% is 0.08, 4/5 is 0.8, and 10% is 0.10. So adding them up: 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.10 equals 0.98, or 98%. So that leaves 2% of the students uninterested in any games. But the problem says the remaining 20 students are not interested. So 2% equals 20 students. That makes sense.\n\nWait, so 2% of N is 20. So I can write that equation: 0.02N = 20. Then, solving for N would give me the total number.\n\nLet me compute that. 0.02N = 20 \u2192 N = 20 / 0.02. 20 divided by 0.02. Hmm, 0.02 is 2 hundredths, so 20 divided by 2 hundredths is 20 * (100/2) \u2192 20 * 50 \u2192 1000. So N is 1000. \n\nWait, but let me double-check because the options are given. Option E is 1000. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The way the problem is phrased, it says 8% are interested in Football, 4/5 in Cricket, 10% in Basketball, and the rest (20) in none. So the sum of the sports-interested students is 8% + 80% + 10% = 98%, so 2% are 20 students. That makes N=1000.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the total number of students is 1000, which is option E.\n\n\nTo determine the total number of students in the class, let the total number of students be denoted as \\( N \\).
