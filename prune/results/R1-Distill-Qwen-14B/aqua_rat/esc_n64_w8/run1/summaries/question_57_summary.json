      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow and has a size of 5cm. Wait, does that mean each edge is 5cm long? I think so. And the thickness is 1cm. Oh right, because it's made of smaller cubes of size 1cm each. So each edge of the big cube is 5 smaller cubes long, right? So the cube is like a shell with 1cm thickness, and the inside is empty.\n\nSo the big cube is 5x5x5 in terms of small cubes, but since it's hollow, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube (because 5-2=3, subtracting two layers from each side). So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is 3^3 = 27, so the number of small cubes that make up the structure is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, but the question is about the faces of the small cubes that are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the problem says the outer surface is painted. So any small cube on the surface will have some painted faces. But the ones inside the hollow part won't be painted because they're not on the outside. So the question is about the total number of faces of all the small cubes that are not painted.\n\nWait, each small cube has 6 faces. But when they are part of the big cube, some faces are on the inside (hollow) and some on the outside (painted). So the unpainted faces would be the ones that are on the inside of the big cube or maybe not exposed at all.\n\nWait, no. The outer surface is painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the exterior of the big cube gets painted. The faces that are inside the hollow part are unpainted, but also, the faces that are adjacent to other small cubes inside the structure (like the ones in the walls) would not be painted. So each small cube's face is either painted (if it's on the exterior) or not (if it's inside or adjacent to another cube).\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each face of the big cube. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cube faces. So each face has 25 small faces. Since the cube is painted on all outer surfaces, each face contributes 25 painted small cube faces. But wait, each small cube can contribute multiple painted faces if they are on corners or edges.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to count all the painted faces and subtract that from the total possible faces to find the unpainted ones. But wait, no, because each small cube's face is either painted or not. So the total number of small cube faces is 125 small cubes * 6 faces each = 750 faces. But since the cube is hollow, some of these faces are internal. Wait, but the hollow part is 3x3x3, so the inner part is 3^3=27 small cubes. Wait, no, that's the number of small cubes inside the hollow part. So for each small cube in the hollow, all their faces are internal and thus unpainted? Or are they?\n\nWait, no. The hollow part is empty, so the small cubes that are part of the structure (the walls) have some faces on the outside (painted) and some faces on the inside (unpainted). The inner faces of the hollow cube are the ones that are on the inner surfaces of the structure, but since the hollow is empty, those faces are not painted. So for each small cube in the structure, the faces that are on the inside of the hollow (adjacent to the empty space) are unpainted.\n\nSo perhaps I should calculate for each small cube in the structure, how many of their faces are unpainted, and sum all of those.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to think of the entire structure as a 5x5x5 cube, and the painted area is all the outer surfaces. The unpainted faces would be the ones that are inside the structure, not on the exterior, and not adjacent to the hollow. Or wait, no, the hollow's inner surfaces are unpainted as well.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about each face of the small cubes and determine whether it's painted or not. Each face of a small cube is either on the exterior of the big cube (painted) or internal (unpainted). So the total number of small cube faces is 125 *6 = 750. The number of painted faces is the total number of exterior faces of the big cube. The big cube has 6 faces, each of 5x5=25 small faces. So 6*25 = 150 painted small faces. So the number of unpainted small faces is 750 - 150 = 600. Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't include 600. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, because that approach doesn't account for the fact that some small cubes are inside the structure and their faces are adjacent to other small cubes or to the hollow. Hmm. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of small cube faces that are on the inside of the hollow structure. Because any face that's part of the hollow's inner surface is not painted. So for each face of the small cubes that are part of the structure, how many are on the inside?\n\nWait, the hollow cube is like a shell. Each face of the hollow cube is 3x3, because the hollow is 3cm on each side. So each face has 3x3=9 small cubes. Each of these has 5 faces (since one face is on the exterior of the big cube). Wait, no, perhaps I should think about each small cube in the hollow and the structure.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find the number of small cube faces that are on the interior of the hollow cube. The hollow cube is 3x3x3, so each face of the hollow cube has 3x3=9 small cube faces. But wait, these are the inner faces of the structure. So the total inner faces for all 6 sides would be 6 * 9 =54. But each face is counted once, but each small cube face is unique.\n\nWait, no. Because each small cube on the inner surface of the structure contributes one face to the hollow. So the total inner faces are 6*(3^2) = 54. So these are unpainted. Additionally, the small cubes on the edges and corners of the hollow structure have more than one face contributing to the inner surfaces.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Each small cube that's part of the structure (the outer shell) has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). The ones on the corners of the hollow have three inner faces, edges have two, and the ones in the middle have one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of small cube faces that are internal. The internal faces are those that are inside the structure but not part of the hollow. No, wait, the hollow is empty. The internal faces are the ones that are adjacent to the empty space. So each small cube in the structure has some faces that are on the exterior (painted) and some that are internal (unpainted). So for each small cube in the structure, the number of unpainted faces is the number of faces adjacent to the hollow or to other structure cubes.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate for each small cube in the structure, how many of their faces are not painted. Then sum all those.\n\nThe structure is a 5x5x5 cube, but the hollow is 3x3x3. So the structure consists of all the small cubes except those 27 in the center. So each small cube in the structure is part of the outer shell.\n\nEach small cube can be in a corner, edge, or face of the structure. Let's categorize them.\n\nCorners of the structure: each corner cube has three painted faces (on the exterior). The other three faces are internal and thus unpainted. So for each corner cube, 3 unpainted faces.\n\nHow many corner cubes are there? A cube has 8 corners, so 8 small cubes. Each contributes 3 unpainted faces: 8 *3 =24.\n\nEdges (excluding corners): Each edge of the structure is 5 units long, but subtracting the two corners, each edge has 5-2=3 cubes. Each cube on an edge has two painted faces. The other four faces: some are internal. Wait, each edge cube has two faces on the exterior (if it's a main edge, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is 5x5x5, so each edge is a line of 5 small cubes, but the two end ones are corners, and the three in the middle are edge cubes. Each edge cube has two faces on the exterior, but wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think. Each edge cube is along one edge, so it has two adjacent faces on the exterior. For example, a cube on the top front edge has the top face and front face painted. The other four faces: one is adjacent to the next cube on the edge, another adjacent to the previous, and two are adjacent to the hollow. So each edge cube has two internal faces (facing the hollow) and two adjacent to other structure cubes. Wait, no, the edge cube is part of the structure, so the faces not on the exterior are either adjacent to other structure cubes or the hollow.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that for each edge cube, the number of unpainted faces is the number of faces not on the exterior. Each edge cube has two painted faces (assuming the cube is on an edge, not a corner). So the other four faces: how many are unpainted?\n\nWait, if the cube is on an edge, two of its faces are on the exterior (painted). The other four: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and two are adjacent to the hollow (so not painted). So each edge cube has four unpainted faces.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me take an example. Imagine a small cube on the top edge, not a corner. It has the top face and, say, the front face painted. The other four faces: the back, left, right, and bottom. The bottom face is adjacent to the hollow (since the cube is on the top layer). The left and right faces are adjacent to other structure cubes (the ones next to it on the same edge). The back face is adjacent to another structure cube (on the same edge). Wait, no. Let me visualize.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that each edge cube (not a corner) has three painted faces? No, no, wait. No, the edge is part of two faces. So each edge cube (non-corner) is part of two faces of the big cube. So each has two painted faces. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes, and two are facing the hollow. So for each edge cube, 2 unpainted faces are adjacent to the hollow, and 2 are adjacent to structure cubes. So, total unpainted faces per edge cube: 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought four, but that might be wrong. Let me think again. Each edge cube has two painted faces (on the two exterior sides of the edge). The other four faces: two are internal (facing the hollow) and two are adjacent to other structure cubes. So the internal faces are unpainted. So each edge cube contributes two unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, no. For example, a cube on the top front edge (but not a corner). It has top and front painted. The other four faces: back, left, right, and bottom. The bottom face is adjacent to the hollow (since it's on the top layer). The back face is adjacent to another structure cube on the same edge. The left and right faces are adjacent to structure cubes on either side along the edge. So the only unpainted face is the bottom. Hmm, wait, that's only one face. So I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each edge cube (non-corner) has three unpainted faces. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe number of unpainted faces for each type of cube:\n\n- Corner cubes: 3 unpainted faces each.\n- Edge cubes (non-corner): Let's see, each edge cube is on an edge, so two painted faces. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and two are internal (facing the hollow, so unpainted). So that would be four unpainted faces. But wait, earlier I thought only one was internal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the structure as a 5x5x5 cube. Each cube in the structure is either on a corner, edge, or face, but not in the hollow.\n\nLet me categorize the structure cubes into:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total. Each has 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted (the ones facing the inside).\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge has 5 cubes, minus 2 corners = 3 per edge. There are 12 edges. So 12 * 3 =36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces, and the remaining 4 faces: how many are unpainted? Well, each edge cube is part of two faces of the big cube. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and two are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted). So each edge cube has 2 unpainted faces. So 36 * 2 =72.\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): Each face of the big cube has a 5x5 grid. Subtracting the edges (which form a frame), each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 face cubes. Wait, no, because the edges are the perimeter. Each face has 5x5 =25 small cubes. Subtract the 4 edge cubes (corners) and the 4 edge centers (non-corner edges). So 25 - 4 -4 =17? No, wait, each face has 4 corners and 4 edge centers, so 8 in total. So 25-8=17. So 17 per face. Multiply by 6 faces: 17*6=102. But wait, this counts the inner part of each face. However, the hollow is 3x3, so each face has a 3x3=9 inner cubes. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, each face of the big cube (5x5) has 25 small cubes. Subtract the outermost layer (which is the edge), leaving a 3x3 inner part. But wait, no, the outermost layer is the face itself. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the face cubes as those that are on the face but not on any edge. So each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =9 such cubes. So 9 per face, 6 faces: 54. Each of these face cubes has one painted face (the exterior). The other five faces: some are adjacent to other structure cubes, some are internal.\n\nWait, each face cube (non-edge) has one painted face (on the exterior of the big cube). The other five faces: how many are unpainted? The face is on a face of the big cube, so one face is painted. The other five: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (on the same face), two are adjacent to other structure cubes (on adjacent faces), and one is adjacent to the hollow. So the internal face is adjacent to the hollow, so that's one unpainted face. The other four are adjacent to structure cubes, so they are not painted. So each face cube has 1 unpainted face (facing the hollow) and four others adjacent to structure cubes (unpainted, but wait, no\u2014those adjacent to structure cubes are not painted because they are inside, but they are not part of the hollow. So maybe those faces are unpainted as well.\n\nWait, no, the problem is that the cubes on the face (non-edge) have one face painted (on the exterior), and the other five faces: four are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and one is adjacent to the hollow (so unpainted). So each face cube has 5 unpainted faces.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 54 face cubes *5 unpainted faces would be 270. Adding to the corners and edges would give a high number, which may not match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total number of small cube faces that are not on the exterior, and thus not painted. The total number of small cube faces is 125 *6 =750. The number of painted faces is 6*(5*5) =150. So unpainted faces would be 750 -150 =600. But the options don't have 600. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, but this approach assumes that all the other faces are unpainted, but in reality, some of the faces are adjacent to other small cubes inside the structure, so they're not part of the hollow. Wait, but those internal faces between two structure cubes are not painted, but they are not part of the hollow either. So they are unpainted, but not because they're part of the hollow.\n\nWait, but the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So all the small cube faces that are not on the exterior are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the internal ones, including both the hollow and the structure's internal faces.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct: total small cube faces =125*6=750. Painted faces=6*25=150. So unpainted=750-150=600. But the options don't have 600. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is hollow, so the inner faces are not part of the structure. Wait, no, the structure is the shell. So the inner faces of the structure are part of the hollow. So the inner faces (facing the hollow) are unpainted. The faces between structure cubes are also unpainted, but they are not part of the hollow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that when two small cubes are adjacent inside the structure, their touching faces are not painted. So the number of unpainted faces includes both the hollow's inner faces and the internal faces between structure cubes.\n\nBut the initial approach of 750-150=600 would include all these. So why are the options not including 600? Because I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure isn't made of 125 small cubes. Wait, no, the big cube is 5x5x5=125. The hollow is 3x3x3=27, so the structure is 125-27=98 small cubes.\n\nWait, but each small cube in the structure has 6 faces. So 98*6=588 small cube faces. Then, the painted faces are 6*(5*5) =150. So the unpainted faces would be 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the hollow is 27 small cubes, which are not part of the structure. So the structure has 98 small cubes, each contributing 6 faces, so 588. 150 are painted, so 588-150=438 unpainted.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The 588 includes all the faces of the structure's small cubes. The painted ones are the 150 on the exterior. The remaining 438 are the faces that are either adjacent to other structure cubes or to the hollow. Those are the unpainted faces. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)438.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure, which is a 5x5x5 cube with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made of smaller 1 cm cubes, and the hollow inner part is a 3x3x3 cube. The goal is to determine the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Structure**:  \n   The entire cube consists of \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) small cubes. The hollow inner part is \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) small cubes.

Oh right, because it's made of smaller cubes of size 1cm each. So each edge of the big cube is 5 smaller cubes long, right? So the cube is like a shell with 1cm thickness, and the inside is empty.\n\nSo the big cube is 5x5x5 in terms of small cubes, but since it's hollow, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube (because 5-2=3, subtracting two layers from each side). So the total number of small cubes is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is 3^3 = 27, so the number of small cubes that make up the structure is 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, but the question is about the faces of the small cubes that are unpainted.\n\nWait, but the problem says the outer surface is painted.

Wait, no, that's the number of small cubes inside the hollow part. So for each small cube in the hollow, all their faces are internal and thus unpainted? Or are they?\n\nWait, no.

The bottom face is adjacent to the hollow (since the cube is on the top layer). The left and right faces are adjacent to other structure cubes (the ones next to it on the same edge). The back face is adjacent to another structure cube (on the same edge). Wait, no. Let me visualize.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that each edge cube (not a corner) has three painted faces? No, no, wait. No, the edge is part of two faces. So each edge cube (non-corner) is part of two faces of the big cube. So each has two painted faces. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes, and two are facing the hollow. So for each edge cube, 2 unpainted faces are adjacent to the hollow, and 2 are adjacent to structure cubes. So, total unpainted faces per edge cube: 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought four, but that might be wrong. Let me think again. Each edge cube has two painted faces (on the two exterior sides of the edge). The other four faces: two are internal (facing the hollow) and two are adjacent to other structure cubes. So the internal faces are unpainted. So each edge cube contributes two unpainted faces.\n\nBut wait, no. For example, a cube on the top front edge (but not a corner). It has top and front painted. The other four faces: back, left, right, and bottom. The bottom face is adjacent to the hollow (since it's on the top layer). The back face is adjacent to another structure cube on the same edge. The left and right faces are adjacent to structure cubes on either side along the edge. So the only unpainted face is the bottom. Hmm, wait, that's only one face. So I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each edge cube (non-corner) has three unpainted faces. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe number of unpainted faces for each type of cube:\n\n- Corner cubes: 3 unpainted faces each.\n- Edge cubes (non-corner): Let's see, each edge cube is on an edge, so two painted faces. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and two are internal (facing the hollow, so unpainted). So that would be four unpainted faces. But wait, earlier I thought only one was internal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the structure as a 5x5x5 cube. Each cube in the structure is either on a corner, edge, or face, but not in the hollow.\n\nLet me categorize the structure cubes into:\n\n1. Corner cubes: 8 in total. Each has 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted (the ones facing the inside).\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge has 5 cubes, minus 2 corners = 3 per edge. There are 12 edges. So 12 * 3 =36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces, and the remaining 4 faces: how many are unpainted? Well, each edge cube is part of two faces of the big cube. The other four faces: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and two are adjacent to the hollow (unpainted). So each edge cube has 2 unpainted faces. So 36 * 2 =72.\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): Each face of the big cube has a 5x5 grid. Subtracting the edges (which form a frame), each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 face cubes. Wait, no, because the edges are the perimeter. Each face has 5x5 =25 small cubes. Subtract the 4 edge cubes (corners) and the 4 edge centers (non-corner edges). So 25 - 4 -4 =17? No, wait, each face has 4 corners and 4 edge centers, so 8 in total. So 25-8=17. So 17 per face. Multiply by 6 faces: 17*6=102. But wait, this counts the inner part of each face. However, the hollow is 3x3, so each face has a 3x3=9 inner cubes. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, each face of the big cube (5x5) has 25 small cubes. Subtract the outermost layer (which is the edge), leaving a 3x3 inner part. But wait, no, the outermost layer is the face itself. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the face cubes as those that are on the face but not on any edge. So each face has (5-2)*(5-2) =9 such cubes. So 9 per face, 6 faces: 54. Each of these face cubes has one painted face (the exterior). The other five faces: some are adjacent to other structure cubes, some are internal.\n\nWait, each face cube (non-edge) has one painted face (on the exterior of the big cube). The other five faces: how many are unpainted? The face is on a face of the big cube, so one face is painted. The other five: two are adjacent to other structure cubes (on the same face), two are adjacent to other structure cubes (on adjacent faces), and one is adjacent to the hollow. So the internal face is adjacent to the hollow, so that's one unpainted face. The other four are adjacent to structure cubes, so they are not painted. So each face cube has 1 unpainted face (facing the hollow) and four others adjacent to structure cubes (unpainted, but wait, no\u2014those adjacent to structure cubes are not painted because they are inside, but they are not part of the hollow. So maybe those faces are unpainted as well.\n\nWait, no, the problem is that the cubes on the face (non-edge) have one face painted (on the exterior), and the other five faces: four are adjacent to other structure cubes (so not painted), and one is adjacent to the hollow (so unpainted). So each face cube has 5 unpainted faces.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 54 face cubes *5 unpainted faces would be 270. Adding to the corners and edges would give a high number, which may not match the options.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total number of small cube faces that are not on the exterior, and thus not painted. The total number of small cube faces is 125 *6 =750. The number of painted faces is 6*(5*5) =150. So unpainted faces would be 750 -150 =600. But the options don't have 600. So this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, but this approach assumes that all the other faces are unpainted, but in reality, some of the faces are adjacent to other small cubes inside the structure, so they're not part of the hollow. Wait, but those internal faces between two structure cubes are not painted, but they are not part of the hollow either. So they are unpainted, but not because they're part of the hollow.\n\nWait, but the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So all the small cube faces that are not on the exterior are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the internal ones, including both the hollow and the structure's internal faces.\n\nSo the initial approach is correct: total small cube faces =125*6=750. Painted faces=6*25=150. So unpainted=750-150=600. But the options don't have 600. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is hollow, so the inner faces are not part of the structure. Wait, no, the structure is the shell. So the inner faces of the structure are part of the hollow. So the inner faces (facing the hollow) are unpainted. The faces between structure cubes are also unpainted, but they are not part of the hollow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that when two small cubes are adjacent inside the structure, their touching faces are not painted. So the number of unpainted faces includes both the hollow's inner faces and the internal faces between structure cubes.\n\nBut the initial approach of 750-150=600 would include all these. So why are the options not including 600? Because I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure isn't made of 125 small cubes. Wait, no, the big cube is 5x5x5=125. The hollow is 3x3x3=27, so the structure is 125-27=98 small cubes.\n\nWait, but each small cube in the structure has 6 faces. So 98*6=588 small cube faces. Then, the painted faces are 6*(5*5) =150. So the unpainted faces would be 588 -150 =438.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the hollow is 27 small cubes, which are not part of the structure. So the structure has 98 small cubes, each contributing 6 faces, so 588. 150 are painted, so 588-150=438 unpainted.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The 588 includes all the faces of the structure's small cubes. The painted ones are the 150 on the exterior. The remaining 438 are the faces that are either adjacent to other structure cubes or to the hollow. Those are the unpainted faces. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube structure, which is a 5x5x5 cube with a thickness of 1 cm. The cube is made of smaller 1 cm cubes, and the hollow inner part is a 3x3x3 cube. The goal is to determine the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Total Small Cubes in the Structure**:  \n   The entire cube consists of \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) small cubes. The hollow inner part is \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) small cubes. Thus, the number of small cubes in the structure (the outer shell) is:  \n   \\[\n   125 - 27 = 98\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Faces of Small Cubes in the Structure**:  \n   Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for the 98 small cubes in the structure is:  \n   \\[\n   98 \\times 6 = 588\n   \\]\n\n3. **Painted Faces on the Outer Surface**:  \n   The outer surface of the cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cube faces, so there are \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) painted small cube faces per face of the cube. Since the cube has 6 faces:  \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ painted faces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces of the structure minus the painted faces:  \n   \\[\n   588 - 150 = 438\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's see. The cube is size 5cm, but the thickness is 1cm. So, it's a hollow cube, meaning it's like a box with walls 1cm thick. It's made up of 1cm\u00b3 smaller cubes.\n\nWait, the cube is 5cm on each edge. So, the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube must be calculated. But since it's hollow, the inner part is empty. So, first, I think I should find the total number of small cubes in a solid cube of 5cm and then subtract the hollow part.\n\nA solid cube of 5cm would have 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow, the inner part is a smaller cube. What's the size of the inner cube? Since the thickness is 1cm, the inner cube's edge would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm. So, 3x3x3 = 27 small cubes. So the hollow cube has 125 -27=98 small cubes. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the hollow part is just the inner part, so yes, 98 small cubes make up the hollow structure.\n\nNow, the problem is about the painted faces. The outer surface is painted, so all the outer small cubes will have their outer faces painted. But the question is about how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\nWait, each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces depending on their position. But the question isn't about how many small cubes have unpainted faces, but rather the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes.\n\nHmm, maybe I should calculate the total number of faces painted and subtract that from the total possible faces, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of unpainted faces per cube and sum them all.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Each small cube can contribute up to 3 faces being painted, depending on whether it's on a corner, edge, face, or inside.\n\nWait, but in the hollow cube, the inner part is empty, so only the outer layer is present. So, all the small cubes are on the outer layer, except the inner empty space. Wait no, the hollow cube's structure is just the outer shell 1cm thick. So all the small cubes are part of this shell.\n\nWait, in a hollow cube of size 5cm (so each edge is 5 units, made of 1cm cubes), the outer layer is 1cm thick, so the inner dimensions are 3cm (since 5-2*1=3). So the hollow cube consists of all the small cubes that are on the outer layer, which is 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3. So 125-27=98 small cubes, as I thought earlier.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes has some faces exposed on the outside. Since the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are not painted because the paint is only on the outer surfaces. Wait, no\u2014the problem says the outer surface is painted. So the inner surfaces (like the walls) are not painted. So any face of a small cube that is on the inside of the hollow part would be unpainted, but the outer faces are painted.\n\nWait, but each small cube in the hollow cube has faces that are either on the outside (painted) or on the inside (unpainted). Additionally, some cubes are on edges or corners, so they have more than one face painted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total number of faces on all the small cubes and then subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nEach small cube has 6 faces. So 98 small cubes would have 98 *6 = 588 faces in total.\n\nNow, how many of these are painted? The painted faces are those on the outer surfaces of the hollow cube. Each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 square of small cube faces. There are 6 faces on a cube, so 6 *5*5= 150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but wait, each small cube's face that's on the exterior contributes to the painted faces. So total painted faces are 5*5*6=150.\n\nSo, total painted faces: 150.\n\nTotal unpainted faces would then be total faces (588) minus painted (150), which equals 438.\n\nSo, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, each small cube in the hollow structure may have more than one face painted. So the painted faces count correctly as 150, but I'm considering all small cube faces. So for example, a corner cube has three painted faces. So when I subtract, I'm correctly accounting for all painted faces, regardless of how many per cube.\n\nBut let me double-check. The total number of small cube faces is 98 *6=588. The number of painted faces is 5*5*6=150. So 588-150=438. That's option A.\n\nWait, but wait another point. The hollow cube is 5cm on each edge, but the thickness is 1cm. So the inner dimension is 3x3x3. So the outer layer is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, so 98 small cubes. So each of these 98 cubes is part of the shell, and some have multiple painted faces.\n\nBut the calculation I did earlier, subtracting the painted faces from the total, gives 438. So the answer would be option A)438.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: for each small cube, count the number of unpainted faces and sum them.\n\nEach cube in the hollow structure can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 unpainted faces, depending on their position.\n\nBut wait, for a cube on the corner, it's part of the outer shell, so three of its faces are on the outside (painted), and the other three are adjacent to other cubes or the inside. But since the cube is hollow, the inner face would be the one that's part of the hollow space, so for a corner cube, one face is on the inside, and the other two are adjacent to other cubes. Wait, but in a hollow cube, each cube is part of the shell, so each cube has some faces on the outside and some on the inside.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that each cube in the shell has some of their faces on the outer surface (painted) and others adjacent to other cubes or the hollow interior (unpainted).\n\nWait, but each cube in the shell can have up to three painted faces (if it's a corner cube), but the other faces are either adjacent to other cubes or the hollow. So for each cube, the number of unpainted faces would be 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. The hollow cube has a shell of 1cm thickness. So the shell consists of all the small cubes that are on the outer layer, and the inner 3x3x3 is hollow.\n\nEach cube in the shell can be categorized based on their position:\n\n1. Corner cubes: These are at the eight corners of the hollow cube. Each corner cube has three painted faces (since they are on three outer surfaces). So for each corner cube, 3 faces are painted, so 3 unpainted.\n\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): These are along the edges, but not at the corners. Each edge of the hollow cube is 5cm long, but the corners are already accounted for. So each edge has 5 - 2 = 3 cubes that are edge cubes (excluding corners). Each of these edge cubes has two painted faces (since they're on two outer surfaces). So each such cube has 4 unpainted faces.\n\n3. Face cubes (not edges or corners): These are on the faces of the hollow cube but not on the edges. Each face has (5-2) x (5-2) = 3x3 =9 such cubes. Each of these has only one painted face, so 5 unpainted.\n\n4. The inner part is hollow, so no cubes there.\n\nWait, but wait, in our case, all the cubes are in the shell, so each cube is either a corner, edge, or face cube.\n\nWait, let's calculate the number of each type.\n\nNumber of corner cubes: 8 (as usual for a cube).\n\nEach corner cube: 3 painted faces \u2192 3 unpainted.\n\nSo 8 *3 = 24 painted, 8*3=24 unpainted faces.\n\nNumber of edge cubes: Each edge has (5-2)=3 cubes (excluding corners). There are 12 edges on a cube.\n\nSo 12 *3 =36 edge cubes.\n\nEach has 2 painted faces \u2192 4 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo 36 *4=144 unpainted faces.\n\nNumber of face cubes: Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3*3=9 cubes. There are 6 faces.\n\nSo 6 *9=54 face cubes.\n\nEach has 1 painted face \u21925 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo 54 *5=270 unpainted faces.\n\nNow, summing all the unpainted faces:\n\n24 (from corners) +144 (edges) +270 (faces) = 438.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces are 438, which matches the earlier calculation. So the correct answer is A)438.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (edge length) with a thickness of 1 cm, made up of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes. The cube is hollow, meaning the inner part is empty, and only the outer shell remains.

So for each corner cube, 3 faces are painted, so 3 unpainted.\n\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): These are along the edges, but not at the corners. Each edge of the hollow cube is 5cm long, but the corners are already accounted for. So each edge has 5 - 2 = 3 cubes that are edge cubes (excluding corners). Each of these edge cubes has two painted faces (since they're on two outer surfaces). So each such cube has 4 unpainted faces.\n\n3. Face cubes (not edges or corners): These are on the faces of the hollow cube but not on the edges. Each face has (5-2) x (5-2) = 3x3 =9 such cubes. Each of these has only one painted face, so 5 unpainted.\n\n4. The inner part is hollow, so no cubes there.\n\nWait, but wait, in our case, all the cubes are in the shell, so each cube is either a corner, edge, or face cube.\n\nWait, let's calculate the number of each type.\n\nNumber of corner cubes: 8 (as usual for a cube).\n\nEach corner cube: 3 painted faces \u2192 3 unpainted.\n\nSo 8 *3 = 24 painted, 8*3=24 unpainted faces.\n\nNumber of edge cubes: Each edge has (5-2)=3 cubes (excluding corners). There are 12 edges on a cube.\n\nSo 12 *3 =36 edge cubes.\n\nEach has 2 painted faces \u2192 4 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo 36 *4=144 unpainted faces.\n\nNumber of face cubes: Each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=3*3=9 cubes. There are 6 faces.\n\nSo 6 *9=54 face cubes.\n\nEach has 1 painted face \u21925 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo 54 *5=270 unpainted faces.\n\nNow, summing all the unpainted faces:\n\n24 (from corners) +144 (edges) +270 (faces) = 438.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces are 438, which matches the earlier calculation. So the correct answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube of size 5 cm (edge length) with a thickness of 1 cm, made up of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes. The cube is hollow, meaning the inner part is empty, and only the outer shell remains. The outer surface is painted, and we need to determine the total number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of small cubes\n- A solid cube of size 5 cm contains \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) small cubes.\n- The hollow part is a smaller cube of size \\(3 \\, \\text{cm}\\) (since the thickness is 1 cm, the inner dimensions are \\(5 - 2 \\times 1 = 3\\)).\n- The hollow part contains \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) small cubes.\n- Therefore, the hollow cube consists of \\(125 - 27 = 98\\) small cubes.\n\n### Step 2: Total number of faces\n- Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for 98 small cubes is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n\n### Step 3: Number of painted faces\n- The outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Each face of the hollow cube is a \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid of small cube faces.\n- There are 6 faces on a cube, so the total number of painted faces is \\(6 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 150\\).\n\n### Step 4: Number of unpainted faces\n- The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces minus the painted faces:\n  \\[\n  588 - 150 = 438\n  \\]\n\n### Verification by categorizing small cubes\nTo verify, we categorize the small cubes based on their positions in the hollow cube:\n1. **Corner cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces: \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n2. **Edge cubes**: Each edge has \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) cubes (excluding corners), and there are 12 edges. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces and 4 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces: \\(12 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 144\\).\n3. **Face cubes**: Each face has \\((5 - 2) \\times (5 - 2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\) cubes (excluding edges and corners), and there are 6 faces. Each face cube has 1 painted face and 5 unpainted faces. Total unpainted faces: \\(6 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 270\\).\n\nSumming these gives:\n\\[\n24 + 144 + 270 = 438\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces is **438**, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\n**Answer: A**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm supposed to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the cube is of size 5cm, and each small cube is 1cm. So the big cube is 5x5x5 in terms of small cubes. But wait, it's hollow, meaning there's an empty space inside. Oh right, the thickness is 1cm. So the hollow part must be a cube of size 3x3x3 because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (since 1cm on each side) is 3cm. So the big cube has 5^3=125 small cubes, and the hollow part is 3^3=27. So the total number of small cubes used is 125-27=98. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need the total number of cubes right now. Let's see.\n\nThe question is about the number of faces that remain unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted. Each small cube can have up to three faces painted if it's on a corner, two if on an edge, one if on a face, and none if it's inside. But wait, the cube is hollow, so the inside small cubes aren't there\u2014so all the small cubes must be on the outer layer except the inner 3x3x3.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the cube is hollow, meaning that the inner part isn't filled with small cubes. So the structure is like a shell of thickness 1cm. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square, but the inner part is empty. So the small cubes on the outer surfaces are painted on their outer faces.\n\nEach small cube that's on the surface will have some faces painted. The ones on the corners will have three painted, edges (but not corners) will have two, and the face centers will have one. The ones inside the shell (if any) wouldn't be present, but in this case, since the hollow is 3x3x3, the inner cubes are empty.\n\nBut the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that are unpainted. So each small cube has 6 faces. If it's on the outer surface, some are painted, others not. The ones inside the hollow have all their faces unpainted, but wait, those small cubes aren't present. Oh wait, no. The hollow cube is made of small cubes\u2014so the entire structure is a shell made of small cubes. So the inner part is empty. So each small cube is part of the outer shell.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the big cube is hollow, meaning the inside is empty, so the small cubes form a shell. So each small cube is on the outer layer. So each has some faces painted. The inner part of the big cube is empty.\n\nSo for each small cube, the number of painted faces depends on its position.\n\nSo to find the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes, I think the approach is:\n\nTotal unpainted faces = (Total number of small cube faces) - (Number of painted faces)\n\nBecause each small cube has 6 faces, the total is 98 * 6. Then subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, but how many painted faces are there? The outer surface of the big cube is painted. The big cube has 6 faces, each 5x5. So each face has 25 squares, each corresponding to a small cube's face. So total painted faces are 6 * 25 = 150.\n\nSo painted faces = 150.\n\nTotal faces of all small cubes: 98 * 6 = 588.\n\nSo unpainted faces = 588 - 150 = 438.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me think again. Because each small cube on the edge or corner is part of multiple faces of the big cube. For example, a corner cube is part of three faces of the big cube, so its three small cube faces are painted. Similarly, an edge cube (but not a corner) is part of two big cube faces, so two small cube faces painted.\n\nBut when we calculate the total painted faces, we're counting each small cube's face once for each big face it's on. So in the big cube, each of the 6 faces has 25 small faces, so 6*25=150 painted small cube faces. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of unpainted small cube faces would be 588 -150 = 438. So the answer should be A)438.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)438, B)550, etc. So that would make the answer A.\n\nBut wait another thought: what about the small cubes that are on the edges and corners? Each of their small cube's faces is being counted in the big cube's painted area. So the calculation is correct. So 438 is the right answer.\n\nSo the correct option is A)438.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it. The cube is 5cm in size, and each face is made up of smaller cubes that are 1cm each. Wait, no, the cube is size 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. So I think that means it's a hollow cube where each face is 5cm by 5cm, and the walls are 1cm thick. So the cube is like a box made up of smaller 1cm\u00b3 cubes.\n\nThe question is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and the inner surfaces (if any) are not. But wait, since the cube is hollow, the inside is empty. So the inner surfaces are not there because it's hollow. Hmm, but when they paint the outer surface, they're only painting the outer faces of the small cubes that make up the cube's exterior.\n\nEach small cube can have up to three faces painted if it's on a corner, two if it's on an edge but not a corner, one if it's on a face but not an edge, and none if it's inside, but in this case, it's hollow so no inner cubes. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is the inside, which is empty. So the small cubes that make up the outer layer are the only ones in the structure.\n\nWait, the cube is 5cm on each edge, and each small cube is 1cm. So the cube is made up of 5x5x5 small cubes, which is 125 small cubes in total. But since it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, right? Because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (1cm each side) equals 3. So the hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. But wait, no, because the thickness is 1cm, the outer layer is 1cm thick, so the inner cube is 3x3x3, and the hollow part is 3x3x3, but the total structure is 5x5x5. So the number of small cubes in the hollow part is 3^3 =27, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (like the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow cube) are not. So each small cube that's on the outer face has some painted faces, but the ones that are on the inner face of the hollow cube might have some unpainted faces.\n\nWait, no, the hollow cube is only the outer layer. So each small cube on the outer layer has some of their faces painted. The inner cubes (the 3x3x3) are not present because the cube is hollow. So the only small cubes present are those in the outer 1cm layer.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the total 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98 small cubes. So 98 small cubes make up the hollow cube.\n\nEach of these small cubes is on the exterior, so each has at least one face painted. But some have more than one face painted, depending on their position.\n\nThe question is, how many faces of these small cubes remain unpainted? So for each small cube, count the number of faces that are not on the outside (i.e., the faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube) and thus not painted.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube is just the outer layer. So for a small cube in the hollow cube, some of their faces are on the exterior (painted) and some are on the interior (unpainted, because they're inside the hollow part, so no paint is applied there). But wait, the hollow cube is the outer shell, so the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So each small cube in the shell has some of their faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted, because the hollow part isn't painted).\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces would be the number of their faces that are on the inside of the shell. Let's think about how many small cubes there are and how many of their faces are unpainted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, each small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces are 98 *6 =588.\n\nBut wait, some of these faces are on the inside, not the outside. The outside of the hollow cube is painted, so the outer faces are painted. The inner faces are not painted.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's outer surfaces are all painted, so the outer 5x5 faces are each painted. Let me compute the total number of outer faces.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube is 5x5=25 squares. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but each painted face is a face of a small cube. So the total number of painted faces is 150.\n\nSo the total number of faces of all small cubes is 98 *6 =588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 150. So the number of unpainted faces is 588 - 150=438.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). But when the hollow cube is constructed, each small cube in the shell has a certain number of its faces on the outside and others on the inside.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of faces that are on the exterior (painted) and others on the interior (unpainted). The unpainted faces would be those that are facing into the hollow part.\n\nWait, each small cube in the shell is part of the outer layer. So for each cube, the number of faces that are on the outside (and thus painted) depends on its position. For example, corner cubes have 3 faces on the outside, edge cubes (non-corner) have 2, face cubes (non-edge) have 1, and the ones on the inner part of the shell have some faces on the inside.\n\nWait, but in this case, the shell is 1cm thick, so for each face of the cube, the inner part is 3x3x3, so the shell is one layer around it. So each small cube in the shell can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 faces on the outside.\n\nWait, but perhaps each small cube in the shell has exactly one face on the outside (since the shell is one layer thick). No, that's not right. For example, corner cubes have three faces on the outside. Because each corner is where three faces meet. So a small cube at a corner would have three of its faces on the exterior, thus painted, and the other three would be on the inside of the hollow cube, thus unpainted.\n\nBut wait, the hollow cube is made of a 5x5x5 structure minus a 3x3x3 inner cube. So the shell is 1cm thick. So for each small cube in the shell, how many of its faces are on the exterior?\n\nLet me think about each small cube in the shell. The cube is 5x5x5, but the inner 3x3x3 is hollow. So the shell is 1 layer thick.\n\nEach small cube in the shell is on the exterior, but their positions can vary. Some are on edges, corners, or faces.\n\nIn a cube, the number of small cubes in the shell can be calculated as:\n\nTotal cubes in the cube: 5^3 =125.\n\nInner hollow cubes: 3^3=27.\n\nSo shell cubes: 125-27=98.\n\nNow, to find the number of faces that are unpainted, which are the faces that are on the inner side of the shell.\n\nEach shell cube has some faces on the outer side (painted) and some on the inner (unpainted). The number of unpainted faces per cube depends on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of inner faces. The inner faces are those that are part of the hollow space. Since the hollow space is 3x3x3, each face of this inner cube is 3x3, so 9 squares per face. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 inner faces. Each inner face is a face of a small cube in the shell, so each contributes one unpainted face.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the hollow cube's inner walls are each made up of 3x3 small cube faces, so 54 in total. So each of these 54 faces is an unpainted face of a small cube in the shell. So the total number of unpainted faces is 54.\n\nWait, but wait. Each inner face is a face of a small cube in the shell. So each of those 54 inner faces is an unpainted face. But each small cube in the shell can have more than one inner face. For example, a small cube on an edge might have two inner faces.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The hollow cube's inner walls are the faces of the shell that are adjacent to the hollow space. Each inner face is a square of the shell's inner surface.\n\nSo the number of inner faces is 6 faces * 3x3 =54. So each of these 54 faces corresponds to a face of a small cube in the shell that is unpainted.\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is 54.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the answer options don't include 54. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the initial approach where I calculated total small cube faces (98*6=588) and subtracted the painted ones (150) gives 438. But when I thought about the inner faces as 54, which is way lower than that. So maybe that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink. Let me approach it another way.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some number of faces painted. The unpainted faces are the ones not on the outside. So for each cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo to find the total unpainted faces, I need to find for each cube in the shell, how many of its faces are not painted.\n\nLet me categorize the small cubes in the shell based on their positions.\n\n1. Corner cubes: There are 8 corners in a cube. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces. So each has 6-3=3 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 8 *3 =24 unpainted faces from corner cubes.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge of the cube has (5-2)=3 small cubes, because the edges are 5cm long, and each small cube is 1cm. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but two of them are corners. So 5-2=3 per edge. There are 12 edges in a cube.\n\nEach edge cube (non-corner) has 2 painted faces (since they're on the edge where two faces meet). So each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 12 edges *3 cubes per edge=36 edge cubes. Each contributes 4 unpainted faces, so 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): Each face of the cube has a 5x5 grid. The outermost layer is the shell, so the face cubes would be those not on the edges.\n\nEach face has (5-2)^2 =3x3=9 such cubes. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face cubes.\n\nEach face cube has 1 painted face (since it's on one face, not on an edge or corner). So each has 6-1=5 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 54 *5=270.\n\n4. Wait, but what about the cubes that are on the inner part of the shell? Because the shell is 1 cm thick, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube. So the cubes in the shell are only on the outer layer. So in this case, the face cubes (excluding edges) are the ones that are one layer in from the edge. So the inner part is hollow, so those cubes are part of the shell.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a category. Let me think again. The shell is 1 cm thick, so each face's inner edge is 3 cm, meaning that each face has a 3x3 arrangement of cubes that are one layer in.\n\nSo the face cubes (excluding edges) are 3x3 per face, 6 faces, 54 cubes. Each has 1 painted face, as above.\n\nWait, but what about the cubes that are in the corners of the inner 3x3x3? No, because the shell is only 1 cm thick. The inner 3x3x3 is empty, so the shell cubes are the ones that are on the exterior.\n\nWait, perhaps I've covered all the shell cubes in the above three categories: corners, edges, face centers.\n\nBut wait, let me check the counts.\n\nCorners:8, each with 3 painted faces.\n\nEdges:12 edges *3=36, each with 2 painted.\n\nFaces:6 faces *9=54, each with 1 painted.\n\nSo total shell cubes:8+36+54=98, which matches 125-27=98.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be:\n\nCorners:8 * (6-3)=8*3=24.\n\nEdges:36 *4=144.\n\nFaces:54 *5=270.\n\nAdding these up:24+144=168; 168+270=438.\n\nSo total unpainted faces are 438.\n\nSo the answer is A)438.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it. The cube is 5cm in size, and each face is made up of smaller cubes that are 1cm each. Wait, no, the cube is size 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. So I think that means it's a hollow cube where each face is 5cm by 5cm, and the walls are 1cm thick. So the cube is like a box made up of smaller 1cm\u00b3 cubes.\n\nThe question is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and the inner surfaces (if any) are not. But wait, since the cube is hollow, the inside is empty. So the inner surfaces are not there because it's hollow. Hmm, but when they paint the outer surface, they're only painting the outer faces of the small cubes that make up the cube's exterior.\n\nEach small cube can have up to three faces painted if it's on a corner, two if it's on an edge but not a corner, one if it's on a face but not an edge, and none if it's inside, but in this case, it's hollow so no inner cubes. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is the inside, which is empty. So the small cubes that make up the outer layer are the only ones in the structure.\n\nWait, the cube is 5cm on each edge, and each small cube is 1cm. So the cube is made up of 5x5x5 small cubes, which is 125 small cubes in total. But since it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, right? Because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (1cm each side) equals 3. So the hollow part is 3x3x3, which is 27 small cubes. But wait, no, because the thickness is 1cm, the outer layer is 1cm thick, so the inner cube is 3x3x3, and the hollow part is 3x3x3, but the total structure is 5x5x5. So the number of small cubes in the hollow part is 3^3 =27, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces that are unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (like the faces that are on the inner side of the hollow cube) are not. So each small cube that's on the outer face has some painted faces, but the ones that are on the inner face of the hollow cube might have some unpainted faces.\n\nWait, no, the hollow cube is only the outer layer. So each small cube on the outer layer has some of their faces painted. The inner cubes (the 3x3x3) are not present because the cube is hollow. So the only small cubes present are those in the outer 1cm layer.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the total 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98 small cubes. So 98 small cubes make up the hollow cube.\n\nEach of these small cubes is on the exterior, so each has at least one face painted. But some have more than one face painted, depending on their position.\n\nThe question is, how many faces of these small cubes remain unpainted? So for each small cube, count the number of faces that are not on the outside (i.e., the faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube) and thus not painted.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube is just the outer layer. So for a small cube in the hollow cube, some of their faces are on the exterior (painted) and some are on the interior (unpainted, because they're inside the hollow part, so no paint is applied there). But wait, the hollow cube is the outer shell, so the inner 3x3x3 is empty. So each small cube in the shell has some of their faces on the exterior (painted) and some on the interior (unpainted, because the hollow part isn't painted).\n\nSo for each small cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces would be the number of their faces that are on the inside of the shell. Let's think about how many small cubes there are and how many of their faces are unpainted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of faces of all small cubes and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nWait, each small cube has 6 faces. There are 98 small cubes, so total faces are 98 *6 =588.\n\nBut wait, some of these faces are on the inside, not the outside. The outside of the hollow cube is painted, so the outer faces are painted. The inner faces are not painted.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's outer surfaces are all painted, so the outer 5x5 faces are each painted. Let me compute the total number of outer faces.\n\nEach face of the hollow cube is 5x5=25 squares. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 painted faces.\n\nWait, but each painted face is a face of a small cube. So the total number of painted faces is 150.\n\nSo the total number of faces of all small cubes is 98 *6 =588.\n\nThe number of painted faces is 150. So the number of unpainted faces is 588 - 150=438.\n\nSo the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because each small cube in the shell has some faces on the outside (painted) and some on the inside (unpainted). But when the hollow cube is constructed, each small cube in the shell has a certain number of its faces on the outside and others on the inside.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of faces that are on the exterior (painted) and others on the interior (unpainted). The unpainted faces would be those that are facing into the hollow part.\n\nWait, each small cube in the shell is part of the outer layer. So for each cube, the number of faces that are on the outside (and thus painted) depends on its position. For example, corner cubes have 3 faces on the outside, edge cubes (non-corner) have 2, face cubes (non-edge) have 1, and the ones on the inner part of the shell have some faces on the inside.\n\nWait, but in this case, the shell is 1cm thick, so for each face of the cube, the inner part is 3x3x3, so the shell is one layer around it. So each small cube in the shell can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 faces on the outside.\n\nWait, but perhaps each small cube in the shell has exactly one face on the outside (since the shell is one layer thick). No, that's not right. For example, corner cubes have three faces on the outside. Because each corner is where three faces meet. So a small cube at a corner would have three of its faces on the exterior, thus painted, and the other three would be on the inside of the hollow cube, thus unpainted.\n\nBut wait, the hollow cube is made of a 5x5x5 structure minus a 3x3x3 inner cube. So the shell is 1cm thick. So for each small cube in the shell, how many of its faces are on the exterior?\n\nLet me think about each small cube in the shell. The cube is 5x5x5, but the inner 3x3x3 is hollow. So the shell is 1 layer thick.\n\nEach small cube in the shell is on the exterior, but their positions can vary. Some are on edges, corners, or faces.\n\nIn a cube, the number of small cubes in the shell can be calculated as:\n\nTotal cubes in the cube: 5^3 =125.\n\nInner hollow cubes: 3^3=27.\n\nSo shell cubes: 125-27=98.\n\nNow, to find the number of faces that are unpainted, which are the faces that are on the inner side of the shell.\n\nEach shell cube has some faces on the outer side (painted) and some on the inner (unpainted). The number of unpainted faces per cube depends on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total number of inner faces. The inner faces are those that are part of the hollow space. Since the hollow space is 3x3x3, each face of this inner cube is 3x3, so 9 squares per face. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 inner faces. Each inner face is a face of a small cube in the shell, so each contributes one unpainted face.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the hollow cube's inner walls are each made up of 3x3 small cube faces, so 54 in total. So each of these 54 faces is an unpainted face of a small cube in the shell. So the total number of unpainted faces is 54.\n\nWait, but wait. Each inner face is a face of a small cube in the shell. So each of those 54 inner faces is an unpainted face. But each small cube in the shell can have more than one inner face. For example, a small cube on an edge might have two inner faces.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The hollow cube's inner walls are the faces of the shell that are adjacent to the hollow space. Each inner face is a square of the shell's inner surface.\n\nSo the number of inner faces is 6 faces * 3x3 =54. So each of these 54 faces corresponds to a face of a small cube in the shell that is unpainted.\n\nSo the total number of unpainted faces is 54.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the answer options don't include 54. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the initial approach where I calculated total small cube faces (98*6=588) and subtracted the painted ones (150) gives 438. But when I thought about the inner faces as 54, which is way lower than that. So maybe that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to rethink. Let me approach it another way.\n\nEach small cube in the shell has some number of faces painted. The unpainted faces are the ones not on the outside. So for each cube in the shell, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo to find the total unpainted faces, I need to find for each cube in the shell, how many of its faces are not painted.\n\nLet me categorize the small cubes in the shell based on their positions.\n\n1. Corner cubes: There are 8 corners in a cube. Each corner cube has 3 painted faces. So each has 6-3=3 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 8 *3 =24 unpainted faces from corner cubes.\n\n2. Edge cubes (excluding corners): Each edge of the cube has (5-2)=3 small cubes, because the edges are 5cm long, and each small cube is 1cm. So each edge has 5 small cubes, but two of them are corners. So 5-2=3 per edge. There are 12 edges in a cube.\n\nEach edge cube (non-corner) has 2 painted faces (since they're on the edge where two faces meet). So each contributes 6-2=4 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 12 edges *3 cubes per edge=36 edge cubes. Each contributes 4 unpainted faces, so 36 *4=144.\n\n3. Face cubes (excluding edges): Each face of the cube has a 5x5 grid. The outermost layer is the shell, so the face cubes would be those not on the edges.\n\nEach face has (5-2)^2 =3x3=9 such cubes. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face cubes.\n\nEach face cube has 1 painted face (since it's on one face, not on an edge or corner). So each has 6-1=5 unpainted faces.\n\nSo 54 *5=270.\n\n4. Wait, but what about the cubes that are on the inner part of the shell? Because the shell is 1 cm thick, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube. So the cubes in the shell are only on the outer layer. So in this case, the face cubes (excluding edges) are the ones that are one layer in from the edge. So the inner part is hollow, so those cubes are part of the shell.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing a category. Let me think again. The shell is 1 cm thick, so each face's inner edge is 3 cm, meaning that each face has a 3x3 arrangement of cubes that are one layer in.\n\nSo the face cubes (excluding edges) are 3x3 per face, 6 faces, 54 cubes. Each has 1 painted face, as above.\n\nWait, but what about the cubes that are in the corners of the inner 3x3x3? No, because the shell is only 1 cm thick. The inner 3x3x3 is empty, so the shell cubes are the ones that are on the exterior.\n\nWait, perhaps I've covered all the shell cubes in the above three categories: corners, edges, face centers.\n\nBut wait, let me check the counts.\n\nCorners:8, each with 3 painted faces.\n\nEdges:12 edges *3=36, each with 2 painted.\n\nFaces:6 faces *9=54, each with 1 painted.\n\nSo total shell cubes:8+36+54=98, which matches 125-27=98.\n\nSo the total unpainted faces would be:\n\nCorners:8 * (6-3)=8*3=24.\n\nEdges:36 *4=144.\n\nFaces:54 *5=270.\n\nAdding these up:24+144=168; 168+270=438.\n\nSo total unpainted faces are 438.\n\nSo the answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the hollow cube, which is 5 cm on each edge, with a thickness of 1 cm.

Wait, size 5 cm cube made from 1 cm cubes. Hmm, I think that means each edge of the cube is 5 cm, so it's a 5x5x5 cube. But since it's hollow with thickness 1 cm, the inside isn't solid. So, the hollow part must be a smaller cube inside.\n\nWait, the thickness is 1 cm, so the outer layer is 1 cm thick. So the inner part would be a cube of size 3 cm on each side. Because 5 cm minus 2 times 1 cm (since the thickness is on both sides) equals 3 cm. So, the hollow part is 3x3x3.\n\nBut wait, the cube is made up of 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes. So the total number of small cubes in the entire 5x5x5 cube is 5\u00b3 = 125. But since it's hollow, we subtract the inner 3\u00b3 =27 cubes. So the hollow cube has 125 -27 =98 small cubes.\n\nWait no, wait. The problem says it's a hollow cube of size 5cm, with thickness 1cm. So maybe the cube has a thickness of 1 cm, meaning the walls are 1 cm thick. So the outer surface is painted, but the inner surfaces are not. So the small cubes on the outer surface have some faces painted, and the ones inside are unpainted.\n\nBut the question is about the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.

So each face of the outer cube (like front, back, left, right, top, bottom) is a 5x5 square, each made of 25 small cube faces. So each face of the outer cube has 25 painted small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nWait, but wait. Each small cube on the corner is part of three faces. But when we count each face separately, the edges and corners are counted multiple times.

Because each face is painted as a whole, each small cube on that face contributes one face to the painted surface.\n\nSo the total painted faces are 150.\n\nSo the unpainted faces are total faces (588) minus painted (150) = 438.\n\nWait, that's one of the options. Option A is 438.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Because some small cubes on the edges or corners might have more than one face painted, but that doesn't affect the total painted count because each face is painted once regardless.\n\nWait, the initial approach is correct. Each face of the big cube has 25 small cube faces painted, so 6*25=150. So unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, we analyze the hollow cube structure:\n\n1. **Cube Dimensions and Small Cubes**:  \n   The cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm. It is composed of smaller cubes of size 1 cm. The total number of small cubes in a 5x5x5 cube is \\( 5^3 = 125 \\). Since the cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, the inner hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube (\\( 3^3 = 27 \\)). Thus, the number of small cubes in the hollow shell is \\( 125 - 27 = 98 \\).\n\n2. **Total Faces of Small Cubes**:  \n   Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is \\( 98 \\times 6 = 588 \\).\n\n3. **Painted Faces**:  \n   The outer surface of the cube is painted. Each face of the cube is a 5x5 grid, consisting of 25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces on the cube, so the total number of painted faces is \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\).\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   The total number of unpainted faces is the total faces minus the painted faces:  \n   \\[\n   588 - 150 = 438\n   \\]\n\nThus, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is **438**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hollow cube, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe problem says: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It's made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. If the outer surface of the cube is painted, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\n\nHmm, wait. Let me parse this. So the cube is hollow, and it's 5 cm on each side. But the thickness is 1 cm. Oh, I see, so it's like a cube shell. The outside is 5 cm, but from the outside to the inside, the thickness is 1 cm. So the inner part is empty, right? And the entire structure is built from 1 cm\u00b3 smaller cubes.\n\nI think I should visualize this. The cube is hollow, so imagine a box made of small cubes, but the inside is empty. Each face of the big cube is 5x5 cm, but since each small cube is 1 cm, each face has 5x5=25 small cubes. But since the cube is hollow, the inner part isn't there.\n\nWait, the thickness is 1 cm. So the hollow part is 1 cm thick. That means that from the outside to the inside, there's only one layer of small cubes. So the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*(1) = 3 cm on each side. Because the hollow part is 3x3x3 cm, I think. Because you subtract the thickness on both sides (left and right, top and bottom, front and back).\n\nSo the big cube is 5x5x5, but the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the total number of small cubes used is the big cube minus the hollow part. So 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. But wait, the question is about the faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted.\n\nOh, right. The outer surface is painted, so all the outer faces of the big cube are painted. Now, when they paint the outer surface, some of the small cubes' faces get painted. The problem is asking how many small cube faces are not painted at all.\n\nSo I need to find the total number of small cube faces that are not exposed to the outside. Because if a small cube is inside, not on the surface, all its faces are unpainted. But some cubes on the surface might have some painted and some unpainted faces.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the big cube is hollow, meaning the inside is empty. So the small cubes are only on the surface, forming the shell. So each small cube is part of the outer shell. But wait, no. The hollow part is 3x3x3, but the shell is 1 cm thick. So the shell is made up of the small cubes on the outside.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe big cube is 5x5x5 cm, made up of 1 cm\u00b3 small cubes. So each edge has 5 small cubes. The thickness is 1 cm, so the hollow part is 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes in the shell is 5\u00b3 - 3\u00b3 = 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. So each of these 98 small cubes is part of the outer shell.\n\nEach of these 98 cubes is on the surface of the big cube. So each has at least one face painted. But some of them have more than one face painted, like the corner cubes which have three faces painted, edge cubes (not corners) have two, and face cubes (not edges) have one.\n\nBut the problem is about the number of faces of the small cubes that are unpainted. So for each small cube, each face that isn't on the outside of the big cube is unpainted.\n\nWait, but wait. Each small cube is part of the shell, so they're on the exterior. So each face of the small cube that is on the exterior of the big cube is painted. The other faces (if any) of the small cube might be adjacent to other small cubes in the shell, or might be the hollow part.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about a cube in the shell. Let's take a cube that's on the corner of the big cube. It has three faces on the exterior, so those three are painted. The other three faces are adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow. But the hollow is empty, so the face adjacent to the hollow is not part of another cube. So that face would be unpainted. So for a corner cube, three painted faces, three unpainted.\n\nWait, but wait. No, the hollow is inside, so the face of the small cube that's towards the hollow is not painted. Because the hollow is empty, that face is internal. So that's one face. But the other faces: the small cube is on the corner, so three faces are on the big cube's exterior, thus painted. The other three faces are either adjacent to other small cubes (so internal, not painted) or the hollow.\n\nWait, no. For the small cube in the corner, each face is either on the exterior or adjacent to another small cube or the hollow. Wait, but the hollow is on the inside, so for the corner cube, the face towards the hollow would be adjacent to the hollow, not another cube. So that face is unpainted. So each corner cube has three painted faces and three unpainted. But wait, the small cube is on the corner, so three of its faces are on the big cube's exterior (painted), and the other three are either adjacent to the hollow or to other small cubes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this. Let's take the big cube as 5x5x5, with a hollow 3x3x3 inside. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square of small cubes, but the inner 3x3 is hollow.\n\nSo each small cube in the shell is on one of the big cube's faces, edges, or corners.\n\nFor the cubes on the edges and corners, they have multiple faces exposed.\n\nSo each small cube in the shell contributes to the exterior. So each face of the big cube is 5x5=25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25=150 small cube faces painted. But each small cube can have multiple faces painted. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 6*(5^2) = 150.\n\nWait, but that's the total number of painted faces. The problem is asking for the number of faces that are unpainted.\n\nEach small cube in the shell contributes some number of faces. Each small cube has 6 faces. The number of painted faces per cube depends on its position.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the total number of small cubes in the shell is 5^3 -3^3 =98. Each small cube has 6 faces, so total possible faces is 98*6=588.\n\nOut of these, how many are painted? Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25, so 6*25=150 painted small cube faces.\n\nSo the number of unpainted faces is 588 -150=438.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nBut let me think again. Because some small cubes have more than one face painted. So if I just subtract 150 from 588, is that correct? Because each painted face is counted once.\n\nYes, because each painted face is a unique small cube face. So total painted is 150, total faces in shell is 98*6=588. So unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nBut wait, another way to think: for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces. Sum this over all 98 cubes.\n\nSo what's the number of painted faces per cube? Let's find out how many cubes have 3, 2, or 1 painted face.\n\nIn the big cube:\n\n- Corner cubes: each corner of the big cube is a small cube. There are 8 corners. Each has 3 painted faces.\n\n- Edge cubes (excluding corners): each edge of the big cube is 5 cm long, so 5 small cubes per edge. Minus the two corners, so 3 per edge. Each edge has 3 such cubes. Each of these has two painted faces.\n\nWait, but wait, the big cube is 5x5x5, so each edge has 5 small cubes. But since the shell is 1 cm thick, the inner part is 3x3x3. So the edges of the shell are the outermost layer.\n\nWait, in a 5x5x5 cube, each edge has 5 small cubes. But when considering the shell, each edge has (5 - 2*1) =3 small cubes in the shell? No, no. Wait, the shell is 1 cm thick, so each edge has 5 small cubes, but the ones in the middle are part of the shell. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.\n\nWait, the shell is the 5x5x5 cube minus the 3x3x3 hollow inside. So the shell is made up of all the small cubes that are on the exterior, i.e., any cube that is on the face, edge, or corner.\n\nSo for a cube of size N x N x N, the number of cubes on the shell is N\u00b3 - (N-2d)\u00b3, where d is the thickness. Here, N=5, d=1, so 5\u00b3 -3\u00b3=98.\n\nNow, for each cube in the shell, the number of painted faces depends on its position:\n\n- Corner cubes: 8 in total (each corner of the big cube). Each has 3 painted faces.\n\n- Edge cubes (not corners): Each edge has (5-2) =3 cubes, since the two ends are corners. Each of these has 2 painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 *3=36 cubes, each with 2 painted faces.\n\n- Face cubes (not edges): Each face has (5-2)^2=3x3=9 cubes. But each face has 9 cubes in the center of the face. Each of these has 1 painted face. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 cubes, each with 1 painted face.\n\nWait, but let's check if these numbers add up to 98.\n\nCorners:8\n\nEdges:36\n\nFaces:54\n\n8 +36=44, 44+54=98. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo now, each corner cube has 3 painted faces. So total painted from corners: 8 *3=24.\n\nEdge cubes:36 *2=72.\n\nFace cubes:54 *1=54.\n\nTotal painted faces:24 +72 +54=150.\n\nSo the total number of painted small cube faces is 150.\n\nEach small cube in the shell contributes 6 faces. 98 cubes, so 588 faces in total.\n\nUnpainted faces =588 -150=438.\n\nSo the answer is 438, which is option A.\n",

So the shell is made up of all the small cubes that are on the exterior, i.e., any cube that is on the face, edge, or corner.\n\nSo for a cube of size N x N x N, the number of cubes on the shell is N\u00b3 - (N-2d)\u00b3, where d is the thickness. Here, N=5, d=1, so 5\u00b3 -3\u00b3=98.\n\nNow, for each cube in the shell, the number of painted faces depends on its position:\n\n- Corner cubes: 8 in total (each corner of the big cube).

Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo now, each corner cube has 3 painted faces.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with a thickness of 1cm. It's made up of smaller cubes each of size 1cm. The outer surface is painted. How many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\n\nHmm. So, the cube is hollow, meaning it's like a box, right? The outer part is 5cm on each side, but the thickness is 1cm. That means the walls of the cube are 1cm thick, and the inside is empty space. So, the cube is made up of 1cm\u00b3 smaller cubes arranged in a larger cube structure.\n\nWait, the cube is 5cm on each side, so each edge is 5 units long. But since the thickness is 1cm, that implies that on each face, there's a 1cm layer that's part of the cube, and the rest is hollow. So, the inner dimensions would be 3cm on each side, because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (since both ends are 1cm thick). Let me check: 5 - 2*(1) = 3. So the inner empty space is a 3x3x3 cube.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the smaller cubes. Each small cube is 1cm\u00b3, so they're 1x1x1. So the entire outer cube would be 5x5x5 small cubes if it were solid, which is 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the number of small cubes used is less.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the cube is made of smaller cubes, so maybe the entire structure, including the hollow part, consists of those small cubes. But no, a hollow cube with 1cm thickness would have the outer layer as the small cubes and the inside as empty. So the total number of small cubes is the outer shell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cube is constructed as a shell. Let me think: The cube has a size of 5cm, which is 5 small cubes on each edge. But since it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm, the inner dimensions are 3cm on each edge (because 5-2=3, subtracting 1cm from each side). So the number of small cubes in the entire hollow cube would be the number of cubes in a 5x5x5 cube minus the number in a 3x3x3 cube. So that's 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Wait, but wait, no, that's if it's a solid cube minus the hollow part. But the problem says the cube is hollow, so maybe the entire structure is just the outer shell, which is 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3. So that would be 98 small cubes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the cube is entirely made up of small cubes, but arranged as a hollow structure with 1cm thickness. So, perhaps the number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98. But I'm not entirely sure about that; perhaps the way the problem is phrased, it's a hollow cube made of small cubes, each of size 1cm\u00b3. So the hollow part is empty, so the total number of small cubes is 5^3 minus (5-2)^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So 98 small cubes make up the hollow structure.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube has 6 faces. The outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (if any) are not painted because they're inside the hollow part. Wait, but in this case, the hollow part is empty, so the inner surfaces of the small cubes (the ones facing the hollow) aren't painted either. So, each small cube on the outer surface has some of their faces painted, and those on the inner surfaces (if any) would have their inner faces unpainted. But wait, in this case, since the hollow cube has a thickness of 1cm, the small cubes on the outer layer are the ones that make up the shell. So, the inner part is empty, so any small cube that's on the outer shell has some of its faces painted, and the ones that are in the shell (but not on the outer surface) would have some faces exposed to the hollow, which aren't painted. But wait, wait a minute, perhaps I should model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the outside, which are painted, and then subtract that from the total number of small cube faces to find the unpainted ones. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of small cubes and their faces, and then subtract the painted ones.\n\nWait, another approach: Each small cube in the hollow cube can be in one of several positions: on the corner, on an edge, on a face, or inside the shell but not on the outer surface. Wait, but in a hollow cube with 1cm thickness, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, so the small cubes that are part of the shell are those that are in the 5x5x5 cube but not in the 3x3x3 inner cube.\n\nEach small cube on the shell contributes some number of painted faces. The ones on the corners will have 3 painted faces, the edges (non-corner) will have 2, the face centers (non-edge) will have 1, and the inner cubes (if any) will have none. But wait, in this case, the shell is only 1cm thick, so there are no inner cubes beyond the hollow. So, the small cubes in the shell are those that are on the corners, edges, and faces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total number of small cube faces that are painted. Each face of the large cube has a 5x5 grid of small cube faces, so each face has 25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25 = 150 painted small cube faces.\n\nWait, but each small cube's face is part of the large cube's face. So, the total painted small cube faces would be 6*(5*5) = 150.\n\nBut each small cube can have multiple faces painted. So, if I sum all the painted faces, it's 150. Each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted. So, the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. So, the total number of small cube faces is the number of small cubes multiplied by 6. Wait, but each small cube is part of the shell, so how many small cubes are there? Let's compute that.\n\nAs earlier, the shell is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, so 125-27=98 small cubes. Each has 6 faces, so 98 * 6 = 588 small cube faces in total.\n\nThe number of painted small cube faces is 150. So, the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. So, 438 faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Because each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. For example, corner cubes have 3 painted, edge (non-corner) have 2, face (non-edge) have 1, and the inner cubes (if any) have 0. But in this case, the shell is only 1cm thick, so all the small cubes are on the surface, right? Because the hollow is 3x3x3, so the shell is 1 layer thick.\n\nWait, but in a 5x5x5 cube, the small cubes on the shell would include all the ones on the corners, edges, and faces. But each small cube in the shell is part of one or more faces of the large cube. So, each small cube on the corner of the large cube has 3 of its faces painted. The ones on the edges (but not corners) have 2 painted. The ones on the faces (but not edges) have 1 painted. The ones inside the shell would have 0, but in this case, since the shell is only 1cm thick, there are no such cubes. Wait, no, the shell is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 98 cubes. So, each of these 98 cubes is on the outer layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach of calculating the total painted small cube faces as 6*(5*5) = 150 is correct. So, the total unpainted would be 98*6 - 150 = 588-150=438. So, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. Let me compute how many small cubes are in each category.\n\nIn a cube, there are 8 corner small cubes, each with 3 painted faces. So, 8 *3 =24 painted faces.\n\nThen, the edges: each edge of the cube has 5 small cubes, but the two at the ends are the corners, so 5-2=3 per edge. Each of these has 2 painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 *3=36 small cubes on edges (non-corner), each contributing 2 painted faces: 36 *2=72.\n\nFaces: each face has a 5x5 grid of small cubes. The corners are already counted, and the edges are also counted. So, the remaining on each face are the inner ones, which form a 3x3 grid (since 5-2=3). But wait, no, each face has 5x5=25 small cubes. Subtracting the 4 corners and 4 edges (each edge has 3 non-corner, but on a face, each edge is a line of 5 small cubes, but 2 are corners, so 3 in the middle). So, per face, the face centers are (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9. Each of these has 1 painted face. So, 6 faces *9 =54 small cubes, each contributing 1 painted face: 54 *1=54.\n\nSo, total painted small cube faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150, which matches the earlier calculation. So, the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces in the shell is 98 *6=588. So, unpainted would be 588-150=438. So, the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another approach: each small cube in the shell has some painted faces. The ones that are on the inside (facing the hollow) are unpainted. But in this case, the shell is 1cm thick, so each small cube in the shell is on the outer surface, and the inner face (towards the hollow) is not painted. So, each small cube in the shell has one face that's unpainted (the inner face). But wait, that's only if the small cube is on the inside of the shell. But in a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell is part of the outer face and may have an inner face, but not all of them. Let me think.\n\nIn a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell has one face that's on the inside, except for the ones on the very corners. Wait, no, perhaps every small cube in the shell (except those on the very edges and corners) have one face that's on the inside. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about a single face of the cube. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes. The ones on the edges of this face are part of the edges of the cube. So, each small cube on the face has one face on the outside (painted) and one face on the inside (unpainted), except for the ones on the edges of the face, which are part of the edges of the cube and may have more painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small cube in the shell has one face that's part of the hollow, so that face is unpainted. So, the number of unpainted faces would be equal to the number of small cubes in the shell, each contributing one unpainted face. So, 98 small cubes, each with one unpainted face: 98 unpainted faces. But wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gives 438, which is way higher than 98. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Each small cube in the shell has some of its faces painted (those on the exterior) and some not. But for each small cube, how many of its 6 faces are on the exterior? For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, so 3 of its 6 are painted, leaving 3 unpainted. But in reality, the corner cube's inner faces are not part of the hollow, so they're unpainted. So, perhaps each small cube has some unpainted faces.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is more accurate: each small cube can have some faces painted (those on the outside) and some unpainted (those on the inside, or adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow).\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube's face that is not on the exterior is unpainted. So, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, the total unpainted faces would be 6 * number of small cubes - number of painted faces.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier: 6*98 =588, minus 150 (painted) gives 438 unpainted. So that approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small cube in the shell has 6 - painted_faces. So, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 - (number of painted faces). So, for corner cubes: 3 painted, 3 unpainted. For edge cubes: 2 painted, 4 unpainted. For face center cubes: 1 painted, 5 unpainted.\n\nSo, let's compute this:\n\nNumber of corner small cubes: 8. Each contributes 3 painted faces, so unpainted per corner cube: 3.\n\nNumber of edge (non-corner) small cubes: each edge has 5 small cubes, 2 are corners, so 3 per edge. 12 edges, so 12 *3 =36. Each contributes 2 painted faces, so 4 unpainted per cube.\n\nNumber of face (non-edge) small cubes: each face has (5-2)^2=9. 6 faces, so 54. Each contributes 1 painted face, so 5 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be:\n\n8 *3 (corners) + 36 *4 (edges) +54 *5 (face centers).\n\nCalculating:\n\n8 *3 =24\n\n36 *4 =144\n\n54 *5=270\n\nAdding them up: 24 +144=168; 168+270=438.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a hollow cube with an outer dimension of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, constructed from smaller cubes of size 1 cm\u00b3. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and the task is to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Structure of the Cube**:  \n   - The cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, meaning the outer layer consists of small cubes, while the inner part is empty.  \n   - The outer dimensions of the cube are 5 cm on each side, and the inner hollow part has dimensions of 3 cm on each side (since 5 - 2 \u00d7 1 = 3).  \n   - The total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the number of small cubes in the outer shell, calculated as:  \n     \\[\n     5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 \\, \\text{small cubes}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total Faces of Smaller Cubes**:  \n   - Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is:  \n     \\[\n     98 \\times 6 = 588 \\, \\text{faces}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Painted Faces**:  \n   - The outer surface of the large cube is painted. Each face of the large cube is a 5 \u00d7 5 grid of small cube faces, so there are:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150 \\, \\text{painted faces}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   - The total number of unpainted faces is the difference between the total faces of the small cubes and the painted faces:  \n     \\[\n     588 - 150 = 438 \\, \\text{unpainted faces}.\n     \\]\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, the number of unpainted faces can also be calculated by considering the contribution of each small cube based on its position:\n- **Corner Cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 3 = 24.\n  \\]\n- **Edge Cubes (Non-Corner)**: Each edge has 3 small cubes (excluding corners), and there are 12 edges. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces and 4 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  12 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 144.\n  \\]\n- **Face Center Cubes**: Each face has \\( (5-2) \\times (5-2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) face center cubes (excluding edges), and there are 6 faces. Each face center cube has 1 painted face and 5 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 270.\n  \\]\n- **Total Unpainted Faces**:  \n  \\[\n  24 + 144 + 270 = 438.\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces is **438**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with a thickness of 1cm. It's made up of smaller cubes each of size 1cm. The outer surface is painted. How many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\n\nHmm. So, the cube is hollow, meaning it's like a box, right? The outer part is 5cm on each side, but the thickness is 1cm. That means the walls of the cube are 1cm thick, and the inside is empty space. So, the cube is made up of 1cm\u00b3 smaller cubes arranged in a larger cube structure.\n\nWait, the cube is 5cm on each side, so each edge is 5 units long. But since the thickness is 1cm, that implies that on each face, there's a 1cm layer that's part of the cube, and the rest is hollow. So, the inner dimensions would be 3cm on each side, because 5 minus 2 times the thickness (since both ends are 1cm thick). Let me check: 5 - 2*(1) = 3. So the inner empty space is a 3x3x3 cube.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the smaller cubes. Each small cube is 1cm\u00b3, so they're 1x1x1. So the entire outer cube would be 5x5x5 small cubes if it were solid, which is 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the number of small cubes used is less.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the cube is made of smaller cubes, so maybe the entire structure, including the hollow part, consists of those small cubes. But no, a hollow cube with 1cm thickness would have the outer layer as the small cubes and the inside as empty. So the total number of small cubes is the outer shell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cube is constructed as a shell. Let me think: The cube has a size of 5cm, which is 5 small cubes on each edge. But since it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm, the inner dimensions are 3cm on each edge (because 5-2=3, subtracting 1cm from each side). So the number of small cubes in the entire hollow cube would be the number of cubes in a 5x5x5 cube minus the number in a 3x3x3 cube. So that's 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes. Wait, but wait, no, that's if it's a solid cube minus the hollow part. But the problem says the cube is hollow, so maybe the entire structure is just the outer shell, which is 5x5x5 minus the inner 3x3x3. So that would be 98 small cubes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the cube is entirely made up of small cubes, but arranged as a hollow structure with 1cm thickness. So, perhaps the number of small cubes is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98. But I'm not entirely sure about that; perhaps the way the problem is phrased, it's a hollow cube made of small cubes, each of size 1cm\u00b3. So the hollow part is empty, so the total number of small cubes is 5^3 minus (5-2)^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So 98 small cubes make up the hollow structure.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube has 6 faces. The outer surfaces are painted, but the inner surfaces (if any) are not painted because they're inside the hollow part. Wait, but in this case, the hollow part is empty, so the inner surfaces of the small cubes (the ones facing the hollow) aren't painted either. So, each small cube on the outer surface has some of their faces painted, and those on the inner surfaces (if any) would have their inner faces unpainted. But wait, in this case, since the hollow cube has a thickness of 1cm, the small cubes on the outer layer are the ones that make up the shell. So, the inner part is empty, so any small cube that's on the outer shell has some of its faces painted, and the ones that are in the shell (but not on the outer surface) would have some faces exposed to the hollow, which aren't painted. But wait, wait a minute, perhaps I should model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the total number of small cube faces that are on the outside, which are painted, and then subtract that from the total number of small cube faces to find the unpainted ones. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of small cubes and their faces, and then subtract the painted ones.\n\nWait, another approach: Each small cube in the hollow cube can be in one of several positions: on the corner, on an edge, on a face, or inside the shell but not on the outer surface. Wait, but in a hollow cube with 1cm thickness, the inner part is a 3x3x3 cube, so the small cubes that are part of the shell are those that are in the 5x5x5 cube but not in the 3x3x3 inner cube.\n\nEach small cube on the shell contributes some number of painted faces. The ones on the corners will have 3 painted faces, the edges (non-corner) will have 2, the face centers (non-edge) will have 1, and the inner cubes (if any) will have none. But wait, in this case, the shell is only 1cm thick, so there are no inner cubes beyond the hollow. So, the small cubes in the shell are those that are on the corners, edges, and faces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the total number of small cube faces that are painted. Each face of the large cube has a 5x5 grid of small cube faces, so each face has 25 small cube faces. There are 6 faces, so 6*25 = 150 painted small cube faces.\n\nWait, but each small cube's face is part of the large cube's face. So, the total painted small cube faces would be 6*(5*5) = 150.\n\nBut each small cube can have multiple faces painted. So, if I sum all the painted faces, it's 150. Each small cube's face that's on the outside is painted. So, the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. So, the total number of small cube faces is the number of small cubes multiplied by 6. Wait, but each small cube is part of the shell, so how many small cubes are there? Let's compute that.\n\nAs earlier, the shell is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, so 125-27=98 small cubes. Each has 6 faces, so 98 * 6 = 588 small cube faces in total.\n\nThe number of painted small cube faces is 150. So, the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. So, 438 faces are unpainted.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Because each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. For example, corner cubes have 3 painted, edge (non-corner) have 2, face (non-edge) have 1, and the inner cubes (if any) have 0. But in this case, the shell is only 1cm thick, so all the small cubes are on the surface, right? Because the hollow is 3x3x3, so the shell is 1 layer thick.\n\nWait, but in a 5x5x5 cube, the small cubes on the shell would include all the ones on the corners, edges, and faces. But each small cube in the shell is part of one or more faces of the large cube. So, each small cube on the corner of the large cube has 3 of its faces painted. The ones on the edges (but not corners) have 2 painted. The ones on the faces (but not edges) have 1 painted. The ones inside the shell would have 0, but in this case, since the shell is only 1cm thick, there are no such cubes. Wait, no, the shell is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 98 cubes. So, each of these 98 cubes is on the outer layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach of calculating the total painted small cube faces as 6*(5*5) = 150 is correct. So, the total unpainted would be 98*6 - 150 = 588-150=438. So, the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: each small cube in the shell contributes some number of painted faces. Let me compute how many small cubes are in each category.\n\nIn a cube, there are 8 corner small cubes, each with 3 painted faces. So, 8 *3 =24 painted faces.\n\nThen, the edges: each edge of the cube has 5 small cubes, but the two at the ends are the corners, so 5-2=3 per edge. Each of these has 2 painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 *3=36 small cubes on edges (non-corner), each contributing 2 painted faces: 36 *2=72.\n\nFaces: each face has a 5x5 grid of small cubes. The corners are already counted, and the edges are also counted. So, the remaining on each face are the inner ones, which form a 3x3 grid (since 5-2=3). But wait, no, each face has 5x5=25 small cubes. Subtracting the 4 corners and 4 edges (each edge has 3 non-corner, but on a face, each edge is a line of 5 small cubes, but 2 are corners, so 3 in the middle). So, per face, the face centers are (5-2)*(5-2) =3x3=9. Each of these has 1 painted face. So, 6 faces *9 =54 small cubes, each contributing 1 painted face: 54 *1=54.\n\nSo, total painted small cube faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150, which matches the earlier calculation. So, the total painted small cube faces are 150.\n\nThe total number of small cube faces in the shell is 98 *6=588. So, unpainted would be 588-150=438. So, the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but another approach: each small cube in the shell has some painted faces. The ones that are on the inside (facing the hollow) are unpainted. But in this case, the shell is 1cm thick, so each small cube in the shell is on the outer surface, and the inner face (towards the hollow) is not painted. So, each small cube in the shell has one face that's unpainted (the inner face). But wait, that's only if the small cube is on the inside of the shell. But in a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell is part of the outer face and may have an inner face, but not all of them. Let me think.\n\nIn a hollow cube, each small cube in the shell has one face that's on the inside, except for the ones on the very corners. Wait, no, perhaps every small cube in the shell (except those on the very edges and corners) have one face that's on the inside. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think about a single face of the cube. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes. The ones on the edges of this face are part of the edges of the cube. So, each small cube on the face has one face on the outside (painted) and one face on the inside (unpainted), except for the ones on the edges of the face, which are part of the edges of the cube and may have more painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small cube in the shell has one face that's part of the hollow, so that face is unpainted. So, the number of unpainted faces would be equal to the number of small cubes in the shell, each contributing one unpainted face. So, 98 small cubes, each with one unpainted face: 98 unpainted faces. But wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation gives 438, which is way higher than 98. So I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Each small cube in the shell has some of its faces painted (those on the exterior) and some not. But for each small cube, how many of its 6 faces are on the exterior? For example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, so 3 of its 6 are painted, leaving 3 unpainted. But in reality, the corner cube's inner faces are not part of the hollow, so they're unpainted. So, perhaps each small cube has some unpainted faces.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is more accurate: each small cube can have some faces painted (those on the outside) and some unpainted (those on the inside, or adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow).\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. So, each small cube's face that is not on the exterior is unpainted. So, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 minus the number of painted faces.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube).\n\nAlternatively, the total unpainted faces would be 6 * number of small cubes - number of painted faces.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier: 6*98 =588, minus 150 (painted) gives 438 unpainted. So that approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each small cube in the shell has 6 - painted_faces. So, for each small cube, the number of unpainted faces is 6 - (number of painted faces). So, for corner cubes: 3 painted, 3 unpainted. For edge cubes: 2 painted, 4 unpainted. For face center cubes: 1 painted, 5 unpainted.\n\nSo, let's compute this:\n\nNumber of corner small cubes: 8. Each contributes 3 painted faces, so unpainted per corner cube: 3.\n\nNumber of edge (non-corner) small cubes: each edge has 5 small cubes, 2 are corners, so 3 per edge. 12 edges, so 12 *3 =36. Each contributes 2 painted faces, so 4 unpainted per cube.\n\nNumber of face (non-edge) small cubes: each face has (5-2)^2=9. 6 faces, so 54. Each contributes 1 painted face, so 5 unpainted per cube.\n\nSo, the total unpainted faces would be:\n\n8 *3 (corners) + 36 *4 (edges) +54 *5 (face centers).\n\nCalculating:\n\n8 *3 =24\n\n36 *4 =144\n\n54 *5=270\n\nAdding them up: 24 +144=168; 168+270=438.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. So the answer is 438, which is option A.\n\n\nThe problem involves a hollow cube with an outer dimension of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, constructed from smaller cubes of size 1 cm\u00b3. The outer surface of the cube is painted, and the task is to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Structure of the Cube**:  \n   - The cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, meaning the outer layer consists of small cubes, while the inner part is empty.  \n   - The outer dimensions of the cube are 5 cm on each side, and the inner hollow part has dimensions of 3 cm on each side (since 5 - 2 \u00d7 1 = 3).  \n   - The total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is the number of small cubes in the outer shell, calculated as:  \n     \\[\n     5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98 \\, \\text{small cubes}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Total Faces of Smaller Cubes**:  \n   - Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces for all 98 small cubes is:  \n     \\[\n     98 \\times 6 = 588 \\, \\text{faces}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Painted Faces**:  \n   - The outer surface of the large cube is painted. Each face of the large cube is a 5 \u00d7 5 grid of small cube faces, so there are:  \n     \\[\n     6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150 \\, \\text{painted faces}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Unpainted Faces**:  \n   - The total number of unpainted faces is the difference between the total faces of the small cubes and the painted faces:  \n     \\[\n     588 - 150 = 438 \\, \\text{unpainted faces}.\n     \\]\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, the number of unpainted faces can also be calculated by considering the contribution of each small cube based on its position:\n- **Corner Cubes**: There are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces and 3 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  8 \\times 3 = 24.\n  \\]\n- **Edge Cubes (Non-Corner)**: Each edge has 3 small cubes (excluding corners), and there are 12 edges. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces and 4 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  12 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 144.\n  \\]\n- **Face Center Cubes**: Each face has \\( (5-2) \\times (5-2) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) face center cubes (excluding edges), and there are 6 faces. Each face center cube has 1 painted face and 5 unpainted faces. Contribution to unpainted faces:  \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 270.\n  \\]\n- **Total Unpainted Faces**:  \n  \\[\n  24 + 144 + 270 = 438.\n  \\]\n\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces is **438**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hollow cube, and I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow, right? And it's made up of smaller 1cm cubes. The size of the larger cube is 5cm, but wait, does that mean each edge is 5cm? I think so. So the cube is 5x5x5 cm in size. But it's hollow, meaning only the outer layer is there, and the inside is empty. Oh wait, the thickness is 1cm. So the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. So actually, the inner dimensions would be (5-2*1) cm in each dimension. Because on each side, the thickness takes up 1cm, so both ends subtract 1 each. So 5-2=3. So the inner part is 3x3x3, but that's empty. So the structure is like a shell.\n\nSo the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube would be the outer volume minus the inner empty volume. The outer volume is 5x5x5 = 125. The inner empty volume is 3x3x3=27. So total small cubes are 125-27=98. Wait, but the problem says the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. So each small cube is 1cm\u00b3.\n\nBut wait, the question isn't about the number of small cubes; it's about the number of faces that remain unpainted. So the outer surfaces are painted, and the question is about how many faces of the small cubes are not painted.\n\nEach small cube can have 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., painted faces. But we're looking for the total number of unpainted faces across all the small cubes.\n\nWait, no, the question is phrased as \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.\" So each face of each small cube is either painted or not. So I need to calculate the total number of faces that are not painted after the entire outer surface is painted.\n\nSo perhaps I should find the total number of small cube faces and subtract the number of painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the number of unpainted faces directly.\n\nBut let's think. Each small cube is 1cm\u00b3, so each has 6 faces. The total number of small cubes is 98, so total faces are 98 *6=588.\n\nNow, how many of these faces are painted? Because the outer surfaces are painted. So the painted faces are those that are on the surface of the hollow cube.\n\nWait, but the hollow cube's outer surface is a 5x5x5 cube. So each face of the larger cube has 5x5=25 small cube faces. Since a cube has 6 faces, the total painted small cube faces would be 6*25=150. But wait, that's the case if the cube was solid. But in this case, the cube is hollow with thickness 1cm. So the outer surface is painted, but the inner surfaces of the hollow part are not part of the outer surface. So the inner surfaces aren't painted.\n\nWait, no, the painting is only on the outer surfaces. So the inner surfaces (like the walls inside the hollow) are not painted. So the painted small cube faces are only those that are on the outer surfaces of the hollow cube.\n\nSo how many faces are painted? Let's think. The hollow cube is like a shell. Each face of the hollow cube (like front, back, left, right, top, bottom) has 5x5 small cube faces. So each face contributes 25 painted faces. So 6 *25=150 painted faces.\n\nSo the total painted small cube faces are 150. So the unpainted faces are total faces (588) minus painted (150) = 588-150=438. So the answer would be 438, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Are all those painted faces on the small cubes unique? Because each small cube on the surface may have multiple faces painted. But when we count the total painted faces, each is a separate face. So for example, a corner cube has 3 painted faces, but each of those is counted in the 150.\n\nSo that approach is correct. So 150 painted faces, 588-150=438 unpainted.\n\nBut wait, another approach: each small cube contributes some number of painted faces. But perhaps it's easier to calculate the unpainted.\n\nEach small cube that's not on the surface has all its faces unpainted. But wait, in a hollow cube, the small cubes can be either on the surface (and thus some of their faces are painted) or in the inner part (which is empty, so no small cubes there). So all the small cubes are on the surface.\n\nWait, no. Because the hollow cube's inner part is 3x3x3, so the outer shell is 5x5x5 minus 3x3x3, which is 125-27=98 small cubes.\n\nSo each of these 98 cubes is on the surface. Now, each of these can have 1, 2, or 3 painted faces.\n\nBut perhaps the total number of painted faces is the sum of all painted faces per cube.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is correct: the total painted small cube faces are 6*25=150. So the unpainted is 588-150=438.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 438.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 438, which matches our calculation.\n",
