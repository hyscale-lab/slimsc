      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where Ram and Krishna start from points A and B, respectively, and they're moving towards each other. Their speeds are given as 20 m/s and 40 m/s. They meet after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, so both are moving towards each other. So their speeds add up because they're approaching each other. So the combined speed is 20 + 40, which is 60 m/s. Right? Because when two objects move towards each other, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds.\n\nThey meet after 10 seconds. So the distance covered until they meet is the combined speed multiplied by time. So that's 60 m/s * 10 s. Let me calculate that: 60 *10 is 600 meters. So together, they've covered 600 meters in that time.\n\nBut wait, that's the distance from A to C plus B to C. Oh, right, because when they meet at point C, the sum of the distances they've each covered equals the total distance between A and B. So the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters. So that's the answer. Let me just double-check. Ram's speed is 20 m/s, so in 10 seconds, he covers 200 meters. Krishna's speed is 40 m/s, so he covers 400 meters in the same time. Adding those together, 200 +400 =600. Yep, that makes sense.

They meet after 10 seconds, and I need to find the total distance between A and B.\n\nHmm, let me think. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So here, Ram's speed is 20 m/s and Krishna's is 40 m/s. So together, they're approaching each other at 20 + 40 = 60 m/s.\n\nWait, right. Because when moving towards each other, the time until they meet is the time until the distance between them is covered by their combined speeds. So in 10 seconds, the distance they cover together would be the sum of the distances each has traveled.\n\nSo the distance each has covered would be speed multiplied by time. Let's calculate that.\n\nRam's distance: 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters.\nKrishna's distance: 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters.\n\nSo together, the total distance from A to B is 200 + 400 = 600 meters.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 600 meters.
