      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips. Karen works for 4 hours for the same purpose. I need to find out after how many hours they can buy the cake together. Oh right, working together, so their rates add up?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about their rates of earning tips. Like, how much does each of them earn per hour. But wait, I don't know the exact amounts, so perhaps I need to model this with some variables.\n\nLet me denote the total cost of the ice cream cake as C. Sharon earns C in 5 hours, so her rate is C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen earns C in 4 hours, so her rate is C over 4.\n\nWait, but actually, maybe I should think of their rates in terms of how much each makes per hour. Let me rephrase: Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, and Karen's is C/4 per hour. Because if Sharon makes enough in 5 hours, then each hour she contributes C/5 towards the total. Same for Karen.\n\nBut wait, when they work together, their rates add up. So the combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour. Let me compute that. To add these, I need a common denominator. 20 is a common denominator for 5 and 4. So (4C +5C)/20 = 9C/20. So together, they earn 9C/20 per hour.\n\nWait, but the total amount needed is C. So how long does it take for them to earn C together? Time is total amount divided by rate. So time T = C / (9C/20). The C cancels out, so T = 20/9 hours. Wait, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. Hmm, but the options are all whole numbers. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, 20/9 is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is roughly 2 hours and 13 minutes. But none of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. \"Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the way to think about it is that Sharon's contribution per hour is 1/5 of the cake's cost, and Karen's is 1/4. So when they work together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4 per hour. Let me calculate that: 1/5 is 0.2, 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them gives 0.45 per hour. So together, they can earn 0.45 of the cake's cost each hour.\n\nWait, but then the time to earn one whole cake would be 1 divided by 0.45, which is approximately 2.222 hours. Again, same as before. But the options don't have a 2.222. So perhaps the problem is phrased differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the ice cream cake's cost is the same for both, so their combined efforts add up. So Sharon's time is 5 hours, so her rate is 1/5 per hour. Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. So together, 1/5 +1/4 = 9/20 per hour. So to get 1 cake, time is 1/(9/20) = 20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours. But the options are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWait, but the options don't have 20/9. So perhaps the question is actually about how much they each contribute in a certain time, and when their combined contributions sum to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of their rates as money. Suppose the ice cream cake costs T dollars. Sharon earns T in 5 hours, so her rate is T/5 per hour. Karen's rate is T/4 per hour. Working together, their combined rate is (T/5 + T/4) = (4T +5T)/20 =9T/20 per hour. So the time to earn T together is T/(9T/20) =20/9 hours, same as before. Hmm.\n\nBut since 20/9 is approximately 2.222, which is between 2 and 3. Looking at the options, the closest higher whole number is 3, but the question is about when they can buy it, so they can't buy it until they have enough. So 2 hours would give them 2 *9T/20 = 18T/20= 9T/10, which is less than T. At 3 hours, 3*(9T/20)=27T/20, which is more than T. So the earliest whole hour they can buy is 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 20/9, so perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 20/9, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Let me think differently. Suppose Sharon needs to work 5 hours to earn enough, and Karen needs 4. So maybe the cake costs some amount, say X. Sharon's hourly rate is X/5, Karen's is X/4. So working together, per hour they earn (X/5 + X/4) = 9X/20. So the time to earn X together is X/(9X/20) =20/9 hours, which is about 2.222. Since the question asks after how many hours, perhaps they need a whole number of hours. So the next whole hour is 3 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 3. So the answer would be C)3 hours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If in 2 hours, they would have earned (9X/20)*2 = 18X/20 = 0.9X, which is 90% of the required amount. They need X, so 2 hours isn't enough. In 3 hours, it's (9X/20)*3 =27X/20, which is 1.35X. That's more than enough, so they can buy the cake after 3 hours. So the correct answer is 3 hours, which is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nAlright, the problem says Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough tips for the cake. Karen works 4 hours for the same purpose. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nHmm, wait, so I'm thinking about how their work hours relate to their earnings. Maybe I should model this using rates. Like, how much each of them earns per hour and then see when their combined earnings add up to the cost of the cake.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate would be C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's rate is C divided by 4. \n\nSo Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, Karen's is C/4 per hour. If they work together, their combined rate would be the sum of both their rates. So combined, they earn (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nWait, let's calculate that. To add C/5 and C/4, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 5 and 4 is 20. So C/5 is 4C/20, and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding those together gives (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So together, they earn 9C/20 per hour.\n\nNow, the total amount needed is C. So how long will it take for them to earn C together at a rate of 9C/20 per hour? Time is equal to total amount divided by rate, so time T = C / (9C/20). \n\nSimplifying that, the C cancels out. So T = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours. Wait, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. But wait, the options are in whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours. So 20/9 is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2 hours and 13 minutes. \n\nBut the options don't have a 2.22 option. So maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the time each takes individually and we need to find when their combined efforts add up. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the cake costs a certain amount of money. Let's assign a variable to that. Let\u2019s say the cake costs X. \n\nSharon earns X in 5 hours, so her rate is X/5 per hour. Karen earns X in 4 hours, so her rate is X/4 per hour. Working together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) per hour. \n\nSo, the combined rate R = X/5 + X/4 = (4X +5X)/20 =9X/20 per hour. \n\nSo, the time T needed to earn X together is X divided by R, which is X / (9X/20) )= 20/9 hours \u2248 2.222 hours.\n\nBut the options are whole numbers. So maybe the problem is assuming that they both work the same number of hours, and the sum of what each contributes is enough for the cake. So, let me model it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s say they both work T hours. Sharon's contribution is (X/5) * T, and Karen's is (X/4)*T. Together, they need their combined contributions to be at least X.\n\nSo, (X/5)*T + (X/4)*T \u2265 X.\n\nLet me factor out X: X*(T/5 + T/4) \u2265 X.\n\nDivide both sides by X (assuming X\u22600): T*(1/5 + 1/4) \u22651.\n\nCompute 1/5 +1/4. That's (4 +5)/20=9/20. So T*(9/20) \u22651 \u2192 T \u2265 (1)/(9/20) \u2192 T\u226520/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nAgain, that's the same result. So the minimum time is 20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours. Looking at the options, the closest higher integer is 3 hours (option C). But wait, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, but 20/9 is approximately 2.22, which is more than 2 hours but less than 3. So if they work for 2 hours, how much would they have earned?\n\nIn 2 hours, Sharon would have earned (X/5)*2 = 2X/5. Karen would have earned (X/4)*2 = X/2. Adding them: 2X/5 + X/2 = (4X +5X)/10 =9X/10. That's 0.9X, which is less than X. So 2 hours isn't enough.\n\nIn 3 hours: Sharon would earn 3X/5, Karen 3X/4. Together: 3X/5 +3X/4 = (12X +15X)/20=27X/20. Which is 1.35X, which is more than X. So 3 hours would be enough. But is 3 the minimal time?\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 20/9 hours is about 2.22, which is the exact time. So the minimal time is 20/9, but since the options don't have fractions, perhaps the question is implying when they can collectively afford it together, perhaps when the sum of their individual contributions equals or exceeds the cost. So 20/9 is the exact time, but since we can't have fractions in the options, the answer would be 3 hours, because 2 hours isn't enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo the correct answer would be the smallest integer greater than 20/9, which is 3. So option C, 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the options don't have a 2.22 option, so the answer is C)3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the time is calculated as the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5. Hmm, LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. But that would mean 20 hours, which is not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct, and the answer is 20/9 hours, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I should see if the question is asking for the time when both have worked for T hours, and their combined earnings are enough.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Sharon's earning rate is 1/5 per hour (assuming the cake costs 1 unit), Karen's is 1/4 per hour. Together, they earn 1/5 +1/4 =9/20 per hour. So time T is 1/(9/20)=20/9\u22482.222 hours. So the answer is 20/9, but the options don't have that. So the next whole hour is 3 hours. So the answer would be C)3 hours.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So it's looking for the time when their combined work equals the cost. So the correct calculation is 20/9, which is about 2.22 hours. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, but that's not enough. So the next option is 3, which is when they can afford it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe each of them contributes a certain amount, and together they can buy the cake when their combined time equals the time needed. But that doesn't quite make sense. \n\nWait, another approach: The combined rate is 9/20 per hour. So in 2 hours, they earn 9/20 * 2 = 9/10, which is 0.9, less than 1. In 3 hours, 9/20 *3 =27/20=1.35, which is more than 1. So the minimum time is between 2 and 3 hours. So the answer would be 3 hours as the next whole number.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3 hours.\n",

So T = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours. Wait, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. But wait, the options are in whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours. So 20/9 is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2 hours and 13 minutes. \n\nBut the options don't have a 2.22 option. So maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the time each takes individually and we need to find when their combined efforts add up. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the cake costs a certain amount of money. Let's assign a variable to that. Let\u2019s say the cake costs X. \n\nSharon earns X in 5 hours, so her rate is X/5 per hour. Karen earns X in 4 hours, so her rate is X/4 per hour. Working together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) per hour. \n\nSo, the combined rate R = X/5 + X/4 = (4X +5X)/20 =9X/20 per hour. \n\nSo, the time T needed to earn X together is X divided by R, which is X / (9X/20) )= 20/9 hours \u2248 2.222 hours.\n\nBut the options are whole numbers. So maybe the problem is assuming that they both work the same number of hours, and the sum of what each contributes is enough for the cake. So, let me model it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s say they both work T hours. Sharon's contribution is (X/5) * T, and Karen's is (X/4)*T. Together, they need their combined contributions to be at least X.\n\nSo, (X/5)*T + (X/4)*T \u2265 X.\n\nLet me factor out X: X*(T/5 + T/4) \u2265 X.\n\nDivide both sides by X (assuming X\u22600): T*(1/5 + 1/4) \u22651.\n\nCompute 1/5 +1/4. That's (4 +5)/20=9/20. So T*(9/20) \u22651 \u2192 T \u2265 (1)/(9/20) \u2192 T\u226520/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nAgain, that's the same result. So the minimum time is 20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours. Looking at the options, the closest higher integer is 3 hours (option C). But wait, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, but 20/9 is approximately 2.22, which is more than 2 hours but less than 3. So if they work for 2 hours, how much would they have earned?\n\nIn 2 hours, Sharon would have earned (X/5)*2 = 2X/5. Karen would have earned (X/4)*2 = X/2. Adding them: 2X/5 + X/2 = (4X +5X)/10 =9X/10. That's 0.9X, which is less than X. So 2 hours isn't enough.\n\nIn 3 hours: Sharon would earn 3X/5, Karen 3X/4. Together: 3X/5 +3X/4 = (12X +15X)/20=27X/20. Which is 1.35X, which is more than X. So 3 hours would be enough. But is 3 the minimal time?\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 20/9 hours is about 2.22, which is the exact time. So the minimal time is 20/9, but since the options don't have fractions, perhaps the question is implying when they can collectively afford it together, perhaps when the sum of their individual contributions equals or exceeds the cost. So 20/9 is the exact time, but since we can't have fractions in the options, the answer would be 3 hours, because 2 hours isn't enough.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo the correct answer would be the smallest integer greater than 20/9, which is 3. So option C, 3 hours.\n\nWait, but the options don't have a 2.22 option, so the answer is C)3 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the time is calculated as the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5. Hmm, LCM of 4 and 5 is 20. But that would mean 20 hours, which is not one of the options. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct, and the answer is 20/9 hours, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I should see if the question is asking for the time when both have worked for T hours, and their combined earnings are enough.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Sharon's earning rate is 1/5 per hour (assuming the cake costs 1 unit), Karen's is 1/4 per hour. Together, they earn 1/5 +1/4 =9/20 per hour. So time T is 1/(9/20)=20/9\u22482.222 hours. So the answer is 20/9, but the options don't have that. So the next whole hour is 3 hours. So the answer would be C)3 hours.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So it's looking for the time when their combined work equals the cost. So the correct calculation is 20/9, which is about 2.22 hours. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, but that's not enough. So the next option is 3, which is when they can afford it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think differently. Maybe each of them contributes a certain amount, and together they can buy the cake when their combined time equals the time needed. But that doesn't quite make sense. \n\nWait, another approach: The combined rate is 9/20 per hour. So in 2 hours, they earn 9/20 * 2 = 9/10, which is 0.9, less than 1. In 3 hours, 9/20 *3 =27/20=1.35, which is more than 1. So the minimum time is between 2 and 3 hours. So the answer would be 3 hours as the next whole number.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)3 hours.\n\n\nTo determine how long Sharon and Karen need to work together to afford the ice cream cake, we first calculate their individual rates of earning tips. Let the cost of the cake be \\( C \\). Sharon earns \\( C \\) in 5 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{C}{5} \\) per hour. Karen earns \\( C \\) in 4 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{C}{4} \\) per hour. Working together, their combined rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{C}{5} + \\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{4C + 5C}{20} = \\frac{9C}{20} \\, \\text{per hour}.\n\\]\n\nTo find the time \\( T \\) it takes for them to earn \\( C \\) together, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{\\text{Total amount}}{\\text{Combined rate}} = \\frac{C}{\\frac{9C}{20}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\, \\text{hours}.\n\\]\n\nThis is approximately \\( 2.222 \\) hours. Since the options are in whole numbers, we round up to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. To confirm, in 2 hours, their combined earnings would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings in 2 hours} = \\left(\\frac{C}{5} \\cdot 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{C}{4} \\cdot 2\\right) = \\frac{2C}{5} + \\frac{2C}{4} = \\frac{4C}{10} + \\frac{5C}{10} = \\frac{9C}{10}.\n\\]\n\nThis is \\( 0.9C \\), which is insufficient. In 3 hours, their combined earnings would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings in 3 hours} = \\left(\\frac{C}{5} \\cdot 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{C}{4} \\cdot 3\\right) = \\frac{3C}{5} + \\frac{3C}{4} = \\frac{12C}{20} + \\frac{15C}{20} = \\frac{27C}{20}.\n\\]\n\nThis is \\( 1.35C \\), which is sufficient. Therefore, the minimum whole number of hours required is 3.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nHmm, the question says Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips for the cake. Karen works for 4 hours for the same purpose. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nWait, so each of them individually can earn enough by working a certain number of hours. But when they work together, how does that add up? I think this is a problem about rates. Like, how much each of them earns per hour, and then combining their rates to see when together they reach the total needed amount.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's assume the cost of the ice cream cake is some amount, say C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate would be C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's rate is C divided by 4.\n\nWait, but actually, each of them is working to earn C. So Sharon's earning rate is (C/5) per hour, and Karen's is (C/4) per hour. Because if she works 5 hours at that rate, she gets C. Same for Karen.\n\nSo when they work together, their combined rate would be Sharon's rate plus Karen's rate. So that's (C/5) + (C/4) per hour. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe common denominator for 5 and 4 is 20. So (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So together, they earn 9C/20 per hour.\n\nBut wait, how much do they need together? Oh, wait, no. The cake costs C. So the combined rate is 9C/20 per hour. So the time T needed for them to earn C together would be T = C / (9C/20) = 20/9 hours. Wait, that can't be right because 20/9 is about 2.222 hours, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, but the options are 1,2,3,4,5 hours. So maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So each of them individually can earn enough in those times. But when they work together, how much time do they need?\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the total tips each can collect in a certain time, and together their combined tips reach the required amount.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's say the total amount needed is X. Sharon's rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's is X/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) per hour. So the time T when their combined earnings equal X is:\n\nT*(X/5 + X/4) = X.\n\nDivide both sides by X: T*(1/5 +1/4) =1.\n\nSo T*(9/20) =1 \u2192 T=20/9 \u2248 2.222 hours. But the options don't have that. Hmm, so maybe the answer isn't in the options, but I must have messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the problem isn't about rates but about how much they earn each hour. Let me think of it another way. Suppose the ice cream cake costs C. Sharon's tip rate is C per 5 hours, so per hour she makes C/5. Karen makes C per 4 hours, so per hour C/4. So per hour together, they make (C/5 + C/4) = (4C +5C)/20 = 9C/20.\n\nSo how long to make C together? Time = total amount / rate \u2192 C / (9C/20) = 20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours. But that's not an option. The options are 1,2,3,4,5. So perhaps the question is about when their combined work hours equal something else. Wait, maybe it's about how much each contributes over time, but I'm not getting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about their combined working hours leading to the cake being affordable. Maybe if Sharon works for T hours, she contributes (T/5) towards the cake, and Karen contributes (T/4). Together, their contributions add up to 1 (the whole cake). So T/5 + T/4 =1.\n\nLet me solve that equation. T*(1/5 +1/4) =1 \u2192 T*(9/20) =1 \u2192 T=20/9\u22482.222 hours, which is the same as before. So that's about 2 and 2/9 hours. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of work rates. Like, Sharon's rate is 1 cake per 5 hours, so 1/5 per hour. Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is 1/5 +1/4 =9/20 per hour. So time to complete 1 cake is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.222 hours. But again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options are integers, so perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe the problem is about how much each can contribute per hour, and when adding their contributions, the sum is enough to buy the cake.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say the cost of the cake is $X. Sharon's earning rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's is X/4 per hour.\n\nIf they work together for T hours, Sharon earns (X/5)*T, and Karen earns (X/4)*T. The sum is (X/5 + X/4)*T = X*(9/20)*T.\n\nWe need this sum to be at least X. So X*(9/20)*T \u2265 X \u2192 (9/20) T \u22651 \u2192 T \u226520/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nBut the options are integers. So the smallest integer greater than 2.222 is 3. So the answer would be option C)3 hours. But let's see if the options have 3. Yes, option C is 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So 3 is an option. So the correct answer is C)3 hours.\n\nWait, but why isn't it 2 hours? Let's check. At 2 hours, their combined earnings would be (X/5)*2 + (X/4)*2 = (2X/5)+(2X/4) = (2X/5)+(X/2) = (4X/10 +5X/10) =9X/10. Which is 0.9X, less than X. So they still need more. At 3 hours, (3X/5)+(3X/4)= (12X/20 +15X/20)=27X/20=1.35X, which is more than enough. So the minimal integer is 3.\n\nSo the answer should be C)3 hours.\n",

Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Karen works for 4 hours to do the same. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nWait, I think I get the gist. They each have their own rates of earning money for the cake, and we need to find out when their combined efforts will add up to the total cost. Oh right, it's a combined work rate problem.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate is C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's rate is C divided by 4 because she takes 4 hours.\n\nSo Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, and Karen's is C/4 per hour. When they work together, their rates add up. So combined, they earn (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nWait, but I think it's better to think in terms of fractions to add them. Let me compute that. The denominators are 5 and 4. The least common denominator is 20. So C/5 is 4C/20, and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding them together gives (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So together, they earn 9C/20 per hour.\n\nBut wait, the total amount needed is C. So if they earn 9C/20 each hour together, how long until they have C?\n\nLet me set up the equation. Let t be the time in hours. So (9C/20) * t = C.\n\nHmm, I can solve for t. Dividing both sides by C (assuming C isn't zero, which makes sense here), I get (9/20) * t = 1.\n\nThen, t = 1 * (20/9) = 20/9 hours. Let me compute that as a decimal. 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours, which is about 2 hours and 13.33 minutes.\n\nWait, but the options are whole numbers. The options given are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nSo 20/9 is about 2.22, which is more than 2 hours. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is B)2, but wait, no. Wait, because they can't buy the cake until they have enough. So if 2 hours gives them (9C/20)*2 = 18C/20 = 0.9C. That's less than C, so they still need more time. So 2 hours isn't enough. Then, after 2.22 hours, they reach exactly C.\n\nBut the options don't have 20/9. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of their individual contributions. Let me consider their rates as money per hour, not in terms of the cake cost.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me denote the total cost of the cake as C.\n\nSharon's rate: She earns C in 5 hours, so per hour she makes C/5.\n\nKaren's rate: She earns C in 4 hours, so per hour she makes C/4.\n\nWhen working together, their combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour. As before, that's 9C/20 per hour.\n\nSo to find the time t when their combined earnings equal C: (9C/20) * t = C.\n\nCancel C from both sides (assuming C \u2260 0), getting (9/20) t = 1 \u2192 t = 20/9 \u2248 2.222 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible answers are all whole numbers. So 20/9 is approximately 2 and 2/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours. So the next whole hour after that is 3 hours, but wait, maybe we're to choose the next whole number of hours needed.\n\nWait, but the question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? So the exact time is 20/9 hours, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should model this as work rates. Like, how much of the cake each can buy per hour.\n\nSharon can buy the whole cake in 5 hours, so per hour she contributes 1/5 of the cake. Similarly, Karen contributes 1/4 per hour.\n\nWorking together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4 = (4 +5)/20 = 9/20 per hour. So in one hour, they complete 9/20 of the cake. How long to finish 1 cake?\n\nTime = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours, which is the same as before.\n\nBut the options don't have 20/9. Hmm, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again: \"After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think in terms of how much each contributes per hour towards the cake's cost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find how much each earns per hour, and then see how long until their combined earnings sum to the cake's cost.\n\nLet me denote the cake's cost as C.\n\nSharon's earning rate: C/5 per hour.\n\nKaren's earning rate: C/4 per hour.\n\nCombined rate: C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/(20) =9C/20 per hour.\n\nSo after t hours, they've earned 9C/20 * t.\n\nWe need this to be \u2265 C.\n\nSo 9C/20 * t \u2265 C \u2192 9t/20 \u22651 \u2192 t \u2265 20/9 \u2248 2.222 hours.\n\nSo the smallest integer t where this is true is 3 hours. Because 2 hours would give 18C/20 = 0.9C, which is less than C. 3 hours would give 27C/20 = 1.35C, which is more than enough.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 3 hours. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because maybe I should think in terms of how much each can contribute. Let's say the cake is $20, just to make the math easier.\n\nIf the cake is $20, Sharon's rate is $4 per hour (since she makes $20 in 5 hours: 20/5=4). Karen's rate is $5 per hour (20/4=5). Together, they make 4+5=9 dollars per hour.\n\nTo make $20, time needed is 20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So in 2 hours, they make 18 dollars. That's not enough. After 3 hours, they make 27 dollars, which is enough.\n\nSo the answer must be 3 hours. So the correct option is C.\n",

Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Karen works for 4 hours to do the same. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\n\nWait, I think I get the gist. They each have their own rates of earning money for the cake, and we need to find out when their combined efforts will add up to the total cost. Oh right, it's a combined work rate problem.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C dollars. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate is C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's rate is C divided by 4 because she takes 4 hours.\n\nSo Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, and Karen's is C/4 per hour. When they work together, their rates add up.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough tips for an ice cream cake. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking after how many hours they can buy the cake together. \n\nWait, so Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough for the cake, and Karen works 4 hours for the same. So each of them individually can afford the cake after their respective hours. But the question is about them working together. I think I need to find the combined rate at which they earn money so that I can figure out how long it would take both of them together to earn enough.\n\nLet me think in terms of rates. Like, if Sharon can earn enough in 5 hours, her rate is the total amount needed divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's rate is the same total divided by 4. But wait, since the cake's cost is the same, maybe I can represent the total cost as a variable, say, C.\n\nSo Sharon's rate would be C divided by 5 hours, which is C/5 per hour. Karen's rate is C/4 per hour. When they work together, their rates add up. So the combined rate is (C/5 + C/4). \n\nWait, let me compute that. Let's find a common denominator for 5 and 4, which is 20. So C/5 is 4C/20, and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding them together gives (4C +5C)/20 = 9C/20 per hour. \n\nSo together, they earn 9C/20 per hour. Now, how long does it take them to earn C together? Let's denote the time as t. The equation would be (9C/20) * t = C. \n\nLet me solve for t. Divide both sides by C (assuming C isn't zero, which makes sense here). So, (9/20)*t =1. Multiply both sides by 20/9, t = 20/9 hours. \n\nWait, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. But the options given are whole numbers. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nHmm, 20/9 is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is more than 2 but less than 3. So looking at the options, the closest whole number higher than 2.22 is 3 hours. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait a second, maybe the way I approached it is wrong. Because the question says Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. So her rate is such that 5 hours of work equals the cost of the cake. Similarly, Karen's 4 hours of work equals the cake's cost. So, maybe I should consider their rates as fractions of the cake per hour.\n\nAh, that's right. So Sharon's rate is 1/5 of the cake per hour, and Karen's rate is 1/4 of the cake per hour. Adding their rates together, 1/5 + 1/4 = (4 +5)/20 =9/20. So together, they make 9/20 of the cake per hour. To find how long to make 1 whole cake, t = 1 / (9/20) =20/9 hours, which is the same as before. \n\nSo 20/9 is about 2.222 hours. But the options are in whole hours. So if they work together for 2 hours, how much would they have? Let's calculate 2 hours * (9/20 cake/hour) = 18/20 = 0.9 of the cake. Not enough. So after 2 hours, they have 90% of the cake's cost, but not the full amount. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is thinking in terms of money. Let me think of it another way. Let\u2019s assume the ice cream cake costs T dollars. Sharon earns T dollars in 5 hours, so her hourly rate is T/5 dollars per hour. Karen earns T in 4 hours, so her rate is T/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is T/5 + T/4 = (4T +5T)/20 =9T/20 per hour. \n\nSo how many hours t does it take for them to make T together? The equation is (9T/20) * t = T. Dividing both sides by T, (9/20)t=1, so t=20/9\u22482.222 hours, same as before. So if they work together for 2.222 hours, they can afford the cake. But the options are in whole hours. \n\nSo looking at the options again, the choices are 1,2,3,4,5 hours. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? It must be the smallest whole number of hours that is greater than or equal to 20/9 (~2.222). So 3 hours is the answer because at 2 hours, they don't have enough. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about it differently. Maybe the problem is considering that each of them contributes money until they can collectively afford it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the sum of their individual contributions adding up to the cost. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose Sharon earns S per hour, and Karen earns K per hour. Sharon needs 5S to buy the cake, and Karen needs 4K to buy the same cake. So 5S = 4K = C (the cost of the cake). So S = C/5, K = C/4. \n\nWhen they work together, the combined earnings per hour are S + K = C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour. So how long until they have C? Time = C / (9C/20) )=20/9 hours, same as before. So again, it's 20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So the answer isn't an option, but the options are integers. \n\nSo the correct answer would be the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. But looking at the options, option B is 2, option C is 3. So the correct choice is B or C?\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it in terms of work rates. Sharon can do 1/5 of the work per hour, Karen can do 1/4. Together, they do 1/5 +1/4 =9/20 per hour. So the time to complete 1 job (buy the cake) is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again. \"After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So perhaps the question is asking for the time when both have individually earned enough. But that doesn't make sense. Because if they are working together, they are pooling their money.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased such that Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake, and Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So perhaps their individual rates are such that Sharon's rate is R_s = C/5, and Karen's rate is R_k = C/4. \n\nWhen working together, their combined rate is R_s + R_k = C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So the time taken together is C / (9C/20) )=20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So again, same result.\n\nBut the options are all whole numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is the next whole number, which is 3 hours. So the answer would be option C)3.\n\nWait, but let me see the options again:\n\nA)1\n\nB)2\n\nC)3\n\nD)4\n\nE)5\n\nHmm, another approach: perhaps the problem is not about rates but about the combined time. Let me think, suppose Sharon can do it in 5 hours, Karen in 4. How long together? Wait, but that's the classic work rate problem. So the formula is 1/(1/5 +1/4) = 1/(9/20)=20/9\u22482.222 hours. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is different.\n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough for the cake, and Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So each has a certain amount of money, and when combined, how much time would they need to have enough.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if Sharon has already earned enough in her 5 hours, and Karen in her 4, but they're working together. Maybe it's about how much time they need to work together beyond their individual times? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the least common multiple of 5 and 4, which is 20. But that would be 20 hours, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that they're contributing their tips to a combined pool, but each only works until they reach the required amount. No, that complicates things further. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Because if Sharon takes 5 hours alone and Karen 4, perhaps together they can do it in less than 4 hours. So the options are 2, which is less than 4. But 20/9 is about 2.22, which is more than 2 but less than 3. So 3 hours is the next whole number. So the answer is 3 hours, option C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because 20/9 is approximately 2.22, which is more than 2 hours. So after 2 hours, they wouldn't have enough. So the correct answer should be 3 hours.\n",

Let's find a common denominator for 5 and 4, which is 20. So C/5 is 4C/20, and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding them together gives (4C +5C)/20 = 9C/20 per hour. \n\nSo together, they earn 9C/20 per hour. Now, how long does it take them to earn C together? Let's denote the time as t. The equation would be (9C/20) * t = C. \n\nLet me solve for t. Divide both sides by C (assuming C isn't zero, which makes sense here). So, (9/20)*t =1. Multiply both sides by 20/9, t = 20/9 hours. \n\nWait, 20 divided by 9 is approximately 2.222... hours. But the options given are whole numbers. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nHmm, 20/9 is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is more than 2 but less than 3. So looking at the options, the closest whole number higher than 2.22 is 3 hours. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem.\n\nWait a second, maybe the way I approached it is wrong. Because the question says Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake. So her rate is such that 5 hours of work equals the cost of the cake. Similarly, Karen's 4 hours of work equals the cake's cost. So, maybe I should consider their rates as fractions of the cake per hour.\n\nAh, that's right. So Sharon's rate is 1/5 of the cake per hour, and Karen's rate is 1/4 of the cake per hour. Adding their rates together, 1/5 + 1/4 = (4 +5)/20 =9/20. So together, they make 9/20 of the cake per hour. To find how long to make 1 whole cake, t = 1 / (9/20) =20/9 hours, which is the same as before. \n\nSo 20/9 is about 2.222 hours. But the options are in whole hours. So if they work together for 2 hours, how much would they have? Let's calculate 2 hours * (9/20 cake/hour) = 18/20 = 0.9 of the cake. Not enough. So after 2 hours, they have 90% of the cake's cost, but not the full amount. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is thinking in terms of money. Let me think of it another way. Let\u2019s assume the ice cream cake costs T dollars. Sharon earns T dollars in 5 hours, so her hourly rate is T/5 dollars per hour. Karen earns T in 4 hours, so her rate is T/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is T/5 + T/4 = (4T +5T)/20 =9T/20 per hour. \n\nSo how many hours t does it take for them to make T together? The equation is (9T/20) * t = T. Dividing both sides by T, (9/20)t=1, so t=20/9\u22482.222 hours, same as before. So if they work together for 2.222 hours, they can afford the cake. But the options are in whole hours. \n\nSo looking at the options again, the choices are 1,2,3,4,5 hours. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? It must be the smallest whole number of hours that is greater than or equal to 20/9 (~2.222). So 3 hours is the answer because at 2 hours, they don't have enough. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me think about it differently. Maybe the problem is considering that each of them contributes money until they can collectively afford it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the sum of their individual contributions adding up to the cost. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose Sharon earns S per hour, and Karen earns K per hour. Sharon needs 5S to buy the cake, and Karen needs 4K to buy the same cake. So 5S = 4K = C (the cost of the cake). So S = C/5, K = C/4. \n\nWhen they work together, the combined earnings per hour are S + K = C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour. So how long until they have C? Time = C / (9C/20) )=20/9 hours, same as before. So again, it's 20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So the answer isn't an option, but the options are integers. \n\nSo the correct answer would be the next whole hour, which is 3 hours. But looking at the options, option B is 2, option C is 3. So the correct choice is B or C?\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it in terms of work rates. Sharon can do 1/5 of the work per hour, Karen can do 1/4. Together, they do 1/5 +1/4 =9/20 per hour. So the time to complete 1 job (buy the cake) is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, because the options are given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again. \"After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So perhaps the question is asking for the time when both have individually earned enough. But that doesn't make sense. Because if they are working together, they are pooling their money.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is phrased such that Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough to buy the cake, and Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So perhaps their individual rates are such that Sharon's rate is R_s = C/5, and Karen's rate is R_k = C/4. \n\nWhen working together, their combined rate is R_s + R_k = C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So the time taken together is C / (9C/20) )=20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So again, same result.\n\nBut the options are all whole numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is the next whole number, which is 3 hours. So the answer would be option C)3.\n\nWait, but let me see the options again:\n\nA)1\n\nB)2\n\nC)3\n\nD)4\n\nE)5\n\nHmm, another approach: perhaps the problem is not about rates but about the combined time. Let me think, suppose Sharon can do it in 5 hours, Karen in 4. How long together? Wait, but that's the classic work rate problem. So the formula is 1/(1/5 +1/4) = 1/(9/20)=20/9\u22482.222 hours. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is different.\n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough for the cake, and Karen works 4 hours to earn enough. So each has a certain amount of money, and when combined, how much time would they need to have enough.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if Sharon has already earned enough in her 5 hours, and Karen in her 4, but they're working together. Maybe it's about how much time they need to work together beyond their individual times? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the least common multiple of 5 and 4, which is 20. But that would be 20 hours, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that they're contributing their tips to a combined pool, but each only works until they reach the required amount. No, that complicates things further. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Because if Sharon takes 5 hours alone and Karen 4, perhaps together they can do it in less than 4 hours. So the options are 2, which is less than 4. But 20/9 is about 2.22, which is more than 2 but less than 3. So 3 hours is the next whole number. So the answer is 3 hours, option C.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because 20/9 is approximately 2.22, which is more than 2 hours. So after 2 hours, they wouldn't have enough. So the correct answer should be 3 hours.\n\n\nTo determine how long Sharon and Karen need to work together to afford the ice cream cake, we analyze their individual rates and combine them.\n\n1. **Individual Rates**:  \n   - Sharon earns enough to buy the cake in 5 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the cake per hour.  \n   - Karen earns enough to buy the cake in 4 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the cake per hour.  \n\n2. **Combined Rate**:  \n   When working together, their rates add up:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4 + 5}{20} = \\frac{9}{20} \\text{ of the cake per hour.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time to Complete the Cake Together**:  \n   To find the time \\( t \\) it takes for them to complete 1 whole cake together, we use the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{9}{20} \\right) t = 1.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\( t \\):  \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1}{\\frac{9}{20}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22 \\text{ hours.}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpreting the Options**:  \n   The question asks for the smallest whole number of hours after which they can afford the cake together. Since \\( 2.22 \\) hours is more than 2 hours but less than 3 hours, the correct answer is the next whole number, which is **3 hours**.\n\nThus, the final answer is **C) 3 hours**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough money for an ice cream cake. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, the problem says Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. Karen works 4 hours for the same purpose. I need to find out after how many hours they can buy the cake together.\n\nWait, I think this is a rate problem. Like, how much each of them earns per hour, and then combine their rates to see when they reach the total amount needed.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let's say the cost of the ice cream cake is C. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate is C divided by 5 hours. Similarly, Karen's rate is C over 4 hours.\n\nSo Sharon's rate (S) is S = C/5 per hour. Karen's rate (K) is K = C/4 per hour.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate would be S + K. So that's (C/5) + (C/4). Let me calculate that. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. 5 and 4 have 20 as the least common denominator.\n\nSo, C/5 is 4C/20 and C/4 is 5C/20. Adding them together gives 9C/20. So together, they earn 9C/20 per hour.\n\nWait, but how much time does it take for them to earn C together? Because the total amount needed is C.\n\nTime is equal to total amount divided by rate. So time (T) = C / (9C/20). Let me compute that.\n\nC divided by (9C/20) is the same as C multiplied by 20/(9C). The C's cancel out, so it's 20/9 hours. Hmm, 20 divided by 9 is about 2.222... hours. That's a little over 2 hours.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. None of these are exactly 2.222, but the options are integers. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I should think in terms of how much each earns per hour and then find the time when their combined earnings reach the total cost.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the total cost be a specific number to make it easier. Let's assume the cake costs $20. I just pick 20 because it's a common multiple of 5 and 4, which might make the calculations easier.\n\nSo if the cake is $20, Sharon earns $20 in 5 hours. That means her hourly rate is 20/5 = $4 per hour. Karen earns $20 in 4 hours, so her rate is 20/4 = $5 per hour.\n\nCombined, their rates are 4 + 5 = $9 per hour. So together, they make $9 every hour. To make $20, how long does it take?\n\nTime = total amount / rate = 20 / 9 \u2248 2.222 hours. Which is about 2 hours and 13 minutes. But the options are in whole hours, so the next whole hour they can buy it would be after 3 hours? No, wait, wait. Wait, the question says after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together. So they need to have earned at least $20 together.\n\nSo in 2 hours, how much do they make? 2 hours * $9/hour = $18. That's not enough. In 3 hours, it's 3 *9= $27, which is more than $20. So they can buy it after 3 hours. But wait, the options include 3 as option C. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together. So it's the earliest integer hour when their combined earnings meet or exceed the cost.\n\nWait, but wait, is there another way to approach this without assuming the total cost? Maybe let the cost be C, and compute the time.\n\nSharon's rate is C/5, Karen's is C/4. Together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20. So the time needed is C / (9C/20) )= 20/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nBut the options are whole numbers, so the next whole number is 3. But wait, the options don't have 3 as the correct answer if I'm thinking about it correctly. Wait, the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, etc. So the answer would be 3 hours, option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Maybe it's about how much each contributes towards the total required. Suppose the cake costs X dollars. Sharon's contribution is X, so she needs to work 5 hours. So her hourly rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's rate is X/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) per hour.\n\nThe time to reach X together is X / (X/5 + X/4) = 1 / (1/5 +1/4 ) = 1/(9/20) )=20/9 hours \u22482.222 hours. So in 2 hours, they would have earned (X/5 +X/4)*2 = X*(2/5 + 2/4) = X*(2/5 + 1/2) = X*(4/10 +5/10)=9X/10. That's 0.9X, which is less than X. So after 2 hours, they can't buy it yet. After 3 hours, they have 3*(9X/20) =27X/20 =1.35X, which is enough. So the minimal integer hour is 3, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, the question says, \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So 20/9 is approximately 2.222 hours. So the earliest whole hour when they can buy it is 3 hours. But wait, maybe the question expects the time in fractional hours, but the options are all integers. So the correct answer is 2.222, but since the options don't have that, the next possible is 3. So the correct answer should be 3 hours, option C.\n\nWait, but wait, another way. Maybe the problem is about how much each contributes, and when their combined time allows them to reach the required amount. Wait, but the way it's worded, Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough for the cake. So the total money needed is equal to her earnings in 5 hours. Similarly for Karen.\n\nWait, but maybe the way to look at it is that the total money required is the same for both. So if Sharon earns S per hour, then 5S = total cost. Karen earns K per hour, so 4K = total cost. So 5S = 4K = C.\n\nSo S = C/5, K= C/4.\n\nWhen working together, their combined rate is S + K = C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour.\n\nSo the time T when combined earnings reach C is T = C/(9C/20) )=20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together\", implying the earliest time when both have contributed enough. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if Sharon can buy it alone in 5 hours and Karen in 4, together they should be able to buy it faster than either alone.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, 2.222 is approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes. So the earliest integer hour is 3 hours, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Perhaps the total amount they need is the sum of what each would earn individually. That doesn't make sense. No, because the cake's cost is fixed. So they're both saving towards the same cake, so their earnings add up.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let\u2019s let Sharon's earning per hour be s, Karen's be k. Sharon needs 5s = total cost, so s= C/5. Karen needs 4k = C, so k= C/4.\n\nWorking together, their combined rate is s + k = C/5 + C/4 = 9C/20 per hour.\n\nTo buy the cake, they need to earn C. So time T = C / (9C/20) )=20/9 \u22482.222 hours.\n\nSo the correct answer is 20/9, but the options are integers. So the answer must be the smallest integer greater than or equal to 20/9, which is 3. So option C.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the time as a fraction, but the options don't have that, so the correct answer is 3 hours.\n",

Let the total cost of the cake be \\( C \\). Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her hourly rate is \\( \\frac{C}{5} \\). Similarly, Karen earns enough in 4 hours, so her hourly rate is \\( \\frac{C}{4} \\). \n\nWhen working together, their combined hourly rate is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Combined rate} = \\frac{C}{5} + \\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{4C + 5C}{20} = \\frac{9C}{20}.\n\\]\n\nThe time \\( T \\) required for them to earn \\( C \\) together is:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{C}{\\text{Combined rate}} = \\frac{C}{\\frac{9C}{20}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.222 \\text{ hours}.\n\\]\n\nSince the options are in whole hours, we round up to the next whole number, which is 3 hours. In 2 hours, their combined earnings would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings in 2 hours} = \\left(\\frac{9C}{20}\\right) \\times 2 = \\frac{18C}{20} = 0.9C,\n\\]\n\nwhich is insufficient. In 3 hours, their earnings would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Earnings in 3 hours} = \\left(\\frac{9C}{20}\\right) \\times 3 = \\frac{27C}{20} = 1.35C,\n\\]\n\nwhich is enough to buy the cake. Therefore, the earliest whole hour when they can afford the cake together is 3 hours.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about Sharon and Karen working to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. I need to find out after how many hours they can buy it together.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips for the cake, and Karen works for 4 hours for the same purpose. So, each of them individually needs a certain amount of time to save enough money. But when they work together, how much time will they need?\n\nI think this is a problem about rates. Like, how much each person earns per hour, and then combining their rates to find the time needed when they work together. Let me think about rates.\n\nSharon works 5 hours to earn the money for the cake. So, her rate is (cake cost) divided by 5 hours. Similarly, Karen's rate is (cake cost) divided by 4 hours. But wait, the cake cost is the same for both, right? Because they both are earning enough to buy the same cake.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let's say the cost of the cake is C dollars. Sharon's hourly rate is C/5 dollars per hour. Karen's is C/4 dollars per hour. So when they work together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4.\n\nWait, I'm not sure if I should be adding their rates directly. Because if Sharon is making C/5 per hour, and Karen C/4, then together, per hour, they make (C/5 + C/4) dollars. So the total amount they make together each hour is that sum.\n\nBut they need to make C dollars together. So the time T it takes for them to make C together is C divided by their combined rate. So T = C / (C/5 + C/4).\n\nWait, let me write that out. T equals C divided by (C/5 + C/4). Let's compute that. Let's factor out C from the denominator: C (1/5 + 1/4). So T = C / [C (1/5 + 1/4)].\n\nOh, wait, the C's cancel out. So T = 1 / (1/5 + 1/4). Now, let's calculate 1/5 plus 1/4. To add those fractions, find a common denominator, which is 20. So 1/5 is 4/20, and 1/4 is 5/20. Adding them gives 9/20. So T is 1 divided by (9/20), which is 20/9 hours.\n\nWait, 20/9 hours is approximately 2.222... hours. But looking at the options, the choices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hours. Hmm, none of the options is exactly 20/9. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine. The problem says Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy the cake. So she earns the total amount in 5 hours. Similarly, Karen needs 4 hours. So their individual rates are such that Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour, Karen's C/4 per hour.\n\nWhen they work together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4. So the time T is C divided by that sum, which is as I did before. But the answer comes out to 20/9, which is about 2.22 hours, which is 2 hours and 13.33 minutes. The options don't have that, but they have option B as 2 hours. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for when they can buy the cake together, so perhaps we should consider the least common multiple or something else. Let me think differently. Maybe they each contribute a portion of their tips towards the cake. Wait, no, the problem states that each is working to earn enough to buy the cake, but perhaps when they combine their efforts, the total is achieved faster.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the combined work rates, like how much of the cake they can buy per hour together. Wait, perhaps the cake is considered as 1 unit of work. So Sharon's rate is 1/5 per hour (she can buy the cake in 5 hours, so per hour she contributes 1/5 towards the cake). Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4 = (4+5)/20 = 9/20 per hour.\n\nSo the time T is 1 divided by (9/20), which is 20/9 hours, same as before. Which is approximately 2.22 hours. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is expecting an approximate answer, but the options are all integers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about their individual contributions. Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so her rate is C/5. Karen's is C/4. Together, their combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour. The time to reach C is C divided by (C/5 + C/4) = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 \u2248 2.22 hours. So that's about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is 2 hours and about 13 minutes. So the closest option is 2 hours, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved differently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: How much of the cake can each of them contribute per hour? Sharon can contribute 1/5 of the cake per hour. Karen can contribute 1/4 per hour. Together, 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 per hour. So time to complete 1 cake is 1/(9/20) = 20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours, as before.\n\nBut the options don't have 20/9. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, which is option B. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another way to approach it: Let's say the cake costs X dollars. Sharon's earning rate is X/5 per hour. Karen's is X/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) per hour. So the time T is X divided by (X/5 + X/4) = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9, same as before.\n\nSo the time is 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.222 hours. So if they work together, after about 2.222 hours, they can buy the cake. Since the options are in whole hours, perhaps the correct answer is 3 hours, because 2 hours wouldn't be enough. Because 2 hours times their combined rate is 2*(9/20) = 18/20 = 9/10, which is less than 1. So after 2 hours, they still need more time. After 3 hours, they would have 3*(9/20) = 27/20 = 1.35, which is more than enough. So the earliest whole hour they can buy it together is 3 hours. But wait, the problem says 'after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?' So if 20/9 is approximately 2.22 hours, the next whole hour is 3 hours. But option C is 3 hours. But wait, the options don't have 2.22, but have 2 and 3 as options. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify whether they can buy the cake only after an integer number of hours. It's possible that the time is a fractional hour. But the options are all whole numbers, so perhaps the correct way is to round up to the next whole hour. But in that case, 20/9 is about 2.22, so the next hour is 3. But I'm not sure if the problem expects you to round up or if it's possible that the answer is 2 hours because 2.22 is closer to 2 than 3. But wait, the problem is about when they can buy the cake together. So they can buy it once they have enough money, which could be at 20/9 hours, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours because it's the integer part, but that would mean they don't have enough yet. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Let me think again. Sharon takes 5 hours to earn enough for the cake. So her rate is C/5 per hour. Karen's rate is C/4 per hour. Together, their rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour. So the time to get C together is C / (C/5 + C/4) = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. So the correct answer isn't among the options. But the options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved as a work-rate problem where each contributes to the same task. For example, if Sharon can do a job in 5 hours and Karen in 4, together they take 20/9 hours. But the options don't have 20/9. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, which is option B. But why? Because 20/9 is approximately 2.22, so the next whole hour is 3. Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to consider that when working together, their rates add up, and the time is 20/9, which is roughly 2 and 2/9 hours, so about 2 hours and 13 minutes. But since the options don't have fractions, the answer must be B)2 hours.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a different setup. Maybe the question is about how much each contributes per hour, and together, how much they need to accumulate.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's say the cake costs $20 (any amount would work, but 20 is a multiple of both 4 and 5, making calculations easier). So Sharon earns enough in 5 hours, so she makes $20 in 5 hours. That's $4 per hour. Karen earns $20 in 4 hours, so she makes $5 per hour. Together, they make $4 + $5 = $9 per hour. To earn $20 together, they need 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours, same as before. So after 2 hours, they would have 9*2=18 dollars, which is not enough. After 3 hours, 9*3=27, which is more than 20. So the earliest whole hour is 3 hours, which is option C.\n\nBut the question is phrased as, \"After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So if they can buy it as soon as they have enough, it would be at 20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours. But since the options are whole numbers, perhaps the answer is 3 hours. But wait, in the initial approach, we thought of 20/9, which is about 2.22. So the options don't have that, but perhaps the correct answer is 2 hours, but that would mean they don't have enough. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about the time each would take individually, and together they can do better. Let me think about it again. Let's model it as work rates.\n\nIf Sharon can complete the task (buying the cake) in 5 hours, her rate is 1/5 per hour. Karen's rate is 1/4 per hour. Together, their combined rate is 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 per hour. So the time to complete 1 task is 1/(9/20) = 20/9 hours, which is approximately 2.22 hours. So the correct answer is 20/9 hours, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 2 hours, but that would mean they don't have enough yet. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to find the least common multiple of 5 and 4, which is 20 hours, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's about how much each contributes per hour, and then how long until their combined contributions sum to the cake's cost. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me assign a variable for the cake's cost. Let C be the cost. Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour. Karen's is C/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour. So the time to reach C is C divided by (9C/20) = 20/9 hours. So again, the same result.\n\nBut the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be a question of when their combined work equals the cake's cost, but using the time each would take individually. Maybe it's a time addition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about how much each person contributes in a certain time, and together, when their contributions add up to the cake's cost.\n\nLet me think. Let's say after t hours, Sharon has earned (C/5)*t, and Karen has earned (C/4)*t. Together, their combined earnings are (C/5 + C/4)*t. We need this to be >= C.\n\nSo ( (C/5) + (C/4) ) * t >= C.\n\nDivide both sides by C: (1/5 + 1/4) t >= 1.\n\nWhich is (9/20) t >=1.\n\nSo t >= 20/9 hours.\n\nSo the minimum time is 20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours. So the earliest time is 2.22 hours, but the options are in whole numbers. So the next possible hour is 3 hours, which would give them enough. So the answer would be 3 hours, option C.\n\nBut the question says, \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So the precise answer is 20/9, which is about 2.22 hours. Since 2 hours would give them 18/20, which is 0.9, so 90% of the needed amount. Not enough. So the earliest whole hour is 3 hours, when they would have 27/20, which is more than 1.\n\nSo the correct answer is 3 hours, option C.\n",

Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to find the least common multiple of 5 and 4, which is 20 hours, but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's about how much each contributes per hour, and then how long until their combined contributions sum to the cake's cost. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me assign a variable for the cake's cost. Let C be the cost. Sharon's rate is C/5 per hour. Karen's is C/4 per hour. So together, their combined rate is C/5 + C/4 = (4C +5C)/20 =9C/20 per hour. So the time to reach C is C divided by (9C/20) = 20/9 hours. So again, the same result.\n\nBut the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be a question of when their combined work equals the cake's cost, but using the time each would take individually. Maybe it's a time addition. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about how much each person contributes in a certain time, and together, when their contributions add up to the cake's cost.\n\nLet me think. Let's say after t hours, Sharon has earned (C/5)*t, and Karen has earned (C/4)*t. Together, their combined earnings are (C/5 + C/4)*t. We need this to be >= C.\n\nSo ( (C/5) + (C/4) ) * t >= C.\n\nDivide both sides by C: (1/5 + 1/4) t >= 1.\n\nWhich is (9/20) t >=1.\n\nSo t >= 20/9 hours.\n\nSo the minimum time is 20/9 hours, which is about 2.22 hours. So the earliest time is 2.22 hours, but the options are in whole numbers. So the next possible hour is 3 hours, which would give them enough. So the answer would be 3 hours, option C.\n\nBut the question says, \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So the precise answer is 20/9, which is about 2.22 hours. Since 2 hours would give them 18/20, which is 0.9, so 90% of the needed amount. Not enough. So the earliest whole hour is 3 hours, when they would have 27/20, which is more than 1.\n\nSo the correct answer is 3 hours, option C.\n\n\nTo determine how many hours Sharon and Karen need to work together to afford the ice cream cake, we analyze their individual rates and combine them.\n\n1. **Individual Rates**:  \n   - Sharon earns enough to buy the cake in 5 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{C}{5} \\) dollars per hour, where \\( C \\) is the cost of the cake.  \n   - Karen earns enough to buy the cake in 4 hours, so her rate is \\( \\frac{C}{4} \\) dollars per hour.  \n\n2. **Combined Rate**:  \n   When working together, their combined rate is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Combined Rate} = \\frac{C}{5} + \\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{4C + 5C}{20} = \\frac{9C}{20} \\, \\text{dollars per hour}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Time to Afford the Cake Together**:  \n   The time \\( T \\) it takes for them to earn \\( C \\) dollars together is given by:  \n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{C}{\\text{Combined Rate}} = \\frac{C}{\\frac{9C}{20}} = \\frac{20}{9} \\, \\text{hours}.\n   \\]  \n   This is approximately \\( 2.22 \\) hours.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Options**:  \n   The problem provides only whole number options for hours. Since \\( 2.22 \\) hours is between 2 and 3 hours, we must determine whether 2 hours or 3 hours is the correct answer.  \n   - After 2 hours, their combined earnings would be:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings in 2 hours} = \\left( \\frac{9C}{20} \\right) \\times 2 = \\frac{18C}{20} = 0.9C,\n     \\]  \n     which is insufficient to buy the cake.  \n   - After 3 hours, their combined earnings would be:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings in 3 hours} = \\left( \\frac{9C}{20} \\right) \\times 3 = \\frac{27C}{20} = 1.35C,\n     \\]  \n     which is more than enough to buy the cake.  \n\nThus, the earliest whole hour after which they can afford the cake together is 3 hours.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Karen works for 4 hours for the same purpose. The question is, after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? The options are A to E, with A being 1 hour and E 5 hours.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a work rate problem. Like, how much each of them earns per hour and then combining their rates to find out when together they have enough money for the cake.\n\nLet me break it down. So, Sharon earns enough in 5 hours. Let's say the cost of the cake is C dollars. So Sharon's earnings per hour would be C divided by 5. Similarly, Karen's earnings would be C divided by 4 per hour.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think. If Sharon works 5 hours to earn enough, her rate is C/5 per hour. Karen's rate is C/4 per hour. So when they work together, their combined rate would be (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I add those together, I get (4C +5C)/(20) = 9C/20 per hour. So every hour together, they earn 9C/20 of the cake's cost. So how long until they have enough to buy the cake? That is, when their combined earnings equal C.\n\nLet me set up the equation. Let t be the time in hours they both work together. So (C/5 + C/4) * t = C.\n\nWait, but substituting the rates: (C/5 + C/4) * t = C.\n\nI can factor out C: C*(1/5 + 1/4) * t = C.\n\nDivide both sides by C (assuming C is not zero, which makes sense here). So (1/5 + 1/4) * t = 1.\n\nCalculate 1/5 + 1/4. Let me compute that. 1/5 is 0.2, 1/4 is 0.25. Adding them gives 0.45. So 0.45 * t = 1 \u2192 t = 1 / 0.45 \u2192 which is approximately 2.222 hours.\n\nWait, but the options are all integers. So 2.222 hours is about 2 and 2/9 hours, which is 2 hours and about 13 minutes. But none of the options are 2.222, so maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering their individual rates in terms of the cake. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the cost of the cake as C. Sharon's rate is C per 5 hours, so her rate is C/5 per hour. Karen's rate is C/4 per hour. So when working together, their combined rate is (C/5 + C/4) per hour.\n\nSo the time t needed would be when (C/5 + C/4) * t = C.\n\nSimplify: ( (4C +5C) / 20 ) * t = C \u2192 (9C/20)*t = C.\n\nDivide both sides by C: 9/20 * t = 1 \u2192 t = 20/9 hours. Which is approximately 2.222 hours, as before.\n\nBut the options don't have 20/9, which is about 2.222. So the closest integer would be 3 hours, but wait, let's check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps instead of considering the rates in terms of the cake, I should think about their earnings in terms of money. But the problem doesn't give any specific amounts, so perhaps I should assume that the cake's cost is such that their tips add up.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's suppose the ice cream cake costs X dollars. Then Sharon's hourly rate is X/5 dollars per hour. Karen's rate is X/4 dollars per hour. When they work together, their combined rate is (X/5 + X/4) dollars per hour. The time needed to earn X dollars together would be t = X / (X/5 + X/4).\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So t = X / [ (4X +5X)/(20) ) ] \u2192 X divided by (9X/20) \u2192 X * (20/(9X)) ) \u2192 20/9 hours, which is about 2.222 hours.\n\nBut the options don't have that. So maybe the problem is designed to think in terms of how much each contributes per hour as a fraction of the cake. So for Sharon, she needs 5 hours to get 1 cake's worth. So in one hour, she contributes 1/5 of the cake. Similarly, Karen contributes 1/4 per hour.\n\nSo when working together, their combined contribution per hour is 1/5 + 1/4. Let's compute that: 1/5 is 0.2, 1/4 is 0.25. Together, 0.45 per hour. So to reach 1 cake, it's 1 / 0.45 \u2248 2.222 hours. So that's 2 and 2/9 hours, or approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nBut the options don't have this. The options are in whole numbers. So perhaps the question is asking for the least integer of time when their combined efforts can afford the cake. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when working together, they're both contributing to the same cake. So the time required is the time when the sum of their individual contributions equals 1.\n\nWait, another way: Let's think about how much each contributes per hour.\n\nSharon's rate: 1 cake per 5 hours \u2192 1/5 per hour.\n\nKaren's rate: 1 cake per 4 hours \u2192 1/4 per hour.\n\nCombined rate: 1/5 + 1/4 = (4 +5)/20 = 9/20 per hour.\n\nSo time = 1 / (9/20) = 20/9 \u22482.222 hours. So 20/9 is about 2.222, which is approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, 2 hours is option B, and 3 hours is option C. But 20/9 is approximately 2.222, which is more than 2 hours. So if the question is asking for the earliest whole hour when they can buy the cake together, then it would be 3 hours because at 2 hours, they would have earned (9/20)*2 = 9/10, which is 0.9 of the cake, not enough. At 3 hours, (9/20)*3 = 27/20 = 1.35, which is more than enough.\n\nWait, but the question says \"after how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together?\" So if they work for t hours, the combined amount is (9/20)*t. We need this to be >=1.\n\nSo 9/20 * t >=1 \u2192 t >= 20/9 \u22482.222. So the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.222 is 3. So the answer is 3 hours, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another approach: Let's calculate how much each earns per hour in terms of the cake.\n\nSharon: 1/5 per hour.\n\nKaren: 1/4 per hour.\n\nCombined: 1/5 + 1/4 = 9/20 per hour.\n\nSo in t hours, total is (9/20)t.\n\nWe need (9/20)t >=1.\n\nt >= 20/9 \u22482.222.\n\nSo the minimal integer t is 3.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option C)3 hours.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is 2 hours, but 2 hours would give 9/20 *2= 18/20= 0.9, which is less than 1. So they can't buy the cake yet. So the next hour is 3, which gives 27/20, which is over 1. So yes, option C.\n",
