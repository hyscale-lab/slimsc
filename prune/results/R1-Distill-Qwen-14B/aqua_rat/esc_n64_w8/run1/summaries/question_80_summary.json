      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. And after those two years, the population will be double what it was one year ago. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the timing here. So, the projection is for the next two years, and then the population two years from now would be double the population of one year ago. Hmm.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the current population is P. So right now, it's P. \n\nIn the first year, it's supposed to increase by 10%, so that would make it P * 1.10. Then in the second year, another 10% increase. So the population after two years would be P * 1.10 * 1.10, which is P * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population is exactly double the population of one year ago. Oh wait, one year ago from now would be the population before the first 10% increase. Because if it's now, and the next two years are coming, then one year ago was before the first 10% growth. So one year ago, the population was P_initial, and two years from now it's P_initial * 2.\n\nWait, maybe I should define the variables more clearly. Let me think:\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let the population one year ago be X.\n- Then, the current population (now) would be X plus a 10% increase, right? Wait, no. Wait, the projection is for the next two years. So one year ago, the population was, say, X. Now, the current population is X multiplied by 1.1 (since it increased 10% from last year). Then, in the next two years, it's expected to increase 10% each year. So two years from now, the population would be X * 1.1 * 1.1 * 1.1? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Let me make a timeline.\n\n- Let me denote the population one year ago (which is the past) as X.\n\n- Then, the current population is X increased by 10% for that past year. So current population is X * 1.10.\n\n- Now, the next two years are projected. So next year (Year 1 from now) will have a 10% increase, so it'll be current * 1.1 = X * 1.1 * 1.1.\n\n- The year after that (Year 2 from now) will also have a 10% increase: X * 1.1^3.\n\nWait, but the problem states that two years from now, the population is double the population of one year ago. One year ago was X, so two years from now, the population is 2X.\n\nSo according to the projection, after two more years (so in two years), the population will be 2X.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nX * (1.1)^2 = 2X.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. Because the current population is X * 1.1. Then, in the next two years, each year it's multiplied by 1.1. So after two years, it's (X * 1.1) * (1.1)^2 = X * 1.1^3.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The current population is one year after the population X. So the next two years would be two more steps. So the population two years from now is X multiplied by 1.1 (for last year's increase) multiplied by 1.1^2 (for the next two years). Wait, that can't be right. Let me think of it as:\n\nYear 0: X (one year ago)\nYear 1: X * 1.1 (current year)\nYear 2: (X * 1.1) * 1.1 = X * 1.1^2 (one year from now)\nYear 3: X * 1.1^3 (two years from now)\n\nThe problem says that two years from now (Year 3), the population is double what it was one year ago (Year 0). So:\n\nX * 1.1^3 = 2X.\n\nOh, that makes sense. So I can set up the equation:\n\nX * (1.1)^3 = 2X.\n\nI can cancel X from both sides (assuming X is not zero, which makes sense for a population), so:\n\n(1.1)^3 = 2.\n\nWait, let me calculate (1.1)^3. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21. Then 1.21 * 1.1 is 1.331. So 1.331 is not equal to 2. Hmm, but the problem says that the projection is that two years from now, it's double. So according to this calculation, (1.1)^3 is 1.331, which is much less than 2. So that suggests that the current projection would not reach double. So perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I got the timeline wrong. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nSo, \"two years from now\" is the future. \"One year ago\" is in the past.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet the current population be P.\n\nOne year ago, the population was P / 1.1, because it's increased by 10% to become P now.\n\nIn the next two years, each year it's increased by 10%. So after one year, it's P * 1.1. After two years, it's P * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem says that after two years, the population is double that of one year ago. So:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nWait, because one year ago's population was P / 1.1, right? Because if you have a 10% increase from one year ago to now, then P = (one year ago's population) * 1.1 \u2192 one year ago's population is P / 1.1.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nI can cancel P from both sides (assuming P \u2260 0):\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1.\n\nLet me compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (1.1)^2 = 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 / 1.1 \u2248 1.81818...\n\nWait, 1.21 is not equal to 1.818, so that can't be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nWait another approach: Let me denote variables as:\n\nLet the population one year ago be X.\n\nCurrent population (now) is X * 1.1.\n\nPopulation after next year (Year 1 from now) is X * 1.1 * 1.1 = X * 1.21.\n\nPopulation after the following year (Year 2 from now) is X * 1.21 * 1.1 = X * 1.331.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago. So:\n\nX * 1.331 = 2 * X.\n\nWait, that would mean 1.331 X = 2X \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 which is not true. So that's impossible. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, but the projection is for the next two years (so including the current year). Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current population is P. The next two years, each with 10% increase. So after two years, it's P * (1.1)^2. The problem says that this equals double the population one year ago.\n\nSo, one year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.1. Because P = P_prev * 1.1.\n\nSo, the equation is P * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nWait, let's compute this equation:\n\nMultiply both sides by 1.1 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nP * (1.1)^3 = 2 P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^3 = 2.\n\nBut (1.1)^3 is 1.331, which is not 2. So this suggests that the current projections can't make the population double in two years. But the problem says that if the projection comes true, then two years from now the population would be double what it was one year ago. So perhaps I'm misdefining the variables.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the current population be P. Then, one year ago, it was P_prev = P / 1.1 (since it's 10% less than current). Then, the projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.1)^2. According to the problem, that equals 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1.\n\nLet me compute the left side: (1.1)^2 = 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 / 1.1 \u2248 1.81818.\n\nHmm, 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that can't be correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So one year ago was before the first 10% increase.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say that one year ago, the population was X. \n\nSo, the current population is X * 1.1 (since it's a 10% increase from one year ago).\n\nIn the next two years, each year it increases by 10%. So after two years, the population is X * 1.1 * (1.1)^2 = X * 1.1^3.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2X. So:\n\nX * (1.1)^3 = 2X \u2192 (1.1)^3 = 2.\n\nBut (1.1)^3 is 1.331, which is less than 2. So this is impossible. So that suggests that the projections would not make the population double one year ago. But the problem says that the projection is that it would be double, so perhaps I'm getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the two years of 10% increases are in the past, and the current population is double that of one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it differently. Let me try again.\n\nLet me consider that the current population is P.\n\nThe population one year ago was P / 1.1.\n\nThe projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that P * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not possible. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the past. Wait, the problem says that the projection is for the next two years. So perhaps the 10% increase is for the last year, not the next two. Wait, no, the question is about the last year's increase.\n\nWait, the question is asking: Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\n\nAh! So the last year, which is the year before now. So, the population one year ago was X, and now it's X * 1.1.\n\nBut according to the projection, two years from now, it's X * (1.1)^3, which is supposed to be double X.\n\nSo,\n\nX * (1.1)^3 = 2X \u2192 1.331 X = 2 X \u2192 which would require 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the population one year ago is not X, but the current population is X. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set current population as X.\n\nOne year ago, the population was X / 1.1.\n\nIn two years, the population will be X * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So:\n\nX * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLeft side: X * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 X / 1.1 \u2248 1.818 X.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 X = 1.818 X \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not true. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of it as a problem where the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, and the growth rate for the next two years is 10% each year. So I need to find what the growth rate was in the last year.\n\nWait, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say that one year ago, the population was P.\n\nSo, current population is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate in the last year (the year before now).\n\nIn the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So after two years, the population is P * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this equals double the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 P.\n\nWe can cancel P from both sides:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.1)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 / 1.21: Let me compute that.\n\n1.21 is 121/100. So 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nSo the population increase in the last year was approximately 65.29%, which is closest to option D)65%.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n",

The problem says that this equals double the population one year ago.\n\nSo, one year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.1.

So perhaps I'm misdefining the variables.\n\nWait, maybe I should let the current population be P. Then, one year ago, it was P_prev = P / 1.1 (since it's 10% less than current). Then, the projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.1)^2.

So that can't be correct. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago.

So that suggests that the projections would not make the population double one year ago. But the problem says that the projection is that it would be double, so perhaps I'm getting the timeline wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the two years of 10% increases are in the past, and the current population is double that of one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it differently. Let me try again.\n\nLet me consider that the current population is P.\n\nThe population one year ago was P / 1.1.\n\nThe projection is that in two years, the population will be P * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that P * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1).\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not possible. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the past. Wait, the problem says that the projection is for the next two years. So perhaps the 10% increase is for the last year, not the next two. Wait, no, the question is about the last year's increase.\n\nWait, the question is asking: Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\n\nAh! So the last year, which is the year before now. So, the population one year ago was X, and now it's X * 1.1.\n\nBut according to the projection, two years from now, it's X * (1.1)^3, which is supposed to be double X.\n\nSo,\n\nX * (1.1)^3 = 2X \u2192 1.331 X = 2 X \u2192 which would require 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the population one year ago is not X, but the current population is X. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set current population as X.\n\nOne year ago, the population was X / 1.1.\n\nIn two years, the population will be X * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. So:\n\nX * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (X / 1.1).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLeft side: X * 1.21.\n\nRight side: 2 X / 1.1 \u2248 1.818 X.\n\nSo,\n\n1.21 X = 1.818 X \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not true. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of it as a problem where the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, and the growth rate for the next two years is 10% each year. So I need to find what the growth rate was in the last year.\n\nWait, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say that one year ago, the population was P.\n\nSo, current population is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate in the last year (the year before now).\n\nIn the next two years, the population increases by 10% each year. So after two years, the population is P * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this equals double the population one year ago, which is 2P.\n\nSo,\n\nP * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 P.\n\nWe can cancel P from both sides:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2.\n\nCompute (1.1)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculate 2 / 1.21: Let me compute that.\n\n1.21 is 121/100. So 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nSo the population increase in the last year was approximately 65.29%, which is closest to option D)65%.\n\nSo the correct answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the population growth in Boomtown. Let the population one year ago be denoted as \\( P \\). The current population is then \\( P \\times 1.1 \\) (a 10% increase from one year ago). Over the next two years, the population is projected to grow at 10% per year, so the population two years from now will be:\n\n\\[\nP \\times 1.1 \\times (1.1)^2 = P \\times (1.1)^3\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is exactly double the population one year ago. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1.1)^3 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n(1.1)^3 = 2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.1)^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n1.1 \\times 1.1 = 1.21, \\quad 1.21 \\times 1.1 = 1.331\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n1.331 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible, so we re-express the problem by considering the growth rate in the last year. Let the population one year ago be \\( P \\), and let the growth rate in the last year be \\( r \\). The current population is then:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r)\n\\]\n\nOver the next two years, the population grows at 10% per year, so the population two years from now is:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2\n\\]\n\nThe problem states that this equals double the population one year ago:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDividing through by \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.1)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n1.1 \\times 1.1 = 1.21\n\\]\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289\n\\]\n\nConverting to a percentage:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 65.29\\%\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **65%**, corresponding to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, I remember that percentages can be tricky, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, right now, the population is probably P, and in the next year, it'll go up by 10%, making it P * 1.10. Then, the following year, it'll go up another 10%, so that's P * 1.10 * 1.10, which is P * 1.21. So after two years, the population would be 21% higher than it is now.\n\nWait, but the problem states that two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Oh, that's interesting. So, let me think about the timing here.\n\nLet me define some variables. Let\u2019s say the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population was P divided by 1.10, because if it increased by 10% last year, then last year's population was P/1.10. Because, for example, if last year's population was X, then X * 1.10 = P. So X = P / 1.10.\n\nTwo years from now, the population will be P * 1.10 * 1.10 = P * 1.21. According to the problem, this is equal to double the population of one year ago. One year ago was P / 1.10, so double that is 2 * (P / 1.10).\n\nSo setting them equal: 1.21 * P = 2 * (P / 1.10). Let me write that equation:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10)\n\nHmm, I can cancel P from both sides since P is not zero. So:\n\n1.21 = 2 / 1.10\n\nLet me calculate the right side. 2 divided by 1.10 is... 2 / 1.1. Let me compute that. 1.1 is 11/10, so 2 divided by (11/10) is 2 * (10/11) = 20/11 \u2248 1.818.\n\nWait, but 1.21 is equal to 1.818? That can't be right. Oh wait, that suggests that 1.21 = 1.818, which is not true. So maybe I messed up the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me try again.\n\nLet me denote the current population as P. So, one year ago, the population was P_prev, and last year it increased by x percent to reach P. So P = P_prev * (1 + x/100). We need to find x, which is the percentage increase from one year ago to now.\n\nTwo years from now, the population will be P * (1.10)^2 = P * 1.21. According to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago. The population one year ago was P_prev, so double that is 2 * P_prev.\n\nSo, equation: 1.21 P = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut since P = P_prev * (1 + x/100), substitute P_prev = P / (1 + x/100).\n\nSo, substituting into the equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x/100)).\n\nDivide both sides by P: 1.21 = 2 / (1 + x/100).\n\nRearranging: 1 + x/100 = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCompute 2 / 1.21. Let's see, 1.21 is 121/100, so 2 / (121/100) = 200/121 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo, 1 + x/100 \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 x/100 \u2248 0.65289 \u2192 x \u2248 65.289%. \n\nSo the percentage increase over the last year is approximately 65.29%.

So, P(Year +2) = 2 * P(Year -1).\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The problem is asking for the percentage increase over the last year. The last year would be from Year -1 to Year 0. So, we need to find the growth rate from Year -1 to Year 0, given the conditions.\n\nLet me write the equations step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let P0 = current population (Year 0).\n- P_prev = population one year ago (Year -1).\n- P1 = population next year (Year +1).\n- P2 = population two years from now (Year +2).\n\nGiven that each year, the population increases by 10%, so:\n\nP1 = P0 * (1 + 10%) = P0 * 1.1\n\nP2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nNow, the problem says that P2 is exactly double P_prev. So,\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year ago, which is before the current year. So, if the current population is P0, then P_prev would be P0 divided by (1 + growth rate from last year). Wait, but we don't know the growth rate from last year. Oh, because the last year's growth is what we're trying to find.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the growth from Year -1 to Year 0. Let's say the growth rate during that year was 'r'. So,\n\nP0 = P_prev * (1 + r).\n\nOur goal is to find 'r', which is the growth rate from last year. Then, the percentage increase would be r * 100%.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P2 is P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nAnd P0 is P_prev * (1 + r).\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nP_prev * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can cancel out P_prev from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which makes sense for a city).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculating 2 divided by 1.21. Let's see, 1.21 * 1.6528 \u2248 2. Because 1.21 * 1.6528 is approximately 2 (since 1.21 * 1.6 is 1.936, and 1.21 * 1.65 is about 2.0015).

So, we need to find the growth rate from Year -1 to Year 0, given the conditions.\n\nLet me write the equations step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let P0 = current population (Year 0).\n- P_prev = population one year ago (Year -1).\n- P1 = population next year (Year +1).\n- P2 = population two years from now (Year +2).\n\nGiven that each year, the population increases by 10%, so:\n\nP1 = P0 * (1 + 10%) = P0 * 1.1\n\nP2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nNow, the problem says that P2 is exactly double P_prev. So,\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year ago, which is before the current year. So, if the current population is P0, then P_prev would be P0 divided by (1 + growth rate from last year). Wait, but we don't know the growth rate from last year. Oh, because the last year's growth is what we're trying to find.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the growth from Year -1 to Year 0. Let's say the growth rate during that year was 'r'. So,\n\nP0 = P_prev * (1 + r).\n\nOur goal is to find 'r', which is the growth rate from last year. Then, the percentage increase would be r * 100%.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nP2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nBut P2 is P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nAnd P0 is P_prev * (1 + r).\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nP_prev * (1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P_prev.\n\nWe can cancel out P_prev from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which makes sense for a city).\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.1)^2. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculating 2 divided by 1.21. Let's see, 1.21 * 1.6528 \u2248 2. Because 1.21 * 1.6528 is approximately 2 (since 1.21 * 1.6 is 1.936, and 1.21 * 1.65 is about 2.0015). So, 2/1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtract 1:\n\nr \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.289%.\n\nSo, the percentage increase is approximately 65.29%, which is closest to 65%. Looking at the options, D is 65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me compute 1.1 squared again. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21. Correct.\n\nThen, 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute that more accurately. 1.21 * 1.6528 is 2.0000 approximately. So, yes, 2/1.21 is approximately 1.65289.\n\nSo, (1 + r) = 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289 or 65.289%. So, the closest option is D)65%.\n\n\nLet \\( P_0 \\) be the current population, \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) be the population one year ago, and \\( P_2 \\) be the population two years from now. The problem states that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years, so:\n\n\\[\nP_1 = P_0 \\cdot 1.1\n\\]\n\\[\nP_2 = P_1 \\cdot 1.1 = P_0 \\cdot (1.1)^2\n\\]\n\nThe problem also states that \\( P_2 = 2 \\cdot P_{\\text{prev}} \\). Since \\( P_0 = P_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + r) \\), where \\( r \\) is the growth rate from one year ago to the current year, we can substitute \\( P_0 \\) into the equation for \\( P_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + r) \\cdot (1.1)^2 = 2 \\cdot P_{\\text{prev}}\n\\]\n\nCanceling \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\cdot (1.1)^2 = 2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (1.1)^2 = 1.21 \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\cdot 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nDividing through by 1.21:\n\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1:\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 0.65289\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage increase is approximately \\( 65.29\\% \\), which is closest to \\( 65\\% \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about population growth in a place called Boomtown. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The problem says that urban planners expect the city's population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that happens, then the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. I need to find the percent population increase over the last year, and the options are given as A to E.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down. So, the projection is for the next two years, each year a 10% increase. So if I call this year's population something, like P, then next year it'll be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1 * P. Then the year after that, it'll be 10% more than that, so 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, the population would be P * (1.1)^2.\n\nBut the problem says that this two-year population will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Oh wait, wait. One year ago from now would be the population before this year's increase. Let me think about that. If this year is the starting point, then one year ago, the population was P0. This year's population is P0 plus 10% of P0, so P = P0 * 1.1. \n\nWait, no, maybe I should assign variables more clearly. Let me define:\n\nLet P be the current population (this year). Then, next year, it'll be P * 1.1. The year after that, it'll be P * 1.1^2. According to the problem, this equals double the population of one year ago. One year ago, that would be the population before this year's 10% increase. So one year ago, the population was P / 1.1, because this year it's 1.1 times that. So P / 1.1 is the population one year ago.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is 1.1^2 * P, which equals 2 times the population one year ago. So:\n\n1.1^2 * P = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because two years from now is 1.1^2 * P. The population one year ago is the population before this year's growth. So, if this year's population is P, then last year's population was P / 1.1. Because this year's P is 1.1 times last year's. So, yes, last year's population is P / 1.1.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nPopulation after two years = 2 * (last year's population)\n=> 1.1^2 * P = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nLet me compute that. 1.1 squared is 1.21. So the left side is 1.21 * P. The right side is 2 * (P / 1.1) = (2/1.1) * P. Let me calculate 2 / 1.1. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.818... So the equation is:\n\n1.21 P = 1.818... P\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1.21 is less than 1.818. That would imply that 1.21 equals 1.818, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nLet me re-express this. Maybe I should define the population one year ago as P0. So current population P = P0 * 1.1. Next year's population is P * 1.1 = P0 * 1.1^2. The year after that is P0 * 1.1^3. Wait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago was P0. So two years from now would be P0 * 1.1^2 (wait, no, no. Let me clarify the timeline.\n\nWait, the current population is P. One year ago, it was P / 1.1, because this year it's up 10% from then. Next year, it'll be P * 1.1. Then the year after, that's two years from now, it'll be P * 1.1^2. \n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population is double that of one year ago. One year ago was P / 1.1, so double is 2*(P/1.1). So the equation is:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nLet me compute both sides. Left side: 1.1^2 is 1.21, so 1.21 * P.\n\nRight side: 2 * (P / 1.1) = (2/1.1) * P. Let's compute 2/1.1. 2 divided by 1.1 is approximately 1.81818... So right side is approximately 1.81818 * P.\n\nSo equation is 1.21 P = 1.81818 P. Hmm, that can't be possible because 1.21 isn't equal to 1.818. So I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I got the timeline wrong. Let me think in terms of specific years.\n\nLet me denote the population now as P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nIn the next two years, the population will grow by 10% each year. So after one year from now, it's P * 1.1. After two years, it's P * (1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem says that the population after two years (which is P * 1.21) is exactly double the population of one year ago (which is P_prev = P / 1.1). So:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier. So 1.21 = 2/(1.1) \u2192 2/(1.1) is approximately 1.818, which is higher than 1.21. So that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the variables.\n\nWait another approach: Maybe the \"one year ago\" refers to the current time minus one year, not relative to the current time. Let me think.\n\nLet me define the population one year ago as P0. Then, current population P = P0 * 1.1.\n\nNext year's population is P * 1.1 = 1.1^2 * P0.\n\nThe year after next (two years from now) is P * 1.1^2 = 1.1^3 * P0.\n\nWait, no, wait: Let me correct that. If current population is P, then next year is P * 1.1. The year after that is (P * 1.1) * 1.1 = P * 1.1^2.\n\nBut the problem states that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. One year ago is P0, the population before this year. So P0 is the population one year ago. So two years from now, the population is P * 1.1^2. This equals 2 * P0.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P0.\n\nBut P is P0 * 1.1. So substitute P = P0 * 1.1 into the equation:\n\n(P0 * 1.1) * (1.21) = 2 * P0.\n\nLet me compute the left side: 1.1 * 1.21 = 1.331. So 1.331 * P0 = 2 * P0.\n\nWait, that gives 1.331 P0 = 2 P0, which implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm setting up the equation wrong. Let me think again. The problem says the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is P * 1.1^2. One year ago is the population before the current year, which is P / 1.1.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.1^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nLet me compute that. P cancels out, so 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that can't be. Therefore, I must have the setup wrong. Maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is expected for the next two years, but the question is about the population increase over the last year, which is prior to this projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the population as P_prev (one year ago), then P_prev * 1.1 is current P. Then, in the next two years, it increases 10% each year. So after two years from now, it's P * 1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that this will be double the population of one year ago, which is P_prev. So:\n\nP * 1.1^2 = 2 * P_prev\n\nBut P = P_prev * 1.1. So substituting:\n\n(P_prev * 1.1) * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.1 * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so something's wrong here. Maybe I'm interpreting the timeline incorrectly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assume that the current population is P. Then, one year ago, it was P / 1.1. Two years from now, the population is P * 1.1^2. According to the problem, this equals 2 times the population one year ago.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nSimplify: 1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is 1.818... So 1.21 = 1.818? That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the population is increasing by 10% each year for the next two years, but perhaps the current population is not the base for both years. Let me think. No, the way it's written, the increase is 10% per year for the next two years. So current P, next year 1.1 P, year after that 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that 1.21 P equals 2 times the population one year ago. One year ago was P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1) \u2192 1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is 1.818..., which is larger than 1.21. So that's impossible. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait a minute. Perhaps the question is not about the next two years but the last two years? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the time frames.\n\nWait, the question says the planners expect a 10% increase each year over the next two years. So that's for the coming two years, not the past. So the projection is for the future, not the past. So the current population is P. Next year, 1.1 P. Two years from now, 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that if this projection holds, then two years from now the population will be double the population of one year ago. So one year ago, that was P_prev = P / 1.1. So two years from now, population is 1.21 P, which equals 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.21 P = 2*(P / 1.1). So the same equation as before, which leads to 1.21 = 2/(1.1) \u2192 1.21 = 1.818, which is impossible. So this suggests that maybe the initial assumption about the growth rate is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% per year is for the next two years, but the question is about the growth over the last year, which is prior to these two years. So perhaps the current population is P, and the last year's population was P_prev. Then, this year's population is P_prev * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate we're trying to find. Then, next year's population is P * 1.1, and the year after that is P * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is 1.21 P, and one year ago is P_prev. So 1.21 P = 2 P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year before now, which is P / (1 + x). Because this year's population is P = P_prev * (1 + x).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x))\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 is approximately 1.65289256.\n\nSo 1 + x \u2248 1.65289256 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289256, which is about 65.29%. So the population increased by approximately 65.29% last year. Looking at the options, D is 65%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D) 65%.\n",

The year after that is (P * 1.1) * 1.1 = P * 1.1^2.\n\nBut the problem states that the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. One year ago is P0, the population before this year. So P0 is the population one year ago. So two years from now, the population is P * 1.1^2. This equals 2 * P0.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P0.\n\nBut P is P0 * 1.1. So substitute P = P0 * 1.1 into the equation:\n\n(P0 * 1.1) * (1.21) = 2 * P0.\n\nLet me compute the left side: 1.1 * 1.21 = 1.331. So 1.331 * P0 = 2 * P0.\n\nWait, that gives 1.331 P0 = 2 P0, which implies 1.331 = 2, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm setting up the equation wrong. Let me think again. The problem says the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is P * 1.1^2. One year ago is the population before the current year, which is P / 1.1.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.1^2 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nLet me compute that. P cancels out, so 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nBut 1.21 is not equal to 1.818. So that can't be. Therefore, I must have the setup wrong. Maybe the problem is that the 10% increase is expected for the next two years, but the question is about the population increase over the last year, which is prior to this projection.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the population as P_prev (one year ago), then P_prev * 1.1 is current P. Then, in the next two years, it increases 10% each year. So after two years from now, it's P * 1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that this will be double the population of one year ago, which is P_prev. So:\n\nP * 1.1^2 = 2 * P_prev\n\nBut P = P_prev * 1.1. So substituting:\n\n(P_prev * 1.1) * 1.21 = 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.1 * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1.331 = 2 \u2192 that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so something's wrong here. Maybe I'm interpreting the timeline incorrectly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me assume that the current population is P. Then, one year ago, it was P / 1.1. Two years from now, the population is P * 1.1^2. According to the problem, this equals 2 times the population one year ago.\n\nSo:\n\nP * 1.21 = 2 * (P / 1.1)\n\nSimplify: 1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is 1.818... So 1.21 = 1.818? That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the population is increasing by 10% each year for the next two years, but perhaps the current population is not the base for both years. Let me think. No, the way it's written, the increase is 10% per year for the next two years. So current P, next year 1.1 P, year after that 1.21 P.\n\nBut the problem says that 1.21 P equals 2 times the population one year ago. One year ago was P_prev = P / 1.1.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.1) \u2192 1.21 P = (2 / 1.1) P \u2192 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is 1.818..., which is larger than 1.21. So that's impossible. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong.\n\nWait a minute. Perhaps the question is not about the next two years but the last two years? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the time frames.\n\nWait, the question says the planners expect a 10% increase each year over the next two years. So that's for the coming two years, not the past. So the projection is for the future, not the past. So the current population is P. Next year, 1.1 P. Two years from now, 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that if this projection holds, then two years from now the population will be double the population of one year ago. So one year ago, that was P_prev = P / 1.1. So two years from now, population is 1.21 P, which equals 2 * P_prev \u2192 1.21 P = 2*(P / 1.1). So the same equation as before, which leads to 1.21 = 2/(1.1) \u2192 1.21 = 1.818, which is impossible. So this suggests that maybe the initial assumption about the growth rate is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the 10% per year is for the next two years, but the question is about the growth over the last year, which is prior to these two years. So perhaps the current population is P, and the last year's population was P_prev. Then, this year's population is P_prev * (1 + x), where x is the growth rate we're trying to find. Then, next year's population is P * 1.1, and the year after that is P * 1.21.\n\nBut the problem says that two years from now, the population is double the population of one year ago. So two years from now is 1.21 P, and one year ago is P_prev. So 1.21 P = 2 P_prev.\n\nBut P_prev is the population one year before now, which is P / (1 + x). Because this year's population is P = P_prev * (1 + x).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n1.21 P = 2 * (P / (1 + x))\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n1.21 = 2 / (1 + x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n1.21 (1 + x) = 2\n\nDivide both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + x = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 is approximately 1.65289256.\n\nSo 1 + x \u2248 1.65289256 \u2192 x \u2248 0.65289256, which is about 65.29%. So the population increased by approximately 65.29% last year. Looking at the options, D is 65%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D) 65%.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given that the population is projected to grow by 10% per year for the next two years, and that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.\n\nLet the current population be denoted as \\( P \\). One year ago, the population was \\( P_{\\text{prev}} = \\frac{P}{1.1} \\), since this year's population is 10% higher than last year's. Over the next two years, the population is projected to grow by 10% each year, so the population two years from now will be \\( P \\cdot (1.1)^2 = 1.21P \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n1.21P = 2 \\cdot \\frac{P}{1.1}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n1.21P = \\frac{2}{1.1}P\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( P \\) (assuming \\( P \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1.21 = \\frac{2}{1.1}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\frac{2}{1.1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1.1} \\approx 1.818\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n1.21 = 1.818\n\\]\n\nThis is not possible, so the setup must be adjusted. Let \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) be the population one year ago. Then, the current population is \\( P = P_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + x) \\), where \\( x \\) is the percent increase over the last year. Two years from now, the population will be \\( P \\cdot (1.1)^2 = P_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + x) \\cdot 1.21 \\). According to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{prev}} \\cdot (1 + x) \\cdot 1.21 = 2 \\cdot P_{\\text{prev}}\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\) (assuming \\( P_{\\text{prev}} \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n(1 + x) \\cdot 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( 1 + x \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + x = \\frac{2}{1.21}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\frac{2}{1.21} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.6529\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 1.6529 - 1 = 0.6529\n\\]\n\nConvert to percentage:\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 65.29\\%\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is **65%**, which corresponds to option D.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, the question says that the planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, right now, their projection is that next year the population will go up by 10%, and the year after that another 10% increase. \n\nWait, but the problem also states that after these two years, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, two years from now, it's double the population of one year ago. So if I think about it, let me denote the current population as P. \n\nWait, but when exactly are we starting from? Let me clarify the timeline. Let's assume that the current time is time zero. The planners are looking into the next two years. So, in one year, the population will be P * 1.10 (since it's a 10% increase). In two years, it'll be P * 1.10^2, which is 1.21 P. \n\nBut the problem says that after two years, the population is double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago would be the population at time zero minus one year. Oh wait, no. Because if the current time is time zero, then one year ago would be negative one year, which doesn't make sense because time is moving forward. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the timeline wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population was P_prev. The projection is that the population will increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So, in the first year, it becomes P * 1.10. In the second year, that becomes P * 1.10^2. \n\nThe problem states that two years from now, the population is double what it was one year ago. Oh, wait, one year ago from two years from now. Let me think about the time points. Let me represent the time as follows:\n\n- Current time: t=0, population P.\n\n- Next year: t=1, population P1 = P * 1.10.\n\n- Two years from now: t=2, population P2 = P1 * 1.10 = P * 1.10^2.\n\nThe problem says that P2 = 2 * P_one_year_ago. Wait, P_one_year_ago would be the population at t=-1. But that's not possible because the current time is t=0. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" Oh! So two years from now is t=2, and one year ago from t=2 would be t=1. So, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=1. \n\nWait, that can't be right because if that's the case, P2 = 2 * P1. But P2 is P * 1.1^2, and P1 is P * 1.1. So, according to the problem, P*1.1^2 = 2*(P*1.1). Let me write that equation.\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P * 1.1)\n\nSimplify both sides. Divide both sides by P (assuming P isn't zero). So, 1.21 = 2 * 1.1.\n\nWait, 2 * 1.1 is 2.2. But 1.21 is not equal to 2.2. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the wording again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So, perhaps two years from now is t=2, and one year ago from the current time is t=-1. But that would mean the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1. But we don't have data about t=-1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year prior to the current projection. Wait, maybe the projection is looking at the next two years, so the current time is t=0, and one year ago would be t=-1. But if the population at t=2 is double that at t=-1, then:\n\nP(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1)\n\nBut we don't know P(t=-1). Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the population one year before the two-year projection. Maybe I should model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for two years, and at the end of two years, it's double the population one year ago, which would be the previous year. So, let me set up variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say the population one year ago (t=-1) is Q.\n\nThen, the current population (t=0) is Q * 1.10 (because it increased by 10% in the last year). \n\nNow, the next two years (t=1 and t=2) will have 10% increases each year. So:\n\nt=1: population = (current) * 1.10 = Q * 1.10 * 1.10 = Q * 1.21\n\nt=2: population = t=1 * 1.10 = Q * 1.21 * 1.10 = Q * 1.331\n\nBut the problem states that the population at t=2 is exactly double the population one year ago, which is Q. So,\n\nQ * 1.331 = 2 * Q\n\nDivide both sides by Q (assuming Q isn't zero), we get 1.331 = 2. That's not correct. Hmm, this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the timeline. Let me try a different approach. Let's let the current population be P. Then, next year (t=1) it will be P * 1.10. The year after that (t=2) it will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now (t=2) is double the population one year ago. One year ago from when? If the current time is t=0, then one year ago is t=-1, which we don't have data on. Alternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the time before the two-year projection started.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured as: the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. After that, the population will be double what it was one year prior to the start of the projection. So, the projection starts at t=0. So, the next two years are t=1 and t=2. \n\nThe population at t=2 is supposed to be double the population at t=-1 (one year before the projection started). So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut I don't know P(t=-1). Alternatively, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the year before t=2. That would be t=1. So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1). Let's see.\n\nP(t=2) = P(t=1) * 1.10 = P(t=0) * (1.10)^2.\n\nIf P(t=2) is double P(t=1), then:\n\nP(t=0) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P(t=0) * 1.10)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P(t=0) = 2.2 P(t=0)\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0): 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is false. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle. Let me denote the current population as P. The population two years from now will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says this is double the population one year ago. So, 1.21 P = 2 * (population one year ago). \n\nWhat is the population one year ago? If current population is P, then one year ago it was P / 1.10 (assuming a 10% increase from the previous year to now). Because if last year's population was Q, then this year it's Q * 1.10 = P \u2192 Q = P / 1.10.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10 )\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side: 2*(P/1.10) = (2/1.10) P = approximately 1.818 P.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not correct. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that the assumption that last year's population was P/1.10 is incorrect. Perhaps the growth rate for the last year is unknown, and we need to find it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the increase for the last year is different. Let me think.\n\nLet me restate the problem.\n\nWe don't know the growth rate for the last year, but we know the growth rate for the next two years is 10% each year. The population two years from now is double the population one year ago.\n\nLet me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say that the population one year ago (before the current time) was Q. \n\n- Then, the current population (now) is Q * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from last year to now.\n\n- In the next year (one year from now), the population becomes (Q*(1+r)) * 1.10.\n\n- In the second year (two years from now), it becomes (Q*(1+r)*1.10) * 1.10 = Q*(1+r)*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So,\n\nQ*(1+r)*(1.10)^2 = 2 * Q\n\nDivide both sides by Q:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So that's exactly what r is. So the last year's growth rate is about 65.29%, so the closest option is D)65%.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n",

So:\n\nt=1: population = (current) * 1.10 = Q * 1.10 * 1.10 = Q * 1.21\n\nt=2: population = t=1 * 1.10 = Q * 1.21 * 1.10 = Q * 1.331\n\nBut the problem states that the population at t=2 is exactly double the population one year ago, which is Q. So,\n\nQ * 1.331 = 2 * Q\n\nDivide both sides by Q (assuming Q isn't zero), we get 1.331 = 2. That's not correct. Hmm, this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the timeline. Let me try a different approach. Let's let the current population be P. Then, next year (t=1) it will be P * 1.10. The year after that (t=2) it will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now (t=2) is double the population one year ago. One year ago from when? If the current time is t=0, then one year ago is t=-1, which we don't have data on. Alternatively, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the time before the two-year projection started.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured as: the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. After that, the population will be double what it was one year prior to the start of the projection. So, the projection starts at t=0. So, the next two years are t=1 and t=2. \n\nThe population at t=2 is supposed to be double the population at t=-1 (one year before the projection started). So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=-1).\n\nBut I don't know P(t=-1). Alternatively, maybe the 'one year ago' refers to the year before t=2. That would be t=1. So, P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1). Let's see.\n\nP(t=2) = P(t=1) * 1.10 = P(t=0) * (1.10)^2.\n\nIf P(t=2) is double P(t=1), then:\n\nP(t=0) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (P(t=0) * 1.10)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1.21 P(t=0) = 2.2 P(t=0)\n\nDivide both sides by P(t=0): 1.21 = 2.2 \u2192 which is false. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try another angle. Let me denote the current population as P. The population two years from now will be P * (1.10)^2 = 1.21 P.\n\nThe problem says this is double the population one year ago. So, 1.21 P = 2 * (population one year ago). \n\nWhat is the population one year ago? If current population is P, then one year ago it was P / 1.10 (assuming a 10% increase from the previous year to now). Because if last year's population was Q, then this year it's Q * 1.10 = P \u2192 Q = P / 1.10.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation: 1.21 P = 2 * (P / 1.10 )\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side: 2*(P/1.10) = (2/1.10) P = approximately 1.818 P.\n\nSo 1.21 P = 1.818 P \u2192 1.21 = 1.818 \u2192 which is not correct. So this can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that the assumption that last year's population was P/1.10 is incorrect. Perhaps the growth rate for the last year is unknown, and we need to find it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the increase for the last year is different. Let me think.\n\nLet me restate the problem.\n\nWe don't know the growth rate for the last year, but we know the growth rate for the next two years is 10% each year. The population two years from now is double the population one year ago.\n\nLet me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let\u2019s say that the population one year ago (before the current time) was Q. \n\n- Then, the current population (now) is Q * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from last year to now.\n\n- In the next year (one year from now), the population becomes (Q*(1+r)) * 1.10.\n\n- In the second year (two years from now), it becomes (Q*(1+r)*1.10) * 1.10 = Q*(1+r)*(1.10)^2.\n\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. So,\n\nQ*(1+r)*(1.10)^2 = 2 * Q\n\nDivide both sides by Q:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2\n\nCompute (1.10)^2 = 1.21.\n\nSo,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2192 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\nr = 1.65289 - 1 = 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 65%, which is the closest. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percent increase in the last year. So that's exactly what r is. So the last year's growth rate is about 65.29%, so the closest option is D)65%.\n\nSo the answer should be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given the following conditions:\n\n1. The population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.\n2. The population two years from now will be exactly double the population one year ago.\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\n- Let the population one year ago be \\( Q \\).\n- Let the current population (at time \\( t = 0 \\)) be \\( P \\).\n- The population one year from now (at \\( t = 1 \\)) will be \\( P \\times 1.10 \\).\n- The population two years from now (at \\( t = 2 \\)) will be \\( P \\times (1.10)^2 = 1.21P \\).\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Population Two Years from Now to One Year Ago\nThe problem states that the population two years from now is double the population one year ago. Thus:\n\\[\n1.21P = 2 \\times Q\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express \\( P \\) in Terms of \\( Q \\)\nSince the population increases by 10% from one year ago to the current time:\n\\[\nP = Q \\times 1.10\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute \\( P \\) into the Equation\nSubstitute \\( P = Q \\times 1.10 \\) into \\( 1.21P = 2 \\times Q \\):\n\\[\n1.21 \\times (Q \\times 1.10) = 2 \\times Q\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n1.21 \\times 1.10 \\times Q = 2 \\times Q\n\\]\n\nDivide through by \\( Q \\) (assuming \\( Q \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\[\n1.21 \\times 1.10 = 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( r \\)\nLet \\( r \\) be the growth rate from one year ago to the current time. Then:\n\\[\nP = Q \\times (1 + r)\n\\]\n\nFrom the previous step:\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + r \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr \\approx 0.65289\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Interpret the Result\nThe growth rate \\( r \\) is approximately \\( 65.29\\% \\). Among the given options, the closest value is \\( 65\\% \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is closest to **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, the problem says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. I need to find the percentage increase in the population over the last year, and choose the closest option from the given choices.\n\nWait, let me break this down. Let's denote the current population as P. But wait, the problem mentions the population two years from now being double the population of one year ago. Oh, so the time frames are a bit confusing. Let me think about the timeline.\n\nSo, currently, we're at time zero. One year ago was time -1, two years from now is time +2. The population at time +2 is double the population at time -1. \n\nLet me try to model this. Let's say the current population is P. Then, one year ago, the population would have been P divided by (1 + last year's growth rate). Wait, but the problem is asking about the growth over the last year, so maybe I should model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should let the population one year ago be X. Then, the current population is X multiplied by (1 + growth rate from last year). Let's call the growth rate 'r' for the last year. So current population P = X*(1 + r). \n\nNow, the projection is that the population increases by 10% each year for the next two years. So, next year's population will be P * 1.10. The year after that, it will be P * 1.10^2.\n\nBut according to the problem, the population two years from now (which is P * 1.10^2) is exactly double the population one year ago (which is X). So, P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * X.\n\nBut since P is X*(1 + r), substituting that in, we get:\n\nX*(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * X.\n\nHmm, X is not zero, so we can divide both sides by X:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2.\n\nLet me compute (1.10)^2. 1.1 squared is 1.21. So,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nDividing both sides by 1.21:\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nWhat's 2 divided by 1.21? Let me calculate that. 1.21 * 1.65 is around 2, because 1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936, and 1.21 * 1.65 is 1.9845, which is just under 2. So 2 / 1.21 is approximately 1.65289.\n\nSo,\n\n1 + r \u2248 1.65289.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides:\n\nr \u2248 0.65289, or about 65.289%.\n\nWait, that's over 65% growth. But looking at the options, D is 65%, which is close. But wait, the question is about the percent increase over the last year. So that's the r we just calculated, which is approximately 65.29%. So the closest option is D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I model the timeline correctly?\n\nThe population two years from now is double that of one year ago. So two years from now is time +2, and one year ago is time -1. So the population at time +2 is double the population at time -1.\n\nSo, population at time +2: P * (1.10)^2 = 2 * (population at time -1).\n\nPopulation at time -1 is P_prev, which is the population one year before now. So P_prev = P_current / (1 + r_last_year). Because if you have a growth rate 'r_last_year' from time -1 to now, then P_current = P_prev * (1 + r_last_year).\n\nWait, perhaps I should denote the variables more clearly. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- P0: population one year ago (time -1)\n- P1: current population (time 0)\n- P2: population after one year (time +1)\n- P3: population after two years (time +2)\n\nAccording to the problem, P3 = 2 * P0.\n\nThe growth rate for the next two years is 10% per year. So,\n\nP2 = P1 * 1.10\n\nP3 = P2 * 1.10 = P1 * (1.10)^2\n\nAlso, the current population P1 is the result of a growth from P0. Let\u2019s say the growth rate last year was 'r', so:\n\nP1 = P0 * (1 + r)\n\nSo substituting into P3:\n\nP3 = P1 * (1.10)^2 = P0 * (1 + r) * (1.10)^2\n\nBut we know P3 = 2 * P0. So,\n\nP0 * (1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2 * P0\n\nDivide both sides by P0:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.10)^2 = 2\n\nAs before, (1.10)^2 is 1.21. So,\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo, r \u2248 0.65289, which is about 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest.

I'm a bit nervous about these exponential growth problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says that the city's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nSo, the planners predict a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, that's two consecutive 10% increases. Let me think about how that works. If the current population is P, then after the first year it would be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. Then, in the second year, another 10% increase, so that's 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, it would be 1.1 * 1.1 * P, which is 1.21P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after these two years, the population will be double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the timeline. Let me think again.\n\nThe way the problem is worded: the projection is for the next two years, so that's from now. So, the population two years from now will be double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the projection is about two years into the future, then one year ago from that point would be one year before the two years have passed. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to sketch a timeline.\n\nLet me denote the current time as time zero. The population is P0 at time zero. The next two years are from time zero to time two (two years from now). So, the population two years from now (time two) is expected to be 1.1 * 1.1 * P0 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that this population (at time two) is exactly double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the statement is made at time two, then one year ago would be time one. Or is the statement made at the current time, time zero? Hmm, the wording says \"two years from now\" and \"one year ago.\" So, maybe the one year ago refers to time zero minus one year. That would be time -1. So, the population at time two is double the population at time -1.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Let me make a table:\n\nTime: -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nPopulation at time -1: let's say that's P_{-1}.\n\nPopulation at time 0: P0.\n\nPopulation at time 1: P0 * 1.1 (after first year's 10% increase).\n\nPopulation at time 2: P0 * 1.1^2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that the population at time 2 is exactly double the population at time -1. So,\n\nP2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut I'm trying to find the percent increase over the last year. Wait, the last year from when? If the question is asking about the population increase over the last year before the current projections, which would be from time -1 to time 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote P0 as the current population, at time 0.\n\nAfter two years (time 2), the population will be 1.21 P0.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago. If the statement is made at time 0, then one year ago would be time -1. So, P_{-1} is the population one year before the current time.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n1.21 P0 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut wait, I'm trying to find the population increase over the last year. The last year would be from time -1 to time 0. So, the population increased from P_{-1} to P0. The percentage increase is ((P0 - P_{-1}) / P_{-1}) * 100%.\n\nBut how do I relate P0 and P_{-1}? From the equation above, I can express P_{-1} in terms of P0.\n\nFrom 1.21 P0 = 2 P_{-1}, solving for P_{-1} gives:\n\nP_{-1} = (1.21 P0) / 2 = 0.605 P0.\n\nSo, P_{-1} is 60.5% of P0.\n\nThe population went from P_{-1} to P0. So, the increase is P0 - P_{-1} = P0 - 0.605 P0 = 0.395 P0.\n\nThe percentage increase is (0.395 P0) / (P_{-1}) ) * 100% = (0.395 P0) / (0.605 P0) ) * 100%.\n\nThe P0 cancels out, so it's (0.395 / 0.605) * 100%.\n\nCalculating that: 0.395 / 0.605 \u2248 0.652, so 65.2%.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. The options are 20,40,50,65,75. So, 65% is option D. But wait, let me double-check my reasoning because 65% seems high, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's say the population one year ago (time -1) was X. So, P_{-1} = X.\n\nAfter two years (time 2), the population is 1.21 * P0. The problem states that this equals 2X.\n\nSo, 1.21 P0 = 2 X.\n\nBut P0 is the current population. How is P0 related to X? Well, from time -1 to time 0, that's one year. So, the growth from time -1 to time 0 is (P0 - X)/X *100%.\n\nWe have X = 0.605 P0, from 1.21 P0 = 2 X \u2192 X = (1.21 P0)/2 = 0.605 P0.\n\nSo, the increase from X to P0 is (P0 - X)/X = (P0 -0.605 P0)/0.605 P0 = (0.395 P0)/(0.605 P0) )= 0.395 / 0.605 \u2248 0.652, which is 65.2%.\n\nSo, the population increased by approximately 65% over the last year.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 65%, which matches this calculation. So the answer should be D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? The problem says that the population two years from now would be double the population of one year ago. So, two years from now is time +2, and one year ago would be time -1 if the statement is made at time 0. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me rephrase: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to one year before the two years in projection. Wait, that would be time 0 -1 year = time -1. So, yes, the same conclusion holds.\n\nSo, yeah, the percentage increase over the last year is approximately 65%, so the correct option is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous about these exponential growth problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nThe question says that the city's population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. And if that happens, the population two years from now will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nSo, the planners predict a 10% increase each year for the next two years. So, that's two consecutive 10% increases. Let me think about how that works. If the current population is P, then after the first year it would be P plus 10% of P, which is 1.1P. Then, in the second year, another 10% increase, so that's 1.1 times the previous year's population. So after two years, it would be 1.1 * 1.1 * P, which is 1.21P.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after these two years, the population will be double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Oh, wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the timeline. Let me think again.\n\nThe way the problem is worded: the projection is for the next two years, so that's from now. So, the population two years from now will be double the population of one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the projection is about two years into the future, then one year ago from that point would be one year before the two years have passed. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to sketch a timeline.\n\nLet me denote the current time as time zero. The population is P0 at time zero. The next two years are from time zero to time two (two years from now). So, the population two years from now (time two) is expected to be 1.1 * 1.1 * P0 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that this population (at time two) is exactly double the population one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? If the statement is made at time two, then one year ago would be time one. Or is the statement made at the current time, time zero? Hmm, the wording says \"two years from now\" and \"one year ago.\" So, maybe the one year ago refers to time zero minus one year. That would be time -1. So, the population at time two is double the population at time -1.\n\nWait, that's a bit tricky. Let me make a table:\n\nTime: -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nPopulation at time -1: let's say that's P_{-1}.\n\nPopulation at time 0: P0.\n\nPopulation at time 1: P0 * 1.1 (after first year's 10% increase).\n\nPopulation at time 2: P0 * 1.1^2 = 1.21 P0.\n\nThe problem states that the population at time 2 is exactly double the population at time -1. So,\n\nP2 = 2 * P_{-1}.\n\nBut I'm trying to find the percent increase over the last year. Wait, the last year from when? If the question is asking about the population increase over the last year before the current projections, which would be from time -1 to time 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote P0 as the current population, at time 0.\n\nAfter two years (time 2), the population will be 1.21 P0.\n\nAccording to the problem, this equals double the population one year ago. If the statement is made at time 0, then one year ago would be time -1.

The last year would be from time -1 to time 0. So, the population increased from P_{-1} to P0. The percentage increase is ((P0 - P_{-1}) / P_{-1}) * 100%.\n\nBut how do I relate P0 and P_{-1}?

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponential growth, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So that's a growth rate of 10% per annum, compounding I think. And according to the projection, two years from now the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, let me make sure I get that right. So the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet's assign some variables to make it clearer. Let me call the current population P. But wait, the problem is asking about the population increase over the last year, so maybe I should consider the population before that. Hmm, perhaps I should define variables for the past and future populations.\n\nWait, the projection is for the next two years, so the current population is P, right? So next year, it'll be P plus 10%, which is P * 1.1. Then the year after that, it'll be (P * 1.1) * 1.1 = P * (1.1)^2.\n\nBut the problem states that two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Let me think. If I'm considering the current time as time zero, then one year ago would be P_prev = P_current / 1.1, assuming a 10% increase each year. Or wait, maybe I should model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the population at different times. Let's say:\n\n- Let P0 be the population one year ago.\n- Then, the current population (now) is P1 = P0 * 1.1 (because it increased by 10% over the last year).\n- Next year, P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n- The year after that, P3 = P2 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^3.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago. So two years from now is P3, and one year ago from when? Oh wait, no. Let me clarify the time frames. \n\nThe problem states that \"two years from now\" would be exactly double the population \"one year ago.\" So, two years from now is P3, and one year ago from when? Hmm, I think I need to get the time points right.\n\nWait, perhaps the statement is that two years from the current time, the population is double the population one year before the current time. So, if now is time zero, then two years from now is time +2, and one year ago is time -1.\n\nSo, the population at time +2 is double the population at time -1.\n\nSo:\n\nP(+2) = 2 * P(-1)\n\nBut I can express P(+2) in terms of P(-1). Let's model the growth:\n\nEach year, the population increases by 10%, so the growth factor is 1.1 per year.\n\nFrom time -1 to time 0: P0 = P(-1) * 1.1 \u2192 P(-1) = P0 / 1.1.\n\nFrom time 0 to time +1: P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\nFrom time +1 to time +2: P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says P(+2) = 2 * P(-1). So:\n\nP(+2) = 2 * P(-1)\n\nBut P(+2) is P0 * (1.1)^2, and P(-1) is P0 / 1.1.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1 )\n\nHmm, let me write that equation:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1 )\n\nI can cancel out P0 from both sides since it's non-zero.\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / (1.1 )\n\nCalculate (1.1)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818...\n\nWait, that's not possible because 1.21 is less than 1.818. Hmm, that suggests maybe I got the time points wrong. Or perhaps I misapplied the growth factors.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If P(+2) is two years from now, and P(-1) is one year ago, then:\n\nFrom P(-1) to P0: that's one year, so P0 = P(-1) * 1.1.\n\nFrom P0 to P1: another year, P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\nFrom P1 to P2: another year, P2 = P1 * 1.1.\n\nSo P2 = P(-1) * (1.1)^3.\n\nBecause P0 is P(-1)*1.1, P1 is P0 *1.1 = P(-1)*(1.1)^2, and P2 is P1 *1.1 = P(-1)*(1.1)^3.\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong earlier. So P2 is P(-1) * (1.1)^3.\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n\nP2 = 2 * P(-1)\n\nWhich is:\n\nP(-1) * (1.1)^3 = 2 * P(-1)\n\nDivide both sides by P(-1) (assuming it's not zero):\n\n(1.1)^3 = 2\n\nWait, let's compute 1.1^3. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, multiplied by 1.1 again: 1.21 * 1.1 = 1.331.\n\nSo 1.331 = 2? That can't be right. So this suggests that my initial setup is wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So two years from now, the population is double the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is from two years from now. No, that doesn't make much sense. Let's think in terms of time steps.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t=0.\n\nPopulation at t=0: P0.\n\nPopulation at t=1 (one year from now): P0 *1.1.\n\nPopulation at t=2 (two years from now): P0*(1.1)^2.\n\nPopulation at t=-1 (one year ago): P0 /1.1.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nSo:\n\nP0*(1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 /1.1 )\n\nAgain, divide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 2 /1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 = 1.818? That's not true. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is not about the population one year ago relative to the current time, but relative to the time when the projection starts. Maybe I'm mixing up the time frames.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the starting point of the projection. Let's try another approach. Let's say that the projection is made from t=0, and the two years are t=1 and t=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is stating that after two years (t=2), the population will be double the population at t=1. No, the problem says \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, maybe 'one year ago' is relative to t=2. So t=2 minus one year is t=1. So P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the 10% increase each year, P(t=2) = P(t=1) *1.1. So substituting, P(t=2) = 1.1 * P(t=1) = 2 * P(t=1). That would imply 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the start of the projection period. So the projection is for the next two years, starting from t=0 to t=2. So one year ago from t=2 would be t=1.\n\nSo P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the growth rate, P(t=2) = P(t=1) *1.1. So 1.1 * P(t=1) = 2 * P(t=1) \u2192 1.1 = 2 \u2192 No, that's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the way I'm interpreting the time points is incorrect. Maybe I should model the population before and after the projection.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume that the current population is P. The planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years, so:\n\nAfter first year: P *1.1.\n\nAfter second year: P *1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population one year ago. So, the population two years from now is double the population one year before the current time (i.e., P /1.1).\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P /1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818.\n\nWhich is not correct. So this suggests that the growth rate can't be 10% if the condition is met, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the problem is not about the future projection but about the past. The question is asking about the percent increase in the last year, so perhaps the population increased by x% last year, and now with the projection of 10% for the next two years, the population in two years would be double the population from one year ago.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nThen, the current population (now) is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from last year to now. We're to find r, which is the percent increase over the last year.\n\nIn the next two years, the population is expected to grow by 10% each year. So:\n\nAfter first year (next year): current pop * 1.1 = P*(1 + r) *1.1.\n\nAfter second year (two years from now): [P*(1 + r) *1.1] *1.1 = P*(1 + r) * (1.1)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this two-year future population is exactly double the population one year ago (which was P). So:\n\nP*(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.21) = 2.\n\nSo (1 + r) = 2 /1.21.\n\nCompute 2 /1.21: 2 \u00f7 1.21 \u2248 1.65289256.\n\nSo 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about population growth in Boomtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponential growth, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem says the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. So that's a growth rate of 10% per annum, compounding I think. And according to the projection, two years from now the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, let me make sure I get that right. So the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet's assign some variables to make it clearer. Let me call the current population P. But wait, the problem is asking about the population increase over the last year, so maybe I should consider the population before that. Hmm, perhaps I should define variables for the past and future populations.\n\nWait, the projection is for the next two years, so the current population is P, right? So next year, it'll be P plus 10%, which is P * 1.1. Then the year after that, it'll be (P * 1.1) * 1.1 = P * (1.1)^2.\n\nBut the problem states that two years from now, the population will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Wait, one year ago from when? Let me think. If I'm considering the current time as time zero, then one year ago would be P_prev = P_current / 1.1, assuming a 10% increase each year. Or wait, maybe I should model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define the population at different times. Let's say:\n\n- Let P0 be the population one year ago.\n- Then, the current population (now) is P1 = P0 * 1.1 (because it increased by 10% over the last year).\n- Next year, P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n- The year after that, P3 = P2 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^3.\n\nWait, but the problem says that two years from now, the population will be double what it was one year ago. So two years from now is P3, and one year ago from when? Oh wait, no. Let me clarify the time frames. \n\nThe problem states that \"two years from now\" would be exactly double the population \"one year ago.\" So, two years from now is P3, and one year ago from when? Hmm, I think I need to get the time points right.\n\nWait, perhaps the statement is that two years from the current time, the population is double the population one year before the current time. So, if now is time zero, then two years from now is time +2, and one year ago is time -1.\n\nSo, the population at time +2 is double the population at time -1.\n\nSo:\n\nP(+2) = 2 * P(-1)\n\nBut I can express P(+2) in terms of P(-1). Let's model the growth:\n\nEach year, the population increases by 10%, so the growth factor is 1.1 per year.\n\nFrom time -1 to time 0: P0 = P(-1) * 1.1 \u2192 P(-1) = P0 / 1.1.\n\nFrom time 0 to time +1: P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\nFrom time +1 to time +2: P2 = P1 * 1.1 = P0 * (1.1)^2.\n\nWait, but the problem says P(+2) = 2 * P(-1). So:\n\nP(+2) = 2 * P(-1)\n\nBut P(+2) is P0 * (1.1)^2, and P(-1) is P0 / 1.1.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1 )\n\nHmm, let me write that equation:\n\nP0 * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 / 1.1 )\n\nI can cancel out P0 from both sides since it's non-zero.\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 / (1.1 )\n\nCalculate (1.1)^2: 1.21.\n\nSo 1.21 = 2 / 1.1 \u2192 2 / 1.1 is approximately 1.818...\n\nWait, that's not possible because 1.21 is less than 1.818. Hmm, that suggests maybe I got the time points wrong. Or perhaps I misapplied the growth factors.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If P(+2) is two years from now, and P(-1) is one year ago, then:\n\nFrom P(-1) to P0: that's one year, so P0 = P(-1) * 1.1.\n\nFrom P0 to P1: another year, P1 = P0 * 1.1.\n\nFrom P1 to P2: another year, P2 = P1 * 1.1.\n\nSo P2 = P(-1) * (1.1)^3.\n\nBecause P0 is P(-1)*1.1, P1 is P0 *1.1 = P(-1)*(1.1)^2, and P2 is P1 *1.1 = P(-1)*(1.1)^3.\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong earlier. So P2 is P(-1) * (1.1)^3.\n\nSo the correct equation is:\n\nP2 = 2 * P(-1)\n\nWhich is:\n\nP(-1) * (1.1)^3 = 2 * P(-1)\n\nDivide both sides by P(-1) (assuming it's not zero):\n\n(1.1)^3 = 2\n\nWait, let's compute 1.1^3. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21, multiplied by 1.1 again: 1.21 * 1.1 = 1.331.\n\nSo 1.331 = 2? That can't be right. So this suggests that my initial setup is wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So two years from now, the population is double the population one year ago.\n\nWait, maybe the 'one year ago' is from two years from now. No, that doesn't make much sense. Let's think in terms of time steps.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t=0.\n\nPopulation at t=0: P0.\n\nPopulation at t=1 (one year from now): P0 *1.1.\n\nPopulation at t=2 (two years from now): P0*(1.1)^2.\n\nPopulation at t=-1 (one year ago): P0 /1.1.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, the population at t=2 is double the population at t=-1.\n\nSo:\n\nP0*(1.1)^2 = 2 * (P0 /1.1 )\n\nAgain, divide both sides by P0:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 2 /1.1 is approximately 1.818.\n\nSo 1.21 = 1.818? That's not true. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is not about the population one year ago relative to the current time, but relative to the time when the projection starts. Maybe I'm mixing up the time frames.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the starting point of the projection. Let's try another approach. Let's say that the projection is made from t=0, and the two years are t=1 and t=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is stating that after two years (t=2), the population will be double the population at t=1. No, the problem says \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\"\n\nWait, maybe 'one year ago' is relative to t=2. So t=2 minus one year is t=1. So P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the 10% increase each year, P(t=2) = P(t=1) *1.1. So substituting, P(t=2) = 1.1 * P(t=1) = 2 * P(t=1). That would imply 1.1 = 2, which is impossible. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"Boomtown urban planners expect the city\u2019s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the 'one year ago' refers to the start of the projection period. So the projection is for the next two years, starting from t=0 to t=2. So one year ago from t=2 would be t=1.\n\nSo P(t=2) = 2 * P(t=1).\n\nBut according to the growth rate, P(t=2) = P(t=1) *1.1. So 1.1 * P(t=1) = 2 * P(t=1) \u2192 1.1 = 2 \u2192 No, that's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the way I'm interpreting the time points is incorrect. Maybe I should model the population before and after the projection.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's assume that the current population is P. The planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years, so:\n\nAfter first year: P *1.1.\n\nAfter second year: P *1.1^2.\n\nThe problem says that two years from now, the population will be double the population one year ago. So, the population two years from now is double the population one year before the current time (i.e., P /1.1).\n\nSo:\n\nP * (1.1)^2 = 2 * (P /1.1 )\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1.1)^2 = 2 /1.1 \u2192 1.21 = 1.818.\n\nWhich is not correct. So this suggests that the growth rate can't be 10% if the condition is met, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe the problem is not about the future projection but about the past. The question is asking about the percent increase in the last year, so perhaps the population increased by x% last year, and now with the projection of 10% for the next two years, the population in two years would be double the population from one year ago.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet P be the population one year ago.\n\nThen, the current population (now) is P * (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from last year to now. We're to find r, which is the percent increase over the last year.\n\nIn the next two years, the population is expected to grow by 10% each year. So:\n\nAfter first year (next year): current pop * 1.1 = P*(1 + r) *1.1.\n\nAfter second year (two years from now): [P*(1 + r) *1.1] *1.1 = P*(1 + r) * (1.1)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, this two-year future population is exactly double the population one year ago (which was P). So:\n\nP*(1 + r) * (1.1)^2 = 2 * P.\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.21) = 2.\n\nSo (1 + r) = 2 /1.21.\n\nCompute 2 /1.21: 2 \u00f7 1.21 \u2248 1.65289256.\n\nSo 1 + r \u2248 1.65289 \u2192 r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.29%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, given that the population is expected to grow by 10% per year for the next two years, and that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population one year ago.\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   - Let \\( P \\) be the population one year ago.  \n   - Let \\( r \\) be the percent population increase over the last year.  \n   - The current population is then \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\).  \n\n2. **Population Projection**:  \n   - After the first year (next year), the population will be \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times 1.1 \\).  \n   - After the second year (two years from now), the population will be \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2 \\).  \n\n3. **Given Condition**:  \n   - The population two years from now is exactly double the population one year ago.  \n   - This gives the equation:  \n     \\[\n     P \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2 \\times P\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**:  \n   - Divide through by \\( P \\):  \n     \\[\n     (1 + r) \\times (1.1)^2 = 2\n     \\]\n   - Compute \\( (1.1)^2 = 1.21 \\):  \n     \\[\n     (1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( (1 + r) \\):  \n     \\[\n     1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.6529\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 1:  \n     \\[\n     r \\approx 0.6529\n     \\]\n   - Convert to percentage:  \n     \\[\n     r \\approx 65.29\\%\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer**:  \n   - The closest option to \\( 65.29\\% \\) is **65%**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is approximately **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
