      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a hotel buying newspapers, and I need to figure out how many they buy on Monday. Let's see, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. And they pay a total of $210 per week. Hmm, I think I can model this with some equations.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day is x. So on Sunday, they buy twice that, which would be 2x. Because the problem says they order twice as many on Sunday.\n\nNow, there are six days when they pay $1 per paper, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So the week has seven days. Sunday is one day, so the other six days are Monday to Saturday. So each of those days, the cost is $1 per paper.\n\nWait, but does the hotel buy the same number of papers each day except Sunday? The problem doesn't specify, but I think it's safe to assume that the \"rest of the days\" refers to each day, meaning each of the other six days they buy x newspapers. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\" \u2014 maybe it's buying x papers each day except Sunday, where it's 2x. So total papers per week would be 2x on Sunday plus 6 times x on the other days.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem. \"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week...\"\n\nOh, wait, maybe it's that on each day other than Sunday, they buy x papers. So on each of those six days, they buy x. Then on Sunday, they buy twice as much, so 2x.\n\nSo the total cost would be: Sunday cost plus the cost for the other days.\n\nSunday: 2x papers at $4 each. So cost is 2x * 4 = 8x dollars.\n\nOther days: 6 days (Monday to Saturday), each with x papers at $1. So 6 * x *1 =6x dollars.\n\nTotal cost is 8x +6x =14x. And this equals $210.\n\nSo 14x = 210 \u2192 x = 210 /14 =15.\n\nSo x is 15. That means on each of the other days, including Monday, they buy 15 papers.\n\nSo the answer should be 15. Looking at the options, option A is 15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's compute the total cost when x=15.\n\nSunday: 2x =30 papers. Cost: 30 *4=120.\n\nOther days: 6 days *15=90 papers. Cost:90 *1=90.\n\nTotal cost: 120+90=210. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of newspapers bought on Monday is 15, which is option A.\n",

And the total they pay per week is $210. The question is, how many newspapers do they buy on Monday?\n\nWait, so let's break it down. Let me think about the variables first. Let's say the number of newspapers ordered on a non-Sunday day is x. Then, on Sunday, they order twice that, so 2x.\n\nNow, the cost. On non-Sundays, each paper is $1, so each day, the cost would be x * $1. But wait, how many non-Sundays are there in a week? There are 6 days (Monday to Saturday), right? So, for each of those 6 days, the cost is x * 1, so 6x in total for those days.\n\nThen, on Sunday, it's 2x newspapers at $4 each. So the cost for Sunday is 2x * 4 = 8x.\n\nAdding both, the total cost per week is 6x + 8x = 14x. And we know the total is $210. So 14x = 210.\n\nWait, solving for x: x = 210 /14.

So cost for non-Sundays: 6 days * (x *1) =6x. Sunday cost: 2x *4=8x. Total 14x=210. Yep, same as before. So x=15. So Monday is x, which is 15. So the answer is A)15.\n\nWait, but why is option B 30?

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hotel buying newspapers. Hmm, let's see. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. They pay $210 a week. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, first, I should probably figure out how many newspapers they buy each day. Let me think about the variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x. \n\nNow, the cost. On non-Sundays, each paper is $1, so each day would cost x * $1. But wait, wait\u2014there are six days they buy these at $1 each, right? Because the week has seven days, Sunday is one day, so the rest are six days. So the cost for the six days would be 6 days * (x * $1) = 6x dollars. \n\nAnd on Sunday, it's 2x papers at $4 each. So that's 2x * $4 = 8x dollars. \n\nSo the total cost per week is the sum of the Sunday cost and the other days. That would be 8x + 6x = 14x. \n\nThe problem says the total is $210. So 14x = 210. To find x, I can divide both sides by 14. Let's see, 210 divided by 14. Hmm, 14 times 15 is 210, because 14*10=140, 14*5=70, 140+70=210.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hotel buying newspapers. Hmm, let's see. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. They pay $210 a week. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday. \n\nAlright, let's break it down. So, first, I should probably figure out how many newspapers they buy each day. Let me think about the variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that, so 2x. \n\nNow, the cost. On non-Sundays, each paper is $1, so each day would cost x * $1. But wait, wait\u2014there are six days they buy these at $1 each, right? Because the week has seven days, Sunday is one day, so the rest are six days. So the cost for the six days would be 6 days * (x * $1) = 6x dollars. \n\nAnd on Sunday, it's 2x papers at $4 each. So that's 2x * $4 = 8x dollars. \n\nSo the total cost per week is the sum of the Sunday cost and the other days. That would be 8x + 6x = 14x. \n\nThe problem says the total is $210. So 14x = 210. To find x, I can divide both sides by 14. Let's see, 210 divided by 14. Hmm, 14 times 15 is 210, because 14*10=140, 14*5=70, 140+70=210. So x is 15. \n\nWait, so x is the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day, like Monday. So the answer would be 15, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If they buy 15 papers each day Monday to Saturday, that's 15 *6 =90 papers. Sunday is 2*15=30. So total papers are 90 +30=120. But the cost is 30*$4=120, and 90*$1=90. So 120+90=210. Yep, that adds up. So the number on Monday is 15. So the correct answer is A)15.\n\n\nLet the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day be \\( x \\). On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many, so it buys \\( 2x \\) newspapers. The cost of newspapers on non-Sunday days is \\( x \\times \\$1 \\) per day, and since there are 6 non-Sunday days, the total cost for these days is \\( 6x \\times \\$1 = 6x \\).

Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says that a newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. A hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on the other days. The total they pay per week is $210. I need to find out how many newspapers they buy on Monday.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, let's figure out the costs and the quantities involved.\n\nSo, the newspaper is $4 on Sunday and $1 on other days. The hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. So if I let x be the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday), then on Sunday they buy 2x.\n\nWait, but wait. How many days are we considering? The problem says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So that's Monday through Saturday, which is 6 days. So each day from Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys x newspapers. Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait, but wait again. The problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the rest of the days. Oh, does that mean twice as many as each day or twice as the sum of the other days? Because that could change things.\n\nWait, let me think. If it's twice as many on Sunday as on the other days, perhaps it's twice as much as each day. So, for example, if Monday through Saturday each have x, Sunday is 2x. But wait, that would make Sunday twice each day, but the other days have x each. So maybe the correct approach is to consider that Sunday is twice the number as the total of the other days.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. \"The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, that wording suggests that on Sunday, the number is twice the number of the rest of the days. So if the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) have a total of, say, 6x (since 6 days), then Sunday would be 2*(6x) = 12x. But that might not make sense because the problem says \"the rest of the days\" as a group. So maybe Sunday is twice the number of newspapers bought on each of the other days.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet x be the number of newspapers bought on each of the six days (Mon-Sat). So each of those days is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy 2x.\n\nWait, but that would mean that on Sunday, they buy twice as many as they do on any one of the other days. So total for Sunday is 2x, and each of the other days is x.\n\nSo the total number of newspapers per week would be 6*x (for Mon-Sat) plus 2x for Sunday, which is 8x.\n\nBut the cost comes into play as well. The cost is $4 per Sunday paper and $1 for others.\n\nSo the cost per week would be:\n\nFor Sunday: number of papers is 2x, each at $4, so 2x *4 = 8x dollars.\n\nFor the other days: each day is x, 6 days, each at $1. So 6x *1 =6x dollars.\n\nTotal cost is 8x +6x =14x. And according to the problem, the total is $210. So 14x =210.\n\nSolving for x: x=210/14=15.\n\nWait, so x is 15. That means each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) buys 15 newspapers. So on Monday, the number is 15. So the answer would be option A)15.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because maybe I made a mistake in how I set up the variables.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me denote the number of papers bought on each of the non-Sunday days as x. So each of the 6 days (Mon-Sat) is x. So total for those days is 6x. Sunday is twice as much as the rest of the days, which would be 2*6x =12x.\n\nWait, wait, that's a different approach. So in this case, Sunday is twice the total of the other days. So that would be 12x on Sunday.\n\nWait, but which interpretation is correct? The problem says, \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Does \"the rest of the days\" refer to each day or the total for all of them?\n\nLooking at the wording again: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh wait, \"rest of the days\" is plural, so maybe it's the total of all other days.\n\nSo if the rest of the days (Mon-Sat) sum to 6x, then Sunday is 2*(6x) =12x.\n\nIn that case, the total number of newspapers would be 6x (Mon-Sat) +12x (Sun) =18x.\n\nNow, the cost: Sunday newspapers are 12x * $4 =48x. The other days: 6x * $1 =6x. So total cost is 48x +6x=54x. And this is given as $210.\n\nSo 54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54=3.518... Wait, that's not a whole number. But since the number of newspapers should be an integer, that can't be right. So perhaps my initial approach was correct, and this alternative approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct interpretation is that Sunday is twice the number of each other day. So each other day is x, Sunday is 2x. So for each of the other days, x, and Sunday is 2x.\n\nSo in that case, the cost calculation would be:\n\nSunday: 2x *4=8x.\n\nOther days: 6 days *x *1 =6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x=14x=210 \u2192x=15.\n\nSo that gives x=15, so Monday is 15. So the answer is A)15.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the rest of the days. So maybe \"twice as many\" refers to the total of all the other days. Let's see.\n\nIf \"rest of the days\" refers to the total, then:\n\nLet the total number of papers on the other days (Mon-Sat) be y. Then Sunday is 2y.\n\nTotal papers: y +2y=3y.\n\nCost: Sunday is 2y *4=8y. Other days: y *1= y. Total cost: 8y + y=9y=210 \u2192 y=210/9=23.333... which isn't an integer. So that's impossible, as newspapers can't be in fractions.\n\nTherefore, that approach must be wrong.\n\nSo the correct interpretation must be that Sunday is twice the number bought on each of the other days.\n\nSo each other day is x, Sunday is 2x.\n\nSo the cost is Sunday: 2x *4=8x. Other days: 6x *1=6x. Total cost 14x=210 \u2192x=15.\n\nSo the number on Monday is 15, so option A.\n",

The options are A)15, B)30, C)45, D)60, E)75.\n\nHmm. So, the newspaper prices vary by day. Sunday is more expensive. The hotel's order on Sunday is double what it is on other days. And the total cost is $210. I need to find the number of newspapers on Monday.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day is x. So on Monday, that's x. Tuesday would also be x, and so on for the other five days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days. So if on other days it's x, Sunday would be 2x.\n\nSo, how many days are we considering? There are seven days in a week. Sunday is one day, and the other six days are Monday to Saturday.\n\nWait no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week.\" So that's Monday through Saturday, which is six days. So each of those six days, the hotel buys x newspapers. And on Sunday, it's 2x.\n\nSo the cost for each day would be based on the number bought and the price.\n\nLet me structure this.\n\nNumber bought on Sunday: 2x. Price per paper: $4. So cost for Sunday is 2x * 4 = 8x dollars.\n\nFor each of the other six days, number bought is x. Price per paper: $1. So cost per day is x * 1 = x dollars. Since there are six days, the total cost for the other days is 6 * x = 6x.\n\nAdding Sunday and the other days together, the total cost is 8x + 6x = 14x.\n\nAnd we know that the total is $210. So 14x = 210.\n\nTo find x, we can divide both sides by 14. So x = 210 /14. Let me compute that.\n\n210 divided by 14: 14 times 15 is 210 (since 14*10=140, 14*5=70; 140+70=210). So x is 15.\n\nBut wait, x is the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day. So on Monday, it's x, which is 15. So the answer should be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo, each non-Sunday day is 15 papers. Sunday is 2x, which is 30. \n\nCost on Sunday: 30 * $4 = $120.\n\nEach of the other six days: 15 * $1 = $15 per day. So six days: 6 * 15 = $90.\n\nTotal cost: 120 + 90 = $210. That matches the given total. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo the number of newspapers on Monday is 15, which is option A.\n\n\nLet the number of newspapers bought on a non-Sunday day be \\( x \\). On Sunday, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers, so it buys \\( 2x \\) newspapers. The cost of newspapers is $4 on Sunday and $1 on other days.\n\n- **Cost on Sunday**: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\) dollars.\n- **Cost on other days**: There are 6 non-Sunday days, so the total cost is \\( 6 \\times (x \\times 1) = 6x \\) dollars.\n\nThe total weekly cost is the sum of the costs on Sunday and other days:\n\\[\n8x + 6x = 14x\n\\]\nGiven that the total weekly cost is $210, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n14x = 210 \\implies x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the hotel buys \\( x = 15 \\) newspapers on each non-Sunday day, including Monday.\n\nTo verify:\n- On Sunday: \\( 2x = 30 \\) newspapers, costing \\( 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\) dollars.\n- On other days: \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\) newspapers, costing \\( 90 \\times 1 = 90 \\) dollars.\n- Total cost: \\( 120 + 90 = 210 \\) dollars, which matches the given total.\n\nTherefore, the number of newspapers bought on Monday is **15**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a newspaper cost and a hotel ordering. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. \n\nSo the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the other days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as on the other days. They pay $210 per week. I need to find how many they buy on Monday.\n\nWait, wait. So let's break this down. First, the days of the week are seven, right? Sunday plus six other days. But wait, the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\" which includes Monday to Saturday. So from Monday to Saturday, that's six days, each at $1 per paper. And Sunday is one day at $4 per paper.\n\nThe hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as on the other days. So if I let the number of papers they buy on a non-Sunday day be x, then on Sunday it's 2x. Because twice as many.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Does \"the rest of the days\" mean each day is x, or that all the non-Sundays combined are x? I think it's the latter. Because the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) in total sum up to x, and Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Suppose on each non-Sunday day, the hotel buys x papers. Then, there are six days (Monday to Saturday) each with x papers. So total non-Sundays would be 6x. Oh wait, no, the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) together sum to x, and Sunday is 2x. So total for the week is 2x (Sunday) + x (rest) = 3x papers. But wait, no, the problem is about the number of newspapers. So each non-Sunday day, the number is the same. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that on each day, the hotel buys a certain number. So let's say on Monday, they buy x papers. Then, since they buy the same amount on each of the other non-Sundays, that's six days (Mon-Sat) each with x papers. So total non-Sundays: 6x. Sunday is twice as much as any other day, so Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait, but wait: the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, does that mean that the total for Sunday is twice the total for the rest? Or that each Sunday is twice as much as each other day?\n\nWait, the wording is tricky. Let me read it again: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\"\n\nAh, okay, so the total on Sunday is twice the total on the other days. So the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) together sum up to x, and Sunday is 2x. So total papers per week: x (non-Sundays) + 2x (Sunday) = 3x.\n\nWait, but wait: no, because the rest of the days are 6 days, each day having the same number. So perhaps it's better to model it as: Let the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. Then Sunday is 2x. So per week, the number is 6x (from Mon-Sat) + 2x (Sunday) = 8x? Wait, no, because if each non-Sunday is x, then six days would be 6x. Plus Sunday's 2x, making 8x in total. But wait, the problem says the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on the rest of the days. So the rest of the days, which are six days, each with x, so total is 6x. Sunday is 2x? Or is Sunday twice the total of the other days?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me re-approach this.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet x be the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day. So each of Monday to Saturday is x.\n\nThen, the total for non-Sundays is 6x.\n\nThe problem says the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as on the rest of the days. So Sunday's papers are 2*(total of rest days). Oh wait, the rest of the days total is 6x, so Sunday is 2*(6x) = 12x.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because then total newspapers per week would be 6x + 12x = 18x. But the cost would be 6x*1 + 12x*4, because non-Sundays are $1 each, Sunday is $4 each.\n\nWait, let me think again. The wording says, \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the number of papers on Sunday is twice the number on the rest of the days. So if the rest of the days total to R papers, Sunday is 2R.\n\nSo, R is the sum of all non-Sundays, which is 6 days each with x papers, so R = 6x. Then Sunday is 2R = 12x.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So the total number of papers per week is R + 2R = 3R = 3*(6x) = 18x.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. So Monday: x, Tuesday: x, ..., Saturday: x.\n\nSo total non-Sundays: 6x.\n\nSunday: twice as many as the rest. So Sunday is 2x? Or is it twice the total of the rest? Because the rest's total is 6x.\n\nIf it's twice the total of the rest, then Sunday is 2*(6x) = 12x. But that would mean that Sunday's purchase is 12x, which is a lot. Alternatively, if \"twice as many on Sunday as on each of the other days,\" then Sunday is 2x per day. But that's different.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So the way I read it, the total on Sunday is twice the total of the rest.\n\nSo rest total: 6x.\n\nSunday: 2*(6x) = 12x.\n\nThen total newspapers per week: 6x + 12x = 18x.\n\nThe cost per week is $210.\n\nThe cost is computed as:\n\nFor non-Sundays: each paper is $1. So cost is (6x) * $1 = $6x.\n\nFor Sunday: each paper is $4. So cost is (12x) * $4 = $48x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x + 48x = 54x = $210.\n\nSo 54x = 210 \u2192 x = 210 /54.\n\nWait, 54x = 210 \u2192 x = 210 /54 = 35/9 \u2248 3.888. Hmm, but that can't be right because x should be an integer, since you can't buy a fraction of a paper.\n\nWait, that suggests I might have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. So Sunday is 2x.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So if the rest of the days are 6 days, each with x, then rest is 6x. So Sunday is 2 * (6x) = 12x.\n\nSo Sunday's newspapers are 12x, which would make the cost for Sunday: 12x * $4 = $48x.\n\nNon-Sundays: 6x * $1 = $6x.\n\nTotal cost: 48x +6x =54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54= 3.888. Hmm, which is not an integer. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm interpreting the problem wrong. Perhaps \"twice as many on Sunday as on each of the other days.\" So each Sunday is 2x, where x is the number on a non-Sunday day. Then, the total for non-Sundays is 6x, and Sunday is 2x. So total papers: 6x +2x =8x.\n\nCost: non-Sundays:6x *1 =6x; Sunday: 2x *4=8x. Total cost:6x+8x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So then, on Monday, which is a non-Sunday, the number is x=15. So the answer would be 15, which is option A.\n\nWait, but that's only if the problem says Sunday is twice as much as each day, not the sum of the other days. So I'm getting conflicting interpretations.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\"\n\nSo the rest of the days (Mon-Sat) are considered as a group. So the rest of the days' total is R, and Sunday is 2R.\n\nSo R = 6x (since each of 6 days is x). So Sunday is 2R =12x.\n\nThus, total papers: R + 2R = 3R= 3*6x=18x.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nNon-Sundays: R *1 =6x *1=6x.\n\nSunday: 2R *4=12x *4=48x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x +48x=54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54= 35/9 \u22483.888. That can't be, as x should be integer.\n\nHmm, that suggests a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that Sunday is twice as many as each of the other days. So Sunday is 2x per day, not 2 times the total of the other days.\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"rest of the days\" could mean each day, or all the days.\n\nWait, in English, when you say \"the rest of the days of the week,\" it usually refers to all the other days combined. So \"the rest of the days\" would be the total of Monday to Saturday. So the total for Sunday is twice that.\n\nSo total newspapers:\n\nSunday: 2*(Monday + Tuesday + ... + Saturday).\n\nBut Monday to Saturday are each x. So sum is 6x. Sunday is 2*6x=12x.\n\nSo total newspapers per week: 6x +12x=18x.\n\nCost:\n\nNon-Sundays: 6x *1 =6x.\n\nSunday: 12x *4=48x.\n\nTotal cost:54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54=35/9\u22483.888. That's not possible.\n\nHmm, that can't be right, so perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\" refers to per day. So each Sunday is twice the number of papers as each other day.\n\nSo each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x.\n\nTotal papers per week: 6x (non-Sundays) +2x (Sunday) =8x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x *1 +2x *4 =6x +8x=14x.\n\nSet 14x=210 \u2192 x=15.\n\nSo on Monday, it's x=15. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\nThat makes sense, and x is integer. So perhaps the initial interpretation was wrong, and the problem means that Sunday's order is twice that of each other day, not twice the sum.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)15.\n",

That's not possible.\n\nHmm, that can't be right, so perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\" refers to per day. So each Sunday is twice the number of papers as each other day.\n\nSo each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x.\n\nTotal papers per week: 6x (non-Sundays) +2x (Sunday) =8x.\n\nTotal cost: 6x *1 +2x *4 =6x +8x=14x.\n\nSet 14x=210 \u2192 x=15.\n\nSo on Monday, it's x=15. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n\nThat makes sense, and x is integer. So perhaps the initial interpretation was wrong, and the problem means that Sunday's order is twice that of each other day, not twice the sum.\n\nSo the correct answer would be A)15.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Cost Structure**:  \n   - Newspapers cost $4 on Sunday and $1 on other days.  \n   - The hotel buys newspapers for 7 days: Sunday and Monday to Saturday.\n\n2. **Ordering Pattern**:  \n   - Let the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day (Monday to Saturday) be \\( x \\).  \n   - The problem states the hotel buys \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\"  \n   - This means the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is \\( 2x \\).\n\n3. **Total Newspapers per Week**:  \n   - Non-Sundays (Monday to Saturday): \\( 6x \\) (since there are 6 days, each with \\( x \\) newspapers).  \n   - Sunday: \\( 2x \\).  \n   - Total newspapers per week: \\( 6x + 2x = 8x \\).\n\n4. **Total Cost per Week**:  \n   - Cost for non-Sundays: \\( 6x \\times \\$1 = \\$6x \\).  \n   - Cost for Sunday: \\( 2x \\times \\$4 = \\$8x \\).  \n   - Total cost per week: \\( \\$6x + \\$8x = \\$14x \\).\n\n5. **Given Total Cost**:  \n   - The hotel pays \\$210 per week for newspapers.  \n   - Set up the equation:  \n     \\[\n     14x = 210\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):  \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n     \\]\n\n6. **Number of Newspapers on Monday**:  \n   - Since \\( x = 15 \\), the hotel buys \\( 15 \\) newspapers on Monday.\n\nThus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday is **15**, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a newspaper cost and a hotel ordering them. Hmm, let me read it again. So, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday compared to the other days. And the total they pay per week is $210. The question is, how many newspapers do they buy on Monday?\n\nWait, Monday is one of the rest days, right? Because Sunday is the only day with a different cost. So the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) cost $1 each. \n\nLet me think about variables. Let's say the number of newspapers ordered on a non-Sunday day is x. Then on Sunday, they order twice as many, so 2x. \n\nSo each non-Sunday day, they spend x * $1 = $x. There are 6 such days (Monday to Saturday). So the cost for the week days is 6 * x * 1 = 6x dollars.\n\nOn Sunday, the cost is 2x newspapers * $4 each. So that's 2x *4 = 8x dollars.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no, 2x is the number on Sunday. So the cost for Sunday is 2x *4 = 8x. Right.\n\nSo total cost per week is 6x (from week days) + 8x (Sunday) = 14x. And we know the total is $210. So 14x = 210.\n\nTo find x, divide both sides by 14. So x = 210 /14. Let me calculate that. 14 times 15 is 210 because 14*10 is 140, 14*5 is 70, 140+70=210. So x is 15.\n\nSo x is 15. That means on each non-Sunday day, they buy 15 newspapers. So Monday is one of those days. So the answer should be 15. Looking at the options, option A is 15.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. So each of the 6 days (Mon-Sat) has 15 papers. Sunday has 30. \n\nCalculating the cost: 6 days *15*$1 = 90. Sunday:30*4=120. Total is 90+120=210. Yep, that adds up. So the answer is 15, which is option A.\n",
