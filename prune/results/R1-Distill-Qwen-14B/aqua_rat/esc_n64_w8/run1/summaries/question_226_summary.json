      "full_content": "Okay, so Peter needs to form a scavenger hunt team. He wants 10 additional people, so that's 10 spots on the team. Wait, but the question says he has 10 friends who would like to participate. Hmm, so Peter is already part of the team? Or is he one of the 10 friends? That's a bit unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says Peter is looking for 10 additional people. So he's probably the one organizing the team. He has 10 friends willing to join. So he needs to choose 10 people from his 10 friends. But if he has exactly 10 friends and needs to pick 10, how many ways can he do that?\n\nI think this is a combinations problem. The number of ways to choose k people from n is given by the combination formula, n choose k, which is n!/(k! (n-k)!).\n\nIn this case, n is 10 friends, and k is 10 people needed. So it's 10 choose 10. Let me compute that. 10! divided by (10! * (10-10)!)). Oh wait, 10-10 is 0, and 0! is 1. So the formula becomes 10!/(10! * 1) = 1. So there's only one way to choose all 10 friends.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any other constraints? Like, does Peter count as part of the 10? Because the problem says he wants 10 additional people. So if he's not part of the 10 friends, then he needs to pick 10 from his 10 friends. So yes, that's one way.\n\nBut if Peter is one of the 10 friends, then he's already included, but he's looking for 10 more. That would mean he needs 10, but he only has 9 friends left. Oh wait, that can't be, because the problem states he has 10 friends. So perhaps Peter is not part of the 10 friends. So the team will consist of Peter plus 10 friends? No, wait, the question says he wants to form a team with himself and 10 others. So he's the organizer and needs 10 more. But the problem says he has 10 friends who would like to participate. So he's selecting all 10 from his 10 friends, which can be done in one way. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo looking at the options, option B is 1.\n\n\nPeter needs to form a scavenger hunt team and requires 10 additional people.
