      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out Ajay's present age. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'll read the problem again and see what information I can extract.\n\nThe problem says: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. So, mathematically, I can write that as (Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age. Got it.\n\nNext part: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. Oh, and Denis's age is 5 years. Wait, wait. Let me parse that again. It says, \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So Denis is 5 years old, and Rahul is two years younger than that. Wait, wait, no. No, I think I misread that. Wait, the structure is \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, wait, is Denis 5 years old, or is Rahul 5? Hmm. Let's think about the wording. It says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years. Oh, wait, that can't be right because if Denis is 5, Rahul would be 3. But let me check the wording again. Oh, maybe it's Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5. So, yes, Rahul's age would be 5 minus 2, which is 3? But wait, that seems too young. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is \"Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years.\" So, the way it's phrased is that Denis is 5, and Rahul is two years younger than Denis. So Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but then the first part says that when you subtract 6 from Ajay's age and divide by 18, you get Rahul's age. So, (Aj -6)/18 = Rahul's age. Rahul is 3, so (Aj -6)/18 = 3. Let me solve for Aj.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 18: Aj -6 = 3 *18 = 54. Then Aj = 54 +6 =60. So Ajay is 60 years old. Looking at the options, B is 60. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes the wording can be tricky.\n\nWait, another thought: Did I interpret the first part correctly? The problem says, \"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.\" So yes, (Aj -6)/18 = Rahul's age. And Rahul is 3, so that gives Ajay's age as 60.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the ages of Rahul and Denis again. The problem says, \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So, the structure is Rahul = Denis's age - 2. And Denis's age is 5. So Rahul is 5 -2 =3. So that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together: Rahul is 3. So (Aj -6)/18 =3 \u2192 Aj=3*18 +6=54+6=60. So Ajay is 60. Option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem goes like this: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. Also, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I'll try to understand each part of the problem.\n\nStarting with the second part, it says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. And Denis's age is 5 years. So if Denis is 5, Rahul must be 5 minus 2, right? That would make Rahul 3 years old. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Because if Rahul is younger, subtracting 2 from Denis's age should give Rahul's age. Yes, 5 minus 2 is 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nNow, the first part of the problem says that if we subtract 6 years from Ajay's current age and then divide that remainder by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, mathematically, that can be written as:\n\n(Rahul's age) = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nWe already know Rahul's age is 3. So plugging that in:\n\n3 = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nNow, I need to solve for Ajay's age. Let's denote Ajay's age as A.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe problem goes like this: If 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. Also, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I'll try to understand each part of the problem.\n\nStarting with the second part, it says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. And Denis's age is 5 years. So if Denis is 5, Rahul must be 5 minus 2, right? That would make Rahul 3 years old. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Because if Rahul is younger, subtracting 2 from Denis's age should give Rahul's age. Yes, 5 minus 2 is 3. So Rahul is 3 years old.\n\nNow, the first part of the problem says that if we subtract 6 years from Ajay's current age and then divide that remainder by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, mathematically, that can be written as:\n\n(Rahul's age) = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nWe already know Rahul's age is 3. So plugging that in:\n\n3 = (Ajay's age - 6) / 18\n\nNow, I need to solve for Ajay's age. Let's denote Ajay's age as A. So the equation becomes:\n\n3 = (A - 6) / 18\n\nTo solve for A, I can multiply both sides by 18. Let's do that:\n\n3 * 18 = A - 6\n\nCalculating 3 times 18, that's 54. So:\n\n54 = A - 6\n\nNow, add 6 to both sides to find A:\n\n54 + 6 = A\n\nWhich gives:\n\n60 = A\n\nSo Ajay's present age is 60 years. Looking at the options, option B is 60.

Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis and Denis is 5 years old, Rahul's age is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rahul's age} = 5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ years}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the relationship between Ajay's and Rahul's ages. The problem states that if 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the result is divided by 18, we obtain Rahul's age. Let \\( A \\) represent Ajay's age. The equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A - 6}{18} = 3.\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( A \\), multiply both sides by 18:\n\n\\[\nA - 6 = 3 \\times 18 = 54.\n\\]\n\nThen, add 6 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nA = 54 + 6 = 60.\n\\]\n\nThus, Ajay's present age is 60 years.

Then, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. We need to find Ajay's present age.\n\nWait, let me break this down. So first, let's note down what each person's age is.\n\nDenis's age is given as 5 years. No, wait, wait, no. Let me read that again. \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" Oh, so Denis is 5 years old. Then Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be Denis's age minus 2.\n\nWait, Denis is 5, so Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Got that.\n\nNow, the first part talks about Ajay. If we subtract 6 years from Ajay's present age, and then divide the remainder by 18, we get Rahul's age. So, mathematically, that can be written as:\n\n(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age.\n\nWe know Rahul's age is 3. So substituting that in:\n\n(Ajay's age - 6) / 18 = 3.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let's let A be Ajay's age. So,\n\n(A - 6) / 18 = 3.\n\nNow, solve for A. Multiply both sides by 18:\n\nA - 6 = 3 * 18.\n\n3 times 18 is 54. So,\n\nA - 6 = 54.\n\nThen add 6 to both sides:\n\nA = 54 + 6 = 60.\n\nWait, so Ajay's age is 60? Let me check the options. The options are A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90. So B is 60, which is our calculation.\n\nLet me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nDenis is 5. Rahul is 2 years younger, so 5-2=3. Correct.\n\nAjay's age minus 6 divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So (A-6)/18 =3. Multiply both sides by 18: A-6=54. Add 6: A=60. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the answer should be B)60.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining Ajay's present age based on the relationships between the ages of Ajay, Rahul, and Denis. \n\n1. **Denis's age is given as 5 years.**  \n   - Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Rahul's age is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Rahul's age} = 5 - 2 = 3 \\text{ years}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **The relationship between Ajay's age and Rahul's age is provided:**  \n   - If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's age and the remainder is divided by 18, the result is Rahul's age.  \n     This can be written as:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\text{Ajay's age} - 6}{18} = \\text{Rahul's age}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Rahul's age into the equation:**  \n   - Since Rahul is 3 years old:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\text{Ajay's age} - 6}{18} = 3.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for Ajay's age:**  \n   - Multiply both sides by 18:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Ajay's age} - 6 = 54.\n     \\]\n   - Add 6 to both sides:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Ajay's age} = 54 + 6 = 60.\n     \\]\n\nThus, Ajay's present age is **60 years**.
