      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. \n\nThe question says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. So, there's a number, let's call it 'x'. The problem is about forming an equation based on the given conditions and then solving for x.\n\nThe first part says, \"10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number.\" So, in equation terms, that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Because 2/3 of the number is (2/3)x, and then 10 is subtracted from that.\n\nThe second part says, \"the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.\" So, the result from the first part equals 40 plus (1/3)x. So putting it together, the equation is (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for x. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFirst, maybe I can get all the terms with x on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. So:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40\n\nSimplifying the left side, 2/3 minus 1/3 is 1/3. So:\n\n(1/3)x -10 =40\n\nNow, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x. So,\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10\n(1/3)x =50\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 3.\n\nx =50 *3\nx=150\n\nWait, so x is 150. Let me check the options. Option C is 150. So that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps.\n\nLet me plug x=150 back into the original problem to see if it works.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. Let's calculate that. 2/3 of 150 is (2*150)/3 = 300/3 =100. Then subtract 10: 100-10=90.\n\nRight side:40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50. So 40+50=90. \n\nYes, both sides are 90. So the equation holds. So x=150 is correct. So the answer is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find that number, and the options are given as A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down. I think the first thing I should do is represent the unknown number with a variable. Let's call it x. That makes sense because variables are used to represent unknowns in equations.\n\nNow, the problem says that if we subtract 10 from two-thirds of this number, it equals the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So, translating that into an equation, I think it would look like this:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, two-thirds of the number is (2/3)x, and subtracting 10 from that gives the left side. On the right side, it's 40 plus one-third of the number, which is (1/3)x. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's see. How do I approach this? Well, I can start by getting all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms together.\n\nSo subtracting (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nWait, let me write that again. It's (2/3)x minus (1/3)x, which is (1/3)x. So the equation becomes:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nNow, I need to get rid of that -10 on the left side. So I'll add 10 to both sides:\n\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nOh right, because 40 + 10 is 50. Now, to solve for x, I need to get rid of the fraction. Since x is being multiplied by 1/3, I can multiply both sides by 3 to cancel that out.\n\nSo:\n\nx = 50 * 3\nx = 150\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So if x is 150, let's plug it back into the original problem to see if both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 - 10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is 100, because 150 divided by 3 is 50, times 2 is 100. Subtract 10 gives 90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40 + 50 is 90. Oh, both sides are equal. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220. So 150 is option C. So that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40\nWhich is (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n(1/3)x = 50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\nx =150.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number is 150, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find that number, and the options are given as A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down. I think the first thing I should do is represent the unknown number with a variable. Let's call it x. That makes sense because variables are used to represent unknowns in equations.\n\nNow, the problem says that if we subtract 10 from two-thirds of this number, it equals the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. So, translating that into an equation, I think it would look like this:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, two-thirds of the number is (2/3)x, and subtracting 10 from that gives the left side. On the right side, it's 40 plus one-third of the number, which is (1/3)x. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's see. How do I approach this? Well, I can start by getting all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Maybe I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms together.\n\nSo subtracting (1/3)x from both sides:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nWait, let me write that again. It's (2/3)x minus (1/3)x, which is (1/3)x. So the equation becomes:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nNow, I need to get rid of that -10 on the left side. So I'll add 10 to both sides:\n\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nOh right, because 40 + 10 is 50. Now, to solve for x, I need to get rid of the fraction. Since x is being multiplied by 1/3, I can multiply both sides by 3 to cancel that out.\n\nSo:\n\nx = 50 * 3\nx = 150\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So if x is 150, let's plug it back into the original problem to see if both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 - 10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is 100, because 150 divided by 3 is 50, times 2 is 100. Subtract 10 gives 90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40 + 50 is 90. Oh, both sides are equal. So that works.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220. So 150 is option C. So that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides:\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40\nWhich is (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n(1/3)x = 50.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\nx =150.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the number is 150, which is option C.\n\n\nLet the unknown number be \\( x \\).
