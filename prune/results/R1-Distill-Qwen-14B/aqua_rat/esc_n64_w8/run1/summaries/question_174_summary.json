      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tire costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, let's see. The problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. Each new tire costs $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost per year of the new tires is greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, so I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage difference. Let me get this straight.\n\nFirst, for the new tires. Each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's $180 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 180 /4 is 45. So each year, the cost averages $45 per tire.\n\nNow, the repair option. The customer already has tires, and repairing them costs $40 per tire. This repair makes the tires last one more year. So, originally, I guess the tires were going to last three years before this repair? Or wait, no\u2014maybe the repair extends their life from four to five years? Or is the original lifespan something else?\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So if the customer is considering repair now, perhaps the tires are nearing the end of their useful life. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, making them last one additional year. So, the current tires' lifespan before repair is four years? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the new tires last four years when purchased. So if the customer is considering repair, perhaps their current tires are, say, three years old. So without repair, they have one year left. But the repair adds one more year, making it two years. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give the current age of the tires. So perhaps I should think about it in terms of what's the total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the key is that the repair adds one year to their current lifespan, regardless of how old they are. So the current tires have a certain lifespan, and the repair extends it by one year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time thing. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me think: If the customer buys new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, paying $40 per tire, which makes them last one more year. Wait, but how long did they last before? The problem says that new tires last four years, but that's when they are purchased. So maybe the current tires are already used for some time. Or perhaps the repair extends their lifespan from X years to X+1 years.\n\nWait, maybe the initial lifespan without repair is three years, and the repair makes them last four. But the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So the customer's current tires might be, say, three years old, and they would last one more year without repair. But if they repair them, they last two more years. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the customer is thinking about whether to buy new tires or repair the existing ones. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time and are about to need replacement, so the repair is an option to extend their life by one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the customer is comparing the two options for the same period. Like, if they buy new tires, they get four years of use, and if they repair, they get one additional year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their current lifespan, but what's that current lifespan? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the average cost per year for the repair option. Let's think: Suppose the current tires are going to last X years without repair. Repairing them for $40 makes them last X+1 years.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say what X is. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the question says the new tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires were originally new, and the customer is thinking about whether to repair them or replace them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer has tires that are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used for another year, but with repair, they can last one more year. So the repair extends the lifespan from four years to five.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the customer's current tires have been used for four years and are at the end of their life. So without repair, they can't be used any longer. But if they repair them, they can get one more year of use.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the current tires, without repair, would last one year less than their maximum. Or perhaps, the repair adds an additional year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So if the current tires have, say, two years of life left, the repair would make them last three years. But the problem doesn't specify the current condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is implying that the customer has tires that are about to last for a certain period, and the repair adds one more year. But without knowing the current lifespan, it's hard to compute. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. The tires, when purchased new, last for four years. So if you buy them new, they last four years. So the customer is considering either buying new tires now, which will last four years, or repairing their current tires for $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year.\n\nSo perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time, and without repair, they have, say, one year left. So repair adds one more year. So the total lifespan with repair is two years. But without knowing how much life they have left, perhaps we can model it as the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So the total lifespan after repair is, let's assume, the current lifespan plus one year. But wait, without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps I need to model this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in their fourth year, and without repair, they will last for one more year (so fifth year?), but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they can't be used beyond their current lifespan. But the repair adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year to the current lifespan, which is three years. So the repair makes them last four years. But that's not given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, so the customer is considering whether to spend $40 now to get one more year, or $180 for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the current tires have already been in use for some years. Let me think about the total cost over the same period. For example, the customer wants to have tires for a certain number of years, and wants to choose between buying new ones or repairing.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it for four years, the same as the new tires. So if the customer repairs their current tires, they can get one more year. So how does that fit into a four-year period?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are, say, three years old) to get one more year, making their total lifespan four years, or buy new tires for four years.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40. They last one additional year. So the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is increased by one year. But what's the original lifespan? Hmm. Without knowing that, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires, when purchased, last four years. So if the customer is considering whether to repair, maybe their current tires have been in use for three years. So without repair, they have one more year. With repair, they get two more years.\n\nSo the total lifespan for the repair option would be 3 + 2 = 5 years? Wait, but that's adding two years, not one. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years (so they are at the end of their useful life). Repairing them would make them last one more year. So the lifespan after repair is five years.\n\nWait, but if you buy new tires, they last four years. So the cost is $180 for four years. The repair is $40 for an additional year (total of five years). But that's not the same as four years. So comparing apples to apples, maybe I should compute the average cost per year for each option over the same period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost for the same period, say four years. So, for four years, they can either buy new tires for $180, which will cover four years, or repair their current tires and use them for four years.\n\nWait, but the repair only adds one year. So if the current tires have, say, three years of life left, then after repair, they'll last four years. So the average cost per year would be 40 /4 = $10. But wait, no, because the repair is a one-time cost. So the total cost is $40, which is spread over four years. So average is 10 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the original tires might have been free, but that's probably not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to spend $40 now to get one more year of use from their current tires, which would otherwise need to be replaced after one year. So without repair, they'd have one year of use, and then need to buy a new tire. With repair, they have two years of use.\n\nBut that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year of each option for the same period.\n\nLet me try to model it. Let's say the customer is trying to cover a period of five years.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires every four years. So in five years, they'd have to buy once and maybe a partial set, but perhaps we can model it as 5/4 = 1.25 sets. Hmm, but maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans.\n\nSo, for new tires: cost is $180, lifespan 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nFor repair: cost is $40, lifespan is 1 additional year. So the average cost per year is 40/1 = $40.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if the current tires have been in use for some time, the repair is only adding one year. So perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 divided by the total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, but if the current tires have already been used for, say, three years, and the repair adds one more year, making it four years. So the total cost for four years would be 40, so average per year is 10.\n\nWait, but that seems too low. So perhaps the current tires were bought new, and after four years, they are being considered for repair. So the customer has had the tires for four years, and without repair, they can't be used for another year. With repair, they can be used for one more year.\n\nSo, the total lifespan after repair is five years, and the cost is 40. So average per year is 40/5 = 8. But that would make the repair option cheaper, which seems possible.\n\nWait, but in that case, the average cost for new tires is 45 per year, and for repair it's 8 per year. That would make the new tires much more expensive, but the options don't have such a high percentage. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not modeling this correctly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair option is a one-time repair that allows the tire to last one more year beyond its original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years, and with repair, it's five years.\n\nSo the total cost for the repair is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tire's average is 45, repair is 8. So the new tires are more expensive, but the question is asking by what percent the new tires' average is greater than the repair.\n\nWait, so the question is: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, (45 - 8)/8 * 100% = (37/8)*100% = 4.625 * 100% = 462.5% greater. But that's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used for another year. With repair, they can be used for one more year. So the total lifespan is four years (original) plus one year (with repair) = five years.\n\nSo the total cost for the repair is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year is 40/5 = 8.\n\nWait, but that makes the new tire average 45, repair average 8. So the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says, \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the repair adds one more year to their current lifespan. So if the current tires are, say, three years old, the repair would make them last four years. So the total lifespan is four years, and the repair cost is $40.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 /4 = 10.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for the repair option, the average cost per year is 10.\n\nAnd the new tires have an average of 45 per year.\n\nSo, the question is: What percent greater is 45 than 10?\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((New - Original)/Original) *100%.\n\nSo, ((45-10)/10)*100% = (35/10)*100% = 3.5 *100% = 350% greater. But that's not an option either. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the average cost calculation for the repair option.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the customer's current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan. Without repair, they can't be used for another year. So the repair adds one year, making their lifespan five years. So the cost is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So average per year is 40/5 =8.\n\nBut then the new tire is 45 per year, which is way higher than 8, leading to a 462% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps the current tires are about to last for three years without repair, and the repair adds one year, making it four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years, so average is 40/4 =10.\n\nAh, that would make sense. So the repair option averages $10 per year, while the new tire is $45 per year.\n\nSo the percentage difference is (45-10)/10 = 35/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that the customer's current tires are already in use for a certain period. Let me think of it as the repair option gives an additional year beyond their current lifespan. So the total lifespan is current lifespan plus one year.\n\nBut without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to end their useful life, so the repair gives one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them now. So, for the same period, perhaps four years.\n\nIf the customer buys new tires, they last four years. So the average is 45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs their current tires, which are about to end their lifespan, the repair would give one more year. So, for the same four-year period, the customer would have to repair once, paying $40, and the tires would last one additional year beyond their original four. So total lifespan is five years, but for the four-year period, they have the repaired tires for one year and the original for four? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose between:\n\nA) Buy new tires: 4-year lifespan, cost 180. Average per year: 45.\n\nB) Repair current tires: 1-year lifespan extension, cost 40. So the total lifespan is, say, 4 years (original) +1 year (repair) =5 years. So the average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nBut then the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100% = 35/8=4.375, so 437.5% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the question is considering the average cost per tire per year. So, for the new tire: 180/4=45.\n\nFor the repair: 40 per tire, which adds one year to the current lifespan. So the current lifespan before repair is, say, x years. After repair, it's x+1 years. So the average cost per year is 40/(x+1).\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is implying that the current tires are about to end their useful life, so x is zero. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and the repair adds one more, making it two years. So x=1, so average is 40/2=20.\n\nBut then the new tire is 45, so (45-20)/20=25/20=1.25, which is 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it in terms of the same period.\n\nSuppose the customer wants to have tires for four years. Option 1: buy new tires for 180, which last four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: repair their current tires for 40, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires were about to last three years, and after repair, they last four years. So for four years, the repair cost is 40, so average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo the new tire is 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (45-10)/10 = 350% increase. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done each year, adding one year each time. But that seems unlikely. The problem states it's a one-time repair adding one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are about to end their four-year lifespan. So the repair allows them to last one more year, making the lifespan five years. So the average cost is 40/5=8.\n\nSo new tire average is 45, repair is 8. So (45-8)/8 = 37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is considering the repair cost as part of the same period as the new tires. For example, the customer is considering a four-year period.\n\nIf they buy new tires, cost is 180, lasts four years. So average 45.\n\nIf they repair, it's a one-time cost of 40, which adds one year. So perhaps during the four-year period, they can repair once, and the tires last five years, but that's over five years. So the average per year for repair is 40/5=8.\n\nBut again, the percentage is 45 vs 8, which is 462.5%, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the customer is comparing the cost for the same period of time, say four years. So, for four years, the options are:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which adds one year. So, for four years, the customer would need to repair once, making the tires last five years, but they only need four. So the average per year is 40/4 =10. Because they have four years of use, the cost is 40, so 10 per year.\n\nSo, 45 vs 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10 = 3.5, which is 350% increase. Not an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 350%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which have been in use for three years. So without repair, they have one more year. With repair, two more years. So the total lifespan is four years (3+1=4 without repair, 3+2=5 with repair? No, wait, the repair adds one year, so if they're in use for three years, repair adds one more, making four years. So the total lifespan is four years, and the repair cost is $40. So average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo, new tires are 45, repair is 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10=350%, which is not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem is considering the repair as an alternative for the same lifespan. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is $40, and it gives one additional year, making the total lifespan four years. So the repair is done once, and the tires last four years. So the average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo new tires are 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (45-10)/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire. But the question is about average cost per year, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe tires, when purchased new, last four years. So new tires last four years.\n\nA customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, or have current tires repaired at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year.\n\nSo, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used beyond four years. Repairing them for $40 makes them last five years.\n\nSo the average cost per year for repair is 40/5=8.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100% = (37/8)*100% =4.625 *100% = 462.5%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, so without repair, they have one more year. With repair, two more years. So the total lifespan is four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years, average 10 per year.\n\nSo the new tire is 45, repair is 10. The increase is 350%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an alternative to replacing after one year. So the customer can either buy new tires for four years, or repair once and get one more year beyond what they'd get otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life beyond what they would have otherwise. So without repair, the tires would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. So the repair adds one year.\n\nSo, the cost for the repair is $40, which allows the tires to last an additional year. So the average cost per year is 40/1=40.\n\nSo new tires: 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40 per year.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100% = (5/40)*100% =12.5%.\n\nOh! That's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the repair adds one year, costing $40, so the average per year for that additional year is 40.\n\nNew tires, which last four years, average 45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' average is 45, repair is 40. The increase is (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tire costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, let's see. The problem says that when you buy new tires, they last four years. Each new tire costs $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, which adds one more year to their life. The question is asking by what percentage the average cost per year of the new tires is greater than the repair option.\n\nWait, so I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage difference. Let me get this straight.\n\nFirst, for the new tires. Each tire is $180 and lasts four years. So, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's $180 divided by 4. Let me compute that: 180 /4 is 45. So each year, the cost averages $45 per tire.\n\nNow, the repair option. The customer already has tires, and repairing them costs $40 per tire. This repair makes the tires last one more year. So, originally, I guess the tires were going to last three years before this repair? Or wait, no\u2014maybe the repair extends their life from four to five years? Or is the original lifespan something else?\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So if the customer is considering repair now, perhaps the tires are nearing the end of their useful life. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, which last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, making them last one additional year. So, the current tires' lifespan before repair is four years? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the new tires last four years when purchased. So if the customer is considering repair, perhaps their current tires are, say, three years old. So without repair, they have one year left. But the repair adds one more year, making it two years. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give the current age of the tires. So perhaps I should think about it in terms of what's the total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires are already in use for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. So maybe the key is that the repair adds one year to their current lifespan, regardless of how old they are. So the current tires have a certain lifespan, and the repair extends it by one year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time thing. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me think: If the customer buys new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, paying $40 per tire, which makes them last one more year. Wait, but how long did they last before? The problem says that new tires last four years, but that's when they are purchased. So maybe the current tires are already used for some time. Or perhaps the repair extends their lifespan from X years to X+1 years.\n\nWait, maybe the initial lifespan without repair is three years, and the repair makes them last four. But the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So the customer's current tires might be, say, three years old, and they would last one more year without repair. But if they repair them, they last two more years. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the customer is thinking about whether to buy new tires or repair the existing ones. So perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time and are about to need replacement, so the repair is an option to extend their life by one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the customer is comparing the two options for the same period. Like, if they buy new tires, they get four years of use, and if they repair, they get one additional year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year beyond their current lifespan, but what's that current lifespan? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as the average cost per year for the repair option. Let's think: Suppose the current tires are going to last X years without repair. Repairing them for $40 makes them last X+1 years.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say what X is. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the question says the new tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires were originally new, and the customer is thinking about whether to repair them or replace them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer has tires that are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used for another year, but with repair, they can last one more year. So the repair extends the lifespan from four years to five.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the customer's current tires have been used for four years and are at the end of their life. So without repair, they can't be used any longer. But if they repair them, they can get one more year of use.\n\nWait, but the problem says, \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the current tires, without repair, would last one year less than their maximum. Or perhaps, the repair adds an additional year beyond their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So if the current tires have, say, two years of life left, the repair would make them last three years. But the problem doesn't specify the current condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is implying that the customer has tires that are about to last for a certain period, and the repair adds one more year. But without knowing the current lifespan, it's hard to compute. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. The tires, when purchased new, last for four years. So if you buy them new, they last four years. So the customer is considering either buying new tires now, which will last four years, or repairing their current tires for $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year.\n\nSo perhaps the current tires have been in use for some time, and without repair, they have, say, one year left. So repair adds one more year. So the total lifespan with repair is two years. But without knowing how much life they have left, perhaps we can model it as the repair adds one year to the current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let's think of the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which makes them last one additional year. So the total lifespan after repair is, let's assume, the current lifespan plus one year. But wait, without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps I need to model this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in their fourth year, and without repair, they will last for one more year (so fifth year?), but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they can't be used beyond their current lifespan. But the repair adds one year to their lifespan.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is considering that the repair adds one year to the current lifespan, which is three years. So the repair makes them last four years. But that's not given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires, so the customer is considering whether to spend $40 now to get one more year, or $180 for four years.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the current tires have already been in use for some years. Let me think about the total cost over the same period. For example, the customer wants to have tires for a certain number of years, and wants to choose between buying new ones or repairing.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it for four years, the same as the new tires. So if the customer repairs their current tires, they can get one more year. So how does that fit into a four-year period?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are, say, three years old) to get one more year, making their total lifespan four years, or buy new tires for four years.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me think about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So the average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40. They last one additional year. So the repair cost is $40, and lifespan is increased by one year. But what's the original lifespan? Hmm. Without knowing that, it's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires, when purchased, last four years. So if the customer is considering whether to repair, maybe their current tires have been in use for three years. So without repair, they have one more year. With repair, they get two more years.\n\nSo the total lifespan for the repair option would be 3 + 2 = 5 years? Wait, but that's adding two years, not one. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years (so they are at the end of their useful life). Repairing them would make them last one more year. So the lifespan after repair is five years.\n\nWait, but if you buy new tires, they last four years. So the cost is $180 for four years. The repair is $40 for an additional year (total of five years). But that's not the same as four years. So comparing apples to apples, maybe I should compute the average cost per year for each option over the same period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is comparing the cost for the same period, say four years. So, for four years, they can either buy new tires for $180, which will cover four years, or repair their current tires and use them for four years.\n\nWait, but the repair only adds one year. So if the current tires have, say, three years of life left, then after repair, they'll last four years. So the average cost per year would be 40 /4 = $10. But wait, no, because the repair is a one-time cost. So the total cost is $40, which is spread over four years. So average is 10 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the original tires might have been free, but that's probably not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to spend $40 now to get one more year of use from their current tires, which would otherwise need to be replaced after one year. So without repair, they'd have one year of use, and then need to buy a new tire. With repair, they have two years of use.\n\nBut that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year of each option for the same period.\n\nLet me try to model it. Let's say the customer is trying to cover a period of five years.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires every four years. So in five years, they'd have to buy once and maybe a partial set, but perhaps we can model it as 5/4 = 1.25 sets. Hmm, but maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year for each option over their respective lifespans.\n\nSo, for new tires: cost is $180, lifespan 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nFor repair: cost is $40, lifespan is 1 additional year. So the average cost per year is 40/1 = $40.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if the current tires have been in use for some time, the repair is only adding one year. So perhaps the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 divided by the total lifespan after repair.\n\nWait, but if the current tires have already been used for, say, three years, and the repair adds one more year, making it four years. So the total cost for four years would be 40, so average per year is 10.\n\nWait, but that seems too low. So perhaps the current tires were bought new, and after four years, they are being considered for repair. So the customer has had the tires for four years, and without repair, they can't be used for another year. With repair, they can be used for one more year.\n\nSo, the total lifespan after repair is five years, and the cost is 40. So average per year is 40/5 = 8. But that would make the repair option cheaper, which seems possible.\n\nWait, but in that case, the average cost for new tires is 45 per year, and for repair it's 8 per year. That would make the new tires much more expensive, but the options don't have such a high percentage. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not modeling this correctly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair option is a one-time repair that allows the tire to last one more year beyond its original lifespan. So the original lifespan is four years, and with repair, it's five years.\n\nSo the total cost for the repair is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So average cost per year is 40 /5 = 8.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tire's average is 45, repair is 8. So the new tires are more expensive, but the question is asking by what percent the new tires' average is greater than the repair.\n\nWait, so the question is: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nSo, (45 - 8)/8 * 100% = (37/8)*100% = 4.625 * 100% = 462.5% greater. But that's not one of the options, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used for another year. With repair, they can be used for one more year. So the total lifespan is four years (original) plus one year (with repair) = five years.\n\nSo the total cost for the repair is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So the average cost per year is 40/5 = 8.\n\nWait, but that makes the new tire average 45, repair average 8. So the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 = 37/8 = 4.625, which is 462.5% higher. But that's not an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe problem says, \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the repair adds one more year to their current lifespan. So if the current tires are, say, three years old, the repair would make them last four years. So the total lifespan is four years, and the repair cost is $40.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 /4 = 10.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for the repair option, the average cost per year is 10.\n\nAnd the new tires have an average of 45 per year.\n\nSo, the question is: What percent greater is 45 than 10?\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((New - Original)/Original) *100%.\n\nSo, ((45-10)/10)*100% = (35/10)*100% = 3.5 *100% = 350% greater. But that's not an option either. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the average cost calculation for the repair option.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the customer's current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan. Without repair, they can't be used for another year. So the repair adds one year, making their lifespan five years. So the cost is $40, and the lifespan is five years. So average per year is 40/5 =8.\n\nBut then the new tire is 45 per year, which is way higher than 8, leading to a 462% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps the current tires are about to last for three years without repair, and the repair adds one year, making it four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years, so average is 40/4 =10.\n\nAh, that would make sense. So the repair option averages $10 per year, while the new tire is $45 per year.\n\nSo the percentage difference is (45-10)/10 = 35/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that the customer's current tires are already in use for a certain period. Let me think of it as the repair option gives an additional year beyond their current lifespan. So the total lifespan is current lifespan plus one year.\n\nBut without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to end their useful life, so the repair gives one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them now. So, for the same period, perhaps four years.\n\nIf the customer buys new tires, they last four years. So the average is 45 per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs their current tires, which are about to end their lifespan, the repair would give one more year. So, for the same four-year period, the customer would have to repair once, paying $40, and the tires would last one additional year beyond their original four. So total lifespan is five years, but for the four-year period, they have the repaired tires for one year and the original for four? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose between:\n\nA) Buy new tires: 4-year lifespan, cost 180. Average per year: 45.\n\nB) Repair current tires: 1-year lifespan extension, cost 40. So the total lifespan is, say, 4 years (original) +1 year (repair) =5 years. So the average cost per year is 40/5=8.\n\nBut then the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100% = 35/8=4.375, so 437.5% increase, which isn't an option.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is per tire, and the question is considering the average cost per tire per year. So, for the new tire: 180/4=45.\n\nFor the repair: 40 per tire, which adds one year to the current lifespan. So the current lifespan before repair is, say, x years. After repair, it's x+1 years. So the average cost per year is 40/(x+1).\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is implying that the current tires are about to end their useful life, so x is zero. That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and the repair adds one more, making it two years. So x=1, so average is 40/2=20.\n\nBut then the new tire is 45, so (45-20)/20=25/20=1.25, which is 125% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it in terms of the same period.\n\nSuppose the customer wants to have tires for four years. Option 1: buy new tires for 180, which last four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: repair their current tires for 40, which makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the current tires were about to last three years, and after repair, they last four years. So for four years, the repair cost is 40, so average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo the new tire is 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (45-10)/10 = 350% increase. But again, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Maybe the repair is done each year, adding one year each time. But that seems unlikely. The problem states it's a one-time repair adding one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are about to end their four-year lifespan. So the repair allows them to last one more year, making the lifespan five years. So the average cost is 40/5=8.\n\nSo new tire average is 45, repair is 8. So (45-8)/8 = 37/8=4.625, which is 462.5% increase. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is considering the repair cost as part of the same period as the new tires. For example, the customer is considering a four-year period.\n\nIf they buy new tires, cost is 180, lasts four years. So average 45.\n\nIf they repair, it's a one-time cost of 40, which adds one year. So perhaps during the four-year period, they can repair once, and the tires last five years, but that's over five years. So the average per year for repair is 40/5=8.\n\nBut again, the percentage is 45 vs 8, which is 462.5%, not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is done each year, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the customer is comparing the cost for the same period of time, say four years. So, for four years, the options are:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. So average per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each, which adds one year. So, for four years, the customer would need to repair once, making the tires last five years, but they only need four. So the average per year is 40/4 =10. Because they have four years of use, the cost is 40, so 10 per year.\n\nSo, 45 vs 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10 = 3.5, which is 350% increase. Not an option.\n\nBut the options don't include 350%, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which have been in use for three years. So without repair, they have one more year. With repair, two more years. So the total lifespan is four years (3+1=4 without repair, 3+2=5 with repair? No, wait, the repair adds one year, so if they're in use for three years, repair adds one more, making four years. So the total lifespan is four years, and the repair cost is $40. So average per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo, new tires are 45, repair is 10. The percentage increase is (45-10)/10=350%, which is not an option.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the problem is considering the repair as an alternative for the same lifespan. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair cost is $40, and it gives one additional year, making the total lifespan four years. So the repair is done once, and the tires last four years. So the average cost per year is 40/4=10.\n\nSo new tires are 45, repair is 10. So the increase is (45-10)/10=3.5, which is 350% increase. Not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the cost per tire. But the question is about average cost per year, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something in the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe tires, when purchased new, last four years. So new tires last four years.\n\nA customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, or have current tires repaired at $40 each, which makes the current tires last one additional year.\n\nSo, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to end their four-year lifespan. So without repair, they can't be used beyond four years. Repairing them for $40 makes them last five years.\n\nSo the average cost per year for repair is 40/5=8.\n\nNew tires: 180/4=45.\n\nSo the percentage increase is (45-8)/8 *100% = (37/8)*100% =4.625 *100% = 462.5%. Not an option.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have been in use for three years, so without repair, they have one more year. With repair, two more years. So the total lifespan is four years. So the repair cost is $40 for four years, average 10 per year.\n\nSo the new tire is 45, repair is 10. The increase is 350%, which is not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an alternative to replacing after one year. So the customer can either buy new tires for four years, or repair once and get one more year beyond what they'd get otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life beyond what they would have otherwise. So without repair, the tires would last one more year, and with repair, they last two more years. So the repair adds one year.\n\nSo, the cost for the repair is $40, which allows the tires to last an additional year. So the average cost per year is 40/1=40.\n\nSo new tires: 45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40 per year.\n\nSo the new tires are 45, repair is 40. So the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100% = (5/40)*100% =12.5%.\n\nOh! That's option C.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the repair adds one year, costing $40, so the average per year for that additional year is 40.\n\nNew tires, which last four years, average 45 per year.\n\nSo the new tires' average is 45, repair is 40. The increase is (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The formula for percentage increase is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Original Value}}{\\text{Original Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe average cost per year of new tires is **12.5%** greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\n**Answer: C**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and their costs over time. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking about the average cost per year for new tires compared to repairing the current ones, and by what percentage the new tires' cost is higher.\n\nAlright, let's see. The new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. So if I buy new tires, I spend $180 upfront, and they'll last me four years. So the total cost is $180 for four years. To find the average cost per year, I guess I divide the total cost by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 \u00f7 4 = 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, the other option is to repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire and adds one more year of life. So the customer already has some tires, right? They can repair them for $40 each, making them last an extra year. Wait, but how many times can they do this? Because each repair adds a year, but the original tires probably have some life left. Oh, wait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. But the current tires are presumably already in use, so maybe they have some years left? Or is the repair an alternative to buying new ones?\n\nWait, the question says \"current tires can be repaired for $40 each, making them last one additional year.\" So if I repair, each repair gives an extra year. But how many times can you repair them? Because each repair adds a year, but each repair is $40. Wait, maybe each repair is done each year, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, so you can repair once to get one more year, or multiple times?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the problem again. \"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the current tires are already on the car. If he repairs them, each repair adds one more year. So, for example, if the tires are already two years old, repairing them would make them last for three more years (since each repair adds one year). But wait, the problem says the new tires last four years. So maybe the current tires are, say, four years old, and can't be repaired anymore? Or perhaps the current tires have some remaining life, and each repair adds one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are of the same brand, but the question doesn't specify how old they are. Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to wear out. Or perhaps the customer is thinking of whether to replace them now or repair them.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has tires that are four years old, and if he doesn't repair, they will last another year (total five years), but he can repair them for $40 each to get one more year. Or maybe each repair adds a year regardless of their current condition. Hmm, perhaps each repair is an option that can be done each year, but that seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is a one-time thing. Let's think of it this way: if I have a tire that would normally last four years, if I repair it once, it lasts five years. But each repair costs $40.\n\nWait, but the problem says the customer can choose between buying new tires or repairing the current ones. So perhaps the current tires are still in their original four-year lifespan, and the customer is deciding whether to replace them now or repair them to get an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the customer is considering whether to replace them now or repair them. Let me model it.\n\nSuppose the customer has tires that have been used for X years. But the problem doesn't specify X. Hmm, perhaps we can assume that the customer is at the point where the current tires are about to need replacement, so X is four years. So, if he buys new tires, he'll have four more years. Alternatively, he can repair the current tires, which would extend their life by one year, making them last for X+1=5 years.\n\nBut wait, the cost of repair is $40 per tire. So if he has four tires, each repair is $40. So if he repairs all four, that's 4 x $40 = $160, and the tires last one more year (so five years in total). Alternatively, if he buys new tires, it's 4 x $180 = $720, and they last four years.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year for each option. Let's calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nFirst, new tires: total cost is $180 per tire, so for four tires, it's 4 * 180 = $720. These tires last four years, so the average cost per year is 720 / 4 = $180 per year per tire? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nWait, so maybe we're considering each tire's cost over its lifespan, and comparing the average per year cost of new tires versus the average per year cost of repaired tires.\n\nSo, for new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year per tire is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: the customer can repair his current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So, if the current tires are, say, four years old, each repair would give them one more year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. So perhaps the current tires are in their last year, so they'd last one more year without repair. But if you repair them, they'll last two more years? Or is each repair adding one year, regardless of their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already four years old and about to wear out. So without repair, they'd last one more year (total five years). But if the customer chooses to repair, he can get an extra year, making the total lifespan five years. But each repair is $40 per tire. So for four tires, that's 4*40 = $160. So the total cost is $160 for five years. So the average cost per year is 160 /5 = $32 per year.\n\nWait, but this is assuming that the customer can repair the tires once to add one year. So the original lifespan is four years, and with one repair, it's five years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer can choose to repair each year, but that seems unlikely. The problem states that each repair adds one additional year, but perhaps it's a one-time repair.\n\nSo, let me model the two options:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires.\n- Cost: 4 tires * $180 = $720.\n- Lifespan: 4 years.\n- Average cost per year: 720 /4 = $180/year.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires\". Oh wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Each tire is $180, so the cost per tire per year is 180/4 = $45. So if the customer has four tires, the total cost is 4*180=720, but the average cost per year per tire is 45. So the total per year is 4*45=180. But wait, the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nWait, the question is: \"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nSo, for each tire, the average cost per year is $45 for the new tire. For the repaired tire, the average cost is lower.\n\nBut wait, the current tires are being repaired. Let's model that.\n\nIf the customer repairs the current tires, each repair costs $40 and adds one year. So, for each tire, the repair adds one year. So, the total cost for each tire when repaired is the repair cost plus the original cost? Or is the original cost zero?\n\nWait, the original cost isn't mentioned for the current tires. The question states that the customer can either buy new tires or repair current ones. So perhaps the current tires are already paid for, and the only cost is the repair. Or maybe the current tires have some residual value. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can ignore it.\n\nSo, for the repair option, each tire is repaired for $40, which gives an extra year. So, for each tire, the cost is $40, and it lasts one additional year.\n\nWait, but how many years does the tire last after repair? Suppose the tire was going to last for x years, and the repair adds one more year. But without knowing x, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to wear out, so x=0. So each repair adds one year. So, for each tire, the repair cost is $40 for one extra year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the tire would last one year after repair. So the total lifespan is one year, and the cost is $40. So the average cost per year is 40 /1 = $40 per year.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. The original tires, when purchased new, last four years. So the current tires are four years old, and without repair, they have no life left. So if the customer chooses to repair, each tire is repaired for $40, and that makes them last one more year. So each tire, after repair, lasts one more year, so one year per tire. So, for each tire, the cost is $40, and it's used for one year. So average cost per year is 40 /1 = $40.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the current tires have some remaining life. Wait, if the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones, perhaps the current tires are still in use and have some lifespan left. For example, if they're two years old, without repair, they'd last two more years. But the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires are four years old and about to wear out. So, without repair, they'd last for zero more years. But with repair, each tire is good for one more year. So each repair adds one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires have one year of life left, and repairing them adds one more year, making it two years. But without knowing how old they are, this is unclear.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think in terms of the total cost and total lifespan for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires.\n- Cost: 4 tires * $180 = $720.\n- Lifespan: 4 years.\n- Average cost per year: 720 /4 = $180 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires.\n- Cost: 4 tires * $40 = $160.\n- Lifespan: Each repair adds one year. So if the current tires are already four years old, they would have zero life left without repair. With one repair, they last one more year. So the lifespan is 1 year.\n- Average cost per year: 160 /1 = $160 per year.\n\nWait, that can't be right because then the new tires are more expensive, but the question is about the new tires' average cost being higher than the repair. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires can be repaired multiple times to add multiple years. But the problem says each repair adds one additional year. So maybe each time you repair, you add another year, but each repair is $40 per tire.\n\nWait, maybe the customer can repair the tires each year, but that seems impractical. Alternatively, perhaps each repair extends the tire's life by one year beyond its original four. But the problem states that a repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps each repair adds one year, but you can't repair them multiple times beyond that. Or perhaps each repair is a one-time thing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair the current ones once, which adds one year. But the problem doesn't specify the current age of the tires, so maybe we can assume that the current tires are four years old and about to wear out. So, without repair, they'd last for zero more years. With one repair, they last one more year.\n\nSo, for the repair option, the customer pays $40 per tire, so $160 total, and the tires last one more year. So the average cost per year is 160 /1 = $160 per year.\n\nWait, but that seems way more than the new tires' average. Because new tires are $720 for four years, which averages to $180 per year, but the repair is $160 per year. So the new tires are more expensive, but the question is about how much higher the average cost is. Wait, but according to this calculation, the new tires average $180 per year, the repair option is $160 per year. So the new tires are more expensive by (180 -160)/160 *100% = 20/160=0.125=12.5%.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires are 12.5% more expensive than the repair option. But wait, the question is phrased as \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nSo in this case, 180 is 12.5% higher than 160. Because 160 * 1.125 = 180.\n\nSo the percentage is 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake in the average cost calculation.\n\nFor the new tires: total cost $720, four years. 720 /4 = 180 per year.\n\nFor the repair: total cost $160, one year. 160 /1 = 160 per year.\n\nSo the difference is 180 - 160 = 20.\n\nTo find what percent 20 is of 160: (20/160)*100 = 12.5%.\n\nSo the average cost per year for new tires is 12.5% greater than the repair option.\n\nSo the answer should be C) 12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tires and their costs over time. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking about the average cost per year for new tires compared to repairing the current ones, and by what percentage the new tires' cost is higher.\n\nAlright, let's see. The new tires cost $180 each and last for four years. So if I buy new tires, I spend $180 upfront, and they'll last me four years. So the total cost is $180 for four years. To find the average cost per year, I guess I divide the total cost by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 \u00f7 4 = 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, the other option is to repair the current tires. Each repair costs $40 per tire and adds one more year of life. So the customer already has some tires, right? They can repair them for $40 each, making them last an extra year. Wait, but how many times can they do this? Because each repair adds a year, but the original tires probably have some life left. Oh, wait, the problem says when purchased new, the tires last four years. But the current tires are presumably already in use, so maybe they have some years left? Or is the repair an alternative to buying new ones?\n\nWait, the question says \"current tires can be repaired for $40 each, making them last one additional year.\" So if I repair, each repair gives an extra year. But how many times can you repair them? Because each repair adds a year, but each repair is $40. Wait, maybe each repair is done each year, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps each repair extends the life by one year, so you can repair once to get one more year, or multiple times?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the problem again. \"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo, the current tires are already on the car. If he repairs them, each repair adds one more year. So, for example, if the tires are already two years old, repairing them would make them last for three more years (since each repair adds one year). But wait, the problem says the new tires last four years. So maybe the current tires are, say, four years old, and can't be repaired anymore? Or perhaps the current tires have some remaining life, and each repair adds one year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are of the same brand, but the question doesn't specify how old they are. Hmm. Maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are about to wear out. Or perhaps the customer is thinking of whether to replace them now or repair them.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer has tires that are four years old, and if he doesn't repair, they will last another year (total five years), but he can repair them for $40 each to get one more year. Or maybe each repair adds a year regardless of their current condition. Hmm, perhaps each repair is an option that can be done each year, but that seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is a one-time thing. Let's think of it this way: if I have a tire that would normally last four years, if I repair it once, it lasts five years. But each repair costs $40.\n\nWait, but the problem says the customer can choose between buying new tires or repairing the current ones. So perhaps the current tires are still in their original four-year lifespan, and the customer is deciding whether to replace them now or repair them to get an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the customer is considering whether to replace them now or repair them. Let me model it.\n\nSuppose the customer has tires that have been used for X years. But the problem doesn't specify X. Hmm, perhaps we can assume that the customer is at the point where the current tires are about to need replacement, so X is four years. So, if he buys new tires, he'll have four more years. Alternatively, he can repair the current tires, which would extend their life by one year, making them last for X+1=5 years.\n\nBut wait, the cost of repair is $40 per tire. So if he has four tires, each repair is $40. So if he repairs all four, that's 4 x $40 = $160, and the tires last one more year (so five years in total). Alternatively, if he buys new tires, it's 4 x $180 = $720, and they last four years.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year for each option. Let's calculate the average cost per year for both options.\n\nFirst, new tires: total cost is $180 per tire, so for four tires, it's 4 * 180 = $720.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tire costs and figuring out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. So the question is asking, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I need to find the average cost per year for both options and then see how much greater the new tire cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nLet me tackle the new tires first. If each tire costs $180 and lasts four years, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180/4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow for the repair option. The customer can repair the current tires for $40 each, and this makes them last one extra year. Wait, the original lifespan isn't given, but I think the new tires last four years when purchased new. So the current tires, if not repaired, probably last three years? Or does the repair extend the life of the current tires beyond their original lifespan? Hmm, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. But the customer already has some tires and is considering repair. So if the customer has current tires, and repairs them for $40 each, they last one more year. So perhaps the original tires were going to last three years, and repair makes them last four?\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last four years. The customer's current tires are presumably older. So if they repair their current tires, they'll last one more year beyond their original lifespan. Wait, maybe the current tires have already been used for some time. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So if the customer buys new tires, they get four years of use. If they repair their current tires, it's a $40 cost per tire and each repair adds one more year. So perhaps the current tires were going to last three years, and with repair, they last four? Or maybe the repair gives them an additional year beyond whatever they have left.\n\nWait, the problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires or repair current ones. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. Let me think: when the customer buys new tires, they last four years. So the current tires are, say, three years old, and the customer is deciding whether to repair them for an extra year or buy new.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me read it again. It says the customer can repair the current tires at $40 each, and the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires would have lasted, say, three years without repair, and with repair, they last four. Or maybe without repair, they'd only last one more year, but with repair, they last two more years? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they won't last another year. So with repair, they'll last one more year. Alternatively, perhaps the original lifespan is four years, but if the customer repairs them, they add one more year beyond that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the new tires are four years lifespan. The repair extends the current tires' life by one year. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they'd last one more year. With repair, they last two more years? Or does the repair make the current tires last four years in total?\n\nWait, the problem states that the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So maybe, without repair, they would not last any longer, but with repair, they last one more year. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires have some life left, and the repair adds one year to that.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit unclear. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think in terms of cost per year.\n\nFor the new tires, it's $180 for four years, so average cost per year is $45, as I calculated earlier.\n\nFor the repair option, the customer pays $40 per tire. But how many years does that cover? The problem says the repair makes the tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires are about to fail after, say, n years, and the repair extends that by one. So the total lifespan after repair is n+1 years. But without knowing n, how can I compute the average cost?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are already three years old and will only last one more year without repair. So repairing them adds one more year, making their total lifespan four years. So for the repair option, the cost is $40, and the lifespan is four years.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year. Repairing them adds one more year, making it four years total.\n\nWait, so the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan becomes four years. So the average cost per year is 40/4 = $10 per year.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So for the new tire option, average cost is $45 per year. For the repair option, it's $10 per year. Wait, no, that can't be right because 45 is much higher than 10. The question asks, the average cost of new tires is what percent greater than the repair cost. So that would be (45 -10)/10 *100% = 350% increase? But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the repair. Let me reread the problem.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nSo the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps without repair, the current tires would not last any more years, but with repair, they last one more year. So the lifespan is one year. So the average cost per year would be $40/1 = $40 per year. But that's even higher.\n\nWait, that can't be, because then the new tires at $45 per year would be more expensive than the repair option at $40. But the question is about the new tires' average cost being higher than the repair.\n\nWait, that would make the new tires more expensive, but the options don't include 12.5% as the correct answer for 45 vs 40. Wait, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40? Let me calculate that. (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%. Oh, so that's option C.\n\nBut wait, if the repair makes the current tires last one additional year, how long do they last in total? If they're already being used, maybe the current tires have some years left, but perhaps the problem is considering the current tires as if they're about to fail, and the repair gives them one more year.\n\nSo for example, without repair, they would last 0 years (they are about to fail), and with repair, they last 1 year. So the average cost per year would be $40 /1 = $40.\n\nIn that case, the new tires are $45 per year, which is 45/40 = 1.125, so 12.5% higher. So the answer would be C)12.5%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the current tires have already been used for a few years, but without repair, they would last one more year. So the total lifespan is, say, n years, and with repair, it's n+1. But the problem says \"current tires\" \u2013 perhaps the customer has tires that are, say, three years old, and without repair, they'd last one more year. Repairing them would make them last two more years? Or is it that the repair adds one year to their current lifespan?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is assuming that the current tires have already been in use for a certain period, but it's not specified. So perhaps the intended interpretation is that the repair adds one year, making the total lifespan of the current tires four years (since new tires last four). So the cost is $40, lifespan is four years, average cost per year is 40/4 = 10. Then the new tires are 45/10 = 4.5 times higher, which is 350% increase. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires would last three years without repair, and the repair makes them last four. So the average cost per year for repair is 40/4 =10, and for new it's 45. Then the percentage increase is (45-10)/10=350%, which again isn't an option.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the problem differently. The customer has current tires. They can either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair the current ones for $40 each, which will make them last one more year.\n\nWait, does that mean that the current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they'll last one more year? So with repair, they last two years? Or perhaps the current tires are already in their third year and will last one more without repair, but with repair, they'll last two more? Hmm, but the problem says the repair makes them last for one additional year, so perhaps without repair, they'd last zero more years (they're about to fail), and with repair, they last one more year.\n\nWait, that's probably the intended interpretation. So the current tires are about to stop being usable, and the repair gives them one more year. So the repair cost is $40, and the lifespan is one year. So the average cost is $40 per year.\n\nIn that case, the new tires are $45 per year, which is 12.5% higher than $40. Because (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer would be option C)12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tire costs and figuring out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. So the question is asking, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, I need to find the average cost per year for both options and then see how much greater the new tire cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nLet me tackle the new tires first. If each tire costs $180 and lasts four years, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180/4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow for the repair option. The customer can repair the current tires for $40 each, and this makes them last one extra year. Wait, the original lifespan isn't given, but I think the new tires last four years when purchased new. So the current tires, if not repaired, probably last three years? Or does the repair extend the life of the current tires beyond their original lifespan? Hmm, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. But the customer already has some tires and is considering repair. So if the customer has current tires, and repairs them for $40 each, they last one more year. So perhaps the original tires were going to last three years, and repair makes them last four?\n\nWait, the problem says the new tires last four years.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this repair will make those tires last one extra year. Wait, so if the tires are already being used, maybe they have some life left? Or is the repair adding one year to their current lifespan?\n\nWait, the question says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are, say, three years old, and the customer is considering whether to replace them or repair them. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Oh wait, maybe I don't need that. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So the repair gives the tires an additional year. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, repairing them would make them last four years total. But maybe the problem isn't about the current age, just about the cost per year. Wait, the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. So I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost.\n\nLet me think: For new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is total cost divided by the number of years. So that would be $180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option, the customer pays $40 per tire. But how many years does this repair extend? The problem says it makes the current tires last for one additional year. Wait, does that mean the tires will last one more year beyond their current lifespan, or does it add one year to the existing lifespan? I think it's the latter. So if the current tires are, say, X years old, the repair will make them last X+1 years. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how old the tires are. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is intended to extend the life by one year beyond what's left. But without knowing the current age, maybe the problem is assuming that the repair is adding one year to the tire's life, regardless of their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair extends their life by one year. So, for example, if the current tires are two years old, and they're repaired, they'll last three more years, making the total lifespan five years. But without knowing the initial lifespan, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done on tires that have already been in use, and adding one year to their life. But this complicates things because the average cost per year would depend on how much time the tire has already been used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. It's about the cost per year when you choose to repair versus buy new. Let me think about the two options in terms of total lifespan and cost.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each. Each tire lasts 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each. The repair makes them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan left, but the repair adds one year. But without knowing their current lifespan, I can't calculate the average cost per year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to fail and need replacement, so repairing them would extend their life by one year beyond that. So for example, if the current tires are about to be used for 3 more years (so total 4 years if bought new), but by repairing, they can be used for 4 more years instead of 3? Or maybe the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are, say, three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years. But if repaired, they last two more years, making the total lifespan five years? Or perhaps the current tires are nearing the end of their life, and the repair adds one year. But without knowing the exact current lifespan, I can't calculate the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is intended to have the repair cost and new cost compared in terms of the same number of years. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair. So perhaps, for each tire, the new tire is a four-year lifespan, costing $180, so $45 per year. The repair is $40 per tire, and adds one year. So perhaps, if you repair, the tire now lasts one more year, but what's the total cost and how many years do you get?\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires are, say, three years old. If you repair, they last four years. So the total lifespan becomes four years, but you're paying $40 for that extra year. But in terms of cost per year, the total cost for four years would be the original cost plus the repair cost, but wait, the original cost isn't given. Oh wait, maybe the customer is only considering the repair cost, not the original cost of the tires.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is choosing between replacing the tires now for $180, which gives four years of use, or repairing the current tires for $40, which allows them to last one more year. So the current tires are about to last for, say, three more years, but if repaired, they last four more years.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the current remaining lifespan of the tires. Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the repair as adding one year beyond what they would have had otherwise. So without repair, the tires would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years.\n\nBut without knowing the original lifespan, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the repair adds one year, and the average cost is calculated over that one year. But that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years, so it's about the average cost over four years. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you repair, the tire lasts for one more year beyond its current lifespan. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, the repair would make them last four years. But perhaps the average cost per year is calculated based on the extended lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me re-express the problem:\n\n- New tires: $180 each, last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\n- Repair: $40 each, makes current tires last one additional year. So, if the customer chooses repair, how does that affect the average cost?\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and get one more year of use from the current tires. But how long would the current tires have lasted without repair? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but for the same number of years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last for, say, three years, but with repair, they last four years. Or maybe without repair, they would last for four years, but repair adds another year, making it five. But without knowing, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the repair cost is $40 per tire, and each repair adds one year of life. So if the customer repairs, the tire can be used for an additional year beyond its original lifespan. But the original lifespan is four years when new. So perhaps, if the tires are new, you can repair them to last five years. But the question is about the customer's choice: buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year.\n\nWait, but if the customer is considering their current tires, perhaps the current tires are already, say, three years old, and the repair would make them last four years. So the total lifespan from now would be four years, but the cost is $40. Alternatively, buying new tires would give four years from now. So in that case, for each tire, the cost per year would be:\n\nRepair: $40 for four years. So average cost is 40 /4 = $10 per year.\n\nNew tires: $180 for four years. So average is 45 per year.\n\nSo the question is, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the repair cost?\n\nSo 45 is what percent greater than 10.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase: ((45 -10)/10)*100 = (35/10)*100=350%. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nHmm, that suggests I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which would have had some lifespan left. So, for example, the current tires are two years old, and would last two more years, making four years. If repaired, they last three more years, making five. So the repair cost is $40, and the tire is used for three more years. So the average cost per year is 40/3 \u224813.33. But then new tires are 45 per year.\n\nSo 45 compared to 13.33 is ((45-13.33)/13.33)*100 = (31.67/13.33)*100 \u2248 238%, which isn't an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which are about to last for one more year. So the repair extends that to two years. So the cost is $40 for two years. So average cost is 20 per year.\n\nNew tires cost 45 per year. So 45 vs 20.\n\nPercentage increase: (45-20)/20 *100 = 25/20 *100=125%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which have already been used for three years, making them last four years total. So the cost is 40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the four years would be (original cost +40)/4. But the original cost isn't given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done once, adding one year, and that's the only repair. So for the same number of years, say four years, the cost would be 180 for new tires, or 40 for repair plus whatever the original cost was. But without knowing the original cost, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the cost per year as 45 for new, and 40 added for an extra year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair gives an additional year, so the tire is used for one more year. So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 spread over that one additional year, so 40 per year. But that can't be, because the new tire is 45 per year. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40? Because (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 =12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\nNew tires: $180 for four years \u2192 45 per year.\n\nRepair: $40 for one year \u2192 40 per year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So the average for new is 45, and the average for repair is 40. So 45 is what percent higher than 40.\n\nSo, (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%.\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the repair adds one year, but if the customer repairs, do they get one more year on top of the current lifespan, or does the repair itself just add one year beyond some point?\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (4 years for 180) or repair their current tires (which would last one more year for 40). So the repair gives one additional year. So the repair's average cost per year is 40/1 =40, and the new tires is 180/4=45. So the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40.\n\nSo (45-40)/40= 5/40= 0.125=12.5%, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the way the problem is phrased, the repair is for the current tires, which may have some life left. So maybe the repair is adding one year to the current lifespan, making the total lifespan longer. But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the two options based on the same number of years. But maybe the problem is simply comparing the cost per year for the new tire (45) and the cost per year for the repair (40), making the percentage difference 12.5%.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is C)12.5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $180 per tire.  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years.  \n   - Average cost per year:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$ per year}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $40 per tire.  \n   - Lifespan extension: 1 additional year.  \n   - Since the repair extends the lifespan by 1 year, the average cost per year is:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$ per year}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Percentage Increase**:  \n   The question asks how much greater the average cost per year of new tires is compared to repairing the current tires.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that new tires last for four years and cost $180 each. Alternatively, the customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this repair will make those tires last one extra year. Wait, so if the tires are already being used, maybe they have some life left? Or is the repair adding one year to their current lifespan?\n\nWait, the question says when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires are, say, three years old, and the customer is considering whether to replace them or repair them. But the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Oh wait, maybe I don't need that. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe customer can choose to buy new tires at $180 each, which last four years. Or repair current tires at $40 each, which extends their life by one year. So the repair gives the tires an additional year. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, repairing them would make them last four years total. But maybe the problem isn't about the current age, just about the cost per year. Wait, the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to repairing.\n\nWait, no. The question is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. So I think I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage increase from the repair cost to the new tire cost.\n\nLet me think: For new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is total cost divided by the number of years. So that would be $180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option, the customer pays $40 per tire. But how many years does this repair extend? The problem says it makes the current tires last for one additional year. Wait, does that mean the tires will last one more year beyond their current lifespan, or does it add one year to the existing lifespan? I think it's the latter. So if the current tires are, say, X years old, the repair will make them last X+1 years. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how old the tires are. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is intended to extend the life by one year beyond what's left. But without knowing the current age, maybe the problem is assuming that the repair is adding one year to the tire's life, regardless of their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use, and the repair extends their life by one year. So, for example, if the current tires are two years old, and they're repaired, they'll last three more years, making the total lifespan five years. But without knowing the initial lifespan, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done on tires that have already been in use, and adding one year to their life. But this complicates things because the average cost per year would depend on how much time the tire has already been used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. It's about the cost per year when you choose to repair versus buy new. Let me think about the two options in terms of total lifespan and cost.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180 each. Each tire lasts 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40 each. The repair makes them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan left, but the repair adds one year. But without knowing their current lifespan, I can't calculate the average cost per year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that the current tires are about to fail and need replacement, so repairing them would extend their life by one year beyond that. So for example, if the current tires are about to be used for 3 more years (so total 4 years if bought new), but by repairing, they can be used for 4 more years instead of 3? Or maybe the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are, say, three years old, and without repair, they would last one more year, making four years. But if repaired, they last two more years, making the total lifespan five years? Or perhaps the current tires are nearing the end of their life, and the repair adds one year. But without knowing the exact current lifespan, I can't calculate the average cost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is intended to have the repair cost and new cost compared in terms of the same number of years. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair. So perhaps, for each tire, the new tire is a four-year lifespan, costing $180, so $45 per year. The repair is $40 per tire, and adds one year. So perhaps, if you repair, the tire now lasts one more year, but what's the total cost and how many years do you get?\n\nWait, perhaps the original tires are, say, three years old. If you repair, they last four years. So the total lifespan becomes four years, but you're paying $40 for that extra year. But in terms of cost per year, the total cost for four years would be the original cost plus the repair cost, but wait, the original cost isn't given. Oh wait, maybe the customer is only considering the repair cost, not the original cost of the tires.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is choosing between replacing the tires now for $180, which gives four years of use, or repairing the current tires for $40, which allows them to last one more year. So the current tires are about to last for, say, three more years, but if repaired, they last four more years.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the current remaining lifespan of the tires. Hmm. So perhaps the problem is considering the repair as adding one year beyond what they would have had otherwise. So without repair, the tires would last, say, three years, and with repair, four years.\n\nBut without knowing the original lifespan, perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the repair adds one year, and the average cost is calculated over that one year. But that doesn't make sense because the new tires last four years, so it's about the average cost over four years. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you repair, the tire lasts for one more year beyond its current lifespan. So if the current tires are, for example, three years old, the repair would make them last four years. But perhaps the average cost per year is calculated based on the extended lifespan.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me re-express the problem:\n\n- New tires: $180 each, last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45.\n\n- Repair: $40 each, makes current tires last one additional year. So, if the customer chooses repair, how does that affect the average cost?\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new tires. So if the customer repairs, they pay $40 and get one more year of use from the current tires. But how long would the current tires have lasted without repair? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the repair is an alternative to buying new, but for the same number of years.\n\nWait, perhaps the customer's current tires are about to fail, and without repair, they would last for, say, three years, but with repair, they last four years. Or maybe without repair, they would last for four years, but repair adds another year, making it five. But without knowing, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the repair cost is $40 per tire, and each repair adds one year of life. So if the customer repairs, the tire can be used for an additional year beyond its original lifespan. But the original lifespan is four years when new. So perhaps, if the tires are new, you can repair them to last five years. But the question is about the customer's choice: buy new tires for $180 each, which last four years, or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year.\n\nWait, but if the customer is considering their current tires, perhaps the current tires are already, say, three years old, and the repair would make them last four years. So the total lifespan from now would be four years, but the cost is $40. Alternatively, buying new tires would give four years from now. So in that case, for each tire, the cost per year would be:\n\nRepair: $40 for four years. So average cost is 40 /4 = $10 per year.\n\nNew tires: $180 for four years. So average is 45 per year.\n\nSo the question is, the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the repair cost?\n\nSo 45 is what percent greater than 10.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase: ((45 -10)/10)*100 = (35/10)*100=350%. But that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the options are 8%,10%,12.5%,16.7%,25%.\n\nHmm, that suggests I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which would have had some lifespan left. So, for example, the current tires are two years old, and would last two more years, making four years. If repaired, they last three more years, making five. So the repair cost is $40, and the tire is used for three more years. So the average cost per year is 40/3 \u224813.33. But then new tires are 45 per year.\n\nSo 45 compared to 13.33 is ((45-13.33)/13.33)*100 = (31.67/13.33)*100 \u2248 238%, which isn't an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which are about to last for one more year. So the repair extends that to two years. So the cost is $40 for two years. So average cost is 20 per year.\n\nNew tires cost 45 per year. So 45 vs 20.\n\nPercentage increase: (45-20)/20 *100 = 25/20 *100=125%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is adding one year to the current tires, which have already been used for three years, making them last four years total. So the cost is 40 for one additional year. So the average cost per year for the four years would be (original cost +40)/4. But the original cost isn't given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done once, adding one year, and that's the only repair. So for the same number of years, say four years, the cost would be 180 for new tires, or 40 for repair plus whatever the original cost was.

So the average cost per year for the repair would be 40 spread over that one additional year, so 40 per year. But that can't be, because the new tire is 45 per year. So 45 is 12.5% higher than 40? Because (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 =12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So:\n\nNew tires: $180 for four years \u2192 45 per year.\n\nRepair: $40 for one year \u2192 40 per year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So the average for new is 45, and the average for repair is 40. So 45 is what percent higher than 40.\n\nSo, (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%.\n\nWhich is option C.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the repair adds one year, but if the customer repairs, do they get one more year on top of the current lifespan, or does the repair itself just add one year beyond some point?\n\nWait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires (4 years for 180) or repair their current tires (which would last one more year for 40).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that new tires last for four years. The cost for each new tire is $180. On the other hand, repairing the current tires costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one additional year. So, if the tires were already in use, repairing them would make them last one more year instead of being replaced right away.\n\nWait, the question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So I need to calculate the average annual cost for both options and then find out what percentage greater the new tires' cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nLet me think about each option separately.\n\nStarting with the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts for four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's straightforward: $180 / 4 years. Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, the repair option: The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes the tires last one more year. Wait, but how long were the tires in use before the repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. But if the customer is considering repair, it's probably after some initial period.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again. It says a customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 or have the current tires repaired for $40, which makes them last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use for a certain time. Oh, maybe the repair is an alternative to replacing them. Let's assume that the current tires have been used for some time and are now being considered for repair or replacement.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Maybe the customer is looking at two options: either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair the current tires, which would make them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and repairing them would make them last one more (total four years), but that's just a guess. Or maybe it's a general case where the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model both options based on their total lifespan and cost.\n\nLet me restate the problem: For each tire, the options are:\n\n1. Buy a new tire for $180, which will last 4 years.\n\n2. Repair the current tire for $40, which will make it last one additional year.\n\nWait, but when is the repair done? Let's assume that the current tire has been in use for a certain period, but perhaps the repair is done when the tire is about to fail, extending its life by one year. Alternatively, maybe the repair is an alternative to replacing the tire immediately, allowing it to last longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's consider each option's average cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180, life is 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tire. Cost is $40, life is extended by 1 year. So, how long does the tire last after repair? Let's see. If the tire is currently being used, and without repair, how long would it last? Hmm, perhaps the initial lifespan is four years, and the repair adds one more year. But maybe the initial usage is not specified. So, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tire's life, regardless of how long it's already been used.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are, say, x years old) or buy new ones. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it, so that the repair extends the life by one year, regardless of when it's done.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are being considered for repair. So, the customer can either replace the tires now, which will last four more years, or repair them for $40 each, making them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and the repair gives them one more year of life.\n\nWait, that might complicate the calculation, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you repair the current tires, you get one more year of use from them. So, the cost is $40, and the benefit is one more year.\n\nBut to calculate the average cost per year, perhaps we need to model the total cost over the same period as the new tires.\n\nWait, but the new tires last four years. The repair gives one more year. So, maybe if you repair the current tires, you can get an extra year on them, making their total life one year more than if you didn't repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial life of the tires is four years. So, if you buy new ones, you get four years. If you repair, you get five years? Or maybe the repair is done when the tire is three years old, adding one more year to reach four years. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you repair, you pay $40 and the tire lasts one more year beyond its previous lifespan. But I think the problem is intended to be simpler.\n\nLet me approach it from another angle. The question asks for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing.\n\nSo, for the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nFor the repair: Each repair is $40, and the tires last one more year. So, let's say the tire was going to last, say, x years without repair. But perhaps the problem is that the repair is done to extend the current tire's life by one year, but perhaps the current tires are already in use for some period. Wait, but the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the repair adds one year, making them last five years? Or perhaps the repair is done when the tire is about to fail, so it gives an additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the repair is done once, giving one more year. So, perhaps the total lifespan after repair is one year. So, the cost is $40 for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to compare the average cost per year of the two options. Let me think of each option in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is 180, life is 4 years. So, cost per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost is 40, life is 1 year. So, cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the repair adds one year, then the total life would be the previous life plus one. But I'm not sure what the previous life is. Because if the tire is already three years old, then a repair would make it last one more year, for a total of four years. So, in that case, the cost is 40 for four years of life? No, because the tire was already used for three years, and the repair gives one more, so total of four.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more abstract, and we can consider the repair option as a one-time cost of $40 that gives an extra year of use, regardless of the tire's current age.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has tires that are about to need replacement, and they can either buy new tires (cost 180, last four years) or repair the current tires (cost 40, last one more year). So, the repair gives one more year of use beyond the current lifespan.\n\nWait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and repairing allows them to last an additional year beyond that. So, the repair adds one year.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the problem is intended to model the repair as providing one year of use at a cost of $40, while the new tire provides four years at 180.\n\nWait, but the average cost per year would then be 40 divided by 1 year, which is 40. So, comparing 45 (new) to 40 (repair). So, the new tires have a higher average cost per year.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So, the new tires' average cost is 45, repair is 40. So, 45 is higher than 40 by 5. To find what percent 5 is of 40, which is 12.5%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if the repair is done once, perhaps the total lifespan of the tires is extended by one year. So, if the tires were going to last four years, but with repair, they last five years. But the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are already in use, to make them last one more year.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to model the two options in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which will last 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40, which makes them last one more year. So, how many years of service does this provide? Let's say the current tires have been in use for 'n' years, and the repair gives them one more year. But without knowing 'n', I can't calculate the total lifespan. So, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done when the tires are about to fail, making them last one additional year. So, the total lifespan after repair is one year.\n\nBut that would make the repair's cost per year $40 per year, but that's for one year. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, giving one additional year beyond the original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, then the repair would make them last five years. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The repair cost is $40, and it gives one more year. So, the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 / 1 = 40.\n\nThen, the new tires' average cost per year is 45. So, 45 compared to 40 is an increase of 5. To find the percentage increase, it's (5 / 40) * 100% = 12.5%. So, the new tires' average cost is 12.5% higher than the repair cost.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for the repair, it's $40. The difference is $5. So, 5 is what percentage of 40? 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year on average.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%, which should be the correct answer.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Additional Lifespan}} = \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repairing the current tires, it is $40.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage difference in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that new tires last for four years. The cost for each new tire is $180. On the other hand, repairing the current tires costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one additional year. So, if the tires were already in use, repairing them would make them last one more year instead of being replaced right away.\n\nWait, the question is asking about the average cost per year for the new tires compared to the cost of repairing. So I need to calculate the average annual cost for both options and then find out what percentage greater the new tires' cost is compared to the repair cost.\n\nLet me think about each option separately.\n\nStarting with the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts for four years. So the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. That's straightforward: $180 / 4 years. Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 4 is 45. So the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, the repair option: The customer can repair their current tires for $40 each, and this repair makes the tires last one more year. Wait, but how long were the tires in use before the repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. But if the customer is considering repair, it's probably after some initial period.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again. It says a customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 or have the current tires repaired for $40, which makes them last one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are already in use for a certain time. Oh, maybe the repair is an alternative to replacing them. Let's assume that the current tires have been used for some time and are now being considered for repair or replacement.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. Maybe the customer is looking at two options: either buy new tires now, which will last four years, or repair the current tires, which would make them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, and repairing them would make them last one more (total four years), but that's just a guess. Or maybe it's a general case where the repair adds one year to their current lifespan.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model both options based on their total lifespan and cost.\n\nLet me restate the problem: For each tire, the options are:\n\n1. Buy a new tire for $180, which will last 4 years.\n\n2. Repair the current tire for $40, which will make it last one additional year.\n\nWait, but when is the repair done? Let's assume that the current tire has been in use for a certain period, but perhaps the repair is done when the tire is about to fail, extending its life by one year. Alternatively, maybe the repair is an alternative to replacing the tire immediately, allowing it to last longer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's consider each option's average cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180, life is 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tire. Cost is $40, life is extended by 1 year. So, how long does the tire last after repair? Let's see. If the tire is currently being used, and without repair, how long would it last? Hmm, perhaps the initial lifespan is four years, and the repair adds one more year. But maybe the initial usage is not specified. So, perhaps the repair adds one year to the tire's life, regardless of how long it's already been used.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is considering whether to repair their current tires (which are, say, x years old) or buy new ones. But perhaps the problem is simplifying it, so that the repair extends the life by one year, regardless of when it's done.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires are being considered for repair. So, the customer can either replace the tires now, which will last four more years, or repair them for $40 each, making them last one more year. So, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, and the repair gives them one more year of life.\n\nWait, that might complicate the calculation, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you repair the current tires, you get one more year of use from them. So, the cost is $40, and the benefit is one more year.\n\nBut to calculate the average cost per year, perhaps we need to model the total cost over the same period as the new tires.\n\nWait, but the new tires last four years. The repair gives one more year. So, maybe if you repair the current tires, you can get an extra year on them, making their total life one year more than if you didn't repair.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial life of the tires is four years. So, if you buy new ones, you get four years. If you repair, you get five years? Or maybe the repair is done when the tire is three years old, adding one more year to reach four years. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you repair, you pay $40 and the tire lasts one more year beyond its previous lifespan. But I think the problem is intended to be simpler.\n\nLet me approach it from another angle. The question asks for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing.\n\nSo, for the new tires: Each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nFor the repair: Each repair is $40, and the tires last one more year. So, let's say the tire was going to last, say, x years without repair. But perhaps the problem is that the repair is done to extend the current tire's life by one year, but perhaps the current tires are already in use for some period. Wait, but the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, the repair adds one year, making them last five years? Or perhaps the repair is done when the tire is about to fail, so it gives an additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that the repair is done once, giving one more year. So, perhaps the total lifespan after repair is one year. So, the cost is $40 for one additional year.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to compare the average cost per year of the two options. Let me think of each option in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: New tires. Cost is 180, life is 4 years. So, cost per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair. Cost is 40, life is 1 year. So, cost per year is 40.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if the repair adds one year, then the total life would be the previous life plus one. But I'm not sure what the previous life is. Because if the tire is already three years old, then a repair would make it last one more year, for a total of four years. So, in that case, the cost is 40 for four years of life? No, because the tire was already used for three years, and the repair gives one more, so total of four.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more abstract, and we can consider the repair option as a one-time cost of $40 that gives an extra year of use, regardless of the tire's current age.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer has tires that are about to need replacement, and they can either buy new tires (cost 180, last four years) or repair the current tires (cost 40, last one more year). So, the repair gives one more year of use beyond the current lifespan.\n\nWait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to last one more year without repair, and repairing allows them to last an additional year beyond that. So, the repair adds one year.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the problem is intended to model the repair as providing one year of use at a cost of $40, while the new tire provides four years at 180.\n\nWait, but the average cost per year would then be 40 divided by 1 year, which is 40. So, comparing 45 (new) to 40 (repair). So, the new tires have a higher average cost per year.\n\nWait, but the problem says the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing. So, the new tires' average cost is 45, repair is 40. So, 45 is higher than 40 by 5. To find what percent 5 is of 40, which is 12.5%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if the repair is done once, perhaps the total lifespan of the tires is extended by one year. So, if the tires were going to last four years, but with repair, they last five years. But the problem says that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So, perhaps the repair is done to the current tires, which are already in use, to make them last one more year.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to model the two options in terms of cost per year.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which will last 4 years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = $45.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40, which makes them last one more year. So, how many years of service does this provide? Let's say the current tires have been in use for 'n' years, and the repair gives them one more year. But without knowing 'n', I can't calculate the total lifespan. So, perhaps the problem is considering that the repair is done when the tires are about to fail, making them last one additional year. So, the total lifespan after repair is one year.\n\nBut that would make the repair's cost per year $40 per year, but that's for one year. Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done once, giving one additional year beyond the original lifespan. So, if the original lifespan is four years, then the repair would make them last five years. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The repair cost is $40, and it gives one more year. So, the average cost per year for the repair option is 40 / 1 = 40.\n\nThen, the new tires' average cost per year is 45. So, 45 compared to 40 is an increase of 5. To find the percentage increase, it's (5 / 40) * 100% = 12.5%. So, the new tires' average cost is 12.5% higher than the repair cost.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for the repair, it's $40. The difference is $5. So, 5 is what percentage of 40? 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So, the new tires are 12.5% more expensive per year on average.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%, which should be the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n### Option 1: New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repairing Current Tires\n- **Repair cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Repair Cost}}{\\text{Additional Lifespan}} = \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Comparison\nThe average cost per year for new tires is $45, and for repairing the current tires, it is $40.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage increase in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that new tires from a certain brand last for four years when purchased new. The customer has two options: buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. I need to find out the average cost per year for each option and then determine what percent greater the new tires' cost is compared to the repair option.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure I understand. So, if the customer buys new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. If they repair, each tire costs $40 and extends the life by a year, meaning the tire lasts five years instead of four? Or is it that the repair adds one year to the current lifespan? Hmm, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. Oh, so the original lifespan isn't specified, but when you repair, they last one more year. Wait, the question says when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires must have been purchased four years ago and are now four years old. So their original lifespan is four years, but repair adds one more, making them last five years.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So when new, four years. Now, the customer is considering repair. If he repairs them, each repair costs $40, and the tires will last one additional year. So the original tires are already in use, and repairing them adds one more year to their life. So the total lifespan becomes four (original) plus one (repair) = five years.\n\nSo for the repair option, each tire is $40 and lasts five years. For the new option, each tire is $180 and lasts four years.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So when you buy new, they last four. But the current tires are presumably already in use, perhaps for some time. Wait, maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair the current ones. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the current tires, which are presumably already being used, can be repaired for $40 each, and that repair will make them last one more year. So the original lifespan of the current tires isn't given, but perhaps it's the same as new tires, which is four years. So if the customer doesn't repair, they will last four years, but if repaired, they last five.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years, the repair makes them last x+1. But since the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years, perhaps the current tires, if not repaired, would last four years, and repairing them would make them last five years.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, perhaps it's irrelevant because we're comparing the average cost over the period the tires are in use. Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost per tire is $180. Each tire lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40 per tire. Each tire lasts one additional year. So if the current tires are already in use, perhaps they've been used for some time, but the repair adds one more year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how much longer the current tires would last without repair. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says that the customer can choose to repair his current tires, which will make them last for one additional year. So the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, but no, that doesn't make sense because the customer is considering repairing them. Wait, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and are now at the end of their lifespan. So without repair, they would last four years, and with repair, they last five.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is comparing the average cost per year for each option, regardless of when the tires were purchased.\n\nSo for the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: each repair is $40, and the tire lasts one additional year. So I'm assuming that the current tires have been in use for some time and would last one more year if repaired. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires are about to fail, so each repair adds one year. Hmm, maybe the problem is that the customer has tires that are about to stop being useful, and he can either replace them or repair them for an extra year.\n\nBut let's think about the cost per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs, the cost is $40 per tire, and the tire lasts one more year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 / 1 = $40 per year. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So if the current tires were going to last, say, n years, then repairing adds one, making it n+1.\n\nWait, but without knowing n, perhaps we can assume that the current tires have already been in use for their full lifespan. Because the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years and are now going to be replaced. So if the customer repairs, they can get one more year of use from them.\n\nWait, but that would mean that without repair, the tires would last four years from purchase, but if you repair, they last five years. So for the repair option, the cost is $40 for an extra year.\n\nWait, but how many years are we considering for the average cost? Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem: the customer has current tires that were purchased new four years ago, so they have been in use for four years and are now at the end of their lifespan. The customer can either buy new tires now, which will cost $180 each and last four years, or repair the current tires at $40 each, which will make them last one additional year (so total five years from the original purchase, but that's four years plus one more).\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is being considered now, so the current tires are four years old, and repair makes them last one more year (so total five years from the purchase date). So the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life by one year.\n\nSo the new tires would last four years, and the repaired tires would last one more year, so five years in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says the customer can choose to repair his current tires, which will make them last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires would have lasted four years from their purchase, and with repair, they last five.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the new tires would be 180 divided by 4, which is $45 per year.\n\nThe average cost per year for the repair is 40 divided by 1, because the repair is for one additional year. Wait, no. Because the current tires have already been in use for four years, and the repair gives them one more year. So the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is $40 for the repair, but how does that factor into the average cost?\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life by one year. So the cost is $40 for that extra year, meaning that for the fifth year, the customer pays $40.\n\nBut the average cost per year for the current tires (if repaired) would be the total cost over five years. Wait, no. Because the customer has already used the tires for four years, and now is considering whether to repair them for an extra year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year regardless of when the tires were purchased.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated as the cost per tire divided by the number of years it lasts. So for new tires: 180 /4 = 45. For repaired tires: 40 /1 = 40. Because the repair adds one year, making the lifespan one year longer than without repair. But wait, without repair, what's the lifespan? The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last four years from purchase, so perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and are about to fail. So repairing them for $40 would make them last for one more year (total five years from purchase).\n\nSo the average cost per year for the current tires (if repaired) is 40 per tire divided by 1 year, which is $40 per year. But that can't be right because the total cost over five years would be 40, so 40/5=8 per year? Or wait, no, because the customer has already used the tires for four years, so the cost of the repair is only for the fifth year. So the average cost per year would be the cost of the repair divided by the additional year. Or perhaps the total cost including all previous years?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it differently. The problem is asking for the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180. Lifespan is 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40. Lifespan is extended by one year. So the repair adds one year to the current tires' life. So the total lifespan becomes 4 + 1 =5 years. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be 40 /1 =40? Or is it 40 /5=8?\n\nWait, I think that's where I'm getting stuck. Because the current tires are already four years old. So the cost of the repair is $40, and they give one more year of use. So the cost for that one year is $40, making the average cost per year for that extra year $40. But the previous four years, the customer has already used the tires, perhaps at some cost. But the problem is comparing the average cost per year for each option. So perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year of the tires when they are in use.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you buy new tires, you have four years of use for $180, which averages to $45 per year. When you repair, you pay $40 to get one more year of use from the current tires. So the average cost per year for the repair is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. So the new tires cost $45 per year, the repair option is $40 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires are 45, repair is 40. So the question is, what percent greater is 45 than 40?\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So it's 45 compared to 40.\n\nSo the difference is 5. So 5 is what percent of 40? (5/40)*100 =12.5%. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180. Lasts 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40. Lasts 1 additional year.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about tires and costs, and I need to figure out the percentage increase in average cost per year between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that new tires from a certain brand last for four years when purchased new. The customer has two options: buy new tires at $180 each or repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one additional year. I need to find out the average cost per year for each option and then determine what percent greater the new tires' cost is compared to the repair option.\n\nWait, wait, let me make sure I understand. So, if the customer buys new tires, each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. If they repair, each tire costs $40 and extends the life by a year, meaning the tire lasts five years instead of four? Or is it that the repair adds one year to the current lifespan? Hmm, the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. Oh, so the original lifespan isn't specified, but when you repair, they last one more year. Wait, the question says when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires must have been purchased four years ago and are now four years old. So their original lifespan is four years, but repair adds one more, making them last five years.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, \"tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So when new, four years. Now, the customer is considering repair. If he repairs them, each repair costs $40, and the tires will last one additional year. So the original tires are already in use, and repairing them adds one more year to their life. So the total lifespan becomes four (original) plus one (repair) = five years.\n\nSo for the repair option, each tire is $40 and lasts five years. For the new option, each tire is $180 and lasts four years.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So when you buy new, they last four. But the current tires are presumably already in use, perhaps for some time. Wait, maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new tires now or repair the current ones. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, so the current tires, which are presumably already being used, can be repaired for $40 each, and that repair will make them last one more year. So the original lifespan of the current tires isn't given, but perhaps it's the same as new tires, which is four years. So if the customer doesn't repair, they will last four years, but if repaired, they last five.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So if the current tires were going to last, say, x years, the repair makes them last x+1. But since the problem states that when purchased new, they last four years, perhaps the current tires, if not repaired, would last four years, and repairing them would make them last five years.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, perhaps it's irrelevant because we're comparing the average cost over the period the tires are in use. Let's see.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost per tire is $180. Each tire lasts four years. So the average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40 per tire. Each tire lasts one additional year. So if the current tires are already in use, perhaps they've been used for some time, but the repair adds one more year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how much longer the current tires would last without repair. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says that the customer can choose to repair his current tires, which will make them last for one additional year. So the current tires are already in use, and without repair, they would last, say, x years. With repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. So perhaps the current tires are new, but no, that doesn't make sense because the customer is considering repairing them. Wait, perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and are now at the end of their lifespan. So without repair, they would last four years, and with repair, they last five.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is comparing the average cost per year for each option, regardless of when the tires were purchased.\n\nSo for the new tires: each tire costs $180 and lasts four years. So the average cost per year is 180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: each repair is $40, and the tire lasts one additional year. So I'm assuming that the current tires have been in use for some time and would last one more year if repaired. Alternatively, perhaps the repair is done when the tires are about to fail, so each repair adds one year. Hmm, maybe the problem is that the customer has tires that are about to stop being useful, and he can either replace them or repair them for an extra year.\n\nBut let's think about the cost per year.\n\nIf the customer repairs, the cost is $40 per tire, and the tire lasts one more year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40 / 1 = $40 per year. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the repair adds one year to the current lifespan. So if the current tires were going to last, say, n years, then repairing adds one, making it n+1.\n\nWait, but without knowing n, perhaps we can assume that the current tires have already been in use for their full lifespan. Because the problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So perhaps the current tires have already been used for four years and are now going to be replaced. So if the customer repairs, they can get one more year of use from them.\n\nWait, but that would mean that without repair, the tires would last four years from purchase, but if you repair, they last five years. So for the repair option, the cost is $40 for an extra year.\n\nWait, but how many years are we considering for the average cost? Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem: the customer has current tires that were purchased new four years ago, so they have been in use for four years and are now at the end of their lifespan. The customer can either buy new tires now, which will cost $180 each and last four years, or repair the current tires at $40 each, which will make them last one additional year (so total five years from the original purchase, but that's four years plus one more).\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is being considered now, so the current tires are four years old, and repair makes them last one more year (so total five years from the purchase date). So the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life by one year.\n\nSo the new tires would last four years, and the repaired tires would last one more year, so five years in total.\n\nWait, but the problem says the customer can choose to repair his current tires, which will make them last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires would have lasted four years from their purchase, and with repair, they last five.\n\nSo, the average cost per year for the new tires would be 180 divided by 4, which is $45 per year.\n\nThe average cost per year for the repair is 40 divided by 1, because the repair is for one additional year. Wait, no. Because the current tires have already been in use for four years, and the repair gives them one more year. So the total lifespan is five years. So the cost is $40 for the repair, but how does that factor into the average cost?\n\nWait, perhaps the repair is an option to extend the current tires' life by one year. So the cost is $40 for that extra year, meaning that for the fifth year, the customer pays $40.\n\nBut the average cost per year for the current tires (if repaired) would be the total cost over five years. Wait, no. Because the customer has already used the tires for four years, and now is considering whether to repair them for an extra year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average cost per year regardless of when the tires were purchased.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated as the cost per tire divided by the number of years it lasts. So for new tires: 180 /4 = 45. For repaired tires: 40 /1 = 40. Because the repair adds one year, making the lifespan one year longer than without repair. But wait, without repair, what's the lifespan? The problem says that when purchased new, they last four years. So the current tires are already four years old, and without repair, they would last four years from purchase, so perhaps the current tires have been in use for four years and are about to fail. So repairing them for $40 would make them last for one more year (total five years from purchase).\n\nSo the average cost per year for the current tires (if repaired) is 40 per tire divided by 1 year, which is $40 per year. But that can't be right because the total cost over five years would be 40, so 40/5=8 per year? Or wait, no, because the customer has already used the tires for four years, so the cost of the repair is only for the fifth year. So the average cost per year would be the cost of the repair divided by the additional year. Or perhaps the total cost including all previous years?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it differently. The problem is asking for the average cost per year for each option.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180. Lifespan is 4 years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40. Lifespan is extended by one year. So the repair adds one year to the current tires' life. So the total lifespan becomes 4 + 1 =5 years. So the average cost per year for the repair option would be 40 /1 =40? Or is it 40 /5=8?\n\nWait, I think that's where I'm getting stuck. Because the current tires are already four years old. So the cost of the repair is $40, and they give one more year of use. So the cost for that one year is $40, making the average cost per year for that extra year $40. But the previous four years, the customer has already used the tires, perhaps at some cost. But the problem is comparing the average cost per year for each option. So perhaps the question is comparing the average cost per year of the tires when they are in use.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you buy new tires, you have four years of use for $180, which averages to $45 per year. When you repair, you pay $40 to get one more year of use from the current tires. So the average cost per year for the repair is $40 for one year, which is $40 per year. So the new tires cost $45 per year, the repair option is $40 per year.\n\nWait, but that would mean the new tires are 45, repair is 40. So the question is, what percent greater is 45 than 40?\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So it's 45 compared to 40.\n\nSo the difference is 5. So 5 is what percent of 40? (5/40)*100 =12.5%. So the answer would be 12.5%, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180. Lasts 4 years. So average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. Cost is $40. Lasts 1 additional year. So the average cost per year is 40/1 =40.\n\nSo the new tires' average cost is 45, which is 5 more than 40. So 5 is what percentage of 40? 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%.\n\nSo the answer is C) 12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average cost per year of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we analyze the two options:\n\n### Option 1: Buy New Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $180  \n- **Lifespan**: 4 years  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Average cost per year} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Lifespan}} = \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Option 2: Repair Current Tires\n- **Cost per tire**: $40  \n- **Additional lifespan**: 1 year  \n- **Average cost per year**:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Average cost per year} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Additional lifespan}} = \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{\\$/year}\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase\nThe question asks for the percentage by which the average cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

The question is about finding the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing new tires instead of repairing the current ones. \n\nAlright, let me break it down. So, the tires last four years when you buy them new. Each new tire costs $180. Alternatively, you can repair the current tires for $40 each, and that makes them last one more year. So, the customer's options are to buy new tires or repair the old ones.\n\nI think the first thing I need to do is calculate the average cost per year for both options. Then, find out how much greater the new tire cost is compared to the repair cost, in percentage terms.\n\nLet's start with the new tires. If each tire costs $180 and they last for four years, the average cost per year would be the total cost divided by the number of years. So that's 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 /4 = 45. So, $45 per year on average for the new tires.\n\nNow, the repair option. The customer can repair each tire for $40, and this extends the life by one year. Wait, but how many years is that? Oh, the original tires probably last a certain amount of time before repair. Wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So I'm assuming that the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem doesn't specify how old they are. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's read again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the current tires can be repaired for $40 each, making them last for one additional year. So, without repair, how long do the current tires last? The problem says that new tires last four years. So, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace them now, or repair them. If they repair, the tires last one more year.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires are already old. Let me think. Suppose the customer has tires that are, say, three years old. If he repairs them, they'll last one more year (so four years total). Or, he can buy new tires which also last four years. But perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the current tires have some remaining life. Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. It just says that repairing the current tires will make them last one additional year. So, the total lifespan after repair is one more year.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial lifespan of the current tires is four years when new. But the customer is thinking about whether to replace or repair. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, then without repair, they would last one more year (total four). If repaired, they'd last two more years (total five). But the problem doesn't specify how old the tires are. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply considering the cost per year for each option, assuming that the new tires last four years, and the repaired tires last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing the current lifespan, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as: when you repair, you pay $40 for each tire, and they last one more year. So the total lifespan is one more year. So, if the current tires are, say, three years old, repair would make them last four years. But perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering replacing or repairing the current tires, which have some remaining life. But maybe that's not necessary. Maybe the problem is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the cost over the same period of time. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the new tires are purchased and last four years. The repair is an option for the current tires, which would make them last one more year than they would otherwise. So, perhaps the current tires have a certain lifespan, but with repair, they last an extra year.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they wouldn't last another year. But when repaired, they will last one more year. So, the customer has to decide: replace (cost $180) or repair (cost $40) for one more year.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the tires are worn out, and without repair, they can't last another year. So, buying new tires would give four years of use, while repairing gives one more year.\n\nWait, but the question is about the average cost per year for each option. So, for the new tires, the cost is $180 for four years. So, per year, 180/4 = $45.\n\nFor the repair option, the customer is repairing the current tires for $40 each. So, if the customer has four tires, that's 4*40 = $160 total cost. And this repair makes the tires last one more year. So, if before repair, the tires might have only a few months left, but after repair, they last one more year. So, the lifespan after repair is one year.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"last for four years\" when purchased new. So, maybe the current tires have been around for three years, and without repair, they would last one more year (total four). But if you repair them, they last one more year beyond that, making it five years. Or perhaps the repair adds one year regardless of current condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the customer's current tires are in their fourth year and will fail. So, if he repairs them, they'll last one more year. So, he can choose to either repair for $40 each, getting one more year, or buy new tires for $180 each, which will last four years.\n\nBut in that case, the customer has to decide whether to spend $40 per tire for one year, or $180 per tire for four years. So, let's model both options.\n\nFirst option: buy new tires. Each tire costs $180, lasts four years. So, average cost per year is 180 /4 = 45.\n\nSecond option: repair current tires for $40 each, which gives one more year of life. So, for each tire, the cost is $40, and lifespan is one year. So, average cost per year is 40 /1 =40.\n\nWait, but wait. If the customer has four tires, the cost would be 4*40=160, and they last one more year. So, for four tires, the total cost is 160, and they last one year. So, per tire per year, that's 160/(4*1) = 10. Wait, that can't be right. Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated on a per tire basis. So, if I have one tire, the options are: buy a new one for $180, which lasts four years. So, per year, 180/4=45. Or, repair for $40, which makes it last one more year. So, if the tire is about to fail, repair would give it one more year. So, the cost is $40 for one year. So, the average cost per year is 40/1 =40.\n\nSo, comparing the two, new tires are 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nThe question is, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing new tires over repair.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 -40 =5.\n\nTo find the percentage increase from repair to new, it's (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is 12.5% higher than that of repair.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C)12.5%.\n",

So, for four tires, the total cost is 160, and they last one year. So, per tire per year, that's 160/(4*1) = 10. Wait, that can't be right. Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the average cost per year is calculated on a per tire basis. So, if I have one tire, the options are: buy a new one for $180, which lasts four years. So, per year, 180/4=45. Or, repair for $40, which makes it last one more year. So, if the tire is about to fail, repair would give it one more year. So, the cost is $40 for one year. So, the average cost per year is 40/1 =40.\n\nSo, comparing the two, new tires are 45 per year, repair is 40 per year.\n\nThe question is, what's the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing new tires over repair.\n\nSo, the increase is 45 -40 =5.\n\nTo find the percentage increase from repair to new, it's (5/40)*100% = 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the average cost per year for new tires is 12.5% higher than that of repair.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C)12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage increase in average cost per year when choosing new tires over repairing the current tires, we calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage difference.\n\n### New Tires:\n- Cost per tire: $180  \n- Lifespan: 4 years  \n- Average cost per year:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\, \\text{dollars per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Repairing Current Tires:\n- Repair cost per tire: $40  \n- Additional lifespan: 1 year  \n- Average cost per year:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\, \\text{dollars per year}.\n  \\]\n\n### Percentage Increase:\nThe increase in average cost per year is:  \n\\[\n45 - 40 = 5 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]  \nThe percentage increase relative to the repair cost is:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5}{40} \\times 100\\% = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost per year of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the cost of repairing the current tires.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about tire costs, and I need to figure out the percentage by which the new tires' average cost per year is greater than the repaired tires. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nSo, the tires when new last for four years. A customer can either buy new ones for $180 each or repair the current ones for $40 each, which makes them last one more year. I need to find out how much greater the average cost per year is for the new tires compared to the repaired ones.\n\nWait, let me break this down. First, I think I should calculate the average cost per year for both options. Then, compare them to find the percentage increase.\n\nStarting with the new tires. The cost is $180 per tire, and they last four years. So, the average cost per year would be total cost divided by the number of years. That would be 180 / 4. Let me calculate that: 180 divided by 4 is 45. So, the average cost per year for new tires is $45.\n\nNow, the other option is repairing the current tires. The repair costs $40 each and extends their life by one year. So, the original lifespan is four years. After repair, it becomes five years. Wait, wait. Wait, the question says when purchased new, they last four years. So, the current tires are presumably already in use for some time. Oh, but the problem doesn't specify how old the current tires are. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.\n\nAh, the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, if they were going to last, say, X years without repair, the repair makes it X+1. But wait, the problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the current tires are already used for some time, but the problem doesn't give that info. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the current tires are still going to last four years without repair, and the repair adds one more year. Or wait, perhaps the problem states that without repair, the current tires would have only one year left, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let me reread the problem. \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nOh, so the current tires are the ones he already has. Without repair, how long would they last? Hmm. The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So, perhaps the current tires have already been used for some time. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, perhaps the customer is considering whether to buy new tires or repair his current ones. Let's think about the expected lifespan.\n\nIf the customer buys new tires, they'll last four years. If he repairs his current tires, which presumably are already in use, the repair will make them last one more year. So, for example, if the current tires have been used for three years, repairing them would make them last for one more year (total of four years from purchase). But without the repair, perhaps they would only last for another year, making the total lifespan four years. Or maybe the repair adds one year beyond their current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires would last for one more year without repair. So, the repair gives them an additional year beyond that, making it two years from now. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to think of the current tires' lifespan. Let me consider that the customer's current tires are about to fail. So, if he doesn't repair, they would last for one more year. If he repairs, they would last for two more years. So, the repair adds one year beyond their current lifespan. So, the repair makes them last for an extra year, so the total lifespan after repair is two years instead of one.\n\nWait, but the problem says the repair will make the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps their lifespan without repair is X years, and with repair, it's X+1 years. But the problem doesn't specify what X is. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is considering that without repair, the current tires would have one year left, and with repair, they'll have two years left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the customer is considering whether to replace the tires now or repair them. If he buys new tires, they last four years. If he repairs, they last one more year beyond their current lifespan. But without knowing how old the current tires are, perhaps the problem is assuming that the current tires have already been used for four years, and so without repair, they would last zero more years. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, maybe the current tires are already four years old and are about to fail. So without repair, they would last zero more years, and with repair, they would last one more year. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply that the repair adds one year to the lifespan, regardless of the current state. So, the current tires can last for four years when new, but after being used for a while, they're about to fail. So, the repair would make them last one more year, so the total lifespan would be four years from when they were new, but that might not be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Let me think differently. Let's think about the cost per year.\n\nFor the new tires: cost is $180, last four years. So, average cost per year is 180/4 = 45.\n\nFor the repair: cost is $40, and it makes the tires last for one additional year. So, if the customer repairs, how much does it cost per year?\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are going to last for a certain number of years. Let's say without repair, they have one year left. So, the customer can either buy new tires (cost 180, lasts four years) or repair (cost 40, makes current tires last for one more year, so total of two years from now). Hmm, but then the cost per year for the repair would be 40 spread over two years. So, 40/2 = 20 per year.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if the current tires have one year left, and you repair them for $40, they last for two years. So, the cost per year is 40 / 2 = 20. Then, the new tire's average is 45 per year. So, the question is asking how much greater is 45 than 20, in percentage terms.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\"\n\nSo, the new tires average is 45, repair is 20. The difference is 25. So, 25 is what percent of 20? Because the question is asking how much greater the new is than the repair. So, the formula is ((45 - 20)/20) * 100%.\n\nSo, 25 / 20 is 1.25, which is 125%. But that's not an option here. Wait, the options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%.\n\nHmm, so I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the current tires are going to last for three years without repair, and the repair adds one more year, making it four years. So, the cost of repair is $40 for four years. So, average cost per year is 40/4 =10. Then, new tires are 45 per year. So, the difference is 45-10=35. So, 35 is what percent of 10? 350%, which is way higher than any option. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repair makes them last one year. So, cost is 40 for one year. Then average cost per year is 40. Then new tires are 45. So, 45-40=5. 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So that's option C.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the current tires are about to fail, then without repair, they provide no additional years. So, the customer would have to buy new tires. If he repairs, he can use them for one more year.\n\nSo, the cost of repair is 40, and they last one year. So, average cost per year is 40.\n\nNew tires cost 180, last four years. So, average cost is 45 per year.\n\nSo, the question is, 45 is what percent greater than 40? So, the difference is 5, so 5/40 is 0.125, which is 12.5%.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12.5%. So, that would be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are already in use for some years, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the problem states that the repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So, perhaps without repair, they would have lasted for four years from when they were new. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, another approach. The problem says the tires, when new, last four years. So, for new tires, the lifespan is four years. The customer has current tires, perhaps that are already, say, three years old. So, without repair, they would last one more year (total four years from purchase). Repairing them would make them last five years in total (so one more year beyond their current state). Hmm, but this complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let's think that the current tires can be repaired for $40, and they will last one additional year beyond their current lifespan. So, if the current tires have been used for x years, they would last (4 - x) years without repair. With repair, they last (4 - x) + 1 years.\n\nBut without knowing x, how can I compute the average cost? Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the current tires' lifespan isn't relevant, and that the repair only adds one year beyond what they would have had.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended that without repair, the current tires would last one year, and with repair, they last two years. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40/2=20. Then, new tires are 45 per year. So, 45 is 25 more than 20. So, 25/20=1.25, 125% increase. But that's not an option. So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires are already four years old and about to fail, so without repair, they have zero years left. Repairing them gives one year. So, average cost is 40 per year. New tires: 180 /4 =45. So, 45 is 12.5% higher than 40. So, the answer would be C.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct way to interpret the problem. The current tires are about to fail, so without repair, they provide no more years. Repairing gives one year. So, the average cost per year for repair is 40.\n\nSo, the average cost of new tires is 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40. So, the answer is C.\n",
