      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all of which are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, okay, so every file is infected by at least one of them, no exceptions. \n\nThe question is asking how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So I need to find the number of files without a worm infection. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem gives a few pieces of information. First, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So let me denote some variables to make this clearer.\n\nLet me define:\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\nWait, but wait, the total number of files is 250, and all are infected by either virus or worm or both. So using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, V + W - B = 250. But I'm not sure if I need that right away.\n\nThe problem also says that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, the 'only worm' count is W - B, right? Because W includes those infected only by worm plus those infected by both. So, W - B = 2.5 * B.\n\nSo equation 1: W - B = 2.5 B \u2192 W = 3.5 B.\n\nAnother piece of info: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means those 125 files are infected only by a worm or neither. But wait, the problem states that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So there are no files uninfected. Therefore, the 125 files not infected by a virus must be the ones infected only by the worm. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm (since all are infected by at least one). So that means the number of files infected only by a worm is 125.\n\nWait, but earlier I had that W - B = 2.5 B, and that W - B is the number of files only infected by worm. So according to this, W - B = 125. So substituting into equation 1: 125 = 2.5 B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 50. So B is 50.\n\nThen, W = 3.5 * B = 3.5 *50 = 175. So W is 175.\n\nSo W is the total infected by worm, which includes both those only worm and both. So W is 175, and B is 50, so W - B is 125, which matches.\n\nNow, the question is how many files were NOT infected by a worm. Well, the total files are 250. The number of files infected by worm is W=175. So the number not infected by worm is 250 - W = 250 - 175 =75. \n\nWait, wait. But wait, earlier I thought that the 125 files not infected by virus are the only ones infected by worm. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 50% are not infected by a virus. So 125 files are not V. Since all are infected by either V or W, the 125 not V must be W only. Because if they're not V, they can't be in both. So yes, W_only is 125.\n\nSo, W = W_only + B \u2192 125 +50=175.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by worm is total files - W. So 250 -175=75. So the answer should be 75, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another approach: using the inclusion-exclusion formula. V + W - B =250. Also, the number not infected by virus is 125, which are only W. So W_only =125. But W_only is W - B =125. So B= W -125. \n\nWait, earlier I found that W =3.5 B. Substituting, W=3.5*(W-125). Let me solve for W.\n\nW=3.5 W - 437.5 \u2192 3.5W - W =437.5 \u2192 2.5 W=437.5 \u2192 W=437.5/2.5=175. So W is 175. Same as before.\n\nSo the number of files not infected by worm is 250-175=75. So the answer is C)75.\n\nWait, but another way: the number of files not infected by a worm is equal to the number of files infected by only virus plus the number of files not infected by either. But wait, the problem says all files are infected by either V or W or both, so no files are not infected by either. So not infected by worm is only those infected by only V. \n\nSo how many are only V? Let's see: V = V_only + B. But V_only is the number of files infected only by virus. \n\nWait, but how much is V? Let's see: since V + W - B =250. We have V +175 -50 =250 \u2192 V +125=250 \u2192 V=125. So V is 125. So V_only is V - B \u2192125 -50=75. So the number of files only V is 75. Hence, the number not infected by worm is 75. So same answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.\n\nAll 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, so every file is infected by at least one of them. No files are uninfected by both. Got it.\n\nThe number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Oh, okay. So if I let the number of files infected by both be, say, B, then the number of files only with a worm would be 2.5*B.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, so 50% of 250 is 125 files. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means these 125 files are only infected by a worm, right? Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it must be infected by a worm, since all files are infected by at least one.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. The 50% not infected by a virus means they are only infected by a worm, because there's no other option. Because all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, yes, 125 files are only worm-infected.\n\nBut earlier I thought that the number of files only worm-infected is 2.5 times the number of both. So, that would mean 125 = 2.5 * B. So, solving for B: B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So 50 files are infected by both virus and worm.\n\nWait, but then how does that fit into the total number of files?\n\nLet me model this with a Venn diagram. The total files are 250. The two sets are Virus (V) and Worm (W). The union of V and W is 250.\n\nThe number of files only in W is 2.5 * B. So only W is 2.5*B. And B is the intersection, V \u2229 W.\n\nSo, the total number of files in W (only W plus both) would be 2.5*B + B = 3.5*B.\n\nSimilarly, the number of files only in V would be total V minus the intersection. But wait, the total number of files not in V is 125, which are only W. So, the number of files in V would be 250 - 125 = 125. Because V includes both the files that are only V and those in both V and W.\n\nSo, the number of files only in V is V_only = V_total - B. V_total is 125, so V_only = 125 - B.\n\nWait, let me reorganize this. The total number of files is the sum of only V, only W, and both. So:\n\nTotal = V_only + W_only + Both\n\nBut both is the same as B, and W_only is 2.5*B.\n\nWait, no. Both is B, which is the same as V \u2229 W. So, W_only is 2.5*B, as given.\n\nSo, let's write down:\n\nTotal files = V_only + W_only + Both?\n\nWait no, because V_only is files only in V, W_only is only in W, and Both is in both. So the total is V_only + W_only + Both. But wait, that can't be right because Both is included in both V and W. Oh, wait, no. The standard formula is:\n\n|V \u222a W| = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|\n\nWhich is 250 = |V| + |W| - B.\n\nBut I also know that |W| is W_only + B. And W_only is 2.5 * B. So |W| = 2.5B + B = 3.5B.\n\nAlso, from the problem, 50% of the files (125) are not infected by a virus. So, the number of files not in V is 125, which must be the W_only, because all files are in either V or W or both. So W_only is 125.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because if 50% are not in V, that means 125 files are only in W, right? Because if they're not in V, and they're infected, they must be in W. So W_only is 125. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that W_only is 2.5 * B. So if W_only is 125, then 125 = 2.5 * B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50.\n\nSo B is 50. Then the number of files that are in both is 50.\n\nNow, let's find the number of files that are in V.\n\nBecause the total number of files is 250, and 125 are only W, the remaining 125 must be in V (either only V or both). So, |V| = 125. But |V| is V_only + B. So V_only = |V| - B = 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nSo, the number of files only in V is 75.\n\nLet me recap the numbers:\n\n- Only W: 125\n- Both V and W: 50\n- Only V: 75\n\nWait, let me check if the total adds up: 125 + 50 +75 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is: How many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nWait, files not infected by a worm would be the files that are not in W. Since all files are in either V or W or both, the only way a file is not in W is if it's only in V. So the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files only in V, which is 75.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question asks, how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So that would be the files not in W. Since W includes all files that are in W only and those in both V and W. So the files not in W are those only in V. So yes, that's 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So all files are in V or W or both. So the files not infected by a worm are those that are in V but not in W. Which is 75.\n\nSo the answer is 75, which is option C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total Files**: There are 250 files on Sam's hard drive, and all of them are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.

These 125 files must be infected only by a worm because all files are infected by at least one of the two.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Worm-Only and Both Infections**: The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of files infected by both. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B \\).\n\n4. **Equating Worm-Only Files**: From step 2, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 125.

The standard formula is:\n\n|V \u222a W| = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|\n\nWhich is 250 = |V| + |W| - B.\n\nBut I also know that |W| is W_only + B. And W_only is 2.5 * B. So |W| = 2.5B + B = 3.5B.\n\nAlso, from the problem, 50% of the files (125) are not infected by a virus. So, the number of files not in V is 125, which must be the W_only, because all files are in either V or W or both. So W_only is 125.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because if 50% are not in V, that means 125 files are only in W, right? Because if they're not in V, and they're infected, they must be in W. So W_only is 125. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that W_only is 2.5 * B. So if W_only is 125, then 125 = 2.5 * B \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50.\n\nSo B is 50. Then the number of files that are in both is 50.\n\nNow, let's find the number of files that are in V.\n\nBecause the total number of files is 250, and 125 are only W, the remaining 125 must be in V (either only V or both). So, |V| = 125. But |V| is V_only + B. So V_only = |V| - B = 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nSo, the number of files only in V is 75.\n\nLet me recap the numbers:\n\n- Only W: 125\n- Both V and W: 50\n- Only V: 75\n\nWait, let me check if the total adds up: 125 + 50 +75 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is: How many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nWait, files not infected by a worm would be the files that are not in W. Since all files are in either V or W or both, the only way a file is not in W is if it's only in V. So the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files only in V, which is 75.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question asks, how many files were NOT infected by a worm. So that would be the files not in W. Since W includes all files that are in W only and those in both V and W. So the files not in W are those only in V. So yes, that's 75.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So all files are in V or W or both. So the files not infected by a worm are those that are in V but not in W. Which is 75.\n\nSo the answer is 75, which is option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Total Files**: There are 250 files on Sam's hard drive, and all of them are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. This means there are no uninfected files.\n\n2. **Files Not Infected by a Virus**: 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, which is \\( 0.5 \\times 250 = 125 \\) files. These 125 files must be infected only by a worm because all files are infected by at least one of the two.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Worm-Only and Both Infections**: The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of files infected by both. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B \\).\n\n4. **Equating Worm-Only Files**: From step 2, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 125. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2.5B = 125\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 files are infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\n5. **Total Files Infected by a Virus**: The total number of files infected by a virus includes those infected only by a virus and those infected by both. Let \\( V_{\\text{only}} \\) represent the number of files infected only by a virus. Then:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{only}} + B = 125\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( B = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{only}} + 50 = 125 \\implies V_{\\text{only}} = 75\n   \\]\n   So, 75 files are infected only by a virus.\n\n6. **Files Not Infected by a Worm**: Files not infected by a worm are those infected only by a virus. From step 5, this number is \\( V_{\\text{only}} = 75 \\).\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let me read it again and break it down.\n\nThe problem says that all 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, so every file is infected by at least one of them. That means the total is 250, which is the union of virus and worm infections.\n\nNext, it says the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Let me jot that down. So, let's denote the number of files infected by both as B. Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 * B.\n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are either not infected by anything or only by a worm? No, wait. Because all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, the files not infected by a virus must be infected by a worm only. Because if they're not by virus, they must be by worm. So, the number of files not infected by a virus is the same as the number infected only by a worm. Oh, right. Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it's only infected by a worm.\n\nWait, but the problem says all 250 are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the complement of \"infected by virus\" is the set of files not infected by virus, which would be only those infected by worm. So, 125 files are only worm.\n\nWait, but earlier it was said that the number of files only worm is 2.5 times the number of both. Let me write that as equations.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let B = number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\n- Let W = number of files infected only by worm.

But wait, V is the number of files with virus, which includes those with both. Similarly, W is the number with worm, which includes both.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me correct. Let me define:\n\n- V = number of files infected by virus (including those also infected by worm).\n\n- W = number of files infected by worm (including those also infected by virus).\n\nThen, the total number of files is V + W - B = 250.\n\nBut I'm given that 50% of the files are not infected by virus. So, the number of files not infected by virus is 125. Which means the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So, V = 125.\n\nSo V = 125.\n\nBut V is the total number of files with virus, which includes those with both. So, V = (number only virus) + B.\n\nSimilarly, W is the number of files with worm, which is (number only worm) + B.\n\nWe also know that the number of files only worm is W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.\"\n\nSo, W_only = 2.5 * B.\n\nAnd since W = W_only + B, then W = 2.5 B + B = 3.5 B.\n\nNow, we have V = 125 = (V_only) + B.\n\nBut V_only is the number of files infected only by virus. So, V_only = V - B = 125 - B.\n\nBut the total number of files is V + W - B = 250.\n\nWait, wait, no. The formula for the union is V + W - (V \u2229 W) = total.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm, or both. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means every file is in at least one of those two categories. No files are uninfected by both, but wait, the question is asking how many files were not infected by a worm. So we'll have to figure that out.\n\nThe problem gives a few pieces of information. Let me jot them down:\n\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So if I let the number of files infected by both be B, then the only worm infected files would be 2.5B.\n\n2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. Wait, but if they're not infected by a virus, since all files are infected by at least one, that means these 125 must be infected only by the worm. Because if they were infected by both, they would be counted as being infected by a virus. So that's an important point.\n\nWait, so if 125 files are not infected by a virus, they must be infected only by the worm. So the number of files infected only by the worm is 125. But earlier, the problem said that this number is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So let's write that equation.\n\nLet me define B as the number of files infected by both virus and worm. So the only worm files are 2.5B. But wait, wait, the only worm files are 125 because 125 are not infected by virus. So 2.5B = 125.\n\nLet me solve for B. 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 50. So B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both.\n\nNow, let's figure out the total number of files. The total is the sum of only virus, only worm, and both. But wait, the total is 250. Let's think about how to compute the total.\n\nWait, the total number of files infected by a virus would be the number of files infected only by a virus plus those infected by both. Similarly for the worm.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of infected files is equal to the number infected by virus plus the number infected by worm minus those infected by both. But since all 250 are infected by at least one, that total is 250.\n\nSo:\n\nVirus (V) + Worm (W) - Both (B) = 250.\n\nBut let's think about what V and W are. V is the number of files infected by virus only plus those infected by both. Similarly, W is worm only plus both.\n\nWe know that worm only is 125, which is 2.5B. And B is 50. So W is worm only (125) + B (50) = 175.\n\nSo W is 175. Now, what about V? Let's see. The number of files not infected by a virus is 125, which implies that the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. Wait, wait, no. If 50% of files are not infected by a virus, that's 125 files. So the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So V = 125.\n\nBut V is the number of files infected by virus, which is virus only plus both. So virus only is V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, virus only is 75, worm only is 125, both is 50. Let me check if these add up to 250: 75 + 125 +50 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow the question is: how many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nWait, not infected by a worm. Since all files are infected by at least one, the only way a file isn't infected by a worm is if it's infected only by a virus. Because if it's infected by both, it's infected by a worm. So the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by the virus, which is 75.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't have 75 as an option for this particular question. Wait, looking back at the options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125. Oh, option C is 75. So the answer should be 75. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the numbers. The number of files not infected by a worm would be the number of files not in the worm category. Since all files are in virus or worm, not in worm means only in virus.\n\nYes, so only virus is 75. So the answer is 75, option C.\n",

Solving for \\( B \\):  \n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 files are infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of files infected by a worm (\\( W \\)) and a virus (\\( V \\)):\n\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B = 125 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   W = \\text{only worm} + \\text{both} = 125 + 50 = 175\n   \\]\n2. The number of files infected by a virus is the total number of files minus the number of files not infected by a virus:\n   \\[\n   V = 250 - 125 = 125\n   \\]\n3. The number of files infected only by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{only virus} = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75\n   \\]\n\nFinally, to determine how many files were NOT infected by a worm, we note that these files must be infected only by a virus. From the calculation above, the number of files infected only by a virus is 75.\n\nThus, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Sam's hard drive with 250 files, all infected by either a virus or a worm, or both. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So that means every file is in at least one of those two categories. No files are uninfected by both, but wait, the question is asking how many files were not infected by a worm. So we'll have to figure that out.\n\nThe problem gives a few pieces of information. Let me jot them down:\n\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So if I let the number of files infected by both be B, then the only worm infected files would be 2.5B.\n\n2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. Wait, but if they're not infected by a virus, since all files are infected by at least one, that means these 125 must be infected only by the worm. Because if they were infected by both, they would be counted as being infected by a virus. So that's an important point.\n\nWait, so if 125 files are not infected by a virus, they must be infected only by the worm. So the number of files infected only by the worm is 125. But earlier, the problem said that this number is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So let's write that equation.\n\nLet me define B as the number of files infected by both virus and worm. So the only worm files are 2.5B. But wait, wait, the only worm files are 125 because 125 are not infected by virus. So 2.5B = 125.\n\nLet me solve for B. 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 50. So B is 50. That means 50 files are infected by both.\n\nNow, let's figure out the total number of files. The total is the sum of only virus, only worm, and both. But wait, the total is 250. Let's think about how to compute the total.\n\nWait, the total number of files infected by a virus would be the number of files infected only by a virus plus those infected by both. Similarly for the worm.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of infected files is equal to the number infected by virus plus the number infected by worm minus those infected by both. But since all 250 are infected by at least one, that total is 250.\n\nSo:\n\nVirus (V) + Worm (W) - Both (B) = 250.\n\nBut let's think about what V and W are. V is the number of files infected by virus only plus those infected by both. Similarly, W is worm only plus both.\n\nWe know that worm only is 125, which is 2.5B. And B is 50. So W is worm only (125) + B (50) = 175.\n\nSo W is 175. Now, what about V? Let's see. The number of files not infected by a virus is 125, which implies that the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. Wait, wait, no. If 50% of files are not infected by a virus, that's 125 files. So the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So V = 125.\n\nBut V is the number of files infected by virus, which is virus only plus both. So virus only is V - B = 125 -50=75.\n\nSo, virus only is 75, worm only is 125, both is 50. Let me check if these add up to 250: 75 + 125 +50 = 250. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow the question is: how many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nWait, not infected by a worm. Since all files are infected by at least one, the only way a file isn't infected by a worm is if it's infected only by a virus. Because if it's infected by both, it's infected by a worm. So the number of files not infected by a worm is the number of files infected only by the virus, which is 75.\n\nWait, but wait, the options don't have 75 as an option for this particular question. Wait, looking back at the options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125. Oh, option C is 75. So the answer should be 75. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the numbers. The number of files not infected by a worm would be the number of files not in the worm category. Since all files are in virus or worm, not in worm means only in virus.\n\nYes, so only virus is 75. So the answer is 75, option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information:\n\n1. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B \\).\n3. It is given that 50% of the files (125 files) are not infected by a virus. Since all files are infected by at least one of the two, these 125 files must be infected only by the worm. Therefore, \\( 2.5B = 125 \\).\n4. Solving for \\( B \\):  \n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 files are infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of files infected by a worm (\\( W \\)) and a virus (\\( V \\)):\n\n1. The number of files infected only by a worm is \\( 2.5B = 125 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   W = \\text{only worm} + \\text{both} = 125 + 50 = 175\n   \\]\n2. The number of files infected by a virus is the total number of files minus the number of files not infected by a virus:\n   \\[\n   V = 250 - 125 = 125\n   \\]\n3. The number of files infected only by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{only virus} = V - B = 125 - 50 = 75\n   \\]\n\nFinally, to determine how many files were NOT infected by a worm, we note that these files must be infected only by a virus. From the calculation above, the number of files infected only by a virus is 75.\n\nThus, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is **75**.\n\nAnswer: C",

I need to find out how many files were not infected by a worm. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the problem. It's a typical set theory question where some files are infected by a virus (V), some by a worm (W), and some by both. So, I'm thinking about using a Venn diagram approach here. The total is 250, so V union W equals 250.\n\nThe problem gives me a few pieces of information. The first is that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Let me denote the number of files infected by both as B. So, the files only by worm would be 2.5B.\n\nWait, right. So, the worm-only is 2.5 times B. And the virus-only would be... Well, I'm not given that directly. Let me think. The total number of files is the sum of virus-only, worm-only, and both. So, V union W = virus-only + worm-only + both. But wait, no, the both is already included in both V and W. Oh wait, no. The formula for the union is V + W - both = total. So, V + W - B = 250. But I might not have V and W directly.\n\nAlternatively, the files can be categorized into three groups: only V, only W, and both. So, total files = only V + only W + both. But wait, no, because that's the same as (V - B) + (W - B) + B = V + W - B. So, that's consistent.\n\nThe second piece of information is that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, that means 50% were infected by a virus, and 50% were not. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The statement says 50% were not infected by a virus. So, the number of files not infected by virus is 50% of 250, which is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by virus. Therefore, the number of files infected by virus is 250 - 125 = 125. So, V = 125. Because V is the number of files infected by virus, which includes those infected by only virus and those infected by both.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The files not infected by a virus are 125. That means those 125 files are infected by worm only, right? Because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, the 125 not infected by virus must be infected by worm only. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because a file could be infected by both, so the files not infected by virus would be those infected by worm only. Because if a file is infected by both, it's still considered as being infected by virus. So, the 125 files not infected by virus are the ones that are only worm infected.\n\nWait, let me think again. If a file is infected by both, it's counted in virus and also in worm. So, the count of files not infected by virus would be those that are only worm-infected. Because any file infected by worm (only or both) is not in the virus-free group. No, wait, no. If a file is infected by both, it is infected by virus, so it's not in the 'not infected by virus' group. So, the 'not infected by virus' group is only the worm-only files.\n\nSo, the number of worm-only files is 125. But wait, the problem says that the number of worm-only files is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. So, worm-only = 2.5 * B. But if worm-only is 125, then 125 = 2.5B. Solving for B gives B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So, B is 50.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, B is 50. Then, the number of virus-only files would be V - B. Because V is 125 (number of files infected by virus), so virus-only is 125 - 50 = 75.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Virus-only: 75\n- Worm-only: 125\n- Both: 50\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, the total would be 75 + 125 + 50 = 250. But that adds up to 250, which is correct. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut the question is, how many files were not infected by a worm? Wait, the files not infected by a worm would be those that are only virus, right? Because if a file is infected by worm, it's either only worm or both. So, the files not infected by worm are the virus-only ones.\n\nSo, the number of files not infected by worm is virus-only, which is 75. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 75. So, the answer should be C)75.\n\nWait, but let me recheck my reasoning. The problem states that all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, all 250 are in V or W or both. The files not infected by virus are 125, which are all the worm-only files. So, worm-only is 125.\n\nFrom the problem, worm-only is 2.5 times both. So, 2.5B = 125 \u2192 B=50.\n\nThen, the number of virus-infected is V = 125. Which is virus-only plus both. So, virus-only is 125 -50 =75. So, those 75 are only virus, which means they are not infected by worm.\n\nTherefore, the number of files not infected by worm is 75, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: the number not infected by worm is the number of files that are only virus. Since all files are either virus or worm or both, the only way to not be infected by worm is to be only virus.\n\nSo, the answer should be 75.\n",

Got it.\n\nThe number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Wait, so let me parse that. Let me assign some variables to make this easier.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm only.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\nSo according to the problem, W = 2.5 * B. Right, because worm-only is 2.5 times the both.\n\nNext part: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, if 50% are not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by a virus. Or wait, no: 50% not infected by virus implies 50% are infected by virus, but that's only considering those who are not both. Hmm, wait, no, because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, if 50% are not infected by virus, that means they are only infected by worm. Because if a file isn't infected by virus, but it's still infected by something, it must be worm only.\n\nWait, let's think again. 50% of 250 is 125 files. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are only infected by worm. Because if they were infected by both, they would be in the B category, but they are not infected by virus. Wait, no, because if a file is infected by both, it's counted in the virus and worm counts, right?\n\nWait, the 125 files not infected by virus implies that all those 125 are only worm infected. Because if a file is infected by both, it's still considered as being infected by a virus, right? So the 125 files are only worm, so W = 125? Wait, but earlier I had W = 2.5 * B. Hmm, but let me check.\n\nWait, the total number of files is 250. All are infected by either virus or worm or both. So the total is V + W + B = 250. But wait, no. Because V is virus only, W is worm only, and B is both. So total is V + W + B = 250.\n\nBut according to the problem, 50% of the files (so 125) were not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are not in V or B. Because if they were in B, they would be infected by virus (since B is both). So the 125 must be W, the worm-only files.\n\nSo W = 125.\n\nBut earlier, we have W = 2.5 * B. So substituting, 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B.\n\nB = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So B is 50.\n\nNow, what's the total number of files infected by a virus? That would be V + B. Because V is virus only, and B is both.\n\nBut wait, we don't know V yet. Let me see if I can find V.\n\nWe know that the total is V + W + B = 250.\n\nWe have W = 125, B =50. So V + 125 +50 =250 \u2192 V = 250 - 175 =75.\n\nSo V is 75. So the number of files infected by a virus is V + B = 75 +50=125. That makes sense because 50% of 250 is 125.\n\nBut the question is, how many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nHmm. Wait, files not infected by a worm would be those not in W or B. Because W is worm only, and B is both. So the only files not infected by a worm are the ones not in W or B. But wait, all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So the only way a file is not infected by a worm is if it's only virus. Because if it's only virus, then it's not worm. So the number of files not infected by a worm is V.\n\nWait, because V is virus only, they are not worm only or both. So yes, the number of files not infected by a worm is V, which is 75.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question is asking for the number of files not infected by a worm. So the files not infected by worm would be the ones that don't have worm in their infection. So that would be the files only infected by virus, which is V=75.\n\nSo the answer should be 75, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.\n\nAll 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. Hmm, so every file has at least one infection, either virus, worm, or both. Got it.\n\nThe number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Wait, so let me parse that. Let me assign some variables to make this easier.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.\n- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm only.\n- Let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm.\n\nSo according to the problem, W = 2.5 * B. Right, because worm-only is 2.5 times the both.\n\nNext part: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, if 50% are not infected by a virus, that means 50% are infected by a virus. Or wait, no: 50% not infected by virus implies 50% are infected by virus, but that's only considering those who are not both. Hmm, wait, no, because all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So, if 50% are not infected by virus, that means they are only infected by worm. Because if a file isn't infected by virus, but it's still infected by something, it must be worm only.\n\nWait, let's think again. 50% of 250 is 125 files. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are only infected by worm. Because if they were infected by both, they would be in the B category, but they are not infected by virus. Wait, no, because if a file is infected by both, it's counted in the virus and worm counts, right?\n\nWait, the 125 files not infected by virus implies that all those 125 are only worm infected. Because if a file is infected by both, it's still considered as being infected by a virus, right? So the 125 files are only worm, so W = 125? Wait, but earlier I had W = 2.5 * B. Hmm, but let me check.\n\nWait, the total number of files is 250. All are infected by either virus or worm or both. So the total is V + W + B = 250. But wait, no. Because V is virus only, W is worm only, and B is both. So total is V + W + B = 250.\n\nBut according to the problem, 50% of the files (so 125) were not infected by a virus. That means those 125 are not in V or B. Because if they were in B, they would be infected by virus (since B is both). So the 125 must be W, the worm-only files.\n\nSo W = 125.\n\nBut earlier, we have W = 2.5 * B. So substituting, 125 = 2.5 * B. Let me solve for B.\n\nB = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So B is 50.\n\nNow, what's the total number of files infected by a virus? That would be V + B. Because V is virus only, and B is both.\n\nBut wait, we don't know V yet. Let me see if I can find V.\n\nWe know that the total is V + W + B = 250.\n\nWe have W = 125, B =50. So V + 125 +50 =250 \u2192 V = 250 - 175 =75.\n\nSo V is 75. So the number of files infected by a virus is V + B = 75 +50=125. That makes sense because 50% of 250 is 125.\n\nBut the question is, how many files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nHmm. Wait, files not infected by a worm would be those not in W or B. Because W is worm only, and B is both. So the only files not infected by a worm are the ones not in W or B. But wait, all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. So the only way a file is not infected by a worm is if it's only virus. Because if it's only virus, then it's not worm. So the number of files not infected by a worm is V.\n\nWait, because V is virus only, they are not worm only or both.

Hmm, I need to find out how many files were not infected by a worm. Let's see... I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram approach here.\n\nWait, the problem says that all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So, that means the total number of files is the union of the virus-infected and worm-infected files. So, the formula I think is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But in this case, the total is 250, so 250 = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|.\n\nBut I'm given some other info. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. So, the only worm-infected files are 2.5 times the both. Let me define some variables to make this clearer.\n\nLet me call the number of files infected by both as x. Then, the number of files only infected by a worm is 2.5x. Because if both is x, then worm-only is 2.5x. Also, the problem states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Since there are 250 files, 50% of 250 is 125. So, 125 files are not infected by a virus, meaning they are only worm-infected, right? Because if a file isn't infected by a virus, it can't be in the virus set. So, that must mean those 125 are only worm.\n\nWait, wait a second. Because if 50% are not virus, that's 125. So those 125 are only worm. So from earlier, the only worm is 2.5x. So 2.5x = 125. Let me solve for x. Dividing both sides by 2.5, x = 125 / 2.5. Hmm, 125 divided by 2.5. Let me calculate that. 2.5 times 50 is 125, so x is 50. So the number of files infected by both is 50.\n\nNow, knowing that, let's find the number of files only worm is 2.5x which is 125, which matches the 50% not infected by virus. So that checks out.\n\nNext, I think I need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. Because the question is asking for that. So, not infected by a worm would be the files only virus plus those neither, but wait, all files are infected by at least one. So, no files are uninfected by both. So, files not infected by worm are only the virus-only files.\n\nWait, no. Because the total is 250. If some are only virus, some only worm, and some both. So the number not infected by worm is only virus.\n\nSo, how do I find the number of virus-only files?\n\nWell, the total number of files is the sum of only virus, only worm, and both. So:\n\nTotal = only virus + only worm + both.\n\nWe know that only worm is 125, both is 50. So:\n\n250 = only virus + 125 + 50.\n\nSo, only virus = 250 - 125 -50 = 75. So, 75 files are only virus.\n\nTherefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is 75. So looking at the options, option C is 75.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, the question is about files not infected by a worm. So, that's only the virus-only files because any file with a worm (either only worm or both) is infected by a worm. So, yes, the only ones not infected by worm are the virus-only.\n\nSo, the calculation was 250 = (only virus) + (only worm) + (both). Only worm is 125, both is 50. So only virus is 75.

So that means every file has at least one of the two. No files are completely clean, I guess.\n\nThe first piece of information is that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Let me break that down. So, if I let the number of files infected by both be, say, B, then the number of files infected only by the worm is 2.5B. Because it's 2.5 times B.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm setting this up right. So, the files can be in three categories: only virus (V), only worm (W), and both (B). Since every file is in at least one, V + W + B = 250.\n\nBut the problem says the number of worm-only files is 2.5 times the both category. So W = 2.5B.\n\nAnother piece of info is that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Oh, so 50% of 250 is 125 files not infected by a virus.

No, because the problem says all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So the 125 files are the worm-only files.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So W = 125.

V is only virus. So the number of files infected by a virus is V + B. Because some files have both. So virus-infected files = V + B =75 +50=125.\n\nBut the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So that would mean 50% are not, which is 125, which matches because 250 - 125 =125.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 50% not infected by a virus would be the files without virus.

Because 50% of 250 is 125, and those files are only worm.\n\nBut earlier I thought W is 2.5B. So if W is 125, then 2.5B = 125. Let me solve for B.\n\nSo B = 125 / 2.5. Hmm, 125 divided by 2.5. Let's see, 2.5 * 50 is 125. So B is 50.\n\nSo now I know B is 50, which is the number of files infected by both.\n\nNow, the total number of files is V + W + B = 250. Wait, but V is the number of files only infected by virus, right? Because the ones not in both.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. So, V is the number of files only virus, W is only worm, and B is both. So total is V + W + B.\n\nWe know W is 125, B is 50. So V + 125 +50 =250. So V = 250 - 175 =75.\n\nWait, but wait. V is only virus. So the number of files infected by a virus is V + B. Because some files have both. So virus-infected files = V + B =75 +50=125.\n\nBut the problem says that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. So that would mean 50% are not, which is 125, which matches because 250 - 125 =125.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the 50% not infected by a virus would be the files without virus. So those are the worm-only files, which is W=125.\n\nSo that makes sense. Now, the question is: how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\nFiles not infected by a worm would be the files that don't have worm. So that would be the only virus files, V, because those files don't have worm. So V is 75.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. So, the files not infected by a worm are the ones that are only virus. Because if a file has a worm, it's either only worm or both. So the not worm files are only virus, which is V=75. So the answer is 75.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 75. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal files: 250.\n\nW = 125 (50% not virus, so only worm).\n\nB = W / 2.5 =125 /2.5=50.\n\nV = 250 - W - B =250-125-50=75.\n\nSo files not infected by worm: V =75. So answer is C.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think that's correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Total files**: 250, all of which are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both.\n\n2. **Files not infected by a virus**: 50% of 250 is 125. These files are only infected by a worm, so the number of files infected only by a worm (W) is 125.\n\n3. **Relationship between W and B**: The number of files infected only by a worm (W) is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm (B). Thus, \\( W = 2.5B \\). Substituting \\( W = 125 \\), we solve for \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{W}{2.5} = \\frac{125}{2.5} = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Files infected only by a virus (V)**: The total number of files is the sum of files infected only by a virus, only by a worm, and by both:\n   \\[\n   V + W + B = 250\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( W = 125 \\) and \\( B = 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   V + 125 + 50 = 250 \\implies V = 250 - 175 = 75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Files not infected by a worm**: These are the files infected only by a virus (V). From the calculation above, \\( V = 75 \\).\n\nThus, the number of files not infected by a worm is **75**, corresponding to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
