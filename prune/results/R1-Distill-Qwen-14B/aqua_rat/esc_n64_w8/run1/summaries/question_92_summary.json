      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a telephone bill that's partly fixed and partly variable based on the number of calls. Hmm, I think I remember that this kind of problem is usually about figuring out the fixed cost and the variable cost per call. Right, the bill has two components: a fixed amount that doesn't change regardless of the number of calls, and a variable part that depends on how many calls you make.\n\nLet me read the question again. So, in the first month, there were 540 calls, and the bill was Rs.1800. In another month, 620 calls led to a bill of Rs.2040. They want to find out what the bill would be for a month where only 500 calls were made.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the fixed cost and the variable cost per call. Let's denote the fixed cost as F and the variable cost per call as V. Then, the total bill can be expressed as F + V * number of calls.\n\nSo for the first scenario: F + 540V = 1800.\n\nSecond scenario: F + 620V = 2040.\n\nI can set up these two equations and solve for F and V. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F.\n\nSo, (F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800.\n\nThat simplifies to 80V = 240. Oh wait, because 620 - 540 is 80, and 2040-1800 is 240. So 80V = 240.\n\nDividing both sides by 80: V = 240 /80 = 3. So each call costs Rs.3.\n\nNow that I know V is 3, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find F. Let's use the first one: F + 540 *3 = 1800.\n\nCalculating 540 *3: 540 *3 is 1620. So F + 1620 = 1800. Subtract 1620 from both sides: F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. So the fixed cost is Rs.180.\n\nNow the question is, what's the bill when there are 500 calls? So F + 500V = 180 + 500*3.\n\nCalculating 500*3: 1500. Then 180 +1500 = 1680. So the bill should be Rs.1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is Rs.1680. So that's the answer.\n",

Second month: 620 calls, bill is Rs.2040. I remember that for such problems, the total cost is usually the sum of a fixed cost plus a variable cost per unit.

So I think that means it's a mixed cost, right? Like, there's a base cost no matter how many calls you make, plus a variable cost per call.\n\nThe problem gives me two scenarios. In the first month, 540 calls lead to a bill of Rs.1800. The next month, 620 calls result in a bill of Rs.2040. And then the question is asking what the bill would be if only 500 calls are made in another month. The options are A to E, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. I remember from algebra that this kind of problem can be solved using linear equations. The total bill (B) would be the fixed cost (F) plus the variable cost per call (V) multiplied by the number of calls (C). So the equation is B = F + V*C.\n\nI have two equations here. The first is 1800 = F + 540V, and the second is 2040 = F + 620V. Since both equations have F and V, I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate F and solve for V.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: 2040 - 1800 = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V). So that's 240 = 80V. Wait, because 620V minus 540V is 80V. So 80V equals 240. Dividing both sides by 80 gives V = 3. So the variable cost per call is 3 rupees.\n\nNow that I know V, I can plug it back into one of the original equations to find F. Let's use the first one: 1800 = F + 540*3. Calculating 540 times 3, that's 1620. So 1800 = F + 1620. Subtracting 1620 from both sides gives F = 180.\n\nSo the fixed cost is 180 rupees, and each call adds 3 rupees. Now, for the third month where they made 500 calls, the bill should be F + 500V. Let's compute that: 180 + 500*3. 500 times 3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 1680.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a telephone bill, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. So that means the total bill has two parts: a fixed cost that doesn't change regardless of how many calls are made, and a variable cost that depends on the number of calls.\n\nIn the first scenario, when there are 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800. Another month, with 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040. And the question is asking what the bill would be if 500 calls are made. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, I think this is a problem involving linear equations. Since the bill is fixed plus variable, I can model it as Total Bill = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Call \u00d7 Number of Calls). So, if I let F be the fixed cost and V be the variable cost per call, then the equation would be:\n\nTotal = F + V \u00d7 Calls.\n\nWe have two data points, so I can set up two equations and solve for F and V.\n\nFirst equation: 540 calls \u2192 1800 = F + 540V.\nSecond equation: 620 calls \u2192 2040 = F + 620V.\n\nNow, I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. Let's do that:\n\n2040 - 1800 = (F + 620V) - (F + 540V)\n240 = (620V - 540V)\n240 = 80V.\n\nSo, V = 240 / 80 = 3. So the variable cost per call is Rs.3.\n\nNow, plug V back into one of the equations to find F. Let's use the first equation:\n\n1800 = F + 540 \u00d7 3.\n540 \u00d7 3 is 1620. So, 1800 = F + 1620.\n\nSubtract 1620 from both sides: F = 1800 - 1620 = 180.\n\nSo, the fixed cost is Rs.180, and the variable cost is Rs.3 per call.\n\nNow, the question asks for the bill when 500 calls are made. Using the same formula:\n\nTotal = F + V \u00d7 Calls = 180 + 3 \u00d7 500.\n\nCalculate 3 \u00d7 500 = 1500. Then add the fixed cost: 180 + 1500 = 1680.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. 500 \u00d73 is 1500, yes. 1500 + 180 is 1680. So the bill should be Rs.1680. Looking at the options, option B is 1680.\n",
