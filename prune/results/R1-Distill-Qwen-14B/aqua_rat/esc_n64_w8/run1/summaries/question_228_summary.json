      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that there are balls marked from 1 to n. We need to find n such that the number of ways to select two balls without picking the one marked 3 is 45. Oh right, combinations, I think. \n\nWait, so the total number of ways to choose two balls from n is C(n,2), which is n(n-1)/2. But we have a condition: we shouldn't pick the ball numbered 3. So maybe I should subtract the cases where 3 is chosen.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of ways without choosing 3 is the same as choosing two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because if we exclude ball 3, there are n-1 balls left. So the number of ways is C(n-1, 2).\n\nAnd the problem says this equals 45. So C(n-1, 2) = 45. Let me write that down.\n\nC(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nHmm, solving for n. So (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nLet me compute 90 as the product of two consecutive integers. Let's see, 9*10 is 90. Wait, no, 9*10 is 90, but wait, (n-1) and (n-2) are consecutive numbers. So let me see, if (n-1)(n-2) = 90, then what numbers multiply to 90 and are consecutive? Let's think: 9 and 10? Wait, 9*10 is 90. So n-1=10 and n-2=9. That would make n-1=10 \u2192 n=11.\n\nWait, but let me check. If n=11, then n-1=10, n-2=9. So (10)(9)/2 = 45. Yes, that's correct. So the value of n should be 11. So the answer is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, another way to think: if I include the total combinations and subtract the cases where 3 is picked. Let me see. The total ways without any restrictions is C(n,2). The number of ways where 3 is picked is C(n-1,1), because once you pick 3, you choose one more from the remaining n-1. So total ways without 3 is C(n,2) - (n-1).\n\nSo according to the problem, C(n,2) - (n-1) =45.\n\nLet me compute that. C(n,2) is n(n-1)/2. So:\n\nn(n-1)/2 - (n-1) =45.\n\nFactor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)(n/2 -1) =45.\n\nHmm, maybe I can write it as (n-1)(n -2)/2 =45. Which brings me back to the same equation as before. So (n-1)(n-2) =90. Which again gives n=11. So that's consistent.\n\nSo yeah, n is 11, which is option A.\n",

The problem says that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one marked 3 is 45. I need to find n, which is the total number of balls.\n\nHmm, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the number of ways to choose k items from a set of m items is given by the combination formula C(m, k) = m!/(k!(m-k)!).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose any two balls from n would be C(n, 2). But wait, the problem specifies that the ball number 3 is not selected. So, how do I calculate that?\n\nOh right! If we can't select ball 3, then the number of available balls is n-1. So the number of ways to choose two balls without including 3 would be C(n-1, 2). And this is equal to 45 according to the problem.\n\nSo, the equation is C(n-1, 2) = 45.

Hmm, the question says there are balls marked from 1 to n, and the number of ways to select two balls without picking the one marked 3 is 45. I need to find n.\n\nWait, right. So the total number of ways to choose any two balls without any restrictions would be the combination of n taken 2 at a time. But here, we have a restriction: the ball numbered 3 can't be selected. So the number of valid pairs is the total pairs minus the ones that include ball 3.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as selecting two balls from all except ball 3. Because if 3 isn't selected, then we're only choosing from the other balls. Oh, right! So the number of ways to choose two balls when ball 3 is excluded is equal to the combination of (n-1) choose 2. Because we're excluding one ball, so there are n-1 balls left, and we pick two.\n\nWait, wait. Let me make sure. The problem says \"the ball with number 3 is not selected.\" So when we count the ways where 3 is not selected, it's the same as choosing any two from the remaining n-1 balls.

There are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 isn't selected. I need to find the value of n.\n\nHmm, right. So, the key point is that when we're choosing two balls, we must exclude the ball numbered 3. Let me think about combinations here because the order doesn't matter in selecting the balls.\n\nWait, combinations. Oh right, the number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n, 2). But since we're excluding the ball numbered 3, that means we're choosing from n-1 balls. Because if there are n balls, and we can't pick 3, we're left with n-1 balls.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose two balls without including 3 would be C(n-1, 2). And the problem states that this equals 45. So, I can set up the equation C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nNow, the combination formula C(k, 2) is k*(k-1)/2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked from 1 to n. There are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball with number 3 isn't selected. I need to find the value of n.\n\nHmm, right. So, the key point is that when we're choosing two balls, we must exclude the ball numbered 3. Let me think about combinations here because the order doesn't matter in selecting the balls.\n\nWait, combinations. Oh right, the number of ways to choose two balls from n is given by the combination formula C(n, 2). But since we're excluding the ball numbered 3, that means we're choosing from n-1 balls. Because if there are n balls, and we can't pick 3, we're left with n-1 balls.\n\nSo the number of ways to choose two balls without including 3 would be C(n-1, 2). And the problem states that this equals 45. So, I can set up the equation C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nNow, the combination formula C(k, 2) is k*(k-1)/2. So substituting that in, I get:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nLet me solve this equation for n.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nSubtracting 90 from both sides:\n\nn\u00b2 -3n -88 =0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2 because the equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88=0, so a=1, b=-3, c=-88.\n\nWait, let me compute the discriminant correctly. The discriminant D is b\u00b2 -4ac. So here, a=1, b=-3, c=-88.\n\nD = (-3)^2 -4*(1)*(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361.\n\nThe square root of 361 is 19. So, n = [3 \u00b119]/2.\n\nSo two possible solutions:\n\nn = (3 +19)/2 = 22/2 = 11.\n\nn = (3 -19)/2 = (-16)/2 = -8.\n\nBut since n can't be negative, we discard -8. So n=11.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 11. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n=11, then the number of ways to choose two balls without 3 is C(10,2). Let's calculate that.\n\nC(10,2) = 10*9/2 = 90/2=45. Which matches the given condition.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about balls in a box and combinations. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: A box contains balls marked from 1 to n. There are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected. What is n?\n\nHmm, right. So we're dealing with combinations because the order of selection doesn't matter here\u2014when you pick two balls, it's just a pair, not a sequence. The key point is that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected in any of these pairs.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of ways to choose any two balls from n would be the combination of n taken 2 at a time, which is n choose 2. But wait, the problem says that the number of ways without selecting ball 3 is 45. So I need to find how many ways there are to choose two balls when ball 3 is excluded.\n\nSo if ball 3 isn't selected, that means we're only choosing from the other balls. How many balls are there excluding ball 3? Well, if there are n balls in total, excluding one (ball 3) leaves us with (n-1) balls. So the number of ways to choose two balls from these (n-1) would be (n-1) choose 2, right?\n\nSo mathematically, that's (n-1 choose 2) = 45.\n\nWait, let me write that formula down. The combination formula is n! / (k! (n-k)!), where k is the number we're choosing. So for (n-1) choose 2, it would be (n-1)(n-2)/2 because 2! is 2, and the rest cancels out. So (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45.\n\nSo now I have the equation (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Because 45 * 2 is 90.\n\nNow I need to solve for n. Let's expand the left side: (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 -3n +2. So n\u00b2 -3n +2 =90.\n\nSubtracting 90 from both sides gives n\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Wait, because the equation is n\u00b2 -3n -88=0, so a=1, b=-3, c=-88. So discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (9) -4*(1)*(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361. Square root of 361 is 19.\n\nSo n = [3 \u00b1 19]/2. That gives two solutions: (3+19)/2=22/2=11, and (3-19)/2= -16/2= -8. Since n can't be negative, we take n=11.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If n is 11, then (n-1) is 10, so 10 choose 2 is (10*9)/2=45. Oh yeah, that's correct. So n must be 11.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 11. So the answer should be A.\n",
