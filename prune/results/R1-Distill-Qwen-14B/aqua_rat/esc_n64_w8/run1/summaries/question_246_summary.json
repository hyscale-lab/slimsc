      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. Now, if we pick five registered voters at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted?\n\nHmm, right. So this sounds like a binomial probability problem. I remember that the binomial formula is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes, like success or failure. In this case, each voter either voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). \n\nThe formula for the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by:\n\nP = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this problem, n is 5 because we're choosing five voters. We want exactly four to have voted, so k is 4. The probability p is 0.9, right? Because 90% chance they voted.\n\nSo let me plug these numbers into the formula. First, I need to calculate C(5,4). C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials. The formula for combinations is n!/(k! (n-k)! )\n\nSo C(5,4) is 5!/(4! * (5-4)!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1) * (1) ) = 5/1 = 5. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recalculate. 5! is 120, 4! is 24, 1! is 1. So 120/(24*1) = 5. Oh, yes, that's correct. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4 is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9. Let me calculate step by step: 0.9 *0.9 is 0.81. Then 0.81 *0.9 is 0.729. Then 0.729 *0.9 is 0.6561. So that's approximately 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) = 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow multiply all these together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me compute that. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805. Then multiply by 0.1: 3.2805 * 0.1 is 0.32805.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 0.32805, which is 32.805%. Looking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which is very close. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check each step. \n\nC(5,4) is definitely 5. 0.9^4, I did that correctly as 0.6561. 0.1^1 is 0.1. Multiplying 5 * 0.6561 gives 3.2805, and then times 0.1 gives 0.32805, which is 32.8%. Yep, that all checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer is B.\n",

Now, if five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election? The options are A through E, with various percentages.\n\nHmm, okay. So I think this is a binomial probability problem because each voter can be considered a Bernoulli trial with two possible outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success, p, is 0.9, and the number of trials, n, is 5.\n\nWait, right, the formula for the binomial probability is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). So in this case, k is 4 because we want exactly four voters who voted.\n\nLet me jot that down. So n is 5, k is 4, p is 0.9. So I'll need to compute C(5,4) multiplied by (0.9)^4 multiplied by (0.1)^(5-4).\n\nFirst, what's C(5,4)? That's the combination of 5 things taken 4 at a time. I think the formula for combinations is n! / (k! (n-k)! ). So 5! is 120, 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1!, which is 1. So 120/(24 * 1) )= 5. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, (0.9)^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9^1 is 0.9, ^2 is 0.81, ^3 is 0.729, ^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen, (0.1)^(1) is 0.1.\n\nSo putting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me compute that. 5 times 0.6561 is 3.2805.

And 0.1 is right because (1-0.9) is 0.1, and (5-4)=1.\n\nSo yeah, 5 * 0.6561 = 3.2805, times 0.1 is 0.32805, which is 32.8% when converted to percentage. So option B is the one.\n\n\nThe problem involves calculating the probability of exactly 4 out of 5 randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voting in the last election, given a 90% chance of voting. This is a binomial probability problem, where each trial (voter) has two outcomes: voted (success) or did not vote (failure).\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = C(n, k) \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (number of trials),\n- \\( k = 4 \\) (number of successes),\n- \\( p = 0.9 \\) (probability of success),\n- \\( C(n, k) \\) is the combination of \\( n \\) things taken \\( k \\) at a time.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( C(5, 4) \\), the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 4) = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{(4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1) \\cdot 1} = 5\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( p^k = (0.9)^4 \\). Breaking this down:\n\\[\n0.9^2 = 0.81, \\quad 0.81 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.729, \\quad 0.729 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.6561\n\\]\nSo, \\( (0.9)^4 = 0.6561 \\).\n\nThen, calculate \\( (1-p)^{n-k} = (0.1)^1 = 0.1 \\).\n\nNow, multiply all components together:\n\\[\nP(4) = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.06561 = 0.32805\n\\]\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n\\[\n0.32805 \\approx 32.8\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five voters voted in the last election is **32.8%**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.\n\nThe question is about finding the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election. They told us that there's a 90% chance any given registered voter voted. So, each person has a 90% chance (which is 0.9) of voting, and a 10% chance (0.1) of not voting.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. I remember that binomial distribution is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each voter either voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success is the same each time, which is 0.9, and we're choosing five voters, so n=5 trials.\n\nThe formula for the binomial probability is: \n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. \n\nSo here, we need to find the probability that exactly four voted, which is k=4. Let's plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(5,4). That's the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. The formula for combinations is n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo, 5! is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. 4! is 24, and (5-4)! is 1! which is 1. So, 120/(24*1) = 5. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4: 0.9*0.9 is 0.81, then 0.81*0.9 is 0.729, and 0.729*0.9 is 0.6561. Wait, wait, no, wait. 0.9^4 is actually 0.9 multiplied four times. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 (that's squared)\n0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729 (that's cubed)\n0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561 (that's to the fourth power). So yes, 0.6561.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) which is 0.1^1 = 0.1.\n\nNow, putting it all together: P(4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1.\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5: 0.06561 *5 = 0.32805.\n\nWait, so that's 0.32805, which is approximately 32.805%. Looking at the options, B is 32.8% and C is 43.7%. So the answer should be B, 32.8%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get confused with exponents.\n\nWait, 0.9^4: let me compute it again.\n\n0.9^1 = 0.9\n\n0.9^2 = 0.81\n\n0.9^3 = 0.9 * 0.81 = 0.729\n\n0.9^4 = 0.9 * 0.729 = 0.6561. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen, 0.6561 *0.1 = 0.06561.\n\nMultiply by 5: 0.06561 *5 = 0.32805. So 32.805%, which rounds to 32.8%, which is option B.\n\nSo the answer should be option B.\n",

Let me start by reading the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. So each voter has a 90% probability of having voted. Now, the question is asking for the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election.\n\nHmm, right. This seems like a binomial probability problem because each trial (each voter) is independent, and there are a fixed number of trials. Each trial has two possible outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success is the same each time, which is 0.9.\n\nI remember that the binomial probability formula is used for such cases.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that there's a 90% chance a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. So each voter has a 90% probability of having voted. Now, the question is asking for the approximate likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election.\n\nHmm, right. This seems like a binomial probability problem because each trial (each voter) is independent, and there are a fixed number of trials. Each trial has two possible outcomes: voted (success) or didn't vote (failure). The probability of success is the same each time, which is 0.9.\n\nI remember that the binomial probability formula is used for such cases. The formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of exactly k successes in n trials.\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\nIn this case, n is 5 (since we're choosing five voters), k is 4 (exactly four voted), p is 0.9.\n\nSo let me plug in the numbers. First, I'll calculate C(5,4). C(n,k) is n!/(k!(n-k)!), so 5!/(4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/(4*3*2*1 * 1) )= 5. So C(5,4) is 5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81. 0.81 * 0.9 is 0.729, and *0.9 again is 0.6561.

If five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election?\n\nThe options are A to E, with various percentages. Hmm. I think this is a binomial probability problem. Yeah, because each voter is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: voted or didn't vote.\n\nSo, binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Right. Where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success.\n\nIn this case, n is 5 because we're choosing five voters. We want exactly four to have voted, so k is 4. The probability of success p is 90%, which is 0.9.\n\nLet me plug the numbers in. First, calculate the combination part. C(5,4) is the number of ways to choose 4 successes out of 5 trials. I remember that C(n, k) is n! / (k! (n-k)!)). So 5! is 120, 4! is 24, and 1! is 1. So 120/(24*1) = 5. So C(5,4)=5.\n\nNext, p^k is 0.9^4. Let me calculate that. 0.9 squared is 0.81, squared again is 0.81 * 0.81. Hmm, 0.81 * 0.8 is 0.648, and 0.81 * 0.01 is 0.0081. So adding them gives 0.648 + 0.0081 = 0.6561. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.81 * 0.81 is actually 0.6561. Oh, right, because 80^2 is 6400, but wait, 0.81 * 0.81 is 0.6561. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nThen, (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4)=0.1^1=0.1.\n\nNow, multiply all parts together. 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let's do that step by step. 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805. Then multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805. So that's approximately 0.328, which is 32.8%.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%, so that's the answer.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd (0.1)^1 is 0.1. So 5 * 0.6561 = 3.2805. Then 3.2805 * 0.1 = 0.32805. So 32.805%, which rounds to 32.8%. So option B is correct.\n\nI think that's it.

Compute \\( p^k = 0.9^4 \\). Calculating step-by-step:\n   \\[\n   0.9^2 = 0.81, \\quad 0.9^3 = 0.729, \\quad 0.9^4 = 0.6561\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute \\( (1-p)^{n-k} = 0.1^{1} = 0.1 \\).\n\n4. Multiply all terms together:\n   \\[\n   P(4) = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 5 \\cdot 0.06561 = 0.32805\n   \\]\n\nThe probability is approximately \\( 32.8\\% \\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",
