      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says a rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15 is inscribed in a sphere, and all eight vertices are on the sphere. I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, right, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is the same as the solid's space diagonal. \n\nWait, what's a space diagonal? Oh right, it's the longest diagonal that runs from one corner of the rectangular solid to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the solid. So the formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular solid with sides a, b, c is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). \n\nLet me write that down. So the space diagonal d = sqrt(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 15\u00b2). Let's compute each part step by step. 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 is 250. So d = sqrt(250). \n\nWhat's sqrt(250)? Well, 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh wait, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623. So 5 times that would be 15.8115. Wait, but the options are given, let me check the options again. Option B is 15.8113, which is close to that. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The problem asks for the diameter of the sphere. Oh wait, wait no, the space diagonal is the diameter, right? Because the sphere's diameter is the maximum distance between any two points on the sphere, which would be the two opposite vertices of the solid. So the space diagonal is indeed the diameter of the sphere. \n\nSo the diameter is 5*sqrt(10) which is approximately 15.8113. Looking at the options, option B is 15.8113. So the answer should be B. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations. Let me recalculate the squares: 3\u00b2 is 9, 4\u00b2 is 16, 15\u00b2 is 225. 9+16=25, 25+225=250. So sqrt(250) is correct. And sqrt(250) is indeed 5*sqrt(10), which is about 5*3.1623. 5 times 3 is 15, 5 times 0.1623 is about 0.8115. So 15 + 0.8115 is 15.8115, which matches option B's 15.8113. Maybe it's rounded down a bit, but that's the closest. \n\nSo yeah, the diameter of the sphere is 5\u221a10, which is approximately 15.8113. So the correct answer is option B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. The solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15. I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, I remember that when a solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices touch the sphere's surface. That means the sphere's diameter should be equal to the solid's space diagonal.\n\nWait, right! The space diagonal of a rectangular solid is the longest diagonal that goes from one corner to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the solid. So to find the diameter of the sphere, I just need to calculate that space diagonal.\n\nThe formula for the space diagonal (d) of a rectangular solid with sides a, b, c is d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Oh yeah, that's right. So plugging in the given dimensions: a=3, b=4, c=15.\n\nLet me compute each squared value. 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those up: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 gives 250. So the square of the diagonal is 250. Taking the square root of 250 gives me the diagonal length.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 250? Hmm, 15 squared is 225, 16 squared is 256. So it's somewhere between 15 and 16. Let me calculate it more accurately. 250 is 25 times 10, so sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). Oh, right, because sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623.\n\nSo 5 multiplied by 3.1623 is about 15.8115. That's the diagonal. Since the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal, the diameter is approximately 15.8115.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113, which is really close.

So yes, sqrt(250) is indeed the space diagonal. So the diameter is sqrt(250) which is approximately 15.8113. So the correct answer is option B.\n\n\nTo determine the diameter of the sphere in which a rectangular solid with dimensions \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 15\\) is inscribed, we calculate the space diagonal of the solid. The formula for the space diagonal \\(d\\) of a rectangular solid with dimensions \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given dimensions \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 15\\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{9 + 16 + 225}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{250}\n\\]\n\nApproximating \\(\\sqrt{250}\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{250} \\approx 15.8113\n\\]\n\nSince the space diagonal of the solid is equal to the diameter of the sphere, the diameter of the sphere is approximately \\(15.8113\\). Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: B**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again. It says a rectangular solid with dimensions 3 x 4 x 15 is inscribed in a sphere, meaning all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. I need to find the diameter of the sphere. The options are given, but I should figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, I remember that when a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the solid's space diagonal. So the space diagonal of the rectangular solid is the same as the sphere's diameter. That makes sense because the space diagonal would stretch from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere, which is the diameter.\n\nWait, right, the formula for the space diagonal (d) of a rectangular solid with length l, width w, and height h is d = sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2). So I just need to plug in the dimensions into this formula.\n\nLet me write down the dimensions: 3, 4, 15. So l=3, w=4, h=15.\n\nCalculating each square: 3^2 is 9, 4^2 is 16, and 15^2 is 225. Adding them up: 9 +16 is 25, and 25 +225 is 250. So the square of the diagonal is 250. Taking the square root of 250 gives the diagonal length.\n\nWait, what's the square root of 250? Let me think. I know that 15^2 is 225 and 16^2 is 256. So sqrt(250) is between 15 and 16. Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\n250 is 25 * 10, so sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10). Because 25 is 5 squared, so sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Oh right, that's a better way. Now, what is sqrt(10) approximately? I remember it's about 3.16227766.\n\nSo 5 * 3.16227766 equals approximately 15.8113883. So that's the space diagonal. Since the diameter is equal to this, the sphere's diameter is approximately 15.8113.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the squares: 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, 15 squared is 225. 9+16=25, 25+225=250. Yep, that's right. Square root of 250 is 5\u221a10, which is approximately 15.8113. So option B is the right choice.\n",
