      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a salesperson and their commission. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. \n\nAlright, the question says the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale. They want to know how many sales of $250 each they need to make to reach at least a $1000 salary. The options are A to E, with numbers like 15, 24, 25, etc.\n\nWait, so the commission is 10% per sale. Each sale is $250. So for each sale, the commission would be 10% of 250, right? Let me calculate that. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250. Oh, that's 25 dollars per sale. Okay, so each sale gives them $25 in commission.\n\nThey want their total salary to be at least $1000. So I need to find the number of sales needed so that the total commission is >=1000. Let me represent the number of sales as 'x'. So the equation would be 25 * x >= 1000.\n\nWait, let me write that down. 25x \u2265 1000. To find x, I divide both sides by 25. So x \u2265 1000 /25. What's 1000 divided by 25? Let me calculate. 25 times 40 is 1000 because 25*40=1000. So x must be at least 40.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Each sale is $250, 10% is 25. So 40 sales would be 40 *25 = 1000. Exactly $1000. So yes, that meets the requirement of at least 1000.\n\nIs there any possibility that I missed something? Like, maybe the commission is calculated differently? No, the question says 10% on each sale. So each sale is 250, 10% is 25. So yeah, 40 sales make 1000.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again: A is 15, which would give 15*25=375. That's way too low. B is 24, so 24*25=600. Still below 1000. C is 25, that's 625. Still no. D is 40, which is exactly 1000. E is 52, which would be 1300. So 40 is the minimum number needed.\n",

That means for every sale, they get 10% of $250. Wait, wait, 10% of 250 is how much? Let me calculate that. 10% is the same as 0.10, so 0.10 * 250 equals 25. Oh right, so each sale gives them $25.\n\nNow, they want their total salary to be at least $1000. So I need to find out how many sales (let's call that number 'n') multiplied by $25 will equal or exceed $1000. So the equation would be 25n >= 1000.\n\nTo find 'n', I can rearrange this. Divide both sides by 25. So n >= 1000 / 25. Let me do that division. 1000 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 40 is 1000, right? Because 25*40 = 1000. So n must be at least 40. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. If he makes 40 sales, each at $250, his commission would be 40 * 25 = 1000. So that's exactly $1000. The question says \"at least\" $1000, so 40 is the minimum number of sales needed. \n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 40. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. Yeah, D is 40.

So for each sale, the person makes 10% of 250. Let me compute that. 10% is 0.1, so 0.1 * 250 equals... 25. So each sale gives them $25.\n\nNow, they want the total salary to be at least $1000. So I guess I need to find the number of sales, let's call it 'n', such that 25 times n is equal to or greater than 1000. So the equation is 25n \u2265 1000.\n\nTo find 'n', I'll divide both sides by 25. That gives n \u2265 1000 / 25. Let me do that division. 1000 divided by 25 is... 40. So n has to be at least 40. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 40. So that's the answer? But wait, wait, let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again. Each sale is $250. 10% of 250 is 25. So per sale, commission is 25. So n times 25 must be >= 1000. So n >= 1000 /25 =40. Yes, that's correct. So the salesperson needs to make 40 sales. So the answer is D.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. So D is 40. So that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Sometimes these problems might have a base salary or something else, but the question says the salary is based solely on the commission. It says the person gets a 10% commission on each sale, and we're calculating the number needed to reach at least $1000. So I think my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 10% of 250 is 25. To reach 1000, how many 25s make up 1000? 25 *40 is 1000. So yes, 40 sales.\n\n\nTo determine how many sales of $250 each the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we start by calculating the commission per sale. The salesperson earns a 10% commission on each sale, so the commission per sale is:\n\n\\[\n0.10 \\times 250 = 25 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe total earnings from commissions must be at least $1000. Let \\( n \\) represent the number of sales. The equation for total earnings is:\n\n\\[\n25n \\geq 1000.\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( n \\), divide both sides by 25:\n\n\\[\nn \\geq \\frac{1000}{25} = 40.\n\\]\n\nThus, the salesperson must make at least 40 sales. Among the given options, the correct answer is:\n\n**A) 15** \u2014 Incorrect, as 15 sales would only yield $375.  \n**B) 24** \u2014 Incorrect, as 24 sales would only yield $600.  \n**C) 25** \u2014 Incorrect, as 25 sales would only yield $625.  \n**D) 40** \u2014 Correct, as 40 sales yield exactly $1000.  \n**E) 52** \u2014 Incorrect, as 52 sales would exceed the required salary.\n\nTherefore, the salesperson needs to make **40 sales** to reach a salary of at least $1000.\n\nAnswer: D",
