      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a jeep traveling a certain distance. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that the jeep takes 6 hours for the forward journey. Then on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. I need to find the distance it traveled.\n\nWait, the distance for both journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going somewhere and coming back. So, the distance is the same for both the forward and return trips.\n\nLet me think about the variables involved. Let's denote the speed during the forward journey as 'v' km/hr. Then, the speed during the return journey would be 'v + 12' km/hr.\n\nSince distance equals speed multiplied by time, for the forward journey, the distance D would be v multiplied by 6 hours. So, D = v * 6.\n\nFor the return journey, the distance is the same, so D is also equal to (v + 12) multiplied by 4 hours. So, D = (v + 12) * 4.\n\nNow, since both expressions equal D, I can set them equal to each other. So, v * 6 = (v + 12) * 4.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\nExpanding the right side: 6v = 4v + 48.\n\nHmm, subtract 4v from both sides to get 2v = 48.\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives v = 24 km/hr.\n\nSo, the speed during the forward journey is 24 km/hr. Now, to find the distance, I can plug this back into either of the two expressions for D. Let's use the forward journey one: D = 24 * 6.\n\n24 times 6 is 144. So, the distance is 144 km.\n\nWait, let me double-check with the return journey. The return speed is 24 + 12 = 36 km/hr. Time is 4 hours, so 36 * 4 = 144. Yep, same answer. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 144 km. So the correct answer should be B.\n",

Then on the return trip, it increases its speed by 12 km/hr and takes 4 hours. We need to find the distance it traveled. \n\nWait, distance is the same in both directions, right? Because it's going forward and then coming back the same path. So the distance 'd' is the same for both trips.\n\nLet me think about speed, time, and distance. The formula is speed = distance / time. So for the forward journey, the speed would be d divided by 6 hours. Let me write that down: speed1 = d / 6.\n\nOn the return trip, the speed is higher. It says it increased by 12 km/hr, so the new speed is speed1 + 12. And the time taken is 4 hours. So the formula for the return trip would be speed2 = d / 4. Wait, no, because speed2 is speed1 +12.

So I can set up an equation.\n\nSo, let me write that equation: (d/6) + 12 = d/4.\n\nHmm, I need to solve for d. Let's see. To eliminate the fractions, maybe I can find a common denominator.

So the correct answer should be B.\n\n\nThe jeep's forward journey speed is \\( v \\) km/hr, and the distance is \\( 6v \\). On the return journey, the speed is \\( v + 12 \\) km/hr, and the distance is \\( 4(v + 12) \\). Since the distances are equal, we set \\( 6v = 4(v + 12) \\). Solving for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[\n6v = 4v + 48 \\implies 2v = 48 \\implies v = 24 \\, \\text{km/hr}.\n\\]\n\nThe distance for the forward journey is \\( 6v = 6 \\times 24 = 144 \\, \\text{km} \\). The return journey also gives the same distance: \\( 4(v + 12) = 4 \\times 36 = 144 \\, \\text{km} \\). Thus, the distance traveled is **144 km**.\n\nAnswer: B",
