      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. \n\nThe problem states that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find out how heavy that truck is. \n\nHmm, averages. Right, average is the total divided by the number of items. So initially, there are 10 vehicles with an average of 12.2 tons. So the total weight of these vehicles must be 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me calculate that: 10 * 12.2 equals 122 tons. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. And the average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average would be 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those together: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. \n\nWait, wait. No, wait a second. Oh no, no. Wait, does the average increase by 2.6 tons, making it 12.2 + 2.6, which is 14.8? I think that's correct. Because the average went up by 2.6, so yes, 14.8 is the new average.\n\nSo the total weight after adding the truck would be 11 vehicles times the new average. So 11 * 14.8. Let me compute that. 10 times 14.8 is 148, and 1 times 14.8 is 14.8, so 148 + 14.8 = 162.8 tons. \n\nSo the total weight before adding the truck was 122 tons. After adding the truck, it's 162.8 tons. So the weight of the truck must be the difference between these two totals. So 162.8 minus 122. Let me do that subtraction. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8 tons. \n\nWait, wait. That gives me 40.8 tons. Looking at the options, option A is 40.8. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nTotal initial weight: 10 * 12.2 = 122. Correct. New average is 12.2 + 2.6 =14.8. Number of vehicles is 11. 11 *14.8. Let me compute that again. 14.8 times 10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. So the truck is 162.8 -122=40.8. So option A is 40.8. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 41.6. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me think again.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the average increased by 2.6, but perhaps the way the average changes is not as straightforward. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says the average increased by 2.6 after adding the truck. So initial average 12.2, new average 14.8. So that's correct. So the calculations seem right. So 40.8 is the weight of the truck, which is option A. But wait, the options have B as 41.6. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 11*14.8. 14.8 * 10 is 148, 14.8 *1 is 14.8. So 148 +14.8 is 162.8. So 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial average is 12.2, and after adding the truck, the average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. So the truck's weight is 14.8 + (11-1)*12.2? Wait, no. Let me think differently. Another approach: when adding one more item, the increase in total is the new average multiplied by the new count minus the old total. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the new average is (Old total + new weight) / (n+1) = new average. So, solving for the new weight: new weight = (new average)*(n+1) - old total.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: new average is 14.8, n=10, so n+1=11. Old total is 122. So new weight is 14.8 *11 -122. \n\nCalculating 14.8 *11: Let's see, 14 *11 is 154, and 0.8 *11 is 8.8, so 154 +8.8 =162.8. So 162.8 -122=40.8. Yep, same as before.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)40.8 tons. So why is option B 41.6? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial average calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, original average is 12.2, 10 vehicles. 10 *12.2 is 122. Correct. The new average is 14.8, 11 vehicles: 11 *14.8 =162.8. So the difference is 40.8. So yeah, A is correct.\n",

Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, so the initial average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. That means the total weight of all the vehicles together is average multiplied by the number, right? So 10 times 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 * 12.2 is 122 tons total.\n\nNow, when they add a new truck, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The average increases by 2.6 tons, so the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me do that addition. 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons.\n\nSo the new average is 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles. Therefore, the total weight of all 11 vehicles is 14.8 multiplied by 11. Let me compute that. Hmm, 14.8 * 10 is 148, and 14.8 * 1 is 14.8, so adding those gives 148 +14.8=162.8 tons.\n\nWait, so the total weight went from 122 tons to 162.8 tons when the truck was added.

Let me check the addition again. The original average is 12.2, increased by 2.6. 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase is per vehicle?

So the truck must be the original total (122) plus this increase. So 122 +28.6=150.6. Wait, that's different. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the truck's weight is the amount that causes the total to go up, which is more than just the increase in average.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it as the truck's weight equals the new total minus the old total.\n\nOld total: 10 *12.2 =122.\n\nNew total: 11 * (12.2 +2.6)=11 *14.8=162.8.\n\nSo truck's weight is 162.8-122=40.8, which is option A.\n\nSo why is option B 41.6?

But wait, the problem says the average increased by 2.6 after adding the truck. So maybe I should have thought of it differently.\n\nWait another approach: the average went up by 2.6 tons for all 11 vehicles. So the total increase in weight is 2.6 *11=28.6 tons. The truck's weight must be more than the original average. Because adding it increases the total and the average.\n\nSo the truck's weight is equal to the original average plus this increase.

So that's the correct choice.\n\n\nThe average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of these vehicles is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 12.2 = 122 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nWhen a new heavy-duty truck is added, the total number of vehicles becomes 11, and the average weight increases by 2.6 tons to:\n\n\\[\n12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThe total weight of the 11 vehicles is then:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 14.8 = 162.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThe weight of the truck is the difference between the new total weight and the original total weight:\n\n\\[\n162.8 - 122 = 40.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is **40.8 tons**, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Then, when a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nHmm, averages. Right, the average is the total divided by the number of items. So the initial average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. That means the total weight of those 10 vehicles is 12.2 multiplied by 10.

So 11 *14.8. Let me calculate 14.8 *11. Hmm, 14.8 *10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. So total is 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons. So the answer should be A) 40.8.\n\nBut wait, the options also have B)41.6 and others. Did I make a mistake in the average? Let me check the new average again. The original average was 12.2. The increase is 2.6, so 12.2 + 2.6 is indeed 14.8. Yes.\n\nSo the truck's weight is 40.8 tons. So the correct option is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the average weight of vehicles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it again.\n\nThe average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, okay. So initially, there are 10 vehicles. Their average is 12.2 tons. So the total weight of all those vehicles together must be 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12 is 120, and 0.2 times 10 is 2, so 120 +2=122 tons. So the total weight is 122 tons.\n\nNow, when we add a new truck, the number of vehicles becomes 11. And the average increases by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those numbers. 12 + 2 is 14, and 0.2 +0.6 is 0.8, so 14.8 tons. That's the new average.\n\nSo the total weight after adding the truck is 11 vehicles multiplied by 14.8 tons. Let me compute that. 10 times 14.8 is 148, and 1 times 14.8 is 14.8, so together 148 +14.8 = 162.8 tons.\n\nWait, so the total weight before adding the truck was 122 tons, and after adding, it's 162.8 tons. The difference between these two totals should be the weight of the truck. So subtract 122 from 162.8. Let me do that: 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option A is 40.8.

So 11 *14.8. Let me calculate 14.8 *11. Hmm, 14.8 *10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. So total is 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons. So the answer should be A) 40.8.\n\nBut wait, the options also have B)41.6 and others. Did I make a mistake in the average? Let me check the new average again. The original average was 12.2. The increase is 2.6, so 12.2 + 2.6 is indeed 14.8. Yes.\n\nSo the truck's weight is 40.8 tons. So the correct option is A.\n\n\nThe average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight of these vehicles is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 12.2 = 122 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nWhen a new heavy-duty truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11, and the average weight increases by 2.6 tons to:\n\n\\[\n12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThe total weight of the 11 vehicles is then:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 14.8 = 162.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThe weight of the truck is the difference between the total weight after and before adding the truck:\n\n\\[\n162.8 - 122 = 40.8 \\, \\text{tons}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is **40.8 tons**, corresponding to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",

Hmm, the question says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nWait, averages. Right, the average is the total sum divided by the number of items. So first, maybe I should calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles. \n\nSo the average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. The formula for average is (sum of all weights) divided by (number of vehicles). So, sum = average * number. That would be 12.2 * 10, which is 122 tons.
