      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Arjun and Sajal are friends with some money. I need to figure out how much each has. Let me read the problem again.\n\nSo, the first condition is: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, Arun is another name for Arjun, right? So Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nLet me denote Arjun's money as A and Sajal's as S. So after Arjun gives $30, Arjun will have A - 30 left. Sajal will have S + 30. And according to the condition, S + 30 equals twice (A - 30). So the equation is S + 30 = 2*(A -30). Let me write that down:\n\nEquation 1: S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\nThe second condition is: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. So Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Then Arjun has A + 10, and Sajal has S -10. The condition says Arjun's amount is thrice Sajal's. So:\n\nEquation 2: A + 10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. I can solve them simultaneously.\n\nLet me write both equations again:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A + 10 = 3(S -10)\n\nLet me expand equation 1 first. \n\nS + 30 = 2A -60\nBring all terms to left:\nS +30 -2A +60 = 0\nSimplify:\nS -2A +90 = 0 \u2192 S = 2A -90. Let's call this Equation 3.\n\nNow equation 2:\n\nA +10 =3S -30\nBring all terms to left:\nA +10 -3S +30 =0 \u2192 A -3S +40 =0 \u2192 A = 3S -40. Equation 4.\n\nNow, substitute S from Equation 3 into Equation 4.\n\nEquation 4: A =3*(2A -90) -40\nLet me compute that:\n\nA =6A -270 -40 \u2192 A=6A -310\nSubtract 6A from both sides: -5A = -310 \u2192 A = (-310)/(-5) =62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now, substitute A=62 into Equation 3: S=2*62 -90 =124-90=34. So Sajal has $34.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Let's look at the options:\n\nA)62,35 \u2192 S=35, but we got 34.\nB)62,34 \u2192 Yes, that's what I got.\nC)34,62 \u2192 No, that's reversed.\nD)42,62 \u2192 No.\nE)62,42 \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer should be option B)62,34.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFrom Equation 3: S =2A -90. If A=62, S=124-90=34. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: A+10=3(S-10). Let's plug in A=62, S=34.\n\n62+10=72. 3*(34-10)=3*24=72. So 72=72. Correct.\n\nEquation 1: S +30=2*(A-30). 34+30=64. 2*(62-30)=2*32=64. 64=64. Correct.\n\nYes, both conditions are satisfied. So the answer is B)62,34.\n",

I can solve them simultaneously. Let me write them down:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nLet me expand equation 1. S + 30 = 2A - 60. If I rearrange, that gives S = 2A - 60 - 30 \u2192 S = 2A - 90.\n\nWait, let me do that again. Starting from equation 1:\n\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nSubtract 30 from both sides: S = 2A - 90.\n\nEquation 1 solved for S is S = 2A -90.\n\nNow equation 2: A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\nExpanding: A +10 = 3S - 30\nLet's rearrange terms. Bring all terms to one side or express in terms of one variable.\n\nLet me substitute S from equation 1 into equation 2. So, equation 2 becomes:\n\nA + 10 = 3*( (2A -90) -10 )\n\nWait, S is (2A -90), so S -10 is (2A -90 -10) = 2A -100.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(2A -100)\n\nLet me compute the right side: 3*(2A) = 6A, 3*(-100) = -300. So,\n\nA +10 = 6A - 300\n\nNow, bring all A terms to one side and constants to the other.\n\nSubtract A from both sides: 10 = 5A -300.\n\nAdd 300 to both sides: 310 = 5A.\n\nDivide both sides by 5: A = 310 /5 = 62.\n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now, substitute A=62 into equation 1 to find S.\n\nEquation 1: S = 2A -90 \u2192 S = 2*62 -90 = 124 -90 = 34.\n\nWait, so S is 34? So Sajal has $34.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if these values satisfy both scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun: 62-30 = 32. Sajal:34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 32*2=64. So that works.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\n\nSajal:34-10=24. Arjun:62+10=72. Is 72 thrice 24? Yes, because 24*3=72. That also works.\n\nSo the values are A=62, S=34. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is 62,34. Option C is 34,62. So the correct pair is 62 and 34, which is option B.\n\nWait, but wait the options are:\n\nA)62,35\n\nB)62,34\n\nC)34,62\n\nD)42,62\n\nE)62,42\n\nSo option B is Arjun 62, Sajal 34. That's correct.\n\nHmm, but looking back at the problem statement, the first scenario is when Arun (Arjun) gives $30 to Sajal. Oh, wait, the problem says Arun and Sajal, but the variables are Arjun and Sajal. I think that's just a name variation. So Arjun is A, and Sajal is S.\n\nSo yeah, the correct answer is option B: 62 and 34.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much money Arjun and Sajal each have. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. Hmm, okay, I think I got it.\n\nSo, let me break this down. There are two scenarios. In the first scenario, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's money becomes twice what Arjun has left. In the second scenario, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, and then Arjun has thrice as much as Sajal does.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up some equations. Let me assign variables to their current amounts. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\nAfter this, Arjun's money becomes A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal's new amount is twice Arjun's new amount. So, the equation would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2 * (A - 30)\n\nThat's equation one.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun.\nAfter this, Sajal has S - 10, and Arjun has A + 10.

Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. Hmm, okay, so I need to set up equations based on these two scenarios.\n\nLet me assign variables to make this easier. Let's say Arjun has 'A' dollars and Sajal has 'S' dollars initially.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So after this transaction, Arjun's money becomes A - 30, and Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, at this point, Sajal has twice as much as Arjun. So I can write the equation: S + 30 = 2*(A - 30). Let me note that down as equation (1).\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's money becomes S - 10, and Arjun's becomes A + 10. In this case, Arjun has thrice as much as Sajal. So the equation is: A + 10 = 3*(S - 10). I'll call this equation (2).\n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2. A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations to find the values of A and S.\n\nLet me expand equation (1) first. S + 30 = 2A - 60. If I rearrange, that's S = 2A - 60 -30, so S = 2A -90. Let me write that as equation (1a): S = 2A - 90.\n\nNow equation (2): A + 10 = 3S - 30. Rearranging, A = 3S - 30 -10, which is A = 3S -40. Let's call this equation (2a): A = 3S -40.\n\nNow I can substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a). Since equation (1a) gives S in terms of A, but equation (2a) gives A in terms of S. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to substitute S from (1a) into (2a).\n\nWait, let's see. From (1a), S = 2A -90. Let's substitute this into equation (2a), which is A = 3S -40.\n\nSo substituting S:\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\nA = 6A -270 -40\nA = 6A -310\n\nHmm, subtract 6A from both sides:\nA -6A = -310\n-5A = -310\nDivide both sides by -5:\nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62.\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars. Now, let's find S using equation (1a): S = 2A -90.\n\nPlugging A =62:\nS = 2*62 -90 = 124 -90 = 34.\n\nWait, so Arjun has 62 and Sajal has 34. Let me check if these values satisfy both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: Arjun gives 30 to Sajal. Arjun's money becomes 62-30=32, Sajal's becomes 34+30=64. Is 64 equal to twice 32? Yes, because 2*32=64. So that works.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24 left. Arjun gets 10, so 62+10=72. Is 72 equal to thrice 24? Yes, because 3*24=72.

The question gives me two scenarios, and I need to figure out how much each of them has. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, the problem says: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait, Arun is probably a typo and should be Arjun, right? Because the names are Arjun and Sajal. So I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, scenario one: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. Let me denote Arjun's money as A and Sajal's as S. After giving $30, Arjun's money becomes A - 30. Sajal's becomes S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal will have twice as much as Arjun left. So, the equation would be S + 30 = 2*(A - 30). That's equation one.\n\nThe second scenario is if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's money becomes S - 10, and Arjun's becomes A + 10. Then, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal.

Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options: option B is 62,34. Option C is 34,62. So the correct pair should be Arjun 62 and Sajal 34. So the answer is option B.\n\nWait, let me double-check the scenarios to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nArjun has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, because 32*2=64. So that's correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. Is 72 three times 24? Yes, because 24*3=72.

A = 3S - 40\n\nHmm, I can substitute equation 2 into equation 1. Let's do that.\n\nFrom equation 2, A is expressed in terms of S.

Then subtract 90: 6S -80 -90 = 6S -170.\n\nSo equation becomes S = 6S -170.\n\nWait, that's S = 6S - 170. Let's subtract S from both sides:\n\n0 = 5S -170 \u2192 5S = 170 \u2192 S = 34.\n\nSo Sajal has $34.

So the correct pair is Arjun:62, Sajal:34. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, let me verify with both conditions.\n\nFirst condition: Arjun gives 30. Arjun has 62-30=32, Sajal has 34+30=64. Does 64 equal twice 32? Yes, 2*32=64. So that works.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. Does 72 equal thrice 24? 3*24=72. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is option B) 62,34.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem where Arjun and Sajal are friends with some money, and there are two scenarios involving money transfers. I need to figure out how much each has. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem says: \n\n1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.\n2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal.\n\nI think I should assign variables to their current amounts.

Oh, wait, Arun is the same as Arjun, right? Because the names are similar. So, Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's money is twice what Arjun has left.\n\nThen the second condition: if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as what's left with Sajal. Hmm, okay. So these are two different scenarios, and I need to find out how much each has initially.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to set up some equations. Let me assign variables. Let me say that Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars.\n\nSo, first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal.\n\nAfter that, Arjun's money becomes A - 30. And Sajal's money becomes S + 30.

So, Arjun now has A + 10, and Sajal has S - 10. The problem states that Arjun then has thrice as much as Sajal.

So, equation 2 becomes:\n\nA +10 =3*(2A -90) -30.\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n3*(2A) is 6A. 3*(-90) is -270. So, 6A -270.

Subtract A from both sides: 10=5A -300.\n\nAdd 300 to both sides: 310=5A.\n\nSo, A = 310 /5. Let me compute that. 5*62 is 310.
