      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about a shopkeeper selling a watch and giving discounts. Hmm, let me try to understand it step by step. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch. \n\nAlright, the problem states that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. So, the difference between the two profit scenarios is Rs. 15. I need to find the marked price based on this information.\n\nWait, let me think. The marked price is the price before any discount. So, when he gives a 5% discount, the selling price would be 95% of the marked price. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of the marked price. \n\nBut wait, what about the cost price? The problem doesn't give the cost price directly. Oh, but maybe the profit difference can help me find that. Because the difference in selling prices (due to the different discounts) would lead to a difference in profit, which is Rs. 15. \n\nSo, let's denote the marked price as M. The selling price when discount is 5% is 0.95*M, and when discount is 7%, it's 0.93*M. The difference between these two selling prices is 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. \n\nThis 0.02M difference is equal to the Rs. 15 loss in profit. So, 0.02M = 15. Then, solving for M would give me M = 15 / 0.02. Let me compute that: 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, which is 750. So the marked price would be Rs. 750.\n\nWait, looking at the options, D is Rs.750. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait a second, I should make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through it again.\n\nWait, the problem says when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs.15 less. So the profit decreases by 15 when the discount increases by 2%. So the difference in selling prices is the cause for the difference in profit. \n\nAssuming that the cost price remains constant, the profit is selling price minus cost price. So, the difference in profit is the difference in selling prices. So yes, 0.02M =15. So M=750. That's correct. \n\nBut let me think again. Oh wait, is the profit the same in both cases except for the discount? Because the cost price is fixed, right? So the profit is (selling price) - (cost price). So when he gives a 5% discount, profit is S1 = 0.95M - C. When he gives 7% discount, S2 = 0.93M - C. The difference S1 - S2 is (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) ) = 0.02M. And this difference is given as Rs.15. So 0.02M =15, so M=750. \n\nSo the marked price is 750, which is option D. So yeah, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n",

Hmm, I remember that when discounts are given, the selling price decreases, which affects the profit. The problem says that when the discount is 5%, he gets a certain profit. But when the discount is increased to 7%, his profit is Rs. 15 less. We need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. The marked price is the original price before any discount. So, when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he sells the watch for 95% of the marked price. Similarly, a 7% discount means he sells it for 93% of the marked price.\n\nNow, the difference between these two selling prices is Rs. 15, which is the loss in profit when the discount increases from 5% to 7%. So, the difference between 5% and 7% of the marked price is Rs. 15. Oh wait, no. Wait, because the profit is based on the cost price, right? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the problem states that when he gives a 7% discount, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. So, the difference in the selling prices is Rs. 15. Because a higher discount leads to lower selling price, hence lower profit.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The profit is calculated as Selling Price minus Cost Price. So, when the selling price decreases by a certain amount, the profit decreases by that amount minus any change in cost price. But in this case, the cost price is fixed. So, the difference in profit is equal to the difference in selling prices. So, the difference between the two selling prices (5% discount and 7% discount) is Rs.15.\n\nWait, no. Wait, because the two scenarios are: 5% discount gives a certain selling price, and 7% gives another. The difference between these two selling prices is the amount by which the profit is reduced by Rs.15.\n\nWait, let's model this.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as M.\n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) is M - 5% of M = 0.95*M.\n\nWhen the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) is M -7% of M = 0.93*M.\n\nThe difference between SP1 and SP2 is 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M.\n\nAccording to the problem, this difference is Rs.15. So:\n\n0.02M = 15\n\nSo, solving for M:\n\nM = 15 / 0.02\n\nHmm, 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50 = 750.\n\nWait, so M is 750. Let me check the options. Option D is Rs. 750. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because sometimes, profit is considered as selling price minus cost price. If the cost price is C, then profit when discount is 5% is SP1 - C, and when discount is 7%, it's SP2 - C. The difference between these two profits is (SP1 - C) - (SP2 - C) = SP1 - SP2 = 0.02M. Which is Rs.15. So yeah, same result. So M is 750, which is option D.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Hmm, let me read it carefully. \n\nThe problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs.15 less. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nAlright, let me think about what I know. The marked price is the price before any discounts. So when the discount is given, the selling price reduces. The difference in profit between the two discount scenarios is Rs.15. \n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. The cost price, I think, is a fixed value because it's the price the shopkeeper paid for the watch. So when he sells it at different discounts, his selling price changes, which affects his profit.\n\nSo, when the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) would be M multiplied by (1 - 5/100), which is 0.95M. Similarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) is 0.93M.\n\nThe profit in each case is SP minus the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. So, profit when discount is 5% is SP1 - C = 0.95M - C. When the discount is 7%, the profit is SP2 - C = 0.93M - C.\n\nAccording to the problem, the profit with a 7% discount is Rs.15 less than the profit with a 5% discount. So, the difference between the two profits is 15. \n\nSo, (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. Wait, let me compute that. \n\nSubtracting the two, the Cs cancel out. So 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. So 0.02M = 15. \n\nOh, right! So solving for M, M = 15 / 0.02. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, since 0.02 is 2/100, so 1/0.02 is 50. So 15 * 50 is 750. \n\nSo the marked price M is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is Rs.750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nThe difference in discounts is 2%, which is 0.02 in decimal. The difference in profit is 15, which equals 0.02*M. So M is 15 / 0.02 = 750. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of cost price. Let me see. The difference in selling prices is 2% of M, which is 0.02*M. Since profit is SP - C, the difference in profits is SP1 - SP2, which is 0.02*M. And that equals 15. So same result. \n\nSo I'm confident that the marked price is Rs.750, which is option D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Hmm, let me read it carefully. \n\nThe problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs.15 less. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nAlright, let me think about what I know. The marked price is the price before any discounts. So when the discount is given, the selling price reduces. The difference in profit between the two discount scenarios is Rs.15. \n\nLet me denote the marked price as M. The cost price, I think, is a fixed value because it's the price the shopkeeper paid for the watch. So when he sells it at different discounts, his selling price changes, which affects his profit.\n\nSo, when the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) would be M multiplied by (1 - 5/100), which is 0.95M. Similarly, when the discount is 7%, the selling price (SP2) is 0.93M.\n\nThe profit in each case is SP minus the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as C. So, profit when discount is 5% is SP1 - C = 0.95M - C. When the discount is 7%, the profit is SP2 - C = 0.93M - C.\n\nAccording to the problem, the profit with a 7% discount is Rs.15 less than the profit with a 5% discount. So, the difference between the two profits is 15. \n\nSo, (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. Wait, let me compute that. \n\nSubtracting the two, the Cs cancel out. So 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M. So 0.02M = 15. \n\nOh, right! So solving for M, M = 15 / 0.02. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, since 0.02 is 2/100, so 1/0.02 is 50. So 15 * 50 is 750. \n\nSo the marked price M is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is Rs.750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nThe difference in discounts is 2%, which is 0.02 in decimal. The difference in profit is 15, which equals 0.02*M. So M is 15 / 0.02 = 750. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of cost price. Let me see. The difference in selling prices is 2% of M, which is 0.02*M. Since profit is SP - C, the difference in profits is SP1 - SP2, which is 0.02*M. And that equals 15. So same result. \n\nSo I'm confident that the marked price is Rs.750, which is option D.\n\n\nThe marked price of the watch is Rs. 750, which corresponds to option D. \n\nAnswer: D",

The problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less than before. I need to find the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so I can check against them once I figure it out.\n\nHmm, I think I should start by setting up the variables. Let's denote the marked price as MP. The cost price, which is the price the shopkeeper paid for the watch, I'll call CP. So, when he sells it at a 5% discount, the selling price is 95% of MP. Similarly, at a 7% discount, the selling price is 93% of MP.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because 5% discount means he's selling it for 95% of the marked price, right? So the selling price when discount is 5% is 0.95 * MP. Similarly, for 7%, it's 0.93 * MP.\n\nThe profit in each case would be the selling price minus the cost price. So, profit1 = 0.95*MP - CP. And when the discount is 7%, the profit is 0.93*MP - CP.\n\nThe problem states that the second profit is Rs. 15 less than the first. So, profit2 = profit1 - 15. Substituting the expressions, we get:\n\n0.93*MP - CP = (0.95*MP - CP) - 15.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n0.93 MP - CP = 0.95 MP - CP -15.\n\nHmm, wait, if I subtract CP from both sides, they cancel out. So:\n\n0.93 MP = 0.95 MP -15.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let's rearrange this equation. Subtract 0.93 MP from both sides:\n\n0 = 0.02 MP -15.\n\nSo, 0.02 MP =15.\n\nThen, MP =15 /0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02. Hmm, 0.02 is 2 cents, so 15/0.02 is the same as 15 *50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 15 *50=750. So MP is 750.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 750. So is that the answer? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this. Let's think about the difference in discounts. The difference between 7% and 5% is 2%. So, the extra discount is 2% of the marked price, which leads to a profit decrease of Rs.15.\n\nSo, 2% of MP equals 15. So, 0.02*MP=15, so MP=15/0.02=750. Same result.\n\nSo the marked price is Rs.750. Looking back at the options, D is 750. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in setting up the equations?\n\nYes, profit is selling price minus cost price. When the discount is higher (7%), the selling price is lower, so the profit is less by Rs.15. So the difference in selling prices is the cause for the difference in profit.\n\nWait, the difference between the two selling prices is 2% of MP, which is 0.02 MP. And that difference is equal to Rs.15. So 0.02 MP =15 \u2192 MP=750. So yes, same result.\n\nSo I think I did it right. The marked price is 750, which is option D.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down. The marked price is the original price before any discounts, right? So when he gives a discount, the selling price decreases, which affects his profit. Since profit is calculated based on the cost price and the selling price, I think I need to relate the discounts to the selling prices and then find the marked price.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's let M be the marked price. Then, when the discount is 5%, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95 * M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M, so 0.93 * M.\n\nNow, the difference in profit when he gives 5% vs 7% discount is Rs.15. So the profit when 5% discount is (Selling Price 1 - Cost Price) and profit when 7% is (Selling Price 2 - Cost Price). The difference between these two profits is Rs.15.\n\nSo, Profit1 = 0.95M - C\nProfit2 = 0.93M - C\nDifference: Profit1 - Profit2 = (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.02M.\n\nAnd according to the problem, this difference is Rs.15. So 0.02M =15. Then M=15/0.02= 750. So the marked price is Rs.750. Looking at the options, option D is 750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait, profit is selling price minus cost price. So if the shopkeeper gives a larger discount (7%), his selling price is lower, so his profit is lower. The problem says he earns Rs.15 less when he gives 7% discount. So Profit1 - Profit2 =15. That makes sense, because 5% discount leads to higher selling price, so higher profit. So 0.02M=15, so M=750. That seems right.\n\nSo the correct option is D) Rs.750.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But when he gives a 7% discount, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I need to find the marked price of the watch.\n\nWait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down. The marked price is the original price before any discounts, right? So when he gives a discount, the selling price decreases, which affects his profit. Since profit is calculated based on the cost price and the selling price, I think I need to relate the discounts to the selling prices and then find the marked price.\n\nLet me think about variables. Let's let M be the marked price. Then, when the discount is 5%, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95 * M. Similarly, a 7% discount would make the selling price 93% of M, so 0.93 * M.\n\nNow, the difference in profit when he gives 5% vs 7% discount is Rs.15. So the profit when 5% discount is (Selling Price 1 - Cost Price) and profit when 7% is (Selling Price 2 - Cost Price). The difference between these two profits is Rs.15.\n\nSo, Profit1 = 0.95M - C\nProfit2 = 0.93M - C\nDifference: Profit1 - Profit2 = (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.02M.\n\nAnd according to the problem, this difference is Rs.15.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch and giving discounts. Hmm, I need to find the marked price of the watch based on the information given. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. I guess I need to relate the two scenarios to find the marked price.\n\nLet me break it down. The marked price is the original price before any discounts. So, when he gives a discount, the selling price decreases. The difference in profit between the two discounts is Rs.15. So, the difference in the selling prices at 5% and 7% discounts should relate to this Rs.15.\n\nWait, but profit is selling price minus cost price. So, if the selling price decreases by a certain amount when the discount increases, the profit decreases by the same amount. Oh right, because the cost price is fixed. So, the difference between the two selling prices (5% and 7% discounts) is the same as the Rs.15 difference in profit.\n\nLet me write that out. Let me denote the marked price as M.\n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price is 95% of M, which is 0.95*M.\n\nWhen the discount is 7%, the selling price is 93% of M, which is 0.93*M.\n\nThe difference between these two selling prices is 0.95M - 0.93M = 0.02M.\n\nAnd according to the problem, this difference is Rs.15. So,\n\n0.02M = 15.\n\nSo, solving for M, I can divide both sides by 0.02.\n\nM = 15 / 0.02.\n\nLet me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, because 0.02 is 1/50. So, 15 * 50 is 750. So, M is 750.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If M is 750, then:\n\nAt 5% discount, selling price is 0.95*750 = 712.50.\n\nAt 7% discount, it's 0.93*750 = 700.50.\n\nThe difference is 712.50 - 700.50 = 12. So wait, that's 12, not 15. Oh no, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the setup. Because in the problem, the difference in profit is 15, which is the same as the difference in selling prices if the cost price is the same in both cases. Wait, but perhaps I should consider the cost price as well.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's let C be the cost price. The selling price when 5% discount is 0.95M, which gives a profit of (0.95M - C). When the discount is 7%, the selling price is 0.93M, so profit is (0.93M - C). The difference in profit is (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 0.02M. And this is equal to 15. So, 0.02M =15 \u2192 M=750.\n\nBut earlier calculation showed a difference of 12, not 15. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, wait. If M is 750, 0.95*750 is 712.5, and 0.93*750 is 700.5. The difference is 712.5 -700.5=12. But according to the problem, the difference should be 15. So that would mean M=750 is not correct. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 0.95*750. 750 * 0.95: 750*(1-0.05) = 750 - 37.5 = 712.5. Correct. 0.93*750: 750*(0.93) = 750 * (1 - 0.07) = 750 - 52.5 = 697.5. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 750 *0.93 is 697.5, not 700.5. Oh! So the difference is 712.5 -697.5=15. Oh, that's correct. So M=750 is correct.\n\nWait, then why did I think earlier that 0.93*750 was 700.5? Oh, I must have miscalculated. Let me compute 750 *0.93 again. 750 *0.93 is (700 *0.93) + (50 *0.93). 700 *0.93 is 651, 50 *0.93 is 46.5. So 651+46.5=697.5. So the difference is 15. So yes, M=750 is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option D is 750. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but why was I confused earlier? Oh because I thought 750*0.93 was 700.5, but no, it's 697.5. So my initial approach was correct. So the answer is D) Rs.750.\n",
