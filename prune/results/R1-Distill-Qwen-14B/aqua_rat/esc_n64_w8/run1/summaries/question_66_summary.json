      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. The area is 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth. So, if I let the breadth be some variable, maybe 'b', then the length can be expressed in terms of 'b' too. The problem says the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. So, that would translate to length = 4*b +1. Got it.\n\nSo, area = length * breadth. Plugging in what I have: 150 = (4b +1) * b. Let me write that out: 150 = b*(4b +1). Expanding that gives me 150 = 4b\u00b2 + b. Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. I should rearrange it so it equals zero: 4b\u00b2 + b -150 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for 'b'. Quadratic equations can be tricky, but I can use the quadratic formula. The formula is (-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC))/(2A), where A is 4, B is 1, and C is -150. Let me plug those numbers in.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: B\u00b2 -4AC = (1)^2 - 4*4*(-150). So that's 1 + 2400, which is 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, right? Because 49*49 is 2401. So, the solutions are (-1 \u00b1 49)/(2*4).\n\nCalculating both possibilities. First, (-1 +49) is 48 divided by 8, which is 6. Second option is (-1 -49)= -50 divided by 8, which is -6.25. Since breadth can't be negative, I'll take b=6 meters.\n\nWait, wait, 6 meters? Let me double-check. If b is 6, then length is 4*6 +1=25 meters. Then area is 6*25=150. Yep, that's correct. So breadth is 6 meters, length is 25 meters.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). Plugging in the numbers: 2*(25 +6) = 2*31=62 meters. Let me check the options. Option C is 62. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular piece of land. The area is given as 150 square meters. The length is said to be 1 meter more than four times the breadth. I need to find the perimeter of this rectangle. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that for a rectangle, the area is calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth. The perimeter is the sum of all sides, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the breadth. So, the formula for perimeter is 2*(length + breadth). But before I can find the perimeter, I need to figure out the actual length and breadth.\n\nThe problem states that the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. So, if I let the breadth be some variable, maybe 'b', then the length would be 4b + 1. Oh right, that makes sense. So, length = 4b + 1.\n\nNow, the area is 150 sq m. So, area = length * breadth = (4b + 1) * b = 150. Let me write that equation down:\n\n(4b + 1) * b = 150\n\nExpanding this, it becomes 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. To make it a standard quadratic equation, I can subtract 150 from both sides:\n\n4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation for 'b'. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, completing the square, or factoring if possible. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to (4 * -150) = -600 and add up to 1. Hmm, let's think: factors of 600. 24 and 25? Wait, 24 *25 is 600, but with opposite signs to get +1. Let me see: 25 and -24. 25 * (-24) = -600 and 25 + (-24) = 1. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, I can split the middle term using these numbers. The equation is:\n\n4b\u00b2 + 25b -24b -150 = 0\n\nGrouping the terms:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) + (-24b -150) = 0\n\nFactor out common terms from each group:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) = 0\n\nWait, because 4b\u00b2 +25b is b(4b +25), and -24b -150 is -6(4b +25). Oh, right! So now the equation is:\n\n(b -6)(4b +25) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are when each factor is zero.\n\nCase 1: b -6 = 0 \u2192 b =6\nCase 2:4b +25=0 \u21924b= -25 \u2192b= -25/4. But breadth can't be negative, so this solution is invalid.\n\nSo, the breadth is 6 meters. Then, the length is 4b +1 =4*6 +1=24 +1=25 meters.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter, I use the formula 2*(length + breadth) =2*(25 +6) =2*(31)=62 meters.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. Area is 25 *6 =150, which matches. Perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So that's correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 62 m. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to solve this problem. So, the question is about a rectangular piece of land with an area of 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. And I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length by breadth. Oh wait, and the perimeter is the sum of all sides, so it's 2 times (length + breadth). So I need to find the length and breadth first.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the equations. Let's denote the breadth as 'b' meters. Then the length would be 4 times the breadth plus 1, so length = 4b + 1.\n\nThe area is given as 150, so:\nArea = length \u00d7 breadth\n150 = (4b + 1) \u00d7 b\n\nExpanding that, it's 4b\u00b2 + b = 150.

Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula: b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A), where A=4, B=1, C=-150.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: B\u00b2 - 4AC = (1)^2 - 4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. Oh, that's a perfect square because 49^2 is 2401.

So option C is correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the breadth of the rectangle be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is \\( 150 \\, \\text{sq m} \\), so we use the formula for the area of a rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n(4b + 1) \\cdot b = 150.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( b = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -150 \\), the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 1^2 - 4(4)(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401.\n\\]\n\nThe square root of the discriminant is \\( \\sqrt{2401} = 49 \\). Substituting back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 \\pm 49}{8}.\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 + 49}{8} = \\frac{48}{8} = 6, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\frac{-1 - 49}{8} = \\frac{-50}{8} = -6.25.\n\\]\n\nSince the breadth cannot be negative, we take \\( b = 6 \\, \\text{m} \\). The length is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{length} = 4b + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}).\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2(25 + 6) = 2(31) = 62 \\, \\text{m}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the piece is **62 meters**.\n\nAnswer: C",
