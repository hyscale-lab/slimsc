      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. I need to determine which of the given statements must be true about Q. The options are I, II, III, and the choices are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors involves adding one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying them together. So if a number Q has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). \n\nWait, since Q has 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number. That means the product (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So the exponents plus one must be either 5 and 1 or 1 and 5. But exponents can't be negative, so let's think about that.\n\nIf (a+1)(b+1) =5, then one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. So possible scenarios are:\n\n1. a+1=5 and b+1=1. So a=4, b=0. But since b is 0, that means there's no second prime factor. So Q would be p^4, where p is a prime. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\n2. Alternatively, a+1=1 and b+1=5. That would mean a=0 and b=4. But again, a=0 implies no first prime factor, so Q would be q^4, same as above.\n\nWait, but another thought. What if Q is a product of two primes, like p^1 * q^1? Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4, which is less than 5. So that doesn't work.\n\nSo the only way for Q to have exactly 5 factors is if it's the fourth power of a single prime. Because if it were a square of a prime, like p^2, the number of factors would be (2+1)=3. That's only 3 factors. So that's not enough. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, does that hold?\n\nWait, wait. Let's think again. If Q is p^4, then the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's 5 factors. So in this case, Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So II is true.\n\nWait, but statement I says Q is the square of a prime. If Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? Hmm, because (p^2)^2 is p^4. So p^4 is the square of p squared, which is a square of a composite number unless p is 2, but that's besides the point. Wait, no. Wait, p is a prime. So p^2 is a prime squared, so p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of a prime squared. Wait, but the statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So for Q to be the square of a prime, Q would have to be (prime)^2, which would be p^2, which has 3 factors, not 5. So in that case, statement I is false because Q is p^4, not p^2.\n\nWait, so statement I is not true. So that would mean statement I is incorrect. So I is false.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Let me clarify: Q is p^4. So is p^4 the square of a prime? Well, the square of a prime is p^2. So p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2, which is a composite number. So Q is not the square of a prime; it's the square of a composite (p^2) if p is prime. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So yes, that's correct because Q is p^4. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III? It says Q is the product of two primes. But if Q is p^4, it's not the product of two primes. It's a single prime raised to the fourth power. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when you have two primes, say p and q, their product is p*q, which would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III is not true.\n\nSo putting it all together, which statements are true?\n\n- I: False. Q is not the square of a prime; it's the fourth power.\n- II: True. Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n- III: False. Q is a single prime to the fourth, not product of two primes.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The question says 'must be true about Q'. So looking back at the options, option C is II only. Option A is I only, which is wrong. Option D is I and II, but since I is false, D is wrong. Option E is I and III, which are both false. Option B is III only, which is also false.\n\nWait, but I thought I was wrong, but let me make sure. Let me think about whether Q can be the square of a prime. So if Q is p^2, then factors are 1, p, p^2. That's 3 factors. So if Q has 5 factors, it can't be p^2. So statement I is definitely false. So the only correct statement is II.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: II only.\n",

The question gives three statements (I, II, III) and asks which must be true. The options are combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, let me think about how the number of factors works. I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 * 1. So that means there's only one term in the product, which implies that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because the exponents plus one multiply to 5, so the exponent must be 4.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the exponents plus one multiply to 5, then the exponents could be 4 (since 4+1=5) and all other exponents would be zero, meaning there are no other prime factors. So yeah, Q must be p^4.\n\nSo looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So p squared is a prime? Wait, no. Wait, p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime. So Q is the square of (p squared), which is the square of a composite number. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: p is a prime, p squared is (p)^2, which is a square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So p^2 is a square, but is it a prime? No. Because p is prime, p^2 is a square of a prime, but it's not a prime itself. So p^2 is composite. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime, which would mean Q = (prime)^2. But Q is p^4, so that's (prime^2)^2, which is (prime)^4. So statement I is not true because Q is not a square of a prime, it's a fourth power of a prime. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then that is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. But p squared is not a prime, it's a square of a prime, but itself composite. So statement I would only be true if p^4 is equal to (another prime)^2. Which would require p^4 = q^2, so p^2 = q. But q must be prime. So p^2 is prime. But p is a prime, so p^2 can only be prime if p is the square root of a prime. Wait, that doesn't make sense because p is an integer, so p^2 would be a square number, which is only prime if p^2 is a prime. But the square of an integer greater than 1 is composite. So p^2 is composite. Hence, Q cannot be the square of a prime. Therefore statement I is false.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Because earlier I thought that Q is p^4. So let me reevaluate. If Q is p^4, then the number of factors is (4+1) =5, correct. So Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would make statement II true. Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that's correct.\n\nSo statement I: Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So p^2 is not a prime, it's a composite. So Q is the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is false. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q is p^4, then its prime factors are only p. So it's p multiplied by itself four times. So it's not the product of two different primes, nor is it a product of two primes in any sense. So statement III is false.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. The product of two primes would mean Q = p * q, where p and q are primes, possibly the same. So if Q is p^4, then it's p*p*p*p. So that's not the product of two primes unless p is multiplied twice, but even then, p^4 is p squared times p squared, which is (p^2)^2. But that's not two primes, but two squares of primes. So statement III is definitely false.\n\nSo now, looking at the options:\n\nI: false\n\nII: true\n\nIII: false\n\nSo which options include only II?

The question says, \"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?\" Then it gives three statements I, II, III, and the options are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right, the formula for the number of divisors. If a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime factor.\n\nSo the problem says Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. Because 5 is prime, that's the only way.\n\nWhich means that when we factor Q, the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. Because if you have more factors, like (a+1)(b+1)... you would get more than 5. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4, because 4+1=5, and no other exponents. Or wait, no, because another possibility is that maybe there are multiple primes, but each exponent plus one is 1. Wait, but exponents can't be negative, so if another exponent is zero, but that would mean that prime isn't actually a factor. So I think the only way is that Q is of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because that would give exponents of 4, so 4+1=5 factors.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Q is p^4, the factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. So that's 5 factors. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, could Q be the product of two primes? Like p*q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. Because each exponent is 1, so 2*2=4. But the question says 5, so that's not possible. So statement III says Q is the product of two primes, which would give 4 factors. So statement III is false.\n\nWhat about statement II? It says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So if Q = p^4, then yes, that's correct, as we saw. So statement II is true.\n\nWait, but statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q = p^2, then the number of factors is 3, because exponents are 2, so 2+1=3. But we have 5 factors, so statement I is not correct. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait. If Q is the square of a prime, then it's p^2. The number of factors would be (2+1) =3. But the question is that Q has 5 factors, so statement I must be false. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Q must be p^4. So in that case, statement I is not correct because p squared gives 3 factors, but Q is p^4, which gives 5 factors. So statement I is not correct. But wait, am I mixing something up?\n\nWait, let me clarify. Statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q = p^2, the number of factors is 3. So if Q has 5 factors, statement I is false. So statement I is not necessarily true, right? Or wait, maybe I got it wrong. Because if Q is p^4, then it's not a square of a prime. Because p^4 is (p^2)^2, so it's the square of p squared. But p is a prime, so p squared is just a composite number. So Q would be the square of a composite number, not a prime. So statement I is incorrect. So statement I is not true.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because the options don't include II only. Wait, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, I thought statement II is correct. So according to my analysis, only statement II is correct, so option C. But wait, earlier I thought that Q is p^4, which would mean statement II is correct. So why is statement I incorrect?\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared, which is a composite number. So Q is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite. So statement I is false. So statement II is correct, so option C is the right answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me think again about the number of factors. If Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime, then the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because (4+1)=5. So that's the only possibility. So Q is the fourth power of a prime.\n\nSo statement I is incorrect because it's not the square of a prime, but the fourth power. Statement II is correct because it is the fourth power of a prime. Statement III is incorrect because the product of two primes gives 4 factors, not 5.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of factors. If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. That means the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when each is increased by one, their product is 5. \n\nSo, looking at the possible forms of Q's prime factors. Since 5 is a prime, the only way is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4, because 4+1=5, and all other exponents are zero (meaning no other primes involved). Or wait, is there another possibility? Let me think. If Q had two different primes, each with exponents that when increased by one multiply to 5. But 5 is prime, so only 5 and 1. So for two primes, one would have exponent 4 and the other 0, which isn't possible because then it's just one prime. Alternatively, maybe each exponent plus one is 1 and 5, but that would require exponents of 0 and 4. So same as before.\n\nSo the conclusion is that Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. Because that's the only way to get exactly five factors. Let's think: for example, 2^4 is 16. The factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. Similarly, 3^4 is 81, factors 1,3,9,27,81. Yep, five.\n\nNow let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p\u00b2, then the number of factors is (2+1)=3. So that's three factors. But in our case, Q has five factors. So statement I can't be true. Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 5. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p\u00b2, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So Q is a square, but it's not the square of a prime\u2014it's the square of a square of a prime. Wait, so that's different. So statement I is not necessarily true. So I is incorrect?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me think again. Let's say p is a prime. Then p squared is p\u00b2. The factors are 1, p, p\u00b2. That's three factors. So statement I would be true only if Q has three factors. But our Q has five. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, wait, but if Q is the square of a prime, then it's p\u00b2, which has three factors. But our Q has five factors, so statement I is not true. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, what if the square is another prime? No, because if Q is the square of a prime, that gives three factors, not five. So statement I is not correct.\n\nSo statement I is false. Hmm. So that would rule out options that have I as correct, like option A and E.\n\nWait, but I thought Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So in that case, Q is a square of p\u00b2, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Since p\u00b2 is not a prime (unless p=2, but even then, p\u00b2=4 is not a prime), statement I is false. So statement I is wrong.\n\nSo that leaves statements II and III. Let me check statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Which is exactly what I concluded earlier. So statement II is true.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p * q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1) = 4. So four factors. But our Q has five. So statement III would be false because that would only give four factors. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nSo the only statement that's true is statement II. Wait, but wait\u2014what about if Q is the product of a prime squared and another prime? Like p\u00b2 * q. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2=6 factors, which is more than five. So that's not the case. So the only way to get exactly five factors is if it's a single prime raised to the fourth power.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nI is false.\n\nII is true.\n\nIII is false.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, so only statement II is true. So the correct option would be C) II only.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"which of the following must be true about Q\". So I must have made a mistake earlier because I thought statement I was incorrect. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me re-express statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, is it the square of a prime? Well, p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So p\u00b2 is not a prime. Because p is a prime, p\u00b2 is composite. So p^4 is the square of p\u00b2, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nSo only statement II is correct. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier in thinking about statement I. Because if Q is a square of a prime, that's p\u00b2, which has 3 factors. But if Q is a square of a composite, that's not relevant here because Q is p^4, which is a square. So statement I is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) II only.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a positive integer Q that has 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of factors. If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. That means the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when each is increased by one, their product is 5. \n\nSo, looking at the possible forms of Q's prime factors. Since 5 is a prime, the only way is that there's one prime factor with exponent 4, because 4+1=5, and all other exponents are zero (meaning no other primes involved). Or wait, is there another possibility? Let me think. If Q had two different primes, each with exponents that when increased by one multiply to 5. But 5 is prime, so only 5 and 1. So for two primes, one would have exponent 4 and the other 0, which isn't possible because then it's just one prime. Alternatively, maybe each exponent plus one is 1 and 5, but that would require exponents of 0 and 4. So same as before.\n\nSo the conclusion is that Q must be the fourth power of a prime number. Because that's the only way to get exactly five factors. Let's think: for example, 2^4 is 16. The factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. Similarly, 3^4 is 81, factors 1,3,9,27,81. Yep, five.\n\nNow let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p\u00b2, then the number of factors is (2+1)=3. So that's three factors.

So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would mean (4+1)=5 factors. So II is correct. So then, statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me re-examine the problem. The options are I, II, III. So, I need to see which statements are necessarily true.\n\nWait, so if Q has exactly 5 factors, it must be of the form p^4. So statement II is correct. So that would make statement I incorrect because p^4 is not the same as p squared. So statement I is wrong.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Let's see. If Q is p * q, where p and q are primes, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's not possible. So statement III is also incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, what if the two primes are the same? Like p squared. Oh, but that's p^2, which has three factors. So that's not the case. So Q can't be the product of two primes, whether same or different, because that would give 4 or 3 factors, neither of which is 5.\n\nSo, looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime \u2192 No, because that gives 3 factors, not 5.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime \u2192 Yes, because p^4 has 5 factors.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two primes \u2192 No, because that gives 4 factors.\n\nSo the only statement that must be true is II.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The options given are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo from my reasoning, only II is correct. So the answer is C) II only.\n\nBut wait, looking back, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of factors when a number is the square of a prime is 3, and the fourth power is 5. So only II is correct.\n\nWait another point: Are there any other ways to get exactly 5 factors? I don't think so, because 5 is a prime, so the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that (a+1)(b+1)...=5. Since 5 is prime, only possible if one exponent is 4 and the rest are 0. So Q must be p^4. So yes, II is correct.\n\nSo looking at the options, the correct choice is C) II only.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding out which statements must be true about Q, given that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The options are I, II, III, and then various combinations. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of divisors (or factors) of a number is based on its prime exponents. If a number N can be expressed as N = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p\u2099^k, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1).\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product is 5 \u00d7 1. That means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So, the exponents must be such that one of them is 4 (since 4+1=5), and the others are zero, I guess. Because if there are multiple primes, like two primes, then (a+1)(b+1) would have to be 5. But 5 can't be broken down into smaller integers multiplied together except 5 and 1. So, the only possibility is that Q is of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because if it had two primes, say p^1 and q^1, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose Q is p^4. Then the number of factors is (4+1)=5, which fits. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. That would mean statement II is correct. But wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm. Wait, if Q is p squared, then the number of factors is (2+1)=3, not 5. So that can't be right. So statement I is incorrect?\n\nWait, wait, wait. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to some exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c ..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possibility is that there's only one term in the product, meaning that Q has only one prime factor, and the exponent plus one equals 5. So the exponent a must be 4, because 4+1=5.\n\nWait, so that would mean Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So Q = p^4, where p is a prime.

I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are combinations of these statements, so I have to evaluate each one.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, I need to find out what possible exponents would give a product of 5 when each is increased by one. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. \n\nThat means the exponents themselves must be 4 and 0 (since 4+1=5 and 0+1=1). Or wait, is that right? Because if there are multiple primes, their exponents plus one multiply. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one could be 5 and 1, or 1 and 5, but 5 is prime so no other factors. \n\nWait, but if there are multiple primes, then the exponents plus one would multiply. So if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That's one possibility. Alternatively, could it be p^1 * q^1, which would give (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. No, that's 4 factors. So that doesn't work. \n\nAnother possibility: what if Q is a product of three primes? Like p^1 * q^1 * r^1. Then the number of factors is (1+1)^3 = 8, which is more than 5. So that's too many. \n\nSo the only way to get exactly 5 factors is to have a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because then (4+1)=5. So Q must be the square of a prime? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime would be p^2. Then the number of factors is 2+1=3. That's only 3 factors, which is less than 5. So that's not correct. \n\nOh, right! So if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II would be correct. But wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be p^2, which gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I miss another possibility? Because 5 is prime, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. So the exponents are 4 and 0. But exponents can't be negative, so if there are two primes, one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But a prime raised to the 0 power is 1, which isn't a prime. So the only possibility is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nSo, Q must be the fourth power of a prime, which is statement II. But wait, looking at the options, statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be p^2, but that's 3 factors. So I is incorrect. \n\nSo now, looking at the statements: \n\nI: Q is the square of a prime \u2192 Incorrect, because that gives 3 factors. \n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime \u2192 Correct. \n\nIII: Q is the product of two primes \u2192 That would be p^1 * q^1, which gives (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So III is incorrect. \n\nSo the only statement that must be true is II. But wait, the options don't have an option with only II correct. Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) I only \n\nB) III only \n\nC) II only \n\nD) I and II only \n\nE) I and III only \n\nSo option C is II only. So the correct answer should be C. \n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, another approach: the number of factors is 5. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is a prime, the only way is to have one exponent as 4, and the rest as 0. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct. \n\nTherefore, among the options, only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, I need to find out what possible exponents would give a product of 5 when each is increased by one. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 \u00d7 1. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. \n\nThat means the exponents themselves must be 4 and 0 (since 4+1=5 and 0+1=1). Or wait, is that right? Because if there are multiple primes, their exponents plus one multiply. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one could be 5 and 1, or 1 and 5, but 5 is prime so no other factors. \n\nWait, but if there are multiple primes, then the exponents plus one would multiply. So if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. That's one possibility. Alternatively, could it be p^1 * q^1, which would give (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. No, that's 4 factors. So that doesn't work. \n\nAnother possibility: what if Q is a product of three primes? Like p^1 * q^1 * r^1. Then the number of factors is (1+1)^3 = 8, which is more than 5. So that's too many. \n\nSo the only way to get exactly 5 factors is to have a single prime raised to the 4th power. Because then (4+1)=5. So Q must be the square of a prime? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime would be p^2. Then the number of factors is 2+1=3. That's only 3 factors, which is less than 5. So that's not correct. \n\nOh, right! So if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. So that's statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II would be correct. But wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So that would be p^2, which gives 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct. \n\nWait, but wait another thing. Did I miss another possibility? Because 5 is prime, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1. So the exponents are 4 and 0. But exponents can't be negative, so if there are two primes, one exponent is 4 and the other is 0. But a prime raised to the 0 power is 1, which isn't a prime. So the only possibility is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nSo, Q must be the fourth power of a prime, which is statement II. But wait, looking at the options, statement I says it's the square of a prime, which would be p^2, but that's 3 factors. So I is incorrect. \n\nSo now, looking at the statements: \n\nI: Q is the square of a prime \u2192 Incorrect, because that gives 3 factors. \n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime \u2192 Correct. \n\nIII: Q is the product of two primes \u2192 That would be p^1 * q^1, which gives (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So III is incorrect. \n\nSo the only statement that must be true is II. But wait, the options don't have an option with only II correct. Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) I only \n\nB) III only \n\nC) II only \n\nD) I and II only \n\nE) I and III only \n\nSo option C is II only. So the correct answer should be C. \n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, another approach: the number of factors is 5. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is a prime, the only way is to have one exponent as 4, and the rest as 0. So Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct. \n\nTherefore, among the options, only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the number of factors \\( Q \\) has. The number of factors of a positive integer is determined by its prime factorization. If \\( Q \\) has a prime factorization \\( Q = p_1^{a} p_2^{b} p_3^{c} \\dots \\), the total number of factors is given by \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots \\). Since \\( Q \\) has exactly 5 factors, we need \\( (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\\dots = 5 \\).\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Statement I: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime, \\( Q = p^2 \\), the number of factors is \\( 2+1 = 3 \\). This is incorrect because \\( Q \\) must have 5 factors, not 3.\n\n2. **Statement II: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime, \\( Q = p^4 \\), the number of factors is \\( 4+1 = 5 \\). This is correct because it satisfies the condition of having exactly 5 factors.\n\n3. **Statement III: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers.**  \n   If \\( Q \\) is the product of two primes, \\( Q = p \\cdot q \\), the number of factors is \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\). This is incorrect because \\( Q \\) must have 5 factors, not 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only statement that must be true is **II**, as \\( Q \\) must be the fourth power of a prime number to have exactly 5 factors. \n\nAnswer: C",

The question says that Q is a positive integer with 5 factors. Then, there are three statements, I, II, and III, and I have to determine which of them must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining these statements in different ways.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q has a prime factorization of, say, p1^a * p2^b * ... pn^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSo in this case, Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. Because 5 can't be broken down into smaller integers for multiplication except 1 and 5. So that means that the formula (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that there's only one term in the product. Because if there were two terms, say (a+1)*(b+1) =5, then each would have to be 1 and 5, but exponents can't be zero because that would mean that prime isn't present. So the exponents must be at least 1. Wait, wait, no\u2014wait, exponents are at least 1 because in prime factorization, each exponent is at least 1. So if (a+1) is 5, then a is 4, right? Because 5-1=4. Or wait, no\u2014let me think. If the product is 5, then the number of exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the only possibility is one exponent, and that exponent plus one equals 5. So that exponent is 4. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5, which fits. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that would be true. But wait, let me think again. Wait, no, wait\u2014wait, no, I think I'm mixing up something.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because 5 is a prime number, so the number of factors can only come from a single exponent. So the prime factorization of Q must be p^4, because 4+1=5. So that means Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. Because I thought that for the number of factors, if the number is p^2, then the number of factors is 3, right? Because exponents are 2, so 2+1=3. So if it's p^4, then 4+1=5, which is the case here.\n\nSo statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would mean Q is p^2, which would have 3 factors, but we have 5 factors. So statement I would be false. So statement II is correct, statement I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, I'm confused now. Because I thought that the number of factors is 5, so the only way is p^4. So statement II must be true. But what about statement I? If statement I were correct, then Q would be p^2, which has 3 factors, which doesn't match. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement III says Q is the product of two primes. So that would be p * q, where p and q are primes. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) = 4. But we have 5 factors, so statement III is false. Because p*q has four factors.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Wait, what if the primes are the same? Like p^2. Oh, but that's the same as statement I. So product of two primes, meaning two distinct primes, right? So no, that can't be because then the number of factors is four, not five.\n\nSo putting it all together: statement II is correct, statements I and III are incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is II only. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me think about the number of factors again. If Q has 5 factors, which is a prime, so the exponents in the prime factorization plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one exponent, which is 4. So Q must be p^4. So statement II is correct, which is Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement I is wrong because p^2 would give 3 factors. Statement III is wrong because that gives four factors.\n\nSo the correct answer is II only, which is option C.\n",

Since \\( Q \\) has 5 factors and 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\( 5 \\) itself. This implies that \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because \\( (4+1) = 5 \\), so the exponent must be 4.\n\n- **Statement I**: \\( Q \\) is the square of a prime number. If \\( Q = p^2 \\), the number of factors would be \\( (2+1) = 3 \\), which is not the case here. Thus, Statement I is false.\n- **Statement II**: \\( Q \\) is the fourth power of a prime number. Since \\( Q = p^4 \\) has \\( (4+1) = 5 \\) factors, this is true. Thus, Statement II is correct.\n- **Statement III**: \\( Q \\) is the product of two prime numbers. If \\( Q = p \\cdot q \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes, the number of factors would be \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\), which is not the case here. Thus, Statement III is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question says, if Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q? The options are I, II, III, and then the choices A to E.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, so for any number Q, if you express it as a product of primes, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c and so on, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nIn this case, Q has 5 factors. Now, 5 is a prime number. So the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were more than one, like 2*3, that would give 6, which is more than 5. So that means the prime factorization of Q must have only one prime factor, and the exponent on that prime must be 4. Because (4+1)=5. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime number.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because if Q is p^4, then the factors would be 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. That's 5 factors. So yes, that fits.\n\nSo looking back at the statements:\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. So if Q is p^4, then the square of a prime is p^2. But p^4 is (p^2)^2, so that's the square of a square of a prime. Hmm, so I'm not sure if I is correct. Wait, the statement says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" If Q is p^4, then it's the fourth power of a prime, not the square. So I would be incorrect? Because Q is p^4, which is the square of p^2, but p^2 is itself a square of a prime. So wait, maybe statement I is correct?\n\nWait, no. Because statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2. So the square of p^2, which is p squared. But p squared is a prime squared. So is p^4 considered the square of a prime number? Hmm, wait, a prime number is a number that has exactly two factors. So p is a prime, p^2 is a square of a prime, p^4 is the square of p squared, which is (p^2)^2. So Q is the square of a composite number (p squared is composite if p is prime and p>2). Wait, but statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared, which is a composite number. So statement I is not true. Because Q would be the square of a composite, not a prime.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify. Let me take an example. Let's say p is 2, a prime. Then Q is 2^4=16. Is 16 the square of a prime number? Well, 16 is 4 squared. But 4 is not a prime; it's 2 squared. So 4 is composite. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But 16 is the square of 4, which is composite. So statement I would be false for Q=16. So that suggests that statement I is not necessarily true. But wait, wait, another example. If p=3, then Q=3^4=81. 81 is 9 squared, and 9 is 3 squared. So again, 9 is composite. So statement I is false for these examples.\n\nSo, statement I is not correct. So statement I is not true about Q. So that would eliminate options that include I being true. Wait, but earlier I thought that Q must be p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So in that case, II would be correct.\n\nWait, but I thought statement I is incorrect because Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, which is composite. So II is correct.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two primes. So product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. So the prime factors would be p and q, each with exponent 1. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But Q has 5 factors, so that's not possible. So statement III is false.\n\nSo let's recap. Q must be of the form p^4. So:\n\nI: Q is square of a prime. No, because p^4 is (p^2)^2, and p^2 is composite.\n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, correct.\n\nIII: Q is product of two primes. No, because that would give 4 factors, not 5.\n\nSo looking at the options, which include statements I and II.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo from above, only II is correct. So the correct answer would be option C: II only.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about this: the number of factors is 5. 5 is a prime, so the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is to have a single exponent of 4. So the number must be of the form p^4, which is statement II.\n\nSo statement II is correct. So the answer should be option C.\n",

The options are A to E, each combining different statements. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. I think the formula is something like if a number N has a prime factorization of N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the total number of factors is (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*...*(an + 1). Right, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So, that means the number of factors formula must be (a1 +1)(a2 +1)... =5. Which can only happen if there's one exponent plus one equals 5, and the rest are 1. So, the exponents must be 4, and all others are zero, but wait, no, because if a number has multiple prime factors, their exponents would contribute multiplicatively.\n\nWait, let me think. So, if Q has exactly 5 factors, then the exponents in its prime factorization must satisfy (a1 +1)(a2 +1)...=5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is (4+1) for a single prime, because if there were two primes, then (a1 +1)(a2 +1) would have to be 5. But 5 can't be written as a product of two numbers greater than 1. Because 5 is prime, so the only possibility is one prime factor with exponent 4. So, Q must be p^4, where p is a prime.\n\nWait, wait, wait, that's what statement II says, right? II says Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So II would be true. But what about statement I? I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, so it is a square of a prime squared. Wait, no, p squared is a square of a prime, but Q is p^4, which is a square of p squared. So, Q is indeed the square of a prime? Wait, no. Wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's the square of p squared, but p squared is another number. So, p^4 is a square, but of a composite number unless p is prime. Wait, no, p is prime, so p squared is a prime squared. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think again. If Q is p^4, then the square root of Q is p^2, which is a square of a prime. So, Q is a square. So, yes, statement I is also true. Because the square of a prime is p^2, but in this case, Q is p^4. So, Q is a square because (p^2)^2 is a square. So, statement I is true.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What's the difference between I and II? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2. But statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, p^4. So, if Q is p^4, then it's both a square and a fourth power. So, both I and II would be true? But that can't be the case because the options don't include both I and II as correct except for option D.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. So, if Q has 5 factors, then it must be p^4, which is a fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is definitely true. Statement I is also true because p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So I is true. So why isn't statement III also true?\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p * q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So, 4 factors, not 5. So, Q cannot be a product of two primes. So statement III is false.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let's double-check. If Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two primes. It's a single prime raised to the fourth power. So, statement III is definitely false. So, the only statements that must be true are I and II.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option D is I and II only. So, that would be the correct answer. But wait, earlier I thought that if Q is p^4, then it's both a square and a fourth power. So both I and II are true.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. The number of factors is 5. So, (a+1) must equal 5, so a=4. So, the number is p^4. So, statement II is correct. Statement I says it's a square of a prime. So, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's the square of p squared. But p squared is a prime squared. Wait, no. p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime. So, (p^2)^2 is the square of that. So, the square of a prime squared is a fourth power. So, statement I is correct because Q is a square, but it's the square of a prime squared, not the square of a prime itself.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, if Q is p^4, then p^4 = (p^2)^2. So, Q is the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's a square of a prime. So, statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime. But in reality, Q is the square of a composite number (p^2 is composite if p is a prime with p>2, but even for p=2, p^2 is 4, which is composite). So, does statement I hold?\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, Q = prime^2. But in our case, Q is prime^4, which is (prime^2)^2. So, the square of a composite number. Therefore, statement I is false. Oh! Wait, that changes things. So, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate. If Q is p^4, then Q is the fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is true. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So, it's a square, but of p squared, which is not a prime. So, statement I is not true. Because statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would require Q = (prime)^2. But Q is (prime)^4, which is different.\n\nSo, statement I is false, statement II is true. What about statement III? As before, statement III would require Q to have two prime factors, which would lead to (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So, Q would have 4 factors, not 5. So, statement III is false.\n\nSo, only statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought statement I was true. Now I'm confused. Let me make sure. So, statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So, for Q to be the square of a prime, it would have to be p^2. But in our case, it's p^4. So, it's not the square of a prime, it's the square of p squared, which is a composite number if p is any prime (since p squared is 4, 9, 25, etc., which are composite except for p=2, where 4 is composite as well). So, statement I is false. Therefore, only statement II is true, so the answer is C) II only.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's list the number of factors for some numbers. Let's take p^4, where p is a prime. Let's say p=2: 2^4=16. The factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. So, 5 factors. So, 16 is p^4, which is a fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is correct.\n\nIs 16 the square of a prime? The square of a prime would be 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 5^2=25, etc. 16 is 4^2, which is (2^2)^2. So, 16 is the square of 4, which is not a prime. So, statement I is incorrect because 16 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of a composite number (4). So, statement I is false.\n\nTherefore, only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is option C.\n",

But 5 can't be written as a product of two numbers greater than 1. Because 5 is prime, so the only possibility is one prime factor with exponent 4. So, Q must be p^4, where p is a prime.\n\nWait, wait, wait, that's what statement II says, right? II says Q is the fourth power of a prime number. So II would be true. But what about statement I? I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, so it is a square of a prime squared. Wait, no, p squared is a square of a prime, but Q is p^4, which is a square of p squared. So, Q is indeed the square of a prime? Wait, no. Wait, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's the square of p squared, but p squared is another number. So, p^4 is a square, but of a composite number unless p is prime. Wait, no, p is prime, so p squared is a prime squared. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think again. If Q is p^4, then the square root of Q is p^2, which is a square of a prime. So, Q is a square. So, yes, statement I is also true. Because the square of a prime is p^2, but in this case, Q is p^4. So, Q is a square because (p^2)^2 is a square. So, statement I is true.\n\nWait, but wait a second. What's the difference between I and II? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would be p^2. But statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, p^4. So, if Q is p^4, then it's both a square and a fourth power. So, both I and II would be true? But that can't be the case because the options don't include both I and II as correct except for option D.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. So, if Q has 5 factors, then it must be p^4, which is a fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is definitely true. Statement I is also true because p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is a square. So I is true. So why isn't statement III also true?\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p * q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors for p*q would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. So, 4 factors, not 5. So, Q cannot be a product of two primes. So statement III is false.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let's double-check. If Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two primes. It's a single prime raised to the fourth power. So, statement III is definitely false. So, the only statements that must be true are I and II.\n\nBut wait, in the options, option D is I and II only. So, that would be the correct answer. But wait, earlier I thought that if Q is p^4, then it's both a square and a fourth power. So both I and II are true.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. The number of factors is 5. So, (a+1) must equal 5, so a=4. So, the number is p^4. So, statement II is correct. Statement I says it's a square of a prime. So, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so yes, it's the square of p squared. But p squared is a prime squared. Wait, no. p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime. So, (p^2)^2 is the square of that. So, the square of a prime squared is a fourth power. So, statement I is correct because Q is a square, but it's the square of a prime squared, not the square of a prime itself.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, if Q is p^4, then p^4 = (p^2)^2. So, Q is the square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's a square of a prime. So, statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime. But in reality, Q is the square of a composite number (p^2 is composite if p is a prime with p>2, but even for p=2, p^2 is 4, which is composite). So, does statement I hold?\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So, Q = prime^2. But in our case, Q is prime^4, which is (prime^2)^2. So, the square of a composite number. Therefore, statement I is false. Oh! Wait, that changes things. So, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate. If Q is p^4, then Q is the fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is true. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So, it's a square, but of p squared, which is not a prime. So, statement I is not true. Because statement I says Q is the square of a prime, which would require Q = (prime)^2. But Q is (prime)^4, which is different.\n\nSo, statement I is false, statement II is true. What about statement III? As before, statement III would require Q to have two prime factors, which would lead to (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So, Q would have 4 factors, not 5. So, statement III is false.\n\nSo, only statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought statement I was true. Now I'm confused. Let me make sure. So, statement I: Q is the square of a prime. So, for Q to be the square of a prime, it would have to be p^2. But in our case, it's p^4. So, it's not the square of a prime, it's the square of p squared, which is a composite number if p is any prime (since p squared is 4, 9, 25, etc., which are composite except for p=2, where 4 is composite as well). So, statement I is false. Therefore, only statement II is true, so the answer is C) II only.\n\nWait, but another approach: Let's list the number of factors for some numbers. Let's take p^4, where p is a prime. Let's say p=2: 2^4=16. The factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16. So, 5 factors. So, 16 is p^4, which is a fourth power of a prime. So, statement II is correct.\n\nIs 16 the square of a prime? The square of a prime would be 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 5^2=25, etc. 16 is 4^2, which is (2^2)^2. So, 16 is the square of 4, which is not a prime. So, statement I is incorrect because 16 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of a composite number (4). So, statement I is false.\n\nTherefore, only statement II is correct. So the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements about \\( Q \\) must be true, we analyze the given information: \\( Q \\) is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors of a number \\( N \\) with prime factorization \\( N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n} \\) is given by \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1) \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here about factors and prime numbers. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. The question says that Q is a positive integer with 5 factors. And then there are three statements, I, II, III, and I have to figure out which must be true.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Right, the formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents in the prime factorization, add one to each, and then multiply them together. So if a number Q has a prime factorization of Q = p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.\n\nWait, so Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1. That means the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that when you add one to each and multiply, you get 5. So the only possibility is that there's one prime factor with an exponent of 4, because 4+1=5. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that's one case.\n\nAlternatively, could there be more than one prime factor? Let's think: if Q had two primes, say p and q, and exponents a and b, then (a+1)(b+1) =5. 5 is prime, so the possibilities are 5=5*1. So either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which would mean a=4, b=0. But b=0 would mean q^0=1, so Q would just be p^4. Or alternatively, a+1=1 and b+1=5, which would mean a=0 and b=4, but that's the same as p^4 again. So in any case, if there are two primes, one exponent is 4 and the other is 0, which effectively makes it a single prime factor. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nWait, but another thought: could Q be the square of a prime? Because the square of a prime would have 3 factors. Let me check: if Q = p^2, then the number of factors is 2+1=3. So that's not 5. So if Q has 5 factors, it can't be the square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That can't be right. So I must be false.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So that would be true. So II is true.\n\nWhat about III? III says Q is the product of two primes. If Q is the product of two primes, like p*q, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1) = 4. Because each exponent is 1, so adding 1 gives 2 and 2, multiply to 4. But Q has 5 factors, so that can't be. So III is false.\n\nWait, but wait another possibility: what if the number of primes in the factorization is more than two? Like three primes? Then (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8, which is more than 5. So that's not possible. So the only way to get 5 factors is to have a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nSo, let's recap:\n\nI: Q is the square of a prime. No, that gives 3 factors. So I is false.\n\nII: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, that gives 5 factors. So II is true.\n\nIII: Q is the product of two primes. That gives 4 factors. So III is false.\n\nSo looking at the options, the statements that must be true are only II.\n\nWait, but the options don't have an option that says only II. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nAh, option C is II only. So the correct answer should be C.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Could there be any other possibility? Because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nAnother angle: the number of factors is 5. So the exponents plus one multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only possible factorization is 5 = 5 * 1. So the exponents would be 4 and 0, but 0 exponents are allowed only if the prime isn't present. So the only way is one prime with exponent 4. So Q is p^4.\n\nSo yes, II is correct. I is incorrect because p squared has 3 factors. III is incorrect because product of two primes has 4 factors. So only II is correct. So the answer is option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. \n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, I need to find what exponents would lead to (a+1)(b+1)... = 5. Wait, 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means the formula must be 5 = 5 * 1. \n\nWhich implies that Q must be of the form where one exponent is 4 (since a+1=5 \u2192 a=4), and all other exponents are zero. Because if there were more than one prime factor, then the product (a+1)(b+1) etc. would be more than 5. For example, if there were two primes, say a=1 and b=1, then (2)(2)=4, which is less than 5. So no, that's not possible.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If Q has 5 factors, which is 5=5*1, then the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because then the exponents are 4, so the number of factors is 4+1=5. Alternatively, could it be p^2 * q^1? Because (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6, which is more than 5. So that's not possible. So the only way is p^4.\n\nSo that means Q is the square of a prime number squared again? Wait, p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, which is the square of p\u00b2. Alternatively, p^4 is the fourth power of p. Oh, wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm, because p\u00b2 is a prime squared. So if Q is p^4, that would be (p\u00b2)^2, so yes, Q is the square of a prime. Because p is a prime, so p\u00b2 is a square of a prime. So statement I is true.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, yes, because Q is p^4, so II is also true. Wait, but wait\u2014does that mean both I and II are correct? Or am I mixing something up?\n\nWait, let me recheck. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So Q is indeed the square of a prime number (since p is a prime, p\u00b2 is a square of a prime). So statement I is true. And Q is the fourth power of p, so statement II is also true. So both I and II are correct?\n\nBut wait, the options don't have an option where both I and II are correct. Let me look at the options again. Option D is I and II only. Hmm, but let me think again. Is Q necessarily the fourth power of a prime?\n\nWait, no. Because if Q is p^4, then yes, but is that the only possibility? Let's see. Since the number of factors is 5, which is a prime, the only way is when the number is of the form p^4. Because the number of factors is (4+1)=5. So yes, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. Also, since p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, it's the square of a prime squared, which is a prime. Wait, p is a prime. So p\u00b2 is a square of a prime, so Q is the square of a prime number, which is statement I.\n\nSo both statements I and II are correct. But wait, looking back at the options, option D is I and II only. So why is that not the answer? Because the options given are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that statement II is correct. So according to that, D would be the right choice. But I also thought that statement III says Q is the product of two primes. Let's see: if Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two primes, because p^4 is p multiplied by itself four times, so it's p*p*p*p, which is only one prime factor. So statement III is false.\n\nSo the correct statements are I and II. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) I and II only.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So, Q has 5 factors. The number of factors is 5, which is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product is 5*1. So the exponents in the prime factorization must be 4 and 0 for other primes. So the number is p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nSo Q = p^4. So:\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. Since p is a prime, p\u00b2 is a prime squared. So yes, statement I is true.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, because p^4 is the fourth power of p. So statement II is also true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. But p^4 is p*p*p*p, which is p^4. So it's not a product of two primes. It's a product of the same prime multiplied four times. So statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, statements I and II are true. So the correct option is D) I and II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is I and II only. So the answer should be D. But I thought earlier that statement I was correct, and II as well. So why would D be correct? Because both I and II are correct. \n\nWait, but wait again. Let me think. Q is p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2. But wait, p^2 is not a prime unless p=2, but wait, p is a prime, but p^2 is a composite number.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Q is a positive integer with 5 factors, and we need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are A to E, each combining different statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. \n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, I need to find what exponents would lead to (a+1)(b+1)... = 5. Wait, 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So that means the formula must be 5 = 5 * 1. \n\nWhich implies that Q must be of the form where one exponent is 4 (since a+1=5 \u2192 a=4), and all other exponents are zero. Because if there were more than one prime factor, then the product (a+1)(b+1) etc. would be more than 5. For example, if there were two primes, say a=1 and b=1, then (2)(2)=4, which is less than 5. So no, that's not possible.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If Q has 5 factors, which is 5=5*1, then the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because then the exponents are 4, so the number of factors is 4+1=5. Alternatively, could it be p^2 * q^1? Because (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6, which is more than 5. So that's not possible. So the only way is p^4.\n\nSo that means Q is the square of a prime number squared again? Wait, p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, which is the square of p\u00b2. Alternatively, p^4 is the fourth power of p. Oh, wait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm, because p\u00b2 is a prime squared. So if Q is p^4, that would be (p\u00b2)^2, so yes, Q is the square of a prime. Because p is a prime, so p\u00b2 is a square of a prime. So statement I is true.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, yes, because Q is p^4, so II is also true. Wait, but wait\u2014does that mean both I and II are correct? Or am I mixing something up?\n\nWait, let me recheck. If Q is p^4, then it's the square of p squared, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So Q is indeed the square of a prime number (since p is a prime, p\u00b2 is a square of a prime). So statement I is true. And Q is the fourth power of p, so statement II is also true. So both I and II are correct?\n\nBut wait, the options don't have an option where both I and II are correct. Let me look at the options again. Option D is I and II only. Hmm, but let me think again. Is Q necessarily the fourth power of a prime?\n\nWait, no. Because if Q is p^4, then yes, but is that the only possibility? Let's see. Since the number of factors is 5, which is a prime, the only way is when the number is of the form p^4. Because the number of factors is (4+1)=5. So yes, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. Also, since p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, it's the square of a prime squared, which is a prime. Wait, p is a prime. So p\u00b2 is a square of a prime, so Q is the square of a prime number, which is statement I.\n\nSo both statements I and II are correct. But wait, looking back at the options, option D is I and II only. So why is that not the answer? Because the options given are:\n\nA) I only\nB) III only\nC) II only\nD) I and II only\nE) I and III only\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that statement II is correct. So according to that, D would be the right choice. But I also thought that statement III says Q is the product of two primes. Let's see: if Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two primes, because p^4 is p multiplied by itself four times, so it's p*p*p*p, which is only one prime factor. So statement III is false.\n\nSo the correct statements are I and II. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) I and II only.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So, Q has 5 factors. The number of factors is 5, which is a prime number. So the only way to write 5 as a product is 5*1. So the exponents in the prime factorization must be 4 and 0 for other primes. So the number is p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nSo Q = p^4. So:\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. Since p is a prime, p\u00b2 is a prime squared. So yes, statement I is true.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, because p^4 is the fourth power of p. So statement II is also true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. But p^4 is p*p*p*p, which is p^4. So it's not a product of two primes. It's a product of the same prime multiplied four times. So statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, statements I and II are true. So the correct option is D) I and II only.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is I and II only. So the answer should be D. But I thought earlier that statement I was correct, and II as well. So why would D be correct? Because both I and II are correct. \n\nWait, but wait again. Let me think. Q is p^4. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2. But wait, p^2 is not a prime unless p=2, but wait, p is a prime, but p^2 is a composite number. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. Oh wait, no. Because if p is a prime, then p^2 is the square of a prime, so Q is the square of p^2. So yes, statement I is correct.\n\nWait, but that's confusing. Let me clarify: if p is a prime, then p^2 is a square of a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime number, which is true because Q is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2, and p^2 is a square of a prime. So statement I is correct.\n\nSo both I and II are correct.

The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. \n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. The formula for the number of factors is something like if a number N can be written as p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Wait, but I think that's when it's the product of two primes. Oh right, more generally, if N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... pn^an, then the number of factors is (a1+1)(a2+1)...(an+1).\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number. So the product of (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5 * 1. So that implies that the number of exponents plus one multiplied together is 5, which is prime. So, the only possibility is that one of the exponents is 4 (since 4+1=5) and all others are zero, meaning that Q must be a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Alternatively, could there be another possibility? Like, if there are two primes, but one exponent is 4 and another is 0? But wait, no, because if there are two primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). If one of them is 4, and the other is 0, that would mean (4+1)(0+1) = 5*1 =5. But wait, if the exponent is 0, that means that prime isn't actually present in the factorization. So that would reduce it to a single prime raised to the 4th power. So, the only case is that Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, but wait. Another thought: 5 can also be written as 5 itself times 1, but since 5 is prime, the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So, in the case of a single prime, it would be p^4. Because 4+1=5. So that gives exactly 5 factors: 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4. \n\nAlternatively, if there were two primes, each with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5. But since 5 is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. So one exponent is 4, the other is 0. But the exponent can't be zero if it's a factor. So the other prime isn't present. So that brings us back to the same situation: Q is a single prime to the 4th power.\n\nSo looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, square is p^2. But Q is p^4. So statement I would be incorrect. Because the square is p^2, but Q is p^4. So statement I is not true.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Yes, that's exactly what we concluded.

So p^2 is not a prime. So Q being p^4 is the square of p squared, but p squared is not a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, is that the square of a prime? Let's see: p^4 = (p^2)^2. So yes, but p^2 is not a prime; it's a square of a prime. So the statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" So if p is prime, then p^2 is not a prime.

The options are combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective powers, then the total number of factors is the product of each exponent plus one. So, for example, if Q = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nWait, the problem says Q has exactly 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 \u00d7 1. So that means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one could be 5 and 1. That implies that Q must be in the form of p^4, where p is a prime. Because if you have (4+1) =5, and other exponents would have to be zero, which means they're not present.\n\nSo, if Q is p^4, then let's look at the statements.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Well, p squared is p^2. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2, so that's the square of p squared. Wait, but I think statement I is saying Q is a square of a prime. So p is a prime, and p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2. So Q is the square of p squared, which is a composite number unless p is 2, but wait no. Wait, p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of a prime squared. Hmm, wait no, p squared is a square of a prime, but p^4 is the fourth power. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So is p^4 the square of a prime? Let me think. Let's take an example: say p=2. Then Q=2^4=16. Is 16 the square of a prime? Well, 16 is 4 squared, but 4 is not a prime. So 16 is (2\u00b2)^2, but 2\u00b2 is 4, which is composite. So statement I is not true. Because 16 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of 4, which isn't prime. So statement I is false. Wait, wait wait, that's a problem because I thought earlier that Q is p^4.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. So the number of factors formula: if Q = p^a, then the number of factors is a+1. So if a+1=5, then a=4. So Q = p^4. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is true.\n\nBut what about statement I? It says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is a square of a prime. So Q is the square of p squared. But p squared is a composite number (unless p=2, but even then, 2\u00b2=4 is composite). So Q is the square of a composite number, not a prime. Therefore, statement I is false. Wait, but wait a second. If p is a prime, then p^4 is a square of p^2, which is the square of a composite number. So statement I is not true because p^4 isn't the square of a prime; it's the square of p^2, which is composite. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that statement I is correct. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me clarify: If Q is p^4, then can it be expressed as the square of a prime? Let's take p=3. Then Q=81. 81 is 9 squared. 9 is 3 squared, so 9 is a square of a prime. So Q is (3\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of a square of a prime. But statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So 81 is 9 squared, which is a square of a composite number (9=3\u00b2, which is composite). So statement I is false.\n\nWait, so statement I is not necessarily true. Because Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is composite unless p is 2, but even then, p=2, p\u00b2=4, which is composite.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. And I need to determine which of the given statements (I, II, III) must be true about Q. The options are combinations of these statements.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right! If a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective powers, then the total number of factors is the product of each exponent plus one. So, for example, if Q = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nWait, the problem says Q has exactly 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5 \u00d7 1. So that means the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one could be 5 and 1. That implies that Q must be in the form of p^4, where p is a prime. Because if you have (4+1) =5, and other exponents would have to be zero, which means they're not present.\n\nSo, if Q is p^4, then let's look at the statements.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. Well, p squared is p^2. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2, so that's the square of p squared. Wait, but I think statement I is saying Q is a square of a prime. So p is a prime, and p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2. So Q is the square of p squared, which is a composite number unless p is 2, but wait no. Wait, p is a prime, so p squared is a square of a prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of a prime squared. Hmm, wait no, p squared is a square of a prime, but p^4 is the fourth power. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So is p^4 the square of a prime? Let me think. Let's take an example: say p=2. Then Q=2^4=16. Is 16 the square of a prime? Well, 16 is 4 squared, but 4 is not a prime. So 16 is (2\u00b2)^2, but 2\u00b2 is 4, which is composite. So statement I is not true. Because 16 is not the square of a prime; it's the square of 4, which isn't prime. So statement I is false. Wait, wait wait, that's a problem because I thought earlier that Q is p^4.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. So the number of factors formula: if Q = p^a, then the number of factors is a+1. So if a+1=5, then a=4. So Q = p^4. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is true.\n\nBut what about statement I? It says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p^2)^2, but p^2 is a square of a prime. So Q is the square of p squared. But p squared is a composite number (unless p=2, but even then, 2\u00b2=4 is composite). So Q is the square of a composite number, not a prime. Therefore, statement I is false. Wait, but wait a second. If p is a prime, then p^4 is a square of p^2, which is the square of a composite number. So statement I is not true because p^4 isn't the square of a prime; it's the square of p^2, which is composite. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that statement I is correct. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me clarify: If Q is p^4, then can it be expressed as the square of a prime? Let's take p=3. Then Q=81. 81 is 9 squared. 9 is 3 squared, so 9 is a square of a prime. So Q is (3\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of a square of a prime. But statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So 81 is 9 squared, which is a square of a composite number (9=3\u00b2, which is composite). So statement I is false.\n\nWait, so statement I is not necessarily true. Because Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is composite unless p is 2, but even then, p=2, p\u00b2=4, which is composite. So statement I is false.\n\nThen statement II is true because Q is p^4, which is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Wait, product of two primes would be p*q, where p and q are primes. The number of factors of p*q would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But Q has 5 factors, so statement III can't be true. Because if Q were the product of two primes, it would have 4 factors, not 5. So statement III is false.\n\nSo the correct statements are only statement II. So looking at the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 no, because II is correct and I is not.\n\nB) III only \u2192 no, III is false.\n\nC) II only \u2192 yes, because II is correct.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 no, because I is wrong.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 no, both are wrong.\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: II only.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check. I thought earlier that statement I is false, but maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again: statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So for Q to be a square of a prime, it must be p^2. But Q is p^4, which is (p^2)^2. So Q is a square, but of p squared, which is a composite. So statement I is false.

The formula for the number of factors is based on the exponents in the prime decomposition. Like, if a number N can be written as p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1), right?\n\nSo, since Q has 5 factors, I should think about how 5 can be expressed as a product of integers. Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product is 5 * 1. That means the exponents plus one multiply to 5. So that would be either (4) or (5,0), but since exponents can't be negative, the exponents themselves must be 4 and 0, but wait, no, because the formula is (a+1)(b+1)... So, if we have a number with two prime factors, but that would require (a+1)(b+1) =5. But 5 is prime, so that's only possible if one of the exponents is 4, and the other is 0. But wait, if one exponent is 0, that would mean that prime isn't actually a factor, right? So that's not possible. So maybe the number has only one prime factor.\n\nWait, so if Q is a single prime raised to the 4th power, then the number of factors would be 4+1=5. That makes sense. So Q would be p^4, where p is a prime. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, p squared is p^2, but in this case, it's p^4. So statement I is not correct because p^4 is the square of p squared, but not the square of a prime. Wait no, p is a prime. So p squared is (p)^2, and p^4 is (p^2)^2. So statement I would be p squared, which is p^2, but in this case, Q is p^4. So statement I is not true. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So Q = (prime)^2. But in our case, Q is (prime)^4. So statement I is false. Oh wait, but wait, if a number has 5 factors, does it have to be p^4? Let me think again. Because 5 is a prime number, the only way to have (a+1)(b+1) =5 is if one of the exponents is 4, and the others are zero. So the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime.

So statement I is false.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I messed up. So if the number of factors is 5, then the exponents in the prime factorization must be such that (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since 5 is prime, the only possibility is a=4 and b=0 (or vice versa, but since b=0, that prime isn't a factor). So the number must be of the form p^4, where p is prime. So Q is p^4. So statement I says it's the square of a prime. But p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So statement I is not correct. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. Suppose I have a number that's the square of a prime. That would be p^2. The number of factors would be (2+1) =3. So 3 factors, which is not 5. So statement I can't be true because if Q had 5 factors, it can't be the square of a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement II? Statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, yes, because we've determined that Q must be p^4. So statement II is true.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. What about statement III? Statement III says Q is the product of two primes.

Oh right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were two or more terms, their product would have to be 5, but 5 can't be broken down further. So that implies that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because then the exponents plus one would be 4+1=5. So that would give exactly 5 factors.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that fits. Alternatively, could Q be a product of two primes each raised to some exponents? Let's see. Suppose Q = p^a * q^b. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this to be 5, which is a prime, one of the terms must be 1 and the other 5. But exponents can't be zero because then that prime wouldn't be part of the factorization. Wait, no, wait. Wait, exponents can be zero? No, wait, if a prime is raised to the zero power, it's 1, so that prime wouldn't be a factor. So actually, in the prime factorization, each exponent must be at least 1. So (a+1) and (b+1) would be at least 2 each. But 5 is prime, so the only way is one of them is 5 and the other is 1, but since exponents can't be zero, that's not possible. So Q can't be a product of two primes. So that would mean that statement III is false.

The options are A) I only, B) III only, C) II only, D) I and II, E) I and III.\n\nWait, I thought statement II is correct. So if II is correct, but I is wrong, then the correct answer would be C) II only.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Let me make sure. Let's take some examples. For example, take 16, which is 2^4. Its factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. That's 5 factors. So that fits. So statement II is correct.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q. The options are combinations of these statements, so I have to evaluate each one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc. So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5*1. So that means there's only one term in the product, right? Because if there were two or more terms, their product would have to be 5, but 5 can't be broken down further. So that implies that Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because then the exponents plus one would be 4+1=5. So that would give exactly 5 factors.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that fits. Alternatively, could Q be a product of two primes each raised to some exponents? Let's see. Suppose Q = p^a * q^b. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this to be 5, which is a prime, one of the terms must be 1 and the other 5. But exponents can't be zero because then that prime wouldn't be part of the factorization. Wait, no, wait. Wait, exponents can be zero? No, wait, if a prime is raised to the zero power, it's 1, so that prime wouldn't be a factor. So actually, in the prime factorization, each exponent must be at least 1. So (a+1) and (b+1) would be at least 2 each. But 5 is prime, so the only way is one of them is 5 and the other is 1, but since exponents can't be zero, that's not possible. So Q can't be a product of two primes. So that would mean that statement III is false. Because statement III says Q is the product of two primes, but actually, that would require exponents to be 1 each, leading to (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors, which is less than 5. So that can't be.\n\nSo that rules out statement III. Now let's look at the options. The options are I, II, III.\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p^2, then the number of factors is 2+1=3. But the question says Q has 5 factors. So statement I is not correct because that would only give 3 factors.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the number of factors a number has. Oh right, if a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime. So, the exponents are each increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSo Q has 5 factors. 5 is a prime number, right? So the only way to express 5 as a product is 5 * 1. That means the number of exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one can only be 5 and 1. That would imply that Q has only one prime factor, because if it had more, their exponents plus one would contribute to the product, making it more than one term.\n\nSo for example, if Q is p^4, then the number of factors is (4+1) =5. Because 4+1=5. So that's one possibility. Another possibility would be if Q is p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1)=5. But since 5 is prime, the only way is (5,1) or (1,5). So either a=4 and b=0 or a=0 and b=4. But since exponents can't be negative, and if b=0, that means that prime isn't present. So essentially, it's just a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, but wait. Are there other ways? Like, could Q be the product of two primes each raised to some power? Let's see. Suppose Q is p^4, then factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's 5 factors. Alternatively, if Q is p\u00b2 * q^1, then the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6, which is more than 5. So that doesn't fit. So the only way to have 5 factors is if it's a single prime raised to the 4th power.\n\nWait, no, wait another thought. What about if the exponent is 4? Because if the exponent is 4, the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that would mean Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared, so p squared is p\u00b2, and p squared again is p\u2074. So Q is (p\u00b2)\u00b2, which is the square of a prime squared. Hmm, but wait, that's not quite right. Because p^4 is the fourth power of a prime. Oh right! So statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime, which would be true. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, no. If Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2, which is the square of p squared. So p squared is a prime? No, wait, p is a prime, so p squared is not a prime, it's a composite. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then p is a prime, but p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2. So if p is a prime, p squared is a composite. So statement I is saying Q is the square of a prime. So, is p squared a prime? No. So statement I would not hold. Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, the statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q is p^4, then is that the square of a prime? Let's see. Let me take an example. Let p=2. Then p^4 is 16. The square of a prime would be (2^2)=4, which is 4. Wait, no, the square of a prime would be (p)^2, so p is prime. So 2 squared is 4. So 4 is the square of a prime. 16 is 4 squared, which is (2^2)^2=2^4. So 16 is the fourth power of a prime, but also, it's the square of 4, which is 2 squared. So wait, 16 is both the square of a composite (4) and the fourth power of a prime (2). So, in this case, Q=16. Is statement I true? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, 16 is the square of 4, which is not a prime. Because 4 is composite. So statement I would be false in this case. So statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but wait another angle. Let me think of another example. Let me take Q= p^4 where p is a prime. So p is 3, Q=81. 81 is 9 squared, and 9 is 3 squared. So 81 is the square of 9, which is a composite. So again, statement I is false because 81 is not the square of a prime. It's the square of a composite number (9). So statement I is not true.\n\nSo statement I is not necessarily true because Q could be the fourth power of a prime, but that's not the same as being the square of a prime. So I is not correct.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. Well, in our analysis, Q must be p^4, so yes, statement II is true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Well, if Q is p^4, then it's just a single prime raised to a power, not a product of two different primes. So statement III is false.\n\nWait, but wait another point. Let's think again. If Q has exactly 5 factors, that's only possible if it's the fourth power of a prime, right? Because if it were the product of two primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. So that's not the case. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait, another scenario: if Q is the product of a prime squared and another prime, like p^2 * q. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6. That's more than 5, so that's not the case either. So the only way to have exactly 5 factors is when Q is p^4.\n\nSo, to recap: Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared. But p squared is a composite (since p is prime). So Q is the square of a composite, not a prime. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's correct because Q is p^4.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. No, because it's a single prime raised to the fourth power, not a product of two distinct primes. So statement III is false.\n\nSo looking at the options, the correct statements are only II.\n\nWait, but the options given are:\n\nA) I only\n\nB) III only\n\nC) II only\n\nD) I and II only\n\nE) I and III only\n\nSo the correct choice should be C) II only.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other possibilities for Q having 5 factors? Let me think again. The number of factors is 5, which is prime. So the only possible exponents are 4 for a single prime. So yes, only II is correct.\n",

Let me read it again: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q? The options are I, II, III, and the choices are combinations of these.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has relates to its prime factorization. Oh right, the formula for the number of divisors. I think it's that if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... , then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(...) and so on for each prime.\n\nSo the problem says Q has 5 factors. Wait, 5 is a prime number. So the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself, right? Because 5 is prime, it can't be broken down into smaller factors other than 1 and 5. So that means that the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5.\n\nWhich means, the exponents plus one multiplied together give 5. So what are the possible exponent combinations here? Let's think. If we have only one prime factor, then the exponent plus one must equal 5. So a+1=5 \u2192 a=4. So Q would be p^4, where p is prime. So that would make the number of factors (4+1)=5.\n\nAlternatively, could there be more than one prime factor? Let's see. Suppose Q has two different primes. Then the product (a+1)(b+1) would need to be 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5=5*1. So one of the exponents plus one would be 5, the other would be 1. So exponents would be 4 and 0. Wait, but exponents can't be negative. So that would mean one prime has exponent 4, and another has exponent 0. But exponent zero means that prime isn't present. So that reduces to just a single prime factor with exponent 4. So that doesn't add any new possibilities.\n\nWhat if there are three primes? Then (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... would have to be 5. But 5 can't be written as a product of three numbers greater than 1 because 5 is prime. So that's not possible. So the only possible scenario is that Q is the fourth power of a single prime number.\n\nWait, so that would mean Q = p^4, where p is prime. Let me confirm: the number of factors is (4+1)=5. Yep, that's right.\n\nNow let's look at the statements I, II, III.\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Hmm. Wait, if Q is p^4, then it's a square of p^2. So p squared is also a prime squared? No, wait. If p is a prime, then p^2 is the square of a prime. So Q is (p^2)^2, which is p^4. So is Q a square of a prime? No, because p^2 is a prime squared, but Q is (p^2)^2. So Q is a square of p^2, which is itself a square. So yes, Q is a square. Because any number squared is a square. So statement I is true.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. If Q is p^4, then it's (p^2)^2. So Q is a square of p^2. But p^2 is not a prime; it's a composite number. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime number. So that would be p^2, but Q is p^4. So statement I is not true because Q is the square of a composite, not a prime. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. So if Q were p^2, then yes, it's the square of a prime. But in our case, Q is p^4. So is p^4 a square of a prime? Let's see. The square of a prime would be (p)^2. But p^4 is (p^2)^2, which is the square of p^2, which is a composite. So Q is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite. So statement I is false.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think of an example. Let\u2019s take p=2. So Q=2^4=16. Now, is 16 the square of a prime? The square of 2 is 4, which is a prime squared. 16 is 4 squared. So 4 is not a prime, so 16 is the square of a composite number (4 is composite). So 16 is not the square of a prime. Hence, statement I is false.\n\nSo statement I is false.\n\nWhat about statement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. Oh yes, that's exactly what we have. Because Q is p^4. So statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Hmm, so Q would be p * q, where p and q are primes. Let's think about the number of factors in that case. If Q is p * q, both primes, then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. But our Q has 5 factors, so that's not possible. So statement III is false.\n\nSo now, looking at the options:\n\nI is false, II is true, III is false.\n\nWait, so which option says only II is true? Let me check the options:\n\nA) I only \u2192 No, because II is true.\n\nB) III only \u2192 No.\n\nC) II only \u2192 Yes.\n\nD) I and II only \u2192 No, because I is false.\n\nE) I and III only \u2192 No.\n\nSo the correct answer is C) II only.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought statement I was true. Now I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine. Because if Q is p^4, then it's a square of p^2, which is (p squared). But p squared is not a prime, so Q is not the square of a prime. So I is false. So statement I is false, statement II is true, statement III is false. So only II is true.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought maybe statement I was true, but I corrected myself. So the answer is option C.\n",

The options are combinations of these, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. So, I think the formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents in the prime factorization, add one to each, and multiply them together. Right? So, for example, if a number Q has a prime factorization like p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nIn this problem, Q has 5 factors. So, I need to find what form Q must take such that the product of (exponents +1) equals 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than zero is 5*1. So, that means the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1, or 1 and 5.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this question about number theory, specifically about the number of factors a positive integer can have. Hmm, I remember that the number of factors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization of the number. Let me think through this.\n\nThe question says that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true about Q.\n\nFirst, I recall that if a number Q has a prime factorization of the form Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... * p\u2099^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). So each exponent is increased by one and multiplied together.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, I need to find what exponents would result in 5 when applying this formula. Let's see, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write it as a product is 5 = 5 \u00d7 1. That means that in the prime factorization of Q, there must be only one term (since any more would require more than two factors in the product), and that term would be 5. So that implies that Q is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. Because if the exponent is 4, then 4+1=5, which gives exactly 5 factors.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. If Q is p^4, then the factors would be 1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3, p\u2074. That's five factors. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, looking at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. Wait, if Q is p\u00b2, then the number of factors would be 3 (1, p, p\u00b2). But Q has 5 factors, so I must be incorrect. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, I thought Q is p\u2074. So statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would be p\u00b2, which would have 3 factors, not 5. So statement I is not correct. Or wait, am I mixing up something?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's clarify. If Q is the square of a prime, that's p\u00b2. Its factors are 1, p, p\u00b2. That's 3 factors, which is not 5. So statement I is false.\n\nBut wait, I thought that Q must be p^4, so that would mean that statement II is correct. Because statement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. So II is true.\n\nBut wait, statement I says it's the square, which is p\u00b2, which is not correct. So I is false. So that would make statement II correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because 5 is a prime, the only way to write it as a product is 5 \u00d71. So the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one would be 5 and 1. That means the exponents themselves are 4 and 0. But wait, exponents can't be zero in prime factorization unless you include primes with exponent zero, which effectively doesn't contribute. So that would mean that the number has only one prime factor with exponent 4. So yes, Q must be p\u2074.\n\nSo statement II is correct because Q is p\u2074, the fourth power of a prime.\n\nWhat about statement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. If Q were the product of two primes, say p and q, then its prime factorization would be p^1 * q^1. The number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. But Q has 5 factors, which is not possible. So statement III is incorrect.\n\nWait, but wait another possibility. What if the number is a cube of a prime? Then exponents would be 3, so factors would be 4 (1, p, p\u00b2, p\u00b3). Still not 5. So the only way to have 5 factors is when the exponent is 4 on a single prime.\n\nSo statements I is incorrect because that would give 3 factors. Statement II is correct. Statement III is incorrect because that would give 4 factors.\n\nWait, but the options don't have an option where only II is correct. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A) I only; B) III only; C) II only; D) I and II only; E) I and III only.\n\nSo option C is II only, which seems to be correct. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but I thought I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would give 3 factors, not 5. So I is false. Statement II says Q is the fourth power, which gives 5 factors. So II is true. So only II must be true. So the correct option is C: II only.\n\nWait, but the options are A, B, C, D, E. So the correct answer is C. But wait, I remember another case. Suppose the number has more than one prime factor, but then the exponents would have to be such that the product of (exponents+1) is 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is one exponent of 4 and others zero. So Q can't have more than one prime factor. Therefore, statement III is incorrect because that would imply two primes, each with exponent 1, which gives (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors, which is less than 5. So yes, III is wrong.\n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So the answer is option C.\n",

The options are combinations of these statements, so I have to evaluate each one.\n\nWait, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number Q has a prime factorization of, say, p^a * q^b, then the total number of factors is (a+1)*(b+1). So I should apply this formula here.\n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is a prime number, the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself.
