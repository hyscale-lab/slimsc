      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at 70 rupees each and shirts at 30 rupees each. What will be the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, the options are given as A to E, with each option indicating a certain number of trousers. Wait, no, looking again, the options are labeled A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Are the options giving the number of trousers, or are they giving the ratio? Oh wait, the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is bought. So the options probably represent the possible ratios, but in the given options, the options are just numbers of trousers, not ratios. That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the options are the number of trousers, and from that, we can find the number of shirts and hence the ratio. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let's try to proceed.\n\nWait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again. The man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the goal is to maximize the number of trousers, which would imply that he buys as many as possible without exceeding 810 rupees, and then the remaining money is spent on shirts. Once we have the number of each, we can find the ratio.\n\nWait, but the problem is about maximizing the number of trousers, so he should buy as many as possible, then use the remaining money for shirts. So let's model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet x = number of trousers bought.\n\nLet y = number of shirts bought.\n\nThe total cost equation is: 70x + 30y = 810.\n\nWe need to find the maximum integer x such that 70x \u2264810, and then see what y would be.\n\nSo first, find the maximum x.\n\n70x \u2264810 \u2192 x \u2264 810/70. Let's calculate that.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let me compute 70*11=770, 70*12=840. 770 is 70*11. 810-770=40. So 810/70 is 11.571 approximately. So the maximum integer x is 11. Wait, but 70*11 is 770, which is under 810. So then the remaining money is 810-770=40. Can he buy shirts with that? Each shirt is 30, so 40/30 is 1.333, which is 1 shirt with 10 rupees left. But the question is about purchasing, so he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So y would be 1.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*11=770, then 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, which is 1 shirt (30 rupees), leaving 10 rupees unused. Is that acceptable? The problem doesn't specify whether he has to spend all the money, just that he spends 810. So perhaps the assumption is that he spends exactly 810. So in that case, 70x +30y =810, and we need x to be as large as possible, which would require that 70x is as large as possible without exceeding 810, and then 30y=810-70x.\n\nBut 70x must be such that 810-70x is divisible by 30, because y must be an integer. So 70x must be congruent to 810 mod 30.\n\nLet me think about this. 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70x mod30 is 10x mod30. 810 mod30 is 0 because 30*27=810. So 10x \u22610 mod30. Simplify this: 10x is a multiple of 30 \u2192 x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x has to be a multiple of 3. Because 10x mod30=0 \u2192 x mod3=0.\n\nSo x can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but not exceeding 11 because 11.57 is the max x.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x could be 11, but according to this, x has to be a multiple of 3. So the maximum x that is a multiple of 3 and less than or equal to 11 is 9. Because 11 isn't a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. 70x +30y=810. So 70x must be \u2264810, but also, 810-70x must be divisible by 30. So 810-70x =30y \u2192 y=(810-70x)/30. For y to be integer, (810-70x) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me write 810=30*27. So 70x must be such that 810-70x is a multiple of 30. So 70x must be congruent to 810 mod30. 810 mod30 is 0. So 70x mod30=0. 70 mod30 is 10. So 10x mod30=0. So 10x must be a multiple of 30. So x must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo x can be 3,6,9,12, etc., but 70*12=840>810, which is over. So maximum x is 9, because 70*9=630, and 810-630=180, which is 30*6 \u2192 y=6. So x=9, y=6. So the ratio of x:y is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are given as numbers of trousers. So the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the question is, when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, what is the ratio? So in this case, the maximum x is 9, leading to a ratio of 9:6 or 3:2. So the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about x=11, but that would leave 40, which is not divisible by 30. So x=11 is not allowed because y would not be integer. So x=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but what about x=9, y=6. Let me check the total cost: 9*70=630, 6*30=180, total 810. Yes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, is there a higher x that is a multiple of 3? 9 is the next after 6. 9+3=12, which is over, as 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo the correct answer is 9 trousers, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees.

The goal is to maximize \\(x\\) while ensuring \\(y\\) is an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Maximize \\(x\\)\nThe maximum possible \\(x\\) is determined by the constraint \\(70x \\leq 810\\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives:\n\n\\[\nx \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be an integer, the maximum possible \\(x\\) is 11.

Therefore, the possible values of \\(x\\) are 3, 6, 9, etc. The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 11 is 9.\n\n### Step 3: Verify \\(x = 9\\)\nIf \\(x = 9\\), the total cost for trousers is:\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630\n\\]\n\nThe remaining amount for shirts is:\n\n\\[\n810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\nDividing this by the cost of one shirt (30 rupees) gives:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 9\\) and \\(y = 6\\) satisfy the equation, and the ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), which simplifies to \\(3:2\\).\n\n### Step 4: Check higher multiples of 3\nThe next multiple of 3 after 9 is 12. However, \\(70 \\times 12 = 840\\), which exceeds 810. Therefore, \\(x = 12\\) is not valid.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9, and the corresponding ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\) or \\(3:2\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the first thing I should do is set up an equation based on the given information. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost would be the cost of the trousers plus the cost of the shirts, right? So that's 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of trousers he can buy. So I need to find the largest possible integer value for T such that the total cost doesn't exceed 810 rupees. Also, since S has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), I'll need to ensure that the remaining money after buying T trousers can be exactly divided by the price of a shirt, which is 30.\n\nSo the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. Let me rearrange this to solve for S. Subtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T. Then divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30. Simplify that, maybe factor out 10 from numerator and denominator. So, 810 is 81*10, 70 is 7*10, and 30 is 3*10. So, 10*(81 -7T)/10*3 \u2192 (81-7T)/3. So S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S has to be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let me think about what that means. Let's compute 81 mod 3. 3*27=81, so 81 mod3 is 0. 7T mod3 is (7 mod3)*(T mod3). 7 mod3 is 1, so it's T mod3. So 81-7T mod3 is (0 - (T mod3)) mod3. For this to be 0, (0 - T mod3) must be 0 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because 81 is divisible by 3, 70T must leave a remainder that when subtracted gives a multiple of 3. Alternatively, 7T must be congruent to 0 mod3, because 81 is 0 mod3. So 7T \u2261 0 mod3. Since 7 mod3 is 1, this implies T must be 0 mod3. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9, etc. But since we need the maximum T, let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264810.\n\nWhat's the maximum T? Let's see. 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum possible integer T is 11. But wait, we have to check if 11 is a multiple of 3. 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 2. So 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9. Let's check if that works.\n\nIf T=9, then 70*9=630. So the remaining money is 810-630=180. Then S=180/30=6. So that's a whole number. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me make sure if 9 is indeed the maximum possible. Because what if T=9 is the maximum multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 11.57. Because 11 is not a multiple of 3, so we can't use it. So 9 is the next lower. But wait, maybe I should check T=10 or T=11 even if they are not multiples of 3. Because maybe when T=10, the remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which is not a whole number. So S would not be an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nWhat about T=11? 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's no good.\n\nSo the next lower T is 9. Let me check T=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So yes, S=6 is valid.\n\nWait, but what about T=8? Let's see. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't an integer. So that's invalid. So T=9 is the maximum number of trousers that allows S to be an integer.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is T:S = 9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3: 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, looking back at the question, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to maximize T, given that 70T +30S =810, with T and S integers \u22650.\n\nSo we can write 70T = 810 -30S \u2192 70T = 30(27 - S).\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7T = 3(27 - S).\n\nSo 7T must be a multiple of 3, which implies T must be a multiple of 3, as 7 and 3 are coprime.\n\nSo T=3k, where k is an integer. Then, 7*(3k)=21k =3(27 - S) \u2192 7k =27 - S \u2192 S=27-7k.\n\nWe also have to have S \u22650, so 27 -7k \u22650 \u2192 7k \u226427 \u2192 k \u22643.857. Since k must be integer, maximum k is 3.\n\nSo k=3 \u2192 T=9, S=27-7*3=27-21=6. Which gives 9 trousers and 6 shirts. That's the maximum T possible.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6 =3:2, but the question is only about the number of trousers, which is 9, so the correct option is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt is 30 rupees. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the first thing I should do is set up an equation based on the given information. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. The total cost would be the cost of the trousers plus the cost of the shirts, right? So that's 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of trousers he can buy. So I need to find the largest possible integer value for T such that the total cost doesn't exceed 810 rupees. Also, since S has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), I'll need to ensure that the remaining money after buying T trousers can be exactly divided by the price of a shirt, which is 30.\n\nSo the equation is 70T + 30S = 810. Let me rearrange this to solve for S. Subtract 70T from both sides: 30S = 810 -70T. Then divide both sides by 30: S = (810 -70T)/30. Simplify that, maybe factor out 10 from numerator and denominator. So, 810 is 81*10, 70 is 7*10, and 30 is 3*10. So, 10*(81 -7T)/10*3 \u2192 (81-7T)/3. So S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S has to be a whole number, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3. Let me think about what that means. Let's compute 81 mod 3. 3*27=81, so 81 mod3 is 0. 7T mod3 is (7 mod3)*(T mod3). 7 mod3 is 1, so it's T mod3. So 81-7T mod3 is (0 - (T mod3)) mod3. For this to be 0, (0 - T mod3) must be 0 mod3. So T mod3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Because 81 is divisible by 3, 70T must leave a remainder that when subtracted gives a multiple of 3. Alternatively, 7T must be congruent to 0 mod3, because 81 is 0 mod3. So 7T \u2261 0 mod3. Since 7 mod3 is 1, this implies T must be 0 mod3. So T has to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9, etc. But since we need the maximum T, let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264810.\n\nWhat's the maximum T? Let's see. 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. So the maximum possible integer T is 11. But wait, we have to check if 11 is a multiple of 3. 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 2. So 11 isn't a multiple of 3. So next lower multiple of 3 is 9. So T=9. Let's check if that works.\n\nIf T=9, then 70*9=630. So the remaining money is 810-630=180. Then S=180/30=6. So that's a whole number. So that works.\n\nWait, but let me make sure if 9 is indeed the maximum possible. Because what if T=9 is the maximum multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 11.57. Because 11 is not a multiple of 3, so we can't use it. So 9 is the next lower. But wait, maybe I should check T=10 or T=11 even if they are not multiples of 3. Because maybe when T=10, the remaining money is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which is not a whole number. So S would not be an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nWhat about T=11? 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30 is about 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's no good.\n\nSo the next lower T is 9. Let me check T=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So yes, S=6 is valid.\n\nWait, but what about T=8? Let's see. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't an integer. So that's invalid. So T=9 is the maximum number of trousers that allows S to be an integer.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is T:S = 9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3: 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, looking back at the question, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my initial approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is to maximize T, given that 70T +30S =810, with T and S integers \u22650.\n\nSo we can write 70T = 810 -30S \u2192 70T = 30(27 - S).\n\nDivide both sides by 10: 7T = 3(27 - S).\n\nSo 7T must be a multiple of 3, which implies T must be a multiple of 3, as 7 and 3 are coprime.\n\nSo T=3k, where k is an integer. Then, 7*(3k)=21k =3(27 - S) \u2192 7k =27 - S \u2192 S=27-7k.\n\nWe also have to have S \u22650, so 27 -7k \u22650 \u2192 7k \u226427 \u2192 k \u22643.857. Since k must be integer, maximum k is 3.\n\nSo k=3 \u2192 T=9, S=27-7*3=27-21=6. Which gives 9 trousers and 6 shirts. That's the maximum T possible.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6 =3:2, but the question is only about the number of trousers, which is 9, so the correct option is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the number of trousers be \\( T \\) and the number of shirts be \\( S \\). The total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{810 - 70T}{30}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S \\) to be an integer, \\( 810 - 70T \\) must be divisible by 30. Simplifying, \\( 70T \\) must leave a remainder that ensures \\( 810 - 70T \\) is divisible by 30. Since \\( 70 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), \\( T \\) must be a multiple of 3 to satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\nThe maximum \\( T \\) is found by solving \\( 70T \\leq 810 \\). Dividing \\( 810 \\) by \\( 70 \\) gives approximately \\( 11.57 \\), so the largest integer \\( T \\) is \\( 11 \\). However, \\( 11 \\) is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is \\( 9 \\).\n\nChecking \\( T = 9 \\):\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630\n\\]\n\\[\n810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\\[\nS = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( T = 9 \\) and \\( S = 6 \\) are valid. Testing higher multiples of 3 (e.g., \\( T = 12 \\)) exceeds the total budget, so \\( T = 9 \\) is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is \\( 9:6 \\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers, which is \\( 9 \\).\n\nAnswer: A",

Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nWait, wait. So the man has a total of 810 rupees to spend. He buys some number of trousers and shirts. The cost per trouser is 70 rupees, and each shirt is 30 rupees. The goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys. Then, we have to find the ratio of trousers to shirts under this condition.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me think. The problem is about maximizing the number of trousers, which means we want as many trousers as possible within the 810 rupees. But since shirts are cheaper, if buying more trousers leaves some money left, we can buy shirts with that. So the idea is to buy as many trousers as possible first, then see how many shirts can be bought with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but how does the ratio come into play here? Because the ratio depends on the exact numbers of each item bought. So first, let's model the problem mathematically.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S.\n\nThe total cost equation would be: 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, and we want T to be as large as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is to maximize T, which means we should find the maximum T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and then see if the remaining amount can be divided by 30 for S.\n\nLet me compute the maximum possible T without considering shirts first.\n\n70*T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810 /70 \u2192 Let me calculate that. 70 * 11 is 770, and 70*12 is 840 which is over 810. So T can be at most 11? Wait, wait. Because 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees. Can 40 be divided by 30? 40 /30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So S would have to be 1, but that would cost 30, leaving 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. Hmm, so maybe 11 isn't possible because the remaining 40 can't be fully used for shirts.\n\nWait, maybe I should try T=11 and see. If T=11, then 70*11=770. Remaining money is 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So S=1, but 30*1=30, so 770+30=800. But that leaves 10 rupees unspent, which is allowed because the problem doesn't say he has to spend all the money. So the total would be 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio would be 11:1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a higher T that allows S to be an integer. Let me check T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 /30 is 3.666... which isn't an integer. So S can be 3, which would cost 90, leaving 20. So 10+3=13 items, but the ratio would be 10:3. But since 11 is a higher number of trousers, that's better.\n\nWait, but what about T=9? 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. So S=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. That's a ratio of 9:6 which simplifies to 3:2. But the number of trousers is 9, which is less than 11, so 11 is better.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe there's a way to have a higher T than 11. Let me see, what if T=12? 70*12=840, which is over 810. So no, can't do that.\n\nWait, but perhaps if T is 11, and the remaining 40 can't be used for shirts, but perhaps the man buys fewer trousers so that the remaining money can be fully used for shirts. Let's check. Because if the remaining money is not enough for another shirt, then maybe buying one less trouser could allow more shirts.\n\nLet me try T=10 again. 70*10=700. Remaining 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So that's 3 shirts, but 3*30=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. So perhaps if T=9, 70*9=630. Remaining 180. 180/30=6. So that's 6 shirts. So for T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but since the problem is to maximize the number of trousers, T=11 is better than T=9, even though with T=11, we can't use all the remaining money for shirts. So, the maximum number of trousers is 11, and the remaining 40 can't be used, but perhaps the man doesn't have to spend all the money. So, he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach is to model it as 70T + 30S = 810. We can rewrite this as 7T + 3S = 81, by dividing both sides by 10. Now, we can model it as 7T + 3S = 81, with T and S being non-negative integers. We need to maximize T.\n\nSo, solving for S: 3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, and S must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me find the values of T where (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nSince 81 is divisible by 3 (81/3=27), 7T must also be congruent to 0 mod 3 for (81-7T) to be divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 81 mod 3 is 0, and 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod 3 is T mod 3. So 7T mod 3 must be 0 \u2192 T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But since 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u226411 as before.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*9=630, 70*12=840 which is over 810, so T can be up to 11. But according to this, T must be a multiple of 3. So the possible T's are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11 was possible, but according to this, T must be a multiple of 3. So perhaps T=9 is the maximum possible in this scenario.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting with my earlier approach. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check. When I considered T=11, I found that 70*11=770, leaving 40. But according to the equation 7T +3S=81, substituting T=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is not an integer. So that's why T=11 isn't allowed, because S has to be integer.\n\nWait, so I was wrong earlier. T=11 isn't a valid solution because S would not be an integer. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the man didn't have to spend all the money. So perhaps the problem allows for some leftover money. Oh wait, but the problem states that he spends 810 in buying the items. So he must spend exactly 810. Because he can't have any leftover money; he's using all of it to buy the items. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. He must spend all 810, so S must be such that 70T +30S =810 exactly.\n\nSo in that case, T must be a multiple of 3, as per the equation above. Because 70T +30S =810 \u2192 7T +3S =81.\n\nSo 7T must leave a remainder of 0 when subtracted from 81, because 3S must be an integer.\n\nWait, so let me think again. 7T +3S =81. So 3S =81 -7T \u2192 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So 7T mod3 must be 0 because 81 mod3 is 0.\n\nAs 7 mod3 is 1, T must be congruent to 0 mod3. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But 70*12=840 which is more than 810, so T can be up to 9.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum T in these values. So T=9.\n\nWhen T=9, 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 3S=18 \u2192 S=6.\n\nSo the number of shirts is 6.\n\nThus, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options don't include this ratio directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, the question asks for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, no, the options are labeled as options for the ratio, but each option is a number with 'Trousers'. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait, looking back: the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So each option is giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased, which is 9.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Because earlier when I thought T=9, S=6, that's 9:6 ratio, which is 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, the maximum number of trousers is 9, and the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options don't give ratios, they give the number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio is to be found, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I've misread the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So each option gives the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers that can be bought, not the ratio. But the wording says 'ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased'.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. The wording is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but the way they are written is a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the maximum T is 9, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9 Trousers.\n",

So no, can't do that.\n\nWait, but perhaps if T is 11, and the remaining 40 can't be used for shirts, but perhaps the man buys fewer trousers so that the remaining money can be fully used for shirts. Let's check. Because if the remaining money is not enough for another shirt, then maybe buying one less trouser could allow more shirts.\n\nLet me try T=10 again. 70*10=700. Remaining 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So that's 3 shirts, but 3*30=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. So perhaps if T=9, 70*9=630. Remaining 180. 180/30=6. So that's 6 shirts. So for T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but since the problem is to maximize the number of trousers, T=11 is better than T=9, even though with T=11, we can't use all the remaining money for shirts. So, the maximum number of trousers is 11, and the remaining 40 can't be used, but perhaps the man doesn't have to spend all the money. So, he buys 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach is to model it as 70T + 30S = 810. We can rewrite this as 7T + 3S = 81, by dividing both sides by 10. Now, we can model it as 7T + 3S = 81, with T and S being non-negative integers. We need to maximize T.\n\nSo, solving for S: 3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81 -7T) to be divisible by 3, and S must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me find the values of T where (81 -7T) is divisible by 3.\n\nSince 81 is divisible by 3 (81/3=27), 7T must also be congruent to 0 mod 3 for (81-7T) to be divisible by 3.\n\nBecause 81 mod 3 is 0, and 7 mod 3 is 1. So 7T mod 3 is T mod 3. So 7T mod 3 must be 0 \u2192 T mod 3 must be 0. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo T can be 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But since 70*T \u2264810 \u2192 T \u226411 as before.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait, 70*9=630, 70*12=840 which is over 810, so T can be up to 11. But according to this, T must be a multiple of 3. So the possible T's are 0,3,6,9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=11 was possible, but according to this, T must be a multiple of 3. So perhaps T=9 is the maximum possible in this scenario.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting with my earlier approach. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check. When I considered T=11, I found that 70*11=770, leaving 40. But according to the equation 7T +3S=81, substituting T=11: 7*11=77. 81-77=4. So 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is not an integer. So that's why T=11 isn't allowed, because S has to be integer.\n\nWait, so I was wrong earlier. T=11 isn't a valid solution because S would not be an integer. So the maximum T is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the man didn't have to spend all the money. So perhaps the problem allows for some leftover money. Oh wait, but the problem states that he spends 810 in buying the items. So he must spend exactly 810. Because he can't have any leftover money; he's using all of it to buy the items. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. He must spend all 810, so S must be such that 70T +30S =810 exactly.\n\nSo in that case, T must be a multiple of 3, as per the equation above. Because 70T +30S =810 \u2192 7T +3S =81.\n\nSo 7T must leave a remainder of 0 when subtracted from 81, because 3S must be an integer.\n\nWait, so let me think again. 7T +3S =81. So 3S =81 -7T \u2192 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So 7T mod3 must be 0 because 81 mod3 is 0.\n\nAs 7 mod3 is 1, T must be congruent to 0 mod3. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12, etc. But 70*12=840 which is more than 810, so T can be up to 9.\n\nSo possible T values are 0,3,6,9.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum T in these values. So T=9.\n\nWhen T=9, 7*9=63 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 3S=18 \u2192 S=6.\n\nSo the number of shirts is 6.\n\nThus, the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options don't include this ratio directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, the options are the number of trousers, not the ratio. Hmm, the question asks for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, but the options are giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, no, the options are labeled as options for the ratio, but each option is a number with 'Trousers'. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.\n\nWait, looking back: the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So each option is giving the number of trousers, not the ratio. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is purchased, which is 9.\n\nSo the correct answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Because earlier when I thought T=9, S=6, that's 9:6 ratio, which is 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, the maximum number of trousers is 9, and the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options don't give ratios, they give the number of trousers.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nSo the ratio is to be found, but the options are giving only the number of trousers. Hmm, perhaps I've misread the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled as A)9 Trousers, B)8 Trousers, etc. So each option gives the number of trousers, not the ratio. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the maximum number of trousers that can be bought, not the ratio. But the wording says 'ratio of trouser and shirt when maximum number of trouser is purchased'.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. The wording is a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the possible ratios, but the way they are written is a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving the number of trousers, and the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the maximum T is 9, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nSo the answer should be A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure must be exactly 810 rupees, meaning the remaining money after buying trousers must be fully utilized to buy shirts.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the equation\nThe total cost equation is:\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. To simplify, divide the entire equation by 10:\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Maximize \\(T\\)\nTo maximize \\(T\\), we solve for \\(S\\) in terms of \\(T\\):\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7T\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3. Thus, the possible values of \\(T\\) are \\(0, 3, 6, 9\\).\n\n### Step 3: Check valid values of \\(T\\)\n- For \\(T = 9\\):  \n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n  \\]\n  This gives \\(T = 9\\) and \\(S = 6\\), satisfying the equation.\n\n- For \\(T = 12\\):  \n  \\[\n  70(12) = 840 > 810\n  \\]\n  This exceeds the total budget, so \\(T = 12\\) is invalid.\n\nThus, the maximum valid \\(T\\) is \\(9\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verify the ratio\nThe ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{T}{S} = \\frac{9}{6} = 3:2\n\\]\nHowever, the question asks for the number of trousers when the maximum number is purchased, not the ratio. Therefore, the answer is \\(T = 9\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is **9**, corresponding to option **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a man who spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are from A to E, each giving a number of trousers.\n\nWait, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he can buy with 810 rupees. So I think I should set up an equation where the total cost equals 810, and the number of trousers is as high as possible.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. So the total cost would be 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nSince we want to maximize T, I should try to find the largest possible T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. But also, any remaining money after buying T trousers should be spent on shirts, which are cheaper.\n\nSo first, let me calculate the maximum possible T without considering the shirts. That would be when he buys only trousers. So 810 divided by 70. Let me compute that: 70 times 11 is 770. 70 times 12 is 840, which is more than 810. So maximum T without shirts would be 11, but 70*11=770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. But shirts are 30 each, so with 40, he can buy 1 shirt because 30*1=30, and 40-30=10, which isn't enough for another shirt. Wait, but is that necessary?\n\nWait, but the question says he buys both trousers and shirts. So he can't buy zero shirts. So if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770. Then he has 40 left. But 40 isn't a multiple of 30, so he can't buy another shirt. So he can only buy one shirt with 30, and have 10 left, which he can't spend. So the total would be 70*11 + 30*1=770+30=800, which is under 810. But wait, that's only 800. He has 10 rupees left, but he can't buy anything else. So perhaps 11 is not possible because it leaves some money unspent. But the problem says he spends 810 in total. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Does he spend exactly 810, or up to 810?\n\nLooking back, the question says he \"spend 810 in buying\". So he must spend exactly 810. So buying 11 trousers would cost 770, but then 810-770=40. But 40 isn't a multiple of 30, so he can't spend exactly 810 with 11 trousers and some shirts. Therefore, 11 might not be an option here.\n\nSo the next possible T is 10. Let's see: 70*10=700. So 810-700=110. Now, 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So 3 shirts would cost 90, leaving 20, which isn't enough. So he can't buy 3 shirts. So perhaps 10 trousers and 3 shirts would be 700 +90=790, which is still under 810. But again, he can't spend exactly 810. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this with equations. Let's write the equation: 70T + 30S =810. We can simplify this by dividing both sides by 10: 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe need T and S to be integers (since you can't buy a fraction of a shirt or trouser). We want to maximize T. So let's express S in terms of T: 3S=81-7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3. Since S must be an integer, (81-7T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nSo let's think about 7T modulo 3. 7 mod3 is 1, so 7T mod3 is equal to T mod3. So 81 is divisible by 3 (81/3=27), so 81-7T must be divisible by 3. So (81-7T) mod3=0 \u2192 7T mod3=81 mod3 \u2192 since 81 mod3 is 0, 7T mod3 must be 0. Which implies T mod3 must be 0, because 7 mod3 is 1. So T must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSo possible T values are multiples of 3: 3,6,9, etc. But wait, maximum T can't be more than 810/70 which is about 11.57, so up to 11.\n\nSo possible T values are 3,6,9, and maybe 12, but 12 is 840, which is over 810. So T can be up to 11, but only multiples of 3. So 3,6,9.\n\nWait, but wait. Earlier, when I thought of 11, the T was 11, which isn't a multiple of 3. So perhaps the maximum T is 9? Let's check that.\n\nIf T=9: 7*9=63. So 3S=81-63=18 \u2192 S=6. So 9 trousers and 6 shirts. 70*9=630, 30*6=180. 630+180=810. Perfect, that's exactly 810.\n\nWhat about T=10? Let's see: T=10 is not a multiple of 3, but let's see if it's possible. 7*10=70. 81-70=11. So 3S=11 \u2192 S=11/3, which is not an integer. So T=10 isn't possible because S would have to be a fraction.\n\nWhat about T=12? 7*12=84 \u2192 81-84=-3. So 3S= -3 \u2192 S=-1. Which is impossible. So T can't be 12.\n\nSo the next possible T after 9 is 12, which isn't allowed. So the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6 or 3:2. But the options give the number of trousers, so the answer is 9.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 9 Trousers. So the correct answer should be option A.\n",

Wait, the options are all about the number of trousers, but the question is about the ratio. Hmm, maybe I need to find how many of each he buys to maximize the number of trousers, and then find the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nSo, let me break it down. He's buying two items: trousers and shirts. The total he spends is 810 rupees. Trousers are 70 each, shirts 30 each. We need to maximize the number of trousers he buys. So, he should buy as many trousers as possible, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but maybe he can buy both. So, the total cost is 70t + 30s = 810, where t is the number of trousers and s is the number of shirts. We need to maximize t, which means we should minimize s, but s has to be a non-negative integer. Because you can't buy a negative number of shirts, right?\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30. Because each shirt is 30, the remaining amount must be a multiple of 30.\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible t without considering the shirts. 810 divided by 70. Let's see, 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, 70*11=770. 70*12=840 which is more than 810. So the maximum possible t without considering shirts is 11, but we need to check if 810-70*11 is divisible by 30.\n\n70*11 is 770. 810-770 is 40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So s would be 1.333, which isn't possible because s has to be an integer. So t=11 isn't feasible.\n\nSo, let's try t=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... Again, not an integer. So that doesn't work either.\n\nNext, t=9. 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. That's an integer. So s=6. So when t=9, s=6. That's a possible solution.\n\nWait, but is this the maximum t possible? Because t=9 works, but maybe there's a higher t that also works. Let me check t=8. 70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, which isn't an integer. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, but I thought t=9 works, but earlier I thought t=11 didn't. So the next step is to check if t can be higher than 9 but less than 11. Let's think, t=10 didn't work because 110 isn't divisible by 30. So the next option is t=9.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, with 6 shirts. So the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Let's simplify that ratio. Both are divisible by 3. 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So the ratio is 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options given are all about the number of trousers. The options are A)9, B)8, etc. But the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number is purchased. Oh wait, the question says, \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't give ratios. Wait, looking back, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio. Because the options are all numbers, not ratios.\n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The first part says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt\" but the options are all numbers. So perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nQuestion: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nWait, maybe the ratio is referring to the number bought. So, when he buys the maximum number of trousers, how many shirts does he buy, and what is the ratio of trousers to shirts.\n\nIn that case, when t=9, s=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the options are just the number of trousers, so the correct answer would be 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the question says, \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps it's asking for the ratio as in the numbers bought, but the options only give the number of trousers. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers. Because the options are all the number of trousers, and the question's last part is about the maximum number of trousers. So maybe the question is simply asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, regardless of the shirts. But that's not possible because he's buying both, but in that case, the maximum number would be when he buys as many trousers as possible, even if shirts are zero. Wait, but shirts cost 30, so if he buys maximum trousers, perhaps he's not buying any shirts. Let me think.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Maybe the maximum number of trousers he can buy is when he spends all his money on trousers, ignoring shirts. So 810 /70. 70*11 is 770, which is under 810. 70*12 is 840, which is over. So maximum t is 11, but that leaves 40, which isn't enough for a shirt. So the number of shirts would be zero. So the ratio would be 11:0, but that's not a valid ratio. But in this case, the options are 11, which is option E. But earlier when I considered buying both, t=9 and s=6, that gives a ratio of 3:2.\n\nHmm, so there's some confusion here. The question says \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So he wants the maximum t possible, which could be 11 if he doesn't buy any shirts. But wait, is that allowed? The problem says he buys both trouser and shirt. Wait, the original problem says \"buying trouser at Rs70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So does that mean he must buy at least one of each? Or can he choose to buy only trousers and no shirts?\n\nThe problem isn't explicit. Let me read again: \"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So he buys both, but the wording is a bit unclear. If he must buy at least one of each, then t can't be 11, because that leaves 40, which isn't enough for a shirt. So he'd have to buy t=9, s=6. But if he can choose to buy only trousers and no shirts, then t=11 is possible.\n\nSo I'm a bit stuck on whether he must buy at least one shirt. The problem states \"buying trouser and shirt,\" which could imply that he buys both. So perhaps he must buy at least one of each.\n\nIn that case, the maximum t is 9, with s=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are all numbers. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is simply asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy, with the condition that he buys some shirts as well. Or perhaps the question is just about the maximum number of trousers regardless of shirts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again. The problem says, \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So he wants to buy as many trousers as possible, and any remaining money can be spent on shirts. So the maximum t is 11, but that leaves 40, which isn't enough for a shirt. So he can't buy any shirts, so s=0. So the ratio would be 11:0, but that's not a valid ratio. So perhaps the question is just about the number of trousers, which would be 11, option E. But then why is the question about the ratio?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to think again. The problem is to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum t is 11, but s=0. So the ratio is 11:0, but ratios can't have zero. So perhaps the next possible t is 10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which is not an integer. So s would be 3, and the remaining 10 would be unspent. But that's not allowed because the total must be exactly 810.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he buys 10 trousers and 3 shirts, which would cost 700 +90 =790, leaving 20 unspent. That's not acceptable. So the only way to spend exactly 810 is when t is 9 and s is 6. Because 9*70=630, 6*30=180. 630+180=810.\n\nSo in that case, the maximum number of trousers he can buy while also buying some shirts is 9. So the ratio of t:s is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options are all about the number of trousers, so the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if he doesn't buy any shirts, he can buy 11 trousers. But if the problem states he must buy both, then that's not allowed. So the correct scenario is t=9 and s=6, giving a ratio of 3:2. But the question's options are about the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, option A.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, wait, the options are all just numbers of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. Hmm, maybe I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810, and then see how many shirts that would leave him with, and find the ratio.\n\nSo the main goal is to maximize the number of trousers. Each trouser costs 70, shirt is 30. He has 810 total.\n\nLet me think. So, if he buys as many trousers as possible, the remaining money will be used for shirts.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, which implies we should spend as much as possible on trousers. So, find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nLet me calculate that. 810 divided by 70. Let me do that division.\n\n70 * 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 770 is less than 810. What about 12? 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, but wait, wait, wait. Because 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40. Then, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But you can't buy a third of a shirt, so he can only buy 1 shirt with the remaining 30, and 10 rupees left.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt, right?\n\nSo the ratio would be 11:1. But wait, looking at the options, the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, which would be 11, but wait the options don't have 11. Wait, no, looking back: the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, option E is 11. So that's the number of trousers.\n\nWait, but I think I might be misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe question says: What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\n\nOh wait, the options are just numbers of trousers, not ratios. So maybe the question is asking for the number of trousers, which is the maximum possible. So E is 11, which is the maximum number of trousers.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. So if T is 11, the cost is 770, remaining is 40. 40 isn't enough for a shirt (30), so 40-30=10, but that's one shirt. So S is 1. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nBut the options are only the number of trousers, so the correct answer would be E)11.\n\nWait, but another way: perhaps the ratio is required, but the options don't show ratios. So maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: the options are labeled A to E, each with a number followed by 'Trousers'. So the options are possible numbers of trousers, and the question is asking which of these is the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810, given that he buys some number of shirts as well.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the man buys both trousers and shirts, so the number of shirts must be at least 1, right? Or could he buy zero shirts? Wait, the problem says he buys both, so he must buy at least one of each? Or is that an assumption? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So he buys both. So he can't buy zero shirts. So the number of shirts must be at least 1.\n\nSo, going back, the maximum number of trousers is 11, which would leave 40, which allows for one shirt (30), leaving 10, but that's okay. So the maximum number is 11.\n\nSo the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. What if he buys 10 trousers? Then 10 *70 =700. Remaining is 110. 110/30 is 3.666. So he can buy 3 shirts, using 90, leaving 20. So total spent is 700+90=790, with 20 left. But he can't buy another shirt because that's 30. So in this case, 10 trousers and 3 shirts. The ratio would be 10:3.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum number of trousers, so 11 is better than 10, as 11 is more.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects that the man buys as many as possible, but also that the remaining money is exactly divisible by the shirt's price. Otherwise, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So, if 70*T +30*S =810, and T is as maximum as possible, but S must be an integer.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nMaximizing T, so T is as high as possible without 70*T exceeding 810.\n\nCompute 810 //70: 70*11=770. 70*12=840>810. So T can be 11.\n\nThen the remaining money is 810-770=40.\n\n40 must be divisible by 30 to have S as an integer. 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 10/30, which is 1.333, which is not an integer. So S would be 1, but then 30*1=30, which leaves 10, which is not enough for another shirt. So the man would buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that uses 70*11 +30*1=770+30=800, leaving 10 unspent. But the problem says he spends 810, so that's not possible. So he can't buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt because 770+30=800<810. So he can't buy exactly 11 trousers and 1 shirt; he would have 10 left, but he can't use that.\n\nSo in that case, perhaps he can't buy 11 trousers, because that would leave him with 40, which isn't enough for another shirt. Wait, but he could buy 10 shirts, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for not using all the money, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers, regardless of whether all the money is spent. So even if he can't spend all 810, the maximum number of trousers is 11, which leaves some money unspent. So the answer is 11, so option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the total spent is exactly 810, so in that case, 11 trousers and 1 shirt would give 770+30=800, which is less than 810. So he needs to adjust.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. So perhaps 11 trousers is not possible because he can't spend all the money. So maybe he can't buy 11. Then, he needs to reduce the number of trousers to find a T where 70*T +30*S =810, and S is an integer.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to find T and S such that 70T +30S=810, with T as large as possible.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation: 70T = 810 -30S.\n\nDividing both sides by 10: 7T = 81 -3S.\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, let's try T=11: 7*11=77. So 77 +3S=81 \u2192 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is not integer. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 70 +3S=81 \u21923S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63 \u219263 +3S=81 \u21923S=18 \u2192S=6. That's integer. So T=9, S=6 is a solution.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers possible is 9, because when T=9, S=6. Let's check: 9*70=630, 6*30=180 \u2192 630+180=810. Exactly.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, so the answer is option A)9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 11 was possible, but that leaves 40 unspent. But the problem doesn't specify whether he has to spend all the money. If he doesn't have to spend all, then 11 is possible. But if he must spend all 810, then 11 isn't possible.\n\nThe question says, \"A man spend 810 in buying...\", which implies that he spends exactly 810. So in that case, he must buy such that 70T +30S=810.\n\nSo then, T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the answer is A)9.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased.\n\nWait, wait, the options are all just numbers of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. Hmm, maybe I need to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810, and then see how many shirts that would leave him with, and find the ratio.\n\nSo the main goal is to maximize the number of trousers. Each trouser costs 70, shirt is 30. He has 810 total.\n\nLet me think. So, if he buys as many trousers as possible, the remaining money will be used for shirts.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T, which implies we should spend as much as possible on trousers. So, find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810.\n\nLet me calculate that. 810 divided by 70. Let me do that division.\n\n70 * 11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 770 is less than 810. What about 12? 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 11, but wait, wait, wait. Because 70*11 is 770, which leaves 810-770=40. Then, 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. But you can't buy a third of a shirt, so he can only buy 1 shirt with the remaining 30, and 10 rupees left.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can buy 1 shirt, right?\n\nSo the ratio would be 11:1. But wait, looking at the options, the options are just the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought, which would be 11, but wait the options don't have 11. Wait, no, looking back: the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. Oh, option E is 11. So that's the number of trousers.\n\nWait, but I think I might be misunderstanding the question.

So if T is 11, the cost is 770, remaining is 40. 40 isn't enough for a shirt (30), so 40-30=10, but that's one shirt. So S is 1.

So the maximum number is 11.\n\nSo the answer is E)11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. What if he buys 10 trousers? Then 10 *70 =700. Remaining is 110. 110/30 is 3.666. So he can buy 3 shirts, using 90, leaving 20. So total spent is 700+90=790, with 20 left. But he can't buy another shirt because that's 30. So in this case, 10 trousers and 3 shirts. The ratio would be 10:3.\n\nBut the question is about the maximum number of trousers, so 11 is better than 10, as 11 is more.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem expects that the man buys as many as possible, but also that the remaining money is exactly divisible by the shirt's price. Otherwise, he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So, if 70*T +30*S =810, and T is as maximum as possible, but S must be an integer.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nMaximizing T, so T is as high as possible without 70*T exceeding 810.\n\nCompute 810 //70: 70*11=770. 70*12=840>810. So T can be 11.\n\nThen the remaining money is 810-770=40.\n\n40 must be divisible by 30 to have S as an integer. 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 10/30, which is 1.333, which is not an integer. So S would be 1, but then 30*1=30, which leaves 10, which is not enough for another shirt. So the man would buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that uses 70*11 +30*1=770+30=800, leaving 10 unspent. But the problem says he spends 810, so that's not possible. So he can't buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt because 770+30=800<810. So he can't buy exactly 11 trousers and 1 shirt; he would have 10 left, but he can't use that.\n\nSo in that case, perhaps he can't buy 11 trousers, because that would leave him with 40, which isn't enough for another shirt. Wait, but he could buy 10 shirts, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem allows for not using all the money, but the question is about the maximum number of trousers, regardless of whether all the money is spent. So even if he can't spend all 810, the maximum number of trousers is 11, which leaves some money unspent. So the answer is 11, so option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the total spent is exactly 810, so in that case, 11 trousers and 1 shirt would give 770+30=800, which is less than 810. So he needs to adjust.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. So perhaps 11 trousers is not possible because he can't spend all the money. So maybe he can't buy 11. Then, he needs to reduce the number of trousers to find a T where 70*T +30*S =810, and S is an integer.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to find T and S such that 70T +30S=810, with T as large as possible.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation: 70T = 810 -30S.\n\nDividing both sides by 10: 7T = 81 -3S.\n\nSo 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nSo, let's try T=11: 7*11=77. So 77 +3S=81 \u2192 3S=4 \u2192 S=4/3, which is not integer. So T=11 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 70 +3S=81 \u21923S=11 \u2192 S=11/3\u22483.666, not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63 \u219263 +3S=81 \u21923S=18 \u2192S=6. That's integer. So T=9, S=6 is a solution.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers possible is 9, because when T=9, S=6. Let's check: 9*70=630, 6*30=180 \u2192 630+180=810. Exactly.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers is 9, so the answer is option A)9.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 11 was possible, but that leaves 40 unspent. But the problem doesn't specify whether he has to spend all the money. If he doesn't have to spend all, then 11 is possible. But if he must spend all 810, then 11 isn't possible.\n\nThe question says, \"A man spend 810 in buying...\", which implies that he spends exactly 810. So in that case, he must buy such that 70T +30S=810.\n\nSo then, T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nSo the answer is A)9.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees, we need to ensure that the total expenditure equals 810 rupees. The equation governing this is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9,8, etc.\n\nHmm, the key here is that he wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I should figure out how much money he can spend on trousers without exceeding his total budget. Then, whatever money is left, he can spend on shirts.\n\nWait, right. So the total amount is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nHe wants the maximum number of T, so I need to find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which should also be an integer.\n\nLet me think. Let's first calculate the maximum possible T without considering shirts. 810 divided by 70 is how much? Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770 because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T possible is 11, but wait, let me check: 70*11 = 770. That leaves 810 - 770 = 40 rupees for shirts. Each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. Oh, but you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So that won't work. So T=11 is not possible because 40 isn't enough for even one more shirt. So that leaves 40, but shirts are 30 each. So can he buy 1 shirt? 30 would leave 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. But the problem says he buys both, right? Because he's buying trousers and shirts. Or does he have to buy at least one of each? The question says he buys both, I think. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can't buy any shirts because 40 isn't a multiple of 30. So that's not possible. So T=11 isn't a valid option.\n\nSo the next lower number is T=10. Let me see: 70*10 is 700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666. Hmm, so he can buy 3 shirts because 3*30=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. Wait, but 110 is not exactly divisible by 30. So 3 shirts would cost 90, leaving 20. So that's possible. So T=10 and S=3. But wait, the remaining 20 can't buy another shirt, but since he's only buying as much as possible, this is acceptable. So the ratio would be 10:3. But wait, the options don't give the ratio directly. The options are the number of trousers. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the options are the number of T, but I'm getting T=10 as a possible option, which is option C. But wait, I should check if T=10 is possible. Let me see.\n\nWait, the total spent would be 70*10 +30*3=700+90=790. That's within 810, but leaves 20 unspent. But the problem says he spends 810 in total. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Oh wait, perhaps he can buy more shirts with the remaining money. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, if T=10, then the money spent on trousers is 700. So the remaining is 110 for shirts. 110 divided by 30 is 3 shirts with 20 left. But 20 isn't enough for another shirt, so S=3. But that only uses 700+90=790, which is 20 less than 810. So he can't buy 11 shirts because that's more than the money left. So that's a problem. Therefore, T=10 is possible but doesn't use up all the money. But the problem says he spends 810, so the total must be exactly 810.\n\nSo perhaps I should find T and S such that 70T +30S =810, with T as large as possible.\n\nSo let's think about it as an equation. 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we want T to be as large as possible, and S must be an integer.\n\nSo, let's solve for S: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81-7T) to be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 =1*T mod3.\n\nSo 81 -7T \u2261 0 - T mod3 \u2192 (81-7T) mod3= (0 - T) mod3.\n\nSo for (81-7T) to be divisible by 3, (0 - T) must be 0 mod3 \u2192 T mod3=0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12... but T can't be more than 11, since 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo let's see possible T values: 9, 6, 3, 0. But T=0 would mean no trousers, which is not the maximum.\n\nSo let's try T=9.\n\nThen S=(81-7*9)/3 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 18/3=6. So S=6.\n\nSo 70*9=630, 30*6=180. 630+180=810. Perfect, that uses all the money.\n\nSo T=9 and S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=10 would be possible, but that leaves some money. So why isn't T=10 the maximum? Because when T=10, the equation becomes 70*10=700. 810-700=110 for shirts. 110/30=3.666, which isn't an integer. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because S isn't an integer. Hence, the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nSo the answer should be T=9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check T=10 again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAt T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So S=3, but that leaves 20 unspent. So the total is 700 +90=790, which is less than 810. But the problem states that he spends 810. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because it doesn't use up all the money. So the maximum T that allows the total to be exactly 810 is T=9.\n\nSo the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. A man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9,8, etc.\n\nHmm, the key here is that he wants to buy as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I should figure out how much money he can spend on trousers without exceeding his total budget. Then, whatever money is left, he can spend on shirts.\n\nWait, right. So the total amount is 810. Let me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The cost equation would be 70T + 30S = 810.\n\nHe wants the maximum number of T, so I need to find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810, and the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which should also be an integer.\n\nLet me think. Let's first calculate the maximum possible T without considering shirts. 810 divided by 70 is how much? Let me compute that. 70 times 11 is 770 because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So the maximum T possible is 11, but wait, let me check: 70*11 = 770. That leaves 810 - 770 = 40 rupees for shirts. Each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. Oh, but you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So that won't work. So T=11 is not possible because 40 isn't enough for even one more shirt. So that leaves 40, but shirts are 30 each. So can he buy 1 shirt? 30 would leave 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. But the problem says he buys both, right? Because he's buying trousers and shirts. Or does he have to buy at least one of each? The question says he buys both, I think. So if he buys 11 trousers, he can't buy any shirts because 40 isn't a multiple of 30. So that's not possible. So T=11 isn't a valid option.\n\nSo the next lower number is T=10. Let me see: 70*10 is 700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666. Hmm, so he can buy 3 shirts because 3*30=90, leaving 20, which isn't enough for another shirt. Wait, but 110 is not exactly divisible by 30. So 3 shirts would cost 90, leaving 20. So that's possible. So T=10 and S=3. But wait, the remaining 20 can't buy another shirt, but since he's only buying as much as possible, this is acceptable. So the ratio would be 10:3. But wait, the options don't give the ratio directly. The options are the number of trousers. So the question is asking for the number of trousers when the maximum is bought. So the options are the number of T, but I'm getting T=10 as a possible option, which is option C. But wait, I should check if T=10 is possible. Let me see.\n\nWait, the total spent would be 70*10 +30*3=700+90=790. That's within 810, but leaves 20 unspent. But the problem says he spends 810 in total. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Oh wait, perhaps he can buy more shirts with the remaining money. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, if T=10, then the money spent on trousers is 700. So the remaining is 110 for shirts. 110 divided by 30 is 3 shirts with 20 left. But 20 isn't enough for another shirt, so S=3. But that only uses 700+90=790, which is 20 less than 810. So he can't buy 11 shirts because that's more than the money left. So that's a problem. Therefore, T=10 is possible but doesn't use up all the money. But the problem says he spends 810, so the total must be exactly 810.\n\nSo perhaps I should find T and S such that 70T +30S =810, with T as large as possible.\n\nSo let's think about it as an equation. 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 10: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, we want T to be as large as possible, and S must be an integer.\n\nSo, let's solve for S: 3S =81 -7T \u2192 S=(81-7T)/3.\n\nWe need (81-7T) to be divisible by 3 and non-negative.\n\nSo 81 mod 3 is 0. 7T mod 3 is (7 mod3)*T mod3 =1*T mod3.\n\nSo 81 -7T \u2261 0 - T mod3 \u2192 (81-7T) mod3= (0 - T) mod3.\n\nSo for (81-7T) to be divisible by 3, (0 - T) must be 0 mod3 \u2192 T mod3=0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12... but T can't be more than 11, since 70*12=840>810.\n\nSo let's see possible T values: 9, 6, 3, 0. But T=0 would mean no trousers, which is not the maximum.\n\nSo let's try T=9.\n\nThen S=(81-7*9)/3 \u2192 81-63=18 \u2192 18/3=6. So S=6.\n\nSo 70*9=630, 30*6=180. 630+180=810. Perfect, that uses all the money.\n\nSo T=9 and S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the number of trousers when maximum is bought. So T=9 is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought T=10 would be possible, but that leaves some money. So why isn't T=10 the maximum? Because when T=10, the equation becomes 70*10=700. 810-700=110 for shirts. 110/30=3.666, which isn't an integer. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because S isn't an integer. Hence, the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6.\n\nSo the answer should be T=9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check T=10 again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAt T=10: 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with a remainder of 20. So S=3, but that leaves 20 unspent. So the total is 700 +90=790, which is less than 810. But the problem states that he spends 810. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because it doesn't use up all the money. So the maximum T that allows the total to be exactly 810 is T=9.\n\nSo the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased while spending exactly 810 rupees, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts.

The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about what the ratio is exactly. Oh right, the ratio would be the number of trousers to the number of shirts. But the key point is that we need the maximum number of trousers possible without exceeding the total amount of 810 rupees.\n\nSo, let's think. He wants to buy as many trousers as possible. Each trouser is 70, so I should divide 810 by 70 to see how many he can buy. But wait, he can't spend more than 810, so he might have some money left for shirts if the division isn't exact.\n\nLet me do the division. 810 divided by 70. Let me calculate that. 70 times 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, plus another 70 is 770. 70*12 would be 840, which is more than 810, so he can't buy 12. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, which leaves 810-770=40 rupees left.\n\nWith 40 rupees left, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30. 30 goes into 40 once, with 10 rupees remaining. But wait, can he buy a fraction of a shirt? No, because you can't buy part of a shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt, and have 10 rupees left, which isn't enough for another shirt.\n\nWait, but that leaves 10 rupees unused. Is that allowed? I think so, because the problem doesn't specify that he has to spend all the money. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, and the shirts are 1.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1. But wait, let me check if buying 11 trousers is possible. Because 11*70 is 770, and 1*30 is 30, total spent is 770+30=800. Which is under 810. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if he buys 11 trousers and then uses the remaining 40 for more than one shirt? No, because 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, but he can't buy a fraction. So only 1 shirt.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1. Looking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. But wait, the options are labeled A to E, each giving the number of trousers.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the man spends a total of 810 rupees. He buys trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each, and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find how many trousers and shirts he can buy without exceeding the total amount. Since we want the maximum number of trousers, that means we should buy as many as possible and then see how many shirts we can get with the remaining money.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. \n\nOur goal is to maximize T. So, I should find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Let me calculate that.\n\n70 multiplied by how much is just under 810? Let's see:\n\n70 * 11 = 770. That's 770. Then 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So the maximum T is 11. Wait, but wait a second. Because if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, leaving 40 rupees. Can he buy shirts with that?\n\nShirts cost 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So he can't buy another shirt because it's cheaper than the remaining money but not enough for a second. So he would have 11 trousers and 1 shirt. But wait, that leaves 10 rupees unused, which isn't possible because you can't spend partial money on an item. So that's acceptable because the problem doesn't say he has to spend all the money.\n\nWait, but is 11 the maximum possible? Let me check. If he buys 11 trousers, he spends 770, leaving 40. But 40 is more than 30, so he can buy one shirt. So total is 11 trousers and 1 shirt. The ratio would be 11:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. But wait, the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 11:1. So the answer would be E, which is 11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose he buys 10 trousers. 70 *10=700. Remaining is 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with 20 remaining. So 3 shirts. So he can buy 10 trousers and 3 shirts. That would give a ratio of 10:3, which is more favorable than 11:1? No, because 11 is larger. So 11 is the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nAnother way: Let me set up the equation.\n\n70T +30S = 810.\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7T +3S = 81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me solve for S: 3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and \u22650.\n\nLet me check possible T values starting from the highest possible, which is 11 (since 7*12=84>81).\n\nT=11: 81-77=4 \u2192 S=4/3 \u22481.333, which is not an integer. So S=1.333 isn't allowed. So that's invalid. Wait, but wait, earlier calculation said that 70*11=770, leaving 40, which allows for one shirt (30) and 10 left. So in terms of the simplified equation, 7*11=77, 81-77=4, which isn't divisible by 3. So S would be 4/3, which is not an integer. So T=11 isn't possible because S isn't an integer.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So then, the next possible T is 10.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666. Not integer.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the man spends a total of 810 rupees. He buys trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each, and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nHmm, I think I need to find how many trousers and shirts he can buy without exceeding the total amount. Since we want the maximum number of trousers, that means we should buy as many as possible and then see how many shirts we can get with the remaining money.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. The total cost equation would be 70*T + 30*S = 810. \n\nOur goal is to maximize T. So, I should find the largest integer T such that 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Let me calculate that.\n\n70 multiplied by how much is just under 810? Let's see:\n\n70 * 11 = 770. That's 770. Then 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So the maximum T is 11. Wait, but wait a second. Because if he buys 11 trousers, that's 770, leaving 40 rupees. Can he buy shirts with that?\n\nShirts cost 30 each. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So he can't buy another shirt because it's cheaper than the remaining money but not enough for a second. So he would have 11 trousers and 1 shirt. But wait, that leaves 10 rupees unused, which isn't possible because you can't spend partial money on an item. So that's acceptable because the problem doesn't say he has to spend all the money.\n\nWait, but is 11 the maximum possible? Let me check. If he buys 11 trousers, he spends 770, leaving 40. But 40 is more than 30, so he can buy one shirt. So total is 11 trousers and 1 shirt. The ratio would be 11:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 11 Trousers. But wait, the question is about the ratio of trousers to shirts. So the ratio is 11:1. So the answer would be E, which is 11 Trousers.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose he buys 10 trousers. 70 *10=700. Remaining is 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3 with 20 remaining. So 3 shirts. So he can buy 10 trousers and 3 shirts. That would give a ratio of 10:3, which is more favorable than 11:1? No, because 11 is larger. So 11 is the maximum number of trousers possible.\n\nAnother way: Let me set up the equation.\n\n70T +30S = 810.\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7T +3S = 81.\n\nWe need to find integer solutions where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me solve for S: 3S = 81 -7T \u2192 S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSince S must be a non-negative integer, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3 and \u22650.\n\nLet me check possible T values starting from the highest possible, which is 11 (since 7*12=84>81).\n\nT=11: 81-77=4 \u2192 S=4/3 \u22481.333, which is not an integer. So S=1.333 isn't allowed. So that's invalid. Wait, but wait, earlier calculation said that 70*11=770, leaving 40, which allows for one shirt (30) and 10 left. So in terms of the simplified equation, 7*11=77, 81-77=4, which isn't divisible by 3. So S would be 4/3, which is not an integer. So T=11 isn't possible because S isn't an integer.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So then, the next possible T is 10.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11 \u2192 11/3 \u22483.666. Not integer. So no good.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18 \u219218/3=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers possible is 9. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, T=9 is the maximum possible because T=10 and T=11 don't give integer S.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be simplified by dividing both by 3 \u2192 3:2. But the question doesn't specify to simplify the ratio, just to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum number is bought.\n\nSo the number of trousers is 9, shirts is 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which can be written as 9/6 or 3/2.\n\nBut looking at the options, the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, no, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers. The question says, 'what will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?'

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nHmm, the options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers. So I think the problem is asking, when he buys as many trousers as possible, how many shirts does he buy, and what's the ratio of trousers to shirts?\n\nWait, the question isn't exactly clear on whether the ratio is Trousers/Shirts or the other way around, but given the options, I think it's about the number of each he buys, so the ratio would be Trousers : Shirts.\n\nSo the goal is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I need to find the maximum possible number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nEach trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt 30. So the total cost is:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nBut we want to maximize T. So we need to find the maximum integer T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are cheaper, but also ensuring that S is a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n70*T <= 810\n\nSo maximum T is 810 divided by 70, but since T must be an integer, we take the floor of that.\n\nLet me calculate 810 divided by 70. 70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11? Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So E is 11, which would be the maximum possible T if shirts are not required. But the man buys both, so he must have some shirts as well.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe he can buy all trousers and no shirts, but I don't think so because the problem says he buys both. Let me read the question again. It says \"buying trouser at Rs70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So he buys both. So he must buy at least one of each? Or is it possible to buy zero shirts if that's the maximum number of trousers?\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps he can buy as many as possible, which might leave no money for shirts. But I think the problem implies he buys some shirts as well, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.\n\nSo to maximize T, we need to see how much money is left after buying T trousers, and then see if the remaining can be divided by 30 (the shirt price) to get an integer S.\n\nSo let's compute the maximum T possible. Let me compute 810 divided by 70.\n\n70 * 11 is 770, which is under 810. So 11 trousers would cost 770, leaving 810-770=40. Can 40 be divided by 30? 40 /30 is 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which is impossible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 isn't possible because S would not be an integer. So the next possible is T=10.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. Remaining money: 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., again not an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't allowed.\n\nNext, T=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money:810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of Trousers to Shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Wait, but when T=9, S=6. But what about T=8?\n\nLet me check T=8: 70*8=560. Remaining:810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, which isn't integer. So S isn't an integer here. So T=8 isn't acceptable.\n\nWait, but T=9 is acceptable, so that's the maximum number of T where S is an integer. Because T=11 and T=10 didn't give integer S.\n\nWait, but the options include E as 11. So perhaps the question is not requiring that both are bought, but just that the maximum number of trousers is purchased, regardless of shirts. So perhaps the man can buy 11 trousers and 0 shirts, but that would be 770, which is under 810. Then he would have 40 left, but maybe he can't buy any more shirts because 40 is not enough for another shirt. So in this case, the number of shirts would be zero, but the problem says he buys both, so maybe this scenario is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that would cost 770 +30 =800, which is within the budget. Then the remaining 10 can't be used for anything. But in that case, the number of shirts is 1. So the ratio would be 11:1. But that would be an option E)11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says he spends 810 in buying both. So 70*T +30*S=810. So when T=11, 70*11=770, so 30*S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=1.333, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So T=11 is not allowed because S must be integer.\n\nThus, the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6, which is an integer. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy with an integer number of shirts is 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when T=11, the remaining money is 40, which can't buy a shirt. So he can't buy 11 trousers because that would require buying 0 shirts, but the problem says he buys both, so he must buy at least one shirt. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require that he buys at least one shirt. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" It doesn't explicitly say he buys both, but the way it's phrased might imply that he buys some of each. So perhaps the initial assumption is that he buys at least one of each.\n\nIn that case, T=11 is impossible because that would leave 40, which isn't enough for a shirt (since 30 is needed for one). So the next possible T is 10, which gives 700, leaving 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nSo next is T=9, which leaves 180, which is exactly 6 shirts. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the correct answer would be option A)9 Trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows buying 0 shirts. Let me check that.\n\nIf he buys 11 trousers, that's 770. He has 40 left, which can't buy a shirt. So total spent is 770, but he has 40 left unspent. But the problem states he spends 810, so that's impossible. So he must spend all 810, so T=11 is not possible because 770+30=800, which is under 810, but that leaves 10 unspent. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So he could buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, which would cost 770+30=800, leaving 10. But that's 800, not 810. So he's spent only 800, but the problem says he spends 810. So that's not possible. So he must spend exactly 810.\n\nSo T=11 and S=1.333 is impossible. So the next is T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which is not integer. So he can't buy 10 trousers and 3 shirts (3*30=90, 700+90=790, 810-790=20 left, which isn't allowed as that's not 0). So 10 is not possible.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So he can buy 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Total cost 630+180=810, which fits. So that's the maximum number of trousers possible, as higher numbers don't yield integer S.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be reduced by dividing both by 3. So 3:2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 9 Trousers. So the answer should be A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a higher T that allows S to be integer. Let me try T=8.\n\n70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666, not integer.\n\nT=6: 420, 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. But that's lower T than 9, so not the maximum.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, leading to 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nSo the answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n",

That means I need to find the maximum possible number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nEach trouser costs 70 rupees, and each shirt 30. So the total cost is:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nBut we want to maximize T. So we need to find the maximum integer T such that the remaining money can be spent on shirts, which are cheaper, but also ensuring that S is a non-negative integer.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n70*T <= 810\n\nSo maximum T is 810 divided by 70, but since T must be an integer, we take the floor of that.\n\nLet me calculate 810 divided by 70. 70*11=770, which is less than 810. 70*12=840, which is more than 810. So the maximum possible T is 11? Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11. So E is 11, which would be the maximum possible T if shirts are not required. But the man buys both, so he must have some shirts as well.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe he can buy all trousers and no shirts, but I don't think so because the problem says he buys both. Let me read the question again. It says \"buying trouser at Rs70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So he buys both. So he must buy at least one of each? Or is it possible to buy zero shirts if that's the maximum number of trousers?\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So perhaps he can buy as many as possible, which might leave no money for shirts. But I think the problem implies he buys some shirts as well, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.\n\nSo to maximize T, we need to see how much money is left after buying T trousers, and then see if the remaining can be divided by 30 (the shirt price) to get an integer S.\n\nSo let's compute the maximum T possible. Let me compute 810 divided by 70.\n\n70 * 11 is 770, which is under 810. So 11 trousers would cost 770, leaving 810-770=40. Can 40 be divided by 30? 40 /30 is 1.333..., which isn't an integer. So S would be 1.333, which is impossible because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So T=11 isn't possible because S would not be an integer. So the next possible is T=10.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. Remaining money: 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666..., again not an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't allowed.\n\nNext, T=9: 70*9=630. Remaining money:810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So T=9, S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of Trousers to Shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Wait, but when T=9, S=6. But what about T=8?\n\nLet me check T=8: 70*8=560. Remaining:810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, which isn't integer. So S isn't an integer here. So T=8 isn't acceptable.\n\nWait, but T=9 is acceptable, so that's the maximum number of T where S is an integer. Because T=11 and T=10 didn't give integer S.\n\nWait, but the options include E as 11. So perhaps the question is not requiring that both are bought, but just that the maximum number of trousers is purchased, regardless of shirts. So perhaps the man can buy 11 trousers and 0 shirts, but that would be 770, which is under 810. Then he would have 40 left, but maybe he can't buy any more shirts because 40 is not enough for another shirt. So in this case, the number of shirts would be zero, but the problem says he buys both, so maybe this scenario is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt, but that would cost 770 +30 =800, which is within the budget. Then the remaining 10 can't be used for anything. But in that case, the number of shirts is 1. So the ratio would be 11:1. But that would be an option E)11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says he spends 810 in buying both. So 70*T +30*S=810. So when T=11, 70*11=770, so 30*S=40 \u2192 S=40/30=1.333, which is not an integer. So that's impossible. So T=11 is not allowed because S must be integer.\n\nThus, the next possible T is 9, which gives S=6, which is an integer. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy with an integer number of shirts is 9.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Because when T=11, the remaining money is 40, which can't buy a shirt. So he can't buy 11 trousers because that would require buying 0 shirts, but the problem says he buys both, so he must buy at least one shirt. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require that he buys at least one shirt. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" It doesn't explicitly say he buys both, but the way it's phrased might imply that he buys some of each. So perhaps the initial assumption is that he buys at least one of each.\n\nIn that case, T=11 is impossible because that would leave 40, which isn't enough for a shirt (since 30 is needed for one). So the next possible T is 10, which gives 700, leaving 110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which isn't integer. So T=10 also doesn't work.\n\nSo next is T=9, which leaves 180, which is exactly 6 shirts. So T=9, S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. So the correct answer would be option A)9 Trousers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows buying 0 shirts. Let me check that.\n\nIf he buys 11 trousers, that's 770. He has 40 left, which can't buy a shirt. So total spent is 770, but he has 40 left unspent. But the problem states he spends 810, so that's impossible. So he must spend all 810, so T=11 is not possible because 770+30=800, which is under 810, but that leaves 10 unspent. So that's not acceptable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. So he could buy 11 trousers and 1 shirt, which would cost 770+30=800, leaving 10. But that's 800, not 810. So he's spent only 800, but the problem says he spends 810. So that's not possible. So he must spend exactly 810.\n\nSo T=11 and S=1.333 is impossible. So the next is T=10. 70*10=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666, which is not integer. So he can't buy 10 trousers and 3 shirts (3*30=90, 700+90=790, 810-790=20 left, which isn't allowed as that's not 0). So 10 is not possible.\n\nT=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So he can buy 9 trousers and 6 shirts. Total cost 630+180=810, which fits. So that's the maximum number of trousers possible, as higher numbers don't yield integer S.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which can be reduced by dividing both by 3. So 3:2.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 9 Trousers. So the answer should be A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a higher T that allows S to be integer. Let me try T=8.\n\n70*8=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666, not integer.\n\nT=6: 420, 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. But that's lower T than 9, so not the maximum.\n\nSo the maximum T possible is 9, leading to 6 shirts. So the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nSo the answer is option A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we start by defining the cost equation:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the number of trousers and \\(S\\) is the number of shirts. The goal is to maximize \\(T\\) while ensuring \\(S\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n### Step 1: Find the maximum possible \\(T\\)\nThe maximum \\(T\\) is determined by dividing the total budget by the cost per trouser:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{max}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{810}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 11\n\\]\n\nHowever, if \\(T = 11\\), the remaining budget is:\n\n\\[\n810 - (70 \\times 11) = 40\n\\]\n\nSince \\(40\\) is not divisible by \\(30\\) (the cost per shirt), \\(T = 11\\) is not valid because \\(S\\) must be an integer.\n\n### Step 2: Check \\(T = 10\\)\nIf \\(T = 10\\), the remaining budget is:\n\n\\[\n810 - (70 \\times 10) = 110\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{110}{30} = 3.666\\ldots\n\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) is not an integer, \\(T = 10\\) is also invalid.\n\n### Step 3: Check \\(T = 9\\)\nIf \\(T = 9\\), the remaining budget is:\n\n\\[\n810 - (70 \\times 9) = 180\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(S = 6\\) is an integer, so \\(T = 9\\) is valid. The ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify higher \\(T\\) values\nFor completeness, we check \\(T = 8\\), \\(T = 7\\), etc., but these yield non-integer \\(S\\) values. Thus, \\(T = 9\\) is the maximum valid number of trousers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of trousers that can be purchased, along with an integer number of shirts, is \\(T = 9\\), and the corresponding ratio is \\(9:6\\) or \\(3:2\\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers and shirts. Trousers cost 70 each and shirts 30 each. The question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a specific number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the first step is to figure out how he can spend exactly 810 rupees on as many trousers as possible. Since he wants the maximum number of trousers, he should buy as many as he can without exceeding his budget, and then see what's left for shirts.\n\nLet me set this up. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70t. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30s. The total is 810, so the equation is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut he wants the maximum number of trousers. So I need to find the largest integer t such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining amount can be exactly divided by 30 to buy some shirts. Because if the remaining amount isn't divisible by 30, then he can't buy a whole number of shirts, and that would mean he can't maximize the number of trousers.\n\nSo, let's solve for s in terms of t. Rearranging the equation: 30s = 810 -70t. So s = (810 -70t)/30. For s to be an integer, (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me see. 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So 70t would be 70 * t. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's find t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and 810-70t is divisible by 30.\n\nLet me think of 70t modulo 30. Because 810 is 810 mod 30, which is 0, since 810 divided by 30 is 27. So 70t must also be congruent to 0 mod 30. Because 810 is 0 mod 30, so 70t must be 0 mod 30.\n\nWait, 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70t mod30 is (10t) mod30. For this to be 0, 10t must be divisible by 30. So 10t mod30=0. That implies t must be a multiple of 3 because 10 *3=30, which is 0 mod30.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3. So possible t values are 3,6,9, etc.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum t possible such that 70t \u2264810.\n\nCalculate 810 /70. 70*11 is 770, 70*12=840 which is over 810. So maximum t is 11, but wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So t=11 is not possible because s would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't allowed. So we need to try t=9.\n\nt=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. So s=6. That works.\n\nWait, but wait, is 9 the maximum possible t that is a multiple of 3? Let's check t=12: 70*12=840 which is over 810, so no. So the next lower multiple is 9. So t=9, s=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that, divide both by 3: 3:2.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, but the options are about how many trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see if there's a higher t that's a multiple of 3 but less than 11. Wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3, so the next lower is 9. So t=9 is the max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by testing each option.\n\nOption A: 9 trousers. 9*70=630. Remaining: 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So yes, possible.\n\nOption B:8 trousers. 8*70=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... which is not integer. So this can't be.\n\nOption C:10 trousers. 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666... Not integer.\n\nOption D:7 trousers. 7*70=490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666..., nope.\n\nOption E:11 trousers. 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333..., nope.\n\nSo only option A gives an integer number of shirts. So the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the answer is A.\n",

The question is about finding the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a specific number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so I think the first step is to figure out how he can spend exactly 810 rupees on as many trousers as possible. Since he wants the maximum number of trousers, he should buy as many as he can without exceeding his budget, and then see what's left for shirts.\n\nLet me set this up. Let's say he buys 't' number of trousers and 's' number of shirts. Each trouser is 70, so the cost for trousers is 70t. Each shirt is 30, so shirts cost 30s. The total is 810, so the equation is 70t + 30s = 810.\n\nBut he wants the maximum number of trousers. So I need to find the largest integer t such that when multiplied by 70, the remaining amount can be exactly divided by 30 to buy some shirts. Because if the remaining amount isn't divisible by 30, then he can't buy a whole number of shirts, and that would mean he can't maximize the number of trousers.\n\nSo, let's solve for s in terms of t. Rearranging the equation: 30s = 810 -70t. So s = (810 -70t)/30. For s to be an integer, (810 -70t) must be divisible by 30.\n\nLet me see. 810 divided by 30 is 27. 70 divided by 30 is 7/3. So 70t would be 70 * t. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's find t such that 70t is less than or equal to 810, and 810-70t is divisible by 30.\n\nLet me think of 70t modulo 30. Because 810 is 810 mod 30, which is 0, since 810 divided by 30 is 27. So 70t must also be congruent to 0 mod 30. Because 810 is 0 mod 30, so 70t must be 0 mod 30.\n\nWait, 70 mod 30 is 10. So 70t mod30 is (10t) mod30. For this to be 0, 10t must be divisible by 30. So 10t mod30=0. That implies t must be a multiple of 3 because 10 *3=30, which is 0 mod30.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3. So possible t values are 3,6,9, etc.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum t possible such that 70t \u2264810.\n\nCalculate 810 /70. 70*11 is 770, 70*12=840 which is over 810. So maximum t is 11, but wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3. So the next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So t=11 is not possible because s would be 40/30=1.333, which isn't allowed. So we need to try t=9.\n\nt=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. So s=6. That works.\n\nWait, but wait, is 9 the maximum possible t that is a multiple of 3? Let's check t=12: 70*12=840 which is over 810, so no. So the next lower multiple is 9. So t=9, s=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6. Simplifying that, divide both by 3: 3:2.\n\nBut the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is bought. So the ratio is 9:6, but the options are about how many trousers, not the ratio. Wait, wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc. So the correct number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's see if there's a higher t that's a multiple of 3 but less than 11. Wait, 11 is not a multiple of 3, so the next lower is 9. So t=9 is the max.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by testing each option.\n\nOption A: 9 trousers. 9*70=630. Remaining: 810-630=180. 180/30=6 shirts. So yes, possible.\n\nOption B:8 trousers. 8*70=560. 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333... which is not integer. So this can't be.\n\nOption C:10 trousers. 10*70=700. 810-700=110. 110/30=3.666...

So the maximum number of trousers is 9. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[\n70t + 30s = 810\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the number of trousers and \\( s \\) is the number of shirts.

Since \\( 70 \\mod 30 = 10 \\), the term \\( 70t \\mod 30 \\) simplifies to \\( 10t \\mod 30 \\). For \\( 10t \\) to be divisible by 30, \\( t \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nNext, we find the maximum \\( t \\) such that \\( 70t \\leq 810 \\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives approximately 11.57, so the maximum possible \\( t \\) is 11. However, 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. What will be the ratio of trousers and shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased?\n\nWait, the options are A to E, each giving a number of trousers, like 9, 8, etc. Hmm, so I think the problem is asking for the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding 810 rupees. And then, based on that, the ratio of trousers to shirts would be determined.\n\nLet me break this down. So, the total amount is 810. Each trouser is 70, each shirt is 30. We need to find how many trousers and shirts he buys such that the total is exactly 810, but the number of trousers is as maximum as possible.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible that he can't buy exactly 810 with integer numbers of each. So perhaps he can spend up to 810, but maybe the total is less? Or perhaps the question implies that he spends exactly 810. I think the latter is the case because otherwise, the problem would be a bit more complicated.\n\nSo, the problem is to maximize the number of trousers (T) while keeping the total cost \u2264 810. But since the options are exact numbers, I think the total is exactly 810.\n\nLet me set up the equation. The cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810, where T is the number of trousers and S is the number of shirts.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, I can express S in terms of T. Let's rearrange the equation:\n\n30*S = 810 - 70*T  \n=> S = (810 -70*T)/30  \nSimplify that: S = (810/30) - (70/30)*T  \nWhich is S = 27 - (7/3)*T.\n\nBut since S has to be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a shirt), (810 -70*T) must be divisible by 30. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, another approach: 70*T must be less than or equal to 810. So, T can be at maximum when 70*T is as large as possible without exceeding 810.\n\nLet me compute 810 divided by 70. 70 * 11 is 770, because 70*10=700, 70*11=770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So, T can be up to 11, but let's check.\n\nWait, but if T is 11, then 70*11=770. So the remaining money is 810-770=40. But shirts are 30 each. 40 isn't a multiple of 30. So 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. So T can't be 11 because then S would have to be 40/30=1.333, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, let's try T=10. 70*10=700. Remaining money:810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666, which is also not an integer. So S can't be 3.666. So T=10 is not possible.\n\nNext, T=9. 70*9=630. Remaining is 810-630=180. 180/30=6. So S=6. That's an integer. So this is a valid solution.\n\nSo, when T is 9, S is 6. So the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So we need to check if T=9 is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nWait, earlier I thought T could be 11, but that didn't work. Then T=10 also didn't work. So T=9 is the maximum where S is an integer.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. What about lower values? Let me check T=8. 70*8=560. Remaining 810-560=250. 250/30=8.333, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nT=7: 70*7=490. Remaining 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666, not integer.\n\nT=6: 420. 810-420=390. 390/30=13. So S=13. So that's possible, but T is 6, which is less than 9. So 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which is 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the ratio is 9:6, but the options only give the number of trousers, not the ratio.\n\nWait, the options are A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. So the question is about the maximum number of trousers he can buy, which is 9. So the answer is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Because maybe I missed a higher T that works.\n\nWait, T=12: 70*12=840, which is over 810. So no.\n\nT=11: 770, as before, leaves 40. 40 isn't divisible by 30. So no.\n\nT=10:700, leaves 110. 110/30=3.666. Not integer.\n\nT=9:630, leaves 180. 180/30=6. So that's good.\n\nSo yeah, T=9 is the maximum possible.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers, so I think the answer will be one of those.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. He wants to spend exactly 810, buying as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I should find out the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his budget, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, the key here is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I should find the largest possible number of trousers (t) such that the total cost doesn't exceed 810, and then see what number of shirts (s) can be bought with the remaining money.\n\nSo, the equation would be 70t + 30s = 810. But since he's trying to buy the maximum number of trousers, I should maximize t, which would minimize s. So, I can rearrange the equation to find s in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 70t \u2264 810. Let's see, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. But since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum t is 11. But wait, let me check that. 70 * 11 is 770. So that's 770 spent on trousers. Then, the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. With 40, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, since he can't buy a fraction. That leaves 10 rupees unused, but the problem doesn't mention that; it just asks for the ratio when maximum trousers are bought.\n\nSo, the number of trousers is 11, and shirts is 1. The ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1. But wait, looking at the options, the options are all the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, the ratio is 11:1, but the options give the number of trousers, so maybe the question is simply asking how many trousers are bought, which would be 11, so option E.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe he can't buy 11 trousers because 11*70 is 770, plus 1 shirt is 30, total 800, which is under 810. So the remaining 10 can't buy another shirt. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, so the correct answer would be E) 11 Trousers.\n\nWait another thing, maybe I should check if buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt is the only possibility. Let me see:\n\nIf t=11, s=1: 70*11=770, 30*1=30. 770+30=800, which is under 810. But what about t=11 and s=2? That would be 770 +60=830, which is over 810. So no, that's not possible. So s can only be 1.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1, and the number of trousers is 11, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem as an equation where 70t +30s =810, and find integer solutions where t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, 70t +30s = 810.\n\nDividing both sides by 10 to simplify: 7t +3s =81.\n\nWe can rearrange this as 3s =81-7t \u2192 s=(81-7t)/3.\n\nSince s must be an integer \u22650, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3, and 81-7t \u22650.\n\nLet me find t such that 81-7t is divisible by 3 and t is maximum.\n\n7t mod 3: since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is t mod3.\n\nSo 81 is 0 mod3, so 81-7t \u2261 0 - t mod3 \u2192 so 0 - t mod3 must be 0 \u2192 t must be 0 mod3.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWe also need 81-7t \u22650 \u21927t \u226481 \u2192t \u226411.571 \u2192 t \u226411.\n\nSo the maximum possible t is 11, but wait 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that t=11 is possible because s=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because 81-7t must be divisible by 3, but when t=11, 81-77=4, which is 4, and 4 mod3 is 1, so 4 is not divisible by 3. So s would be 4/3, which is not an integer. Oh wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt would work, but according to this, s would be 4/3, which is 1.333, which isn't possible.\n\nSo that suggests that t can't be 11 because s wouldn't be an integer.\n\nSo where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, because I didn't check if s is an integer.\n\nSo, let me re-examine.\n\nt=11: 70*11=770, remaining 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, so s=1.333. Not integer. So s can't be 1.333. So t=11 is not possible because s isn't an integer.\n\nSo I need to find the maximum t such that s is an integer.\n\nSo, let's try t=11: s=(81-77)/3 =4/3 \u2192 no.\n\nt=10: 7*10=70 \u219281-70=11 \u2192 11/3=3.666\u2026 nope.\n\nt=9:7*9=63 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 yes. So s=6.\n\nSo when t=9, s=6.\n\nSo that gives 9 trousers and 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, t=9 is possible, but perhaps there's a higher t that also gives an integer s.\n\nWait, let's check t=8.\n\nt=8 \u21927*8=56 \u219281-56=25 \u219225/3\u22488.333\u2192 not integer.\n\nt=7 \u21927*7=49 \u219281-49=32 \u219232/3\u224810.666\u2192 no.\n\nt=6 \u21927*6=42 \u219281-42=39 \u219239/3=13\u2192 yes, s=13.\n\nSo t=6, s=13.\n\nBut wait, we're looking for maximum t. So t=9 is higher than t=6.\n\nWait, what about t=10? As before, t=10 gives s= (81-70)/3=11/3 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=11: s not integer. So the next possible t is t=9, which gives s=6. So maximum t is 9.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2, but the question is about the number of trousers, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Because earlier when I thought t=11 was possible, I didn't check if s is an integer, which it isn't. So t can't be 11. The maximum t that allows s to be an integer is 9.\n\nSo the man buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts, with total cost 9*70 +6*30 =630 +180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question is about the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9. So the answer would be option A)9 Trousers.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a man spends 810 rupees on buying trousers and shirts. The trousers cost 70 each and shirts are 30 each. The question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options given are A to E, each with a number of trousers, so I think the answer will be one of those.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. He wants to spend exactly 810, buying as many trousers as possible. So, I guess I should find out the maximum number of trousers he can buy without exceeding his budget, and then see how many shirts he can buy with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, the key here is to maximize the number of trousers. That means I should find the largest possible number of trousers (t) such that the total cost doesn't exceed 810, and then see what number of shirts (s) can be bought with the remaining money.\n\nSo, the equation would be 70t + 30s = 810. But since he's trying to buy the maximum number of trousers, I should maximize t, which would minimize s. So, I can rearrange the equation to find s in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 70t \u2264 810. Let's see, 810 divided by 70 is approximately 11.57. But since he can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum t is 11. But wait, let me check that. 70 * 11 is 770. So that's 770 spent on trousers. Then, the remaining money is 810 - 770 = 40. With 40, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333. So he can buy 1 shirt, since he can't buy a fraction. That leaves 10 rupees unused, but the problem doesn't mention that; it just asks for the ratio when maximum trousers are bought.\n\nSo, the number of trousers is 11, and shirts is 1. The ratio of trousers to shirts would be 11:1. But wait, looking at the options, the options are all the number of trousers, not the ratio. Oh wait, the question is phrased as \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So, the ratio is 11:1, but the options give the number of trousers, so maybe the question is simply asking how many trousers are bought, which would be 11, so option E.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe he can't buy 11 trousers because 11*70 is 770, plus 1 shirt is 30, total 800, which is under 810. So the remaining 10 can't buy another shirt. So yes, 11 trousers and 1 shirt. So the ratio is 11:1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are giving the number of trousers. So the maximum number of trousers is 11, so the correct answer would be E) 11 Trousers.\n\nWait another thing, maybe I should check if buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt is the only possibility. Let me see:\n\nIf t=11, s=1: 70*11=770, 30*1=30. 770+30=800, which is under 810. But what about t=11 and s=2? That would be 770 +60=830, which is over 810. So no, that's not possible. So s can only be 1.\n\nSo the ratio is 11:1, and the number of trousers is 11, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the problem as an equation where 70t +30s =810, and find integer solutions where t is as large as possible.\n\nSo, 70t +30s = 810.\n\nDividing both sides by 10 to simplify: 7t +3s =81.\n\nWe can rearrange this as 3s =81-7t \u2192 s=(81-7t)/3.\n\nSince s must be an integer \u22650, (81-7t) must be divisible by 3, and 81-7t \u22650.\n\nLet me find t such that 81-7t is divisible by 3 and t is maximum.\n\n7t mod 3: since 7 mod3 is 1, so 7t mod3 is t mod3.\n\nSo 81 is 0 mod3, so 81-7t \u2261 0 - t mod3 \u2192 so 0 - t mod3 must be 0 \u2192 t must be 0 mod3.\n\nSo t must be a multiple of 3.\n\nWe also need 81-7t \u22650 \u21927t \u226481 \u2192t \u226411.571 \u2192 t \u226411.\n\nSo the maximum possible t is 11, but wait 11 is not a multiple of 3. The next lower multiple of 3 is 9.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation shows that t=11 is possible because s=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because 81-7t must be divisible by 3, but when t=11, 81-77=4, which is 4, and 4 mod3 is 1, so 4 is not divisible by 3. So s would be 4/3, which is not an integer. Oh wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that buying 11 trousers and 1 shirt would work, but according to this, s would be 4/3, which is 1.333, which isn't possible.\n\nSo that suggests that t can't be 11 because s wouldn't be an integer.\n\nSo where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, because I didn't check if s is an integer.\n\nSo, let me re-examine.\n\nt=11: 70*11=770, remaining 810-770=40. 40/30=1.333, so s=1.333. Not integer. So s can't be 1.333. So t=11 is not possible because s isn't an integer.\n\nSo I need to find the maximum t such that s is an integer.\n\nSo, let's try t=11: s=(81-77)/3 =4/3 \u2192 no.\n\nt=10: 7*10=70 \u219281-70=11 \u2192 11/3=3.666\u2026 nope.\n\nt=9:7*9=63 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6 \u2192 yes. So s=6.\n\nSo when t=9, s=6.\n\nSo that gives 9 trousers and 6 shirts.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question is about the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So in this case, t=9 is possible, but perhaps there's a higher t that also gives an integer s.\n\nWait, let's check t=8.\n\nt=8 \u21927*8=56 \u219281-56=25 \u219225/3\u22488.333\u2192 not integer.\n\nt=7 \u21927*7=49 \u219281-49=32 \u219232/3\u224810.666\u2192 no.\n\nt=6 \u21927*6=42 \u219281-42=39 \u219239/3=13\u2192 yes, s=13.\n\nSo t=6, s=13.\n\nBut wait, we're looking for maximum t. So t=9 is higher than t=6.\n\nWait, what about t=10? As before, t=10 gives s= (81-70)/3=11/3 \u2192 not integer.\n\nt=11: s not integer. So the next possible t is t=9, which gives s=6. So maximum t is 9.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6 \u2192 3:2, but the question is about the number of trousers, which is 9. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Because earlier when I thought t=11 was possible, I didn't check if s is an integer, which it isn't. So t can't be 11. The maximum t that allows s to be an integer is 9.\n\nSo the man buys 9 trousers and 6 shirts, with total cost 9*70 +6*30 =630 +180=810. Perfect.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2, but the question is about the number of trousers when maximum is bought, which is 9. So the answer would be option A)9 Trousers.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, the man spends a total of 810 rupees on buying trousers at 70 rupees each and shirts at 30 rupees each.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys. That makes sense. So, he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so the cost for trousers would be 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts would be 30*S. The total cost is 810, so the equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, but with T being as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum trousers are bought. So, first, find T_max, the maximum number of trousers possible, then find the corresponding S, and then compute the ratio T:S.\n\nBut wait, the options given are only the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A to E, each being a number of trousers. So, perhaps the question is asking what is the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then the ratio is perhaps part of the calculation, but the options are just the number of trousers. Or maybe the ratio is part of the answer. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are just numbers with the label 'Trousers', which suggests that the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, maybe the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Alternatively, perhaps the options represent possible maximum numbers of trousers, and the correct option is the number of trousers, and then the ratio is a part of the solution process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let's think about the problem: he has 810 rupees, and he buys T trousers and S shirts. We need to maximize T, so that the cost doesn't exceed 810. Let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810. Because if he buys T as maximum as possible, the remaining money will be spent on shirts.\n\nWait, but 70*T must be less than or equal to 810. So the maximum possible T is floor(810 /70). Let me compute that.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see: 70*11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So T_max is 11, because 70*11=770. So 11 trousers cost 770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. Then, with 40 rupees, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30. So 40 /30 is 1.333... but you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt, which costs 30, leaving 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So with T=11, S=1. But wait, that's only 30, but the remaining money is 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total cost is 770+30=800, which is under 810. Hmm, but that leaves 10 rupees unused.\n\nBut perhaps he can buy more shirts if he buys fewer trousers. Because if he buys 11 trousers, he can only buy 1 shirt. But maybe if he buys 10 trousers, he can buy more shirts.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nIf T=10, the cost is 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. So S=110/30=3.666. So he can buy 3 shirts, which would cost 90, leaving 20. So total spent is 700+90=790. Hmm, that's less than 810. Alternatively, perhaps he can buy 3 shirts and have 20 left, which is better than the previous case where he had 10 left.\n\nWait, but perhaps even better, can he buy more shirts by reducing the number of trousers further?\n\nWait, but the question is about maximizing the number of trousers. So if 11 is possible, that's better. But in the first case, when T=11, he can only buy 1 shirt, but maybe he can't spend all the money because 770+30=800, leaving 10. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to adjust the number of shirts to use up more of the money.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the total spent is 810, so any leftover money would not be used. So, perhaps the maximum number of trousers is 11, but then he can't spend all 810. But perhaps the problem allows for that.\n\nWait, but the problem says he \"spends 810 in buying\". So the total cost is exactly 810. Therefore, 70*T +30*S must equal 810. So the equation is 70T +30S =810.\n\nSo we need to find integer solutions for T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\n7T + 3S = 81.\n\nNow, the equation is 7T +3S =81. We need to find maximum T such that S is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, solving for S: S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nS must be an integer, so (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me see: 81 mod 3 is 0, since 81/3=27. So 7T must also leave a remainder of 0 mod 3, because 81-7T must be divisible by 3.\n\n7 mod 3 is 1, because 7=2*3 +1. So 7T mod 3 is equal to (1*T) mod 3.\n\nSo, 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nWe need 81-7T to be divisible by 3, so 81 mod3 is 0, 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 0 - T mod3 must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12 etc. But since 7T can't exceed 81, T can be up to 11, as earlier.\n\nWait, so T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12. But 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so the maximum T is 9? Because 7*9=63, and 81-63=18, which is 3*6. So S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, which isn't a multiple of 3. So perhaps that's not a valid solution because S would not be an integer. Let's check.\n\nWait, when T=11, 7T=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not an integer. So S would be 4/3, which is 1.333, not an integer. So that's invalid. So the maximum T that allows S to be integer must be such that T is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the possible Ts are 0,3,6,9, etc., but under 81/7, which is about 11.57. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12, but 12 is 84, which is over 81. So the maximum possible T is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum T is 9, and S is 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the options are giving the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct option is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought T=11 would give 770, which is under 810, but that's only 770, and the remaining 40 can't buy any more shirts without leftover. But in that scenario, the total would be 770+30=800, which is under 810. But the problem says he spends exactly 810. So that scenario isn't allowed. So T=11 isn't a valid solution because it doesn't use the entire 810.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the maximum T such that 7T +3S =81, with S being integer. So T must be a multiple of 3, and the maximum T is 9, giving S=6.\n\nSo the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is 10, which is higher than 9. So why can't T=10?\n\nBecause when T=10, 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't possible. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because S isn't integer.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe have 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe're looking for T as large as possible, so let me try T=11.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3=1.333... which is not an integer. So no.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So yes.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3=8.333... No.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3=10.666... No.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. But we are looking for maximum T, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's compute 70*9 +30*6. 70*9 is 630, 30*6 is 180. 630+180=810. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, and the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says a man spends 810 rupees buying trousers at 70 each and shirts at 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each with a number of trousers.\n\nHmm, so the goal is to maximize the number of trousers he buys. That makes sense. So, he's trying to buy as many trousers as possible without exceeding his total budget of 810 rupees.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's denote the number of trousers as T and the number of shirts as S. Each trouser costs 70, so the cost for trousers would be 70*T. Each shirt is 30, so shirts would be 30*S. The total cost is 810, so the equation would be:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810\n\nWe need to find integer values of T and S that satisfy this equation, but with T being as large as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the ratio of trousers to shirts when maximum trousers are bought. So, first, find T_max, the maximum number of trousers possible, then find the corresponding S, and then compute the ratio T:S.\n\nBut wait, the options given are only the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the options are A to E, each being a number of trousers. So, perhaps the question is asking what is the maximum number of trousers he can buy, and then the ratio is perhaps part of the calculation, but the options are just the number of trousers. Or maybe the ratio is part of the answer. Hmm, let me read the question again.\n\nWait, the question says \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So the ratio is T:S. But the options are just numbers with the label 'Trousers', which suggests that the options are the number of trousers. Hmm, maybe the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Alternatively, perhaps the options represent possible maximum numbers of trousers, and the correct option is the number of trousers, and then the ratio is a part of the solution process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed step by step. Let's think about the problem: he has 810 rupees, and he buys T trousers and S shirts. We need to maximize T, so that the cost doesn't exceed 810. Let's find the maximum T such that 70*T \u2264 810. Because if he buys T as maximum as possible, the remaining money will be spent on shirts.\n\nWait, but 70*T must be less than or equal to 810. So the maximum possible T is floor(810 /70). Let me compute that.\n\n810 divided by 70. Let's see: 70*11 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is more than 810. So T_max is 11, because 70*11=770. So 11 trousers cost 770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. Then, with 40 rupees, how many shirts can he buy? Each shirt is 30. So 40 /30 is 1.333... but you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So he can buy 1 shirt, which costs 30, leaving 10 rupees, which isn't enough for another shirt. So with T=11, S=1. But wait, that's only 30, but the remaining money is 10, which isn't enough for another shirt. So total cost is 770+30=800, which is under 810. Hmm, but that leaves 10 rupees unused.\n\nBut perhaps he can buy more shirts if he buys fewer trousers. Because if he buys 11 trousers, he can only buy 1 shirt. But maybe if he buys 10 trousers, he can buy more shirts.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nIf T=10, the cost is 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. So S=110/30=3.666. So he can buy 3 shirts, which would cost 90, leaving 20. So total spent is 700+90=790. Hmm, that's less than 810. Alternatively, perhaps he can buy 3 shirts and have 20 left, which is better than the previous case where he had 10 left.\n\nWait, but perhaps even better, can he buy more shirts by reducing the number of trousers further?\n\nWait, but the question is about maximizing the number of trousers. So if 11 is possible, that's better. But in the first case, when T=11, he can only buy 1 shirt, but maybe he can't spend all the money because 770+30=800, leaving 10. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to adjust the number of shirts to use up more of the money.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the total spent is 810, so any leftover money would not be used. So, perhaps the maximum number of trousers is 11, but then he can't spend all 810. But perhaps the problem allows for that.\n\nWait, but the problem says he \"spends 810 in buying\". So the total cost is exactly 810. Therefore, 70*T +30*S must equal 810. So the equation is 70T +30S =810.\n\nSo we need to find integer solutions for T and S where T is as large as possible.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n70T + 30S = 810.\n\nDivide both sides by 10 to simplify:\n\n7T + 3S = 81.\n\nNow, the equation is 7T +3S =81. We need to find maximum T such that S is a non-negative integer.\n\nSo, solving for S: S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nS must be an integer, so (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet me see: 81 mod 3 is 0, since 81/3=27. So 7T must also leave a remainder of 0 mod 3, because 81-7T must be divisible by 3.\n\n7 mod 3 is 1, because 7=2*3 +1. So 7T mod 3 is equal to (1*T) mod 3.\n\nSo, 7T mod3 = T mod3.\n\nWe need 81-7T to be divisible by 3, so 81 mod3 is 0, 7T mod3 is T mod3. So 0 - T mod3 must be 0. So T mod3 must be 0.\n\nSo T must be a multiple of 3. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12 etc. But since 7T can't exceed 81, T can be up to 11, as earlier.\n\nWait, so T must be a multiple of 3. So possible T values are 0,3,6,9,12. But 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so the maximum T is 9? Because 7*9=63, and 81-63=18, which is 3*6. So S=6.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought T=11, which isn't a multiple of 3. So perhaps that's not a valid solution because S would not be an integer. Let's check.\n\nWait, when T=11, 7T=77. 81-77=4. 4/3 is not an integer. So S would be 4/3, which is 1.333, not an integer. So that's invalid. So the maximum T that allows S to be integer must be such that T is a multiple of 3.\n\nSo the possible Ts are 0,3,6,9, etc., but under 81/7, which is about 11.57. So T can be 0,3,6,9,12, but 12 is 84, which is over 81. So the maximum possible T is 9.\n\nSo when T=9, 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So the maximum T is 9, and S is 6. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But wait, the options are giving the number of trousers, so perhaps the correct option is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier I thought T=11 would give 770, which is under 810, but that's only 770, and the remaining 40 can't buy any more shirts without leftover. But in that scenario, the total would be 770+30=800, which is under 810. But the problem says he spends exactly 810. So that scenario isn't allowed. So T=11 isn't a valid solution because it doesn't use the entire 810.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the maximum T such that 7T +3S =81, with S being integer. So T must be a multiple of 3, and the maximum T is 9, giving S=6.\n\nSo the number of trousers is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is 10, which is higher than 9. So why can't T=10?\n\nBecause when T=10, 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not an integer. So S=3.666, which isn't possible. So T=10 isn't a valid solution because S isn't integer.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe have 7T +3S=81.\n\nWe're looking for T as large as possible, so let me try T=11.\n\n7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4/3=1.333... which is not an integer. So no.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70. 81-70=11. 11/3 is not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63. 81-63=18. 18/3=6. So S=6. So yes.\n\nT=8: 7*8=56. 81-56=25. 25/3=8.333... No.\n\nT=7: 7*7=49. 81-49=32. 32/3=10.666... No.\n\nT=6: 7*6=42. 81-42=39. 39/3=13. So S=13. So T=6, S=13. But we are looking for maximum T, so 9 is better.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but the options are A)9, B)8, C)10, D)7, E)11.\n\nSo the correct answer is A)9.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's compute 70*9 +30*6. 70*9 is 630, 30*6 is 180. 630+180=810. Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo the maximum number of trousers he can buy is 9, and the ratio of T:S is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the question asks for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is bought, which would be 9:6, but the options only give the number of trousers, so the answer is 9, which is option A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with a total budget of 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The total expenditure must equal 810 rupees, and the number of shirts (S) must be an integer.\n\nThe equation governing the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nSimplifying by dividing through by 10:\n\n\\[\n7T + 3S = 81\n\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7T}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(S\\) to be an integer, \\(81 - 7T\\) must be divisible by 3. Since \\(7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), \\(7T \\equiv T \\pmod{3}\\). Thus, \\(T\\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\nT \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n\\]\n\nThis means \\(T\\) must be a multiple of 3. The possible values of \\(T\\) are 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. However, \\(T\\) must also satisfy \\(7T \\leq 81\\), so the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 9.\n\nSubstituting \\(T = 9\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{81 - 7(9)}{3} = \\frac{81 - 63}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, when \\(T = 9\\), \\(S = 6\\), and the total cost is:\n\n\\[\n70(9) + 30(6) = 630 + 180 = 810\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the budget constraint. Checking higher values of \\(T\\) (e.g., \\(T = 10\\) or \\(T = 11\\)) results in non-integer values for \\(S\\), making them invalid.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 9, and the corresponding number of shirts is 6. The ratio of trousers to shirts is \\(9:6\\), but the question only asks for the number of trousers, which is 9.\n\n**Answer: A**",

I need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when he buys the maximum number of trousers possible. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nWait, the problem says he spends exactly 810, right? So the total cost is 70 times the number of trousers plus 30 times the number of shirts. And I need to maximize the number of trousers, which means I should buy as many as possible without exceeding the budget. Then, whatever money is left should be spent on shirts.\n\nLet me denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S. So the equation is:\n\n70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nI need to find T and S such that T is as large as possible, and then find the ratio T:S.\n\nSo, to maximize T, I can try to find the maximum integer T where 70*T is less than or equal to 810. Because if 70*T is more than 810, he can't buy that many.\n\nLet me calculate the maximum possible T. 70*T \u2264 810 \u2192 T \u2264 810/70. Let me compute that. 70*11 is 770, because 70*10 is 700, plus 70 is 770. 70*12 is 840, which is over 810. So the maximum T is 11, but wait wait, wait. Let me check 810 divided by 70.\n\n810 /70 = 11.571... So the maximum integer T is 11. But wait, 11*70 is 770, so 810-770=40. So he has 40 left for shirts. Each shirt is 30, so 40 divided by 30 is 1.333... which isn't an integer. Oh, that's a problem because he can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So 11 Trousers isn't possible because 40 isn't divisible by 30. So the next lower T is 10.\n\nWait, let's check T=11. 70*11=770. Remaining 810-770=40. 40/30 = 1.333. So he can't buy 1.333 shirts. So that's not possible. So T=11 isn't a feasible solution because S has to be an integer. So I have to try T=10.\n\nT=10: 70*10=700. Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... again, not an integer. Hmm, so that's also not possible. So T=10 isn't working.\n\nNext, T=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. Oh, that's an integer. So S=6. So that's a valid solution. So the numbers are T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm going too fast. Let me list down the possible T from high to low and see where 810-70*T is divisible by 30.\n\nStart with T=11: 770, 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333 \u2192 no.\nT=10: 700, 110 left. 110/30=3.666\u2192 no.\nT=9: 630, 180 left. 180/30=6 \u2192 yes. So S=6. So this is a valid option.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a higher T where S is an integer. Let me check T=8: 560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, not integer. T=7: 490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666\u2192 nope. T=6: 420. 390 left. 390/30=13. So T=6, S=13. But wait, 6 is lower than 9, so 9 is better for maximum T.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me think again. So the maximum T is 11, but it doesn't give an integer S. So the next possible is T=10, but that also doesn't. So T=9 is the next possible.\n\nSo the numbers are T=9, S=6. So the ratio is T:S = 9:6. Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 9 is the maximum possible T that gives an integer S.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether there are any higher T that I might have missed. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 70*T for T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nT=10: 700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666, no.\n\nT=9: 630. 180 left. 180/30=6. So that works.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3: 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled A to E, but the options are the number of trousers. So the question is, when maximum number of trousers is purchased, what is the ratio.\n\nWait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So I think the ratio is T:S, and the options are about the number of trousers. So the options are the number of T's, and I'm supposed to pick the correct T that allows S to be an integer.\n\nWait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So each option is a possible number of T's, and the correct answer is the one where when you buy that number of T's, the remaining money allows buying a whole number of shirts.\n\nSo in our case, the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is about the number of T's, so the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check for T=11, 10, 9, etc., whether any higher T than 9 gives an integer S.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840, which is over 810. So no.\n\nT=11: no.\n\nT=10: no.\n\nT=9: yes.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are about the number of trousers. Wait, looking again at the question: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, so each option is the number of Trousers.

Remaining is 810-700=110. 110 divided by 30 is 3.666... again, not an integer. Hmm, so that's also not possible. So T=10 isn't working.\n\nNext, T=9: 70*9=630. 810-630=180. 180 /30=6. Oh, that's an integer. So S=6. So that's a valid solution. So the numbers are T=9, S=6.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. Maybe I'm going too fast. Let me list down the possible T from high to low and see where 810-70*T is divisible by 30.\n\nStart with T=11: 770, 810-770=40. 40/30 is 1.333 \u2192 no.\nT=10: 700, 110 left. 110/30=3.666\u2192 no.\nT=9: 630, 180 left. 180/30=6 \u2192 yes. So S=6. So this is a valid option.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a higher T where S is an integer. Let me check T=8: 560. 810-560=250. 250/30 is about 8.333, not integer. T=7: 490. 810-490=320. 320/30=10.666\u2192 nope. T=6: 420. 390 left. 390/30=13. So T=6, S=13. But wait, 6 is lower than 9, so 9 is better for maximum T.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me think again. So the maximum T is 11, but it doesn't give an integer S. So the next possible is T=10, but that also doesn't. So T=9 is the next possible.\n\nSo the numbers are T=9, S=6. So the ratio is T:S = 9:6. Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio when maximum number of trousers is purchased. So 9 is the maximum possible T that gives an integer S.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether there are any higher T that I might have missed. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute 70*T for T=11: 70*11=770. 810-770=40. 40 divided by 30 is 1.333, which is not an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nT=10: 700. 810-700=110. 110/30 is 3.666, no.\n\nT=9: 630. 180 left. 180/30=6. So that works.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6. Simplifying that, both are divisible by 3: 9/3=3, 6/3=2. So 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are given as A)9 Trousers, B)8, etc. Wait, no, looking back, the options are labeled A to E, but the options are the number of trousers. So the question is, when maximum number of trousers is purchased, what is the ratio.\n\nWait, the question says \"the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased.\" So I think the ratio is T:S, and the options are about the number of trousers. So the options are the number of T's, and I'm supposed to pick the correct T that allows S to be an integer.\n\nWait, no, the options are A)9 Trousers, etc. So each option is a possible number of T's, and the correct answer is the one where when you buy that number of T's, the remaining money allows buying a whole number of shirts.\n\nSo in our case, the maximum possible T is 9, which gives S=6. So the ratio is 9:6, but the question is about the number of T's, so the correct option is A)9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check for T=11, 10, 9, etc., whether any higher T than 9 gives an integer S.\n\nT=12: 70*12=840, which is over 810. So no.\n\nT=11: no.\n\nT=10: no.\n\nT=9: yes.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the answer is A)9 Trousers.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:6, which is 3:2. But the question is asking for the ratio, but the options are about the number of trousers. Wait, looking again at the question: \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)9 Trousers\n\nB)8 Trousers\n\nC)10 Trousers\n\nD)7 Trousers\n\nE)11 Trousers\n\nWait, so each option is the number of Trousers. So the correct option is A)9 Trousers, because that's the maximum number of T's possible with an integer S.\n\nSo the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of trousers (T) that can be purchased with 810 rupees, given that each trouser costs 70 rupees and each shirt costs 30 rupees. The remaining money after buying the maximum number of trousers should be spent on shirts (S), which must also be an integer.\n\nThe total cost equation is:\n\n\\[\n70T + 30S = 810\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(T\\), we start by finding the largest integer \\(T\\) such that \\(70T \\leq 810\\). Dividing 810 by 70 gives:\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{810}{70} \\approx 11.57\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum possible \\(T\\) is 11. However, checking \\(T = 11\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 11 = 770, \\quad 810 - 770 = 40\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 40 rupees cannot buy a whole number of shirts since \\(40 / 30 = 1.333\\), which is not an integer. Therefore, \\(T = 11\\) is not feasible.\n\nNext, we check \\(T = 10\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 10 = 700, \\quad 810 - 700 = 110\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 110 rupees also cannot buy a whole number of shirts since \\(110 / 30 = 3.666\\), which is not an integer. Thus, \\(T = 10\\) is not feasible either.\n\nNext, we check \\(T = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n70 \\times 9 = 630, \\quad 810 - 630 = 180\n\\]\n\nThe remaining 180 rupees can buy shirts:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{180}{30} = 6\n\\]\n\nThis is valid since \\(S = 6\\) is an integer. Therefore, \\(T = 9\\) and \\(S = 6\\) is a feasible solution. The ratio of trousers to shirts is:\n\n\\[\nT:S = 9:6 = 3:2\n\\]\n\nSince the question asks for the maximum number of trousers, the correct answer is \\(T = 9\\). Among the options provided, the correct choice is:\n\n**A) 9 Trousers**\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.\n\nThe problem says: A man spends 810 rupees in buying trousers at Rs 70 each and shirts at Rs 30 each. We need to find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. The options are given as A to E, each indicating a different number of trousers.\n\nHmm, okay, so the man is buying both trousers and shirts, and the total he spends is 810 rupees. Each trouser costs 70, each shirt 30. The question is about maximizing the number of trousers, so I think I need to find how many trousers he can buy without exceeding 810, and then see how many shirts that allows him to buy. Once I have the counts of both, I can find the ratio.\n\nWait, but the question says the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. So, the first step is to find the maximum number of trousers he can buy with 810, given that he also buys some shirts. Because if he buys all possible trousers, maybe he won't have any money left for shirts, but I think the problem implies he buys both, otherwise the ratio would be undefined.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says he buys both, right? Because it says \"trousers at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each.\" So he's buying both. So the maximum number of trousers he can buy is when the remaining money after buying as many as possible is used to buy shirts.\n\nSo let's model this. Let\u2019s denote the number of trousers as T and shirts as S.\n\nThe total cost is 70*T + 30*S = 810.\n\nWe need to maximize T. So, we can write 70T + 30S = 810. Let's solve for S in terms of T.\n\n30S = 810 -70T\n\nS = (810 -70T)/30.\n\nBut S must be a whole number because you can't buy a fraction of a shirt. So, (810 -70T) must be divisible by 30.\n\nAlternatively, 70T must be less than or equal to 810. So the maximum possible T is when 70T is as large as possible without exceeding 810.\n\nLet me calculate 810 divided by 70. Let's see: 70*11 is 770, 70*12 is 840. But 840 is more than 810, so maximum T without exceeding is 11? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 70*11 is 770, which is under 810. So 11 trousers would cost 770, leaving 810-770=40 rupees. 40 divided by 30 is 1 and 1/3. But you can't buy a third of a shirt. So S must be an integer. So in that case, 11 trousers would leave 40, which isn't enough for another shirt (since shirts are 30 each, 40 is more than 30 but you can buy one shirt and have 10 left, but that's not possible because 30 doesn't divide 40 evenly). Wait, 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10. So S can't be a fraction, so S must be 1, but then the total spent would be 770 +30=800, leaving 10 unspent. But the problem says he spends all 810. Oh wait, no. The problem says he spends 810 in buying both, but perhaps he doesn't have to spend all of it? No, the wording says he spends 810, so he must spend exactly 810. So 70T +30S must equal 810 exactly.\n\nSo, in that case, 810 -70T must be divisible by 30. So 70T must be such that 810 -70T is a multiple of 30.\n\nLet me think about this mathematically. 70T +30S =810.\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 10 to simplify: 7T +3S =81.\n\nNow, the equation is 7T +3S =81.\n\nWe need T and S to be non-negative integers, and we need to maximize T.\n\nSo, let's solve for S: 3S =81 -7T => S = (81 -7T)/3.\n\nSo, (81 -7T) must be divisible by 3, and S must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet me find the possible values of T.\n\nWe can rearrange 7T \u226481 \u2192 T \u226481/7 \u224811.57. So T can be up to 11.\n\nBut let's check for T from 11 down to 0 and see when (81-7T) is divisible by 3 and S is non-negative.\n\nStarting with T=11: 7*11=77 \u2192 81-77=4. 4 is not divisible by 3. So S=4/3, which is not integer. So T=11 is invalid.\n\nT=10: 7*10=70 \u2192 81-70=11 \u219211/3 is not integer.\n\nT=9: 7*9=63 \u219281-63=18 \u219218/3=6. So S=6. That's valid.\n\nSo T=9, S=6.\n\nLet me check if there's a higher T possible. Wait, when T=11 and T=10 didn't work, so the next lower is T=9, which works.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9, with S=6.\n\nSo the ratio of trousers to shirts is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2.\n\nWait, but the options are about the number of trousers, not the ratio. Wait, the question is, what is the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased? So the ratio is 9:6, which can be written as 3:2. But the options are giving the number of trousers, like option A is 9 Trousers, etc. So the correct number is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a higher T possible. Because perhaps I missed something. Let's see, for T=8: 7*8=56 \u219281-56=25 \u219225/3 is not integer.\n\nT=7:7*7=49 \u219281-49=32 \u219232/3\u224810.666. Not integer.\n\nT=6:7*6=42 \u219281-42=39 \u219239/3=13. So S=13. So that's valid, but T=6 is less than 9, so 9 is still the maximum.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check T=11 again. 7*11=77. 81-77=4. 4 isn't divisible by 3, so S=4/3 is not allowed.\n\nHmm. So yes, T=9 is the maximum. So the ratio is 9:6, which simplifies to 3:2. But the options don't give a ratio; they give the number of trousers. The question is asking for the ratio when the maximum number of trousers is purchased. Oh wait, no, the question is phrased as \"What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased?\" So perhaps the ratio is the number of trousers to shirts, which is 9:6, or 3:2, but the options don't list ratios, they list the number of trousers. Wait, the options are A)9, B)8, etc., so I think the correct answer is 9, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should check if T=12 is possible. Wait, 7*12=84, which is more than 81, so no.\n\nSo the maximum T is 9. So the answer is A)9.\n",
