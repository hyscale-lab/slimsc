Hmm, wait, let me make sure I'm reading the question right. Oh yeah, it says \"PROBLEM\", but looking at the word, I count seven letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, M. Each letter is unique, right? So no repeats in the original word.\n\nThe question is asking how many ways we can rearrange these letters to form 7-letter words where none of the letters repeat. So, since all letters are already unique, any rearrangement would automatically satisfy the condition of no repeating letters.
