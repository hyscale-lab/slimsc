      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the company produces 420 units every month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them each month. We need to find the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400. \n\nHmm, first, I think I should calculate the total production cost for a year. Since they make 420 units a month, the monthly cost would be 420 multiplied by $110. Let me do that: 420 * 110. Let me think, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So adding them, 44k + 2.2k is 46,200 dollars per month. \n\nWait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, 420 * 110. Let me calculate that again. 420 * 100 is 42,000 and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So 42,000 + 4,200 = 46,200. Yeah, that's right. So each month, the company spends $46,200 on production.\n\nSince they produce every month, the yearly production cost would be 46,200 multiplied by 12 months. Let me compute that. 46,200 * 12. Hmm, 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 * 2 is 92,400. So adding them together, 462,000 + 92,400 is 554,400. So the total yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So, Profit = Revenue - Cost. So Revenue must be at least Profit + Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue >= 626,400 + 554,400. Let me add those numbers. 626,400 + 554,400. 626k + 554k is 1,180,000, but wait, 626,400 plus 554,400. Let me compute it properly: 626,400 + 554,400. 600k + 500k is 1.1 million. 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So the Revenue needs to be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nRevenue is calculated as the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. They sell all 420 units each month, so per year that's 420 *12 = 5040 units. So, 5040 units sold per year.\n\nSo, Revenue = (Selling Price per unit) * 5040 units. We need this Revenue to be >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo, let me write that as an equation: (S) * 5040 >= 1,180,800. We need to solve for S.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040 to find S. So S >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, let's see. 5040 times 200 is 1,008,000. Because 5040 * 200 = 5040*2*100=10,080 *100=1,008,000. \n\nWait, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800.\n\nSo, 5040 * x = 172,800. What's x? Let's compute 172,800 / 5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the division. Let's see, 5040 is 504 *10. 172800 divided by 5040 is the same as 172800/(504*10) = (172800/504)/10.\n\nWait, 172800 divided by 504. Let me see: 504 * 340 is 504*300=151200, plus 504*40=20160. 151200+20160=171360. Hmm, but 172800 is 172,800. 171360 is less than that. The difference is 172,800 -171,360=1440.\n\nSo 504 * 2.857 approx? Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, 5040 * 34.2857? Wait, maybe it's easier to divide 172800 by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 34 = 171,360. Then 172800 - 171360 = 1440. 5040 * x =1440 \u2192 x =1440/5040= 0.2857. So 34 + 0.2857 \u224834.2857.\n\nSo 172800 /5040 is 34.2857. So adding that to the 200, total S would be 200 + 34.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nWait, wait. No, because I think I messed up the initial calculation. Let me re-do the division.\n\nWait, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify both numerator and denominator by dividing by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 goes into 118,080 how many times?\n\nLet me see: 504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280 left.\n\n504 * 34 = 17,136. 17,280 -17,136=144.\n\n504 * 0.2857 is 144, because 504 * 0.2857 \u2248144.\n\nSo 200 +34 +0.2857=234.2857.\n\nSo S is approximately 234.2857. Since the selling price has to be at least this, but the options are given as integers, so the minimum price would be $235. But wait, looking at the options, the closest higher option is B)230, C)240, etc.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: let's compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\n504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800. Subtract from 118,080: 17,280 left.\n\n504 \u00d7 34 = 17,136. 17,280 -17,136 = 144.\n\n144 is 504 \u00d7 (144/504)= 144/(504)= 0.2857.\n\nSo total is 200 +34 + 0.2857=234.2857. So S must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the possible choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280. So the minimum price that guarantees the profit is the smallest option equal to or higher than 234.29. The options are A)226, which is too low. B)230, also lower. Next is C)240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would be the minimum. \n\nWait, wait, but I think I might have messed up the profit calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the profit is revenue minus production cost. The total production cost per year is 46,200 *12 =554,400.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So revenue needs to be 554,400 +626,400=1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nNumber of units sold per year is 420 *12=5040. Correct.\n\nSo 5040 * S >=1,180,800. So S >=1,180,800 /5040= 234.2857.\n\nSo S must be at least 234.2857. The options are 226, 230, 240, etc. So 230 is below 234, which is not enough. 240 is the next higher option. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n",

So 42,000 + 4,200 = 46,200. Yeah, that's right. So each month, the company spends $46,200 on production.\n\nSince they produce every month, the yearly production cost would be 46,200 multiplied by 12 months. Let me compute that. 46,200 * 12. Hmm, 46,200 * 10 is 462,000, and 46,200 * 2 is 92,400. So adding them together, 462,000 + 92,400 is 554,400. So the total yearly production cost is $554,400.\n\nNow, the company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So, Profit = Revenue - Cost. So Revenue must be at least Profit + Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue >= 626,400 + 554,400. Let me add those numbers. 626,400 + 554,400. 626k + 554k is 1,180,000, but wait, 626,400 plus 554,400.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures a yearly profit of at least $626,400. \n\nAlright, first, let's break down the information given. The company produces 420 units every month. So, per year, that's 420 multiplied by 12 months. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Let's see, 420 times 10 is 4200, and 420 times 2 is 840, so adding those gives 5040 units per year. \n\nThe production cost is $110 per component. So, the total production cost for the year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110 each. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Wait, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company sells all of the components each month, so their revenue each month is the selling price per component multiplied by 420 units. But since we're looking at the yearly profit, I should probably consider the annual revenue. Let me denote the selling price per component as 'x'. Then, the revenue per month is 420 * x. So, over a year, that would be 12 * (420 * x) = 5040x.\n\nThe profit is revenue minus production cost. They want the profit to be at least $626,400. So, the equation would be:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n626,400 \u2264 5040x - 554,400\n\nWait, I think that's correct. So, let's rearrange this inequality to solve for x. \n\nAdding 554,400 to both sides:\n\n626,400 + 554,400 \u2264 5040x\n\nLet me add those numbers. 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see: 600k + 500k is 1.1 million. Then, 26,400 + 54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So,\n\n1,180,800 \u2264 5040x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to find x:\n\nx \u2265 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me see. 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Subtracting that from 1,180,800 gives 172,800. Now, 5040 * 34 is 171,360 (because 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160; adding gives 171,360). Adding 34 to 200 gives 234. 172,800 -171,360 is 1,440. Now, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440 because 5040 * 1/3 is 1680, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, 1440 /5040 = 0.2857. So, x is approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, wait, that's about 234.29. But the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the calculated minimum price is approximately $234.29. But none of the options are exactly that. The closest higher option is C)240. Because the selling price needs to be at least 234.29 to meet the profit. So, the minimum price from the options that's higher than this is 240. Because if they set the price at 230, which is lower than 234.29, the profit might not meet the target.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the division. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the fraction. Let's see:\n\n1,180,800 / 5040 = ?\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see if 504 divides into 118,080 evenly.\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280 left.\n\n504 * 34 = 17,136. So 200 +34=234, and 17,280 -17,136=144. \n\nNow, 504 goes into 144 how many times? 0.2857 times. So 234.2857.\n\nYes, so x is approximately $234.29. So, the minimum selling price must be at least this amount. Looking at the options, the next higher option is C)240. So that's the minimum price they can set to guarantee the profit. \n\nWait, but is 240 the minimum or is there a lower option that's still higher than 234.29? The options are 226, 230, 240, etc. 230 is lower than 234.29, so that won't work. So 240 is the next possible option. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I calculate the total correctly? Let's recheck the numbers.\n\nTotal units per year: 420/month *12 months = 5040 units. Correct.\n\nProduction cost per unit: $110. So total cost: 5040 *110= 554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit: $626,400.\n\nSo, revenue needed is 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is 5040 * x. So, x=1,180,800/5040= 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nSo, the selling price must be at least $234.29. The options are A)226 (too low), B)230 (also too low), C)240 (which is above), so 240 is the minimum among the options that will guarantee the profit.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If the company sells at 240, how much profit would they make? Let me compute that to confirm.\n\nRevenue would be 5040 *240. Let me calculate that: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*40=201,600. So total revenue is 1,209,600.\n\nProduction cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So that's good.\n\nIf they set the price at 230, revenue would be 5040*230. Let's see: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*30=151,200. So total 1,159,200. Profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800, which is less than 626,400. So 230 is too low.\n\nSo the minimum price must be higher than 234.29, so the smallest option provided that's higher is 240, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company producing computer components. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures a yearly profit of at least $626,400. \n\nAlright, first, let's break down the information given. The company produces 420 units every month. So, per year, that's 420 multiplied by 12 months. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Let's see, 420 times 10 is 4200, and 420 times 2 is 840, so adding those gives 5040 units per year. \n\nThe production cost is $110 per component. So, the total production cost for the year would be 5040 units multiplied by $110 each. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute that. 5040 * 110. Wait, 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. So adding those together gives 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company sells all of the components each month, so their revenue each month is the selling price per component multiplied by 420 units. But since we're looking at the yearly profit, I should probably consider the annual revenue. Let me denote the selling price per component as 'x'. Then, the revenue per month is 420 * x. So, over a year, that would be 12 * (420 * x) = 5040x.\n\nThe profit is revenue minus production cost. They want the profit to be at least $626,400. So, the equation would be:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n626,400 \u2264 5040x - 554,400\n\nWait, I think that's correct. So, let's rearrange this inequality to solve for x. \n\nAdding 554,400 to both sides:\n\n626,400 + 554,400 \u2264 5040x\n\nLet me add those numbers. 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see: 600k + 500k is 1.1 million. Then, 26,400 + 54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So,\n\n1,180,800 \u2264 5040x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to find x:\n\nx \u2265 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that division. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me see. 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. Subtracting that from 1,180,800 gives 172,800. Now, 5040 * 34 is 171,360 (because 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160; adding gives 171,360). Adding 34 to 200 gives 234. 172,800 -171,360 is 1,440. Now, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1440 because 5040 * 1/3 is 1680, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, 1440 /5040 = 0.2857. So, x is approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, wait, that's about 234.29. But the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the calculated minimum price is approximately $234.29. But none of the options are exactly that. The closest higher option is C)240. Because the selling price needs to be at least 234.29 to meet the profit. So, the minimum price from the options that's higher than this is 240. Because if they set the price at 230, which is lower than 234.29, the profit might not meet the target.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the division. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simplify the fraction. Let's see:\n\n1,180,800 / 5040 = ?\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see if 504 divides into 118,080 evenly.\n\n504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 17,280 left.\n\n504 * 34 = 17,136. So 200 +34=234, and 17,280 -17,136=144. \n\nNow, 504 goes into 144 how many times? 0.2857 times. So 234.2857.\n\nYes, so x is approximately $234.29. So, the minimum selling price must be at least this amount. Looking at the options, the next higher option is C)240. So that's the minimum price they can set to guarantee the profit. \n\nWait, but is 240 the minimum or is there a lower option that's still higher than 234.29? The options are 226, 230, 240, etc. 230 is lower than 234.29, so that won't work. So 240 is the next possible option. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I calculate the total correctly? Let's recheck the numbers.\n\nTotal units per year: 420/month *12 months = 5040 units. Correct.\n\nProduction cost per unit: $110. So total cost: 5040 *110= 554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit: $626,400.\n\nSo, revenue needed is 554,400 +626,400= 1,180,800.\n\nRevenue is 5040 * x. So, x=1,180,800/5040= 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nSo, the selling price must be at least $234.29. The options are A)226 (too low), B)230 (also too low), C)240 (which is above), so 240 is the minimum among the options that will guarantee the profit.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. If the company sells at 240, how much profit would they make? Let me compute that to confirm.\n\nRevenue would be 5040 *240. Let me calculate that: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*40=201,600. So total revenue is 1,209,600.\n\nProduction cost is 554,400. So profit is 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So that's good.\n\nIf they set the price at 230, revenue would be 5040*230. Let's see: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*30=151,200. So total 1,159,200. Profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800, which is less than 626,400. So 230 is too low.\n\nSo the minimum price must be higher than 234.29, so the smallest option provided that's higher is 240, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total units produced, production costs, and required revenue.\n\n1. **Total Units Produced per Year**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month. Over a year, this is:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost per Year**:  \n   The production cost is $110 per unit. Thus, the total cost for the year is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Required Revenue for Desired Profit**:  \n   The company aims for a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production cost. Therefore, the required revenue is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Production Cost} = 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Minimum Selling Price per Unit**:  \n   The revenue is also given by the selling price per unit (\\(x\\)) multiplied by the total number of units sold:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times x.\n   \\]  \n   Setting this equal to the required revenue:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times x = 1,180,800.\n   \\]  \n   Solving for \\(x\\):  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29.\n   \\]  \n   Thus, the minimum selling price per unit must be at least $234.29.\n\n5. **Selecting the Minimum Selling Price from Options**:  \n   Among the given options (A) $226, (B) $230, (C) $240, (D) $260, (E) $280), the smallest value greater than $234.29 is $240. Setting the price at $240 ensures the required profit, while lower prices like $226 or $230 would result in insufficient revenue.\n\n6. **Verification**:  \n   - At $240 per unit, the revenue is:  \n     \\[\n     5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n     The profit is:  \n     \\[\n     1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{dollars},\n     \\]  \n     which exceeds the target profit of $626,400.  \n   - At $230 per unit, the revenue is:  \n     \\[\n     5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n     \\]  \n     The profit is:  \n     \\[\n     1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{dollars},\n     \\]  \n     which is less than the target profit.  \n\nThus, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired profit is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the company produces 420 units every month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They want to make sure their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, I need to find the minimum selling price per component.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out the total production cost per month. Oh right, that's 420 units multiplied by $110 each. Let me calculate that. 420 times 110. Hmm, 400 times 110 is 44,000, and 20 times 110 is 2,200. So adding those together, 44,000 + 2,200 is 46,200. So each month, the company spends $46,200 on production.\n\nNow, what about revenue? Revenue is the total money made from sales. Since they sell all 420 units each month, their revenue per month is 420 times the selling price per unit, which I'll call 'p'. So revenue per month is 420p.\n\nWait, but the profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So profit per month is (420p) minus (46,200). And since we're looking at the yearly profit, I need to multiply this monthly profit by 12.\n\nThe desired yearly profit is $626,400. So the equation would be 12 times (420p - 46,200) equals at least 626,400. Let me write that down: 12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400.\n\nLet me simplify this equation. First, expand the left side. 12*420p is 5040p, and 12*46200 is... Hmm, 46200 times 12. Let me calculate that. 46200 *10 is 462,000. 46200*2 is 92,400. So adding them together, 462,000 +92,400 = 554,400. So the equation becomes 5040p -554400 >=626400.\n\nNow, I'll bring the 554400 to the other side. So, 5040p >=626400 +554400. Let's add those two numbers. 626,400 +554,400. Hmm, 600,000 +500,000 is 1,100,000. Then 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So 5040p >=1,180,800.\n\nTo find p, I'll divide both sides by 5040. So p >= 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800? Let me see, 5040 *30 is 151,200. Subtract that: 172,800 -151,200 =21,600. 5040 *4 is 20,160. So 30+4=34, with 1,440 remaining. 5040 *0.2857 is about 1440, because 5040 *0.25 is 1260, and 5040*0.0347 is about 175. So around 34.2857.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. 5040 * 234 = 5040*(200+34) = 1,008,000 + (5040*34). Let's calculate 5040*34. 5000*34=170,000, and 40*34=1,360. So total 171,360. So 5040 *234=1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360. The remaining is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 =1,440. Now, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440 because 5040*(1/7) is about 720, so 1/3 is 1680, but perhaps I should compute 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So p is 234 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29. But since the price has to be a whole dollar amount and they can't sell at a fraction, the next whole number is $235. But looking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, none of the options are exactly 234.29, but the closest higher option is C)240. But wait, let me check if 230 is enough. Let me compute the profit with p=230.\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck the math.\n\nWait, 12*(420p -46200) >=626400.\n\nSo 420p -46200 >=626400 /12.\n\nWhat's 626400 divided by 12? Let me calculate that. 626400 /12: 12*50,000=600,000. 26,400 /12 is 2,200. So total is 50,000 +2,200 =52,200. So 420p -46200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420p >=52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo p >=98,400 /420. Let me compute that. 98,400 divided by 420. Hmm, 420*200=84,000. So 98,400-84,000=14,400. 420*34=14,280. So 200+34=234. 14,400-14,280=120. 420*0.2857=120. So 234.2857. So p must be at least $234.2857, so $235.\n\nBut the options don't have 235. The closest higher is 240, but let me check if 230 is enough. Let's see.\n\nIf p=230, then 420*230=96,600. Subtract production cost 46,200: profit per month is 96,600-46,200=50,400. Yearly profit is 50,400 *12=604,800. But desired is 626,400. So 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nNext option is 240. Let's compute. 420*240=100,800. Minus 46,200 is 54,600 per month. 54,600 *12=655,200. That's more than 626,400. So the minimum p is 240.\n\nWait, but wait, let me see if 234.2857 is the exact point. So the options are 230, 240, etc. So 230 is too low, 240 is the next possible. Therefore, the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the company produces 420 units every month, and each unit costs them $110 to produce. They want to make sure their yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, I need to find the minimum selling price per component.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out the total production cost per month. Oh right, that's 420 units multiplied by $110 each. Let me calculate that. 420 times 110. Hmm, 400 times 110 is 44,000, and 20 times 110 is 2,200. So adding those together, 44,000 + 2,200 is 46,200. So each month, the company spends $46,200 on production.\n\nNow, what about revenue? Revenue is the total money made from sales. Since they sell all 420 units each month, their revenue per month is 420 times the selling price per unit, which I'll call 'p'. So revenue per month is 420p.\n\nWait, but the profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So profit per month is (420p) minus (46,200). And since we're looking at the yearly profit, I need to multiply this monthly profit by 12.\n\nThe desired yearly profit is $626,400. So the equation would be 12 times (420p - 46,200) equals at least 626,400. Let me write that down: 12*(420p - 46200) >= 626400.\n\nLet me simplify this equation. First, expand the left side. 12*420p is 5040p, and 12*46200 is... Hmm, 46200 times 12. Let me calculate that. 46200 *10 is 462,000. 46200*2 is 92,400. So adding them together, 462,000 +92,400 = 554,400. So the equation becomes 5040p -554400 >=626400.\n\nNow, I'll bring the 554400 to the other side. So, 5040p >=626400 +554400. Let's add those two numbers. 626,400 +554,400. Hmm, 600,000 +500,000 is 1,100,000. Then 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So 5040p >=1,180,800.\n\nTo find p, I'll divide both sides by 5040. So p >= 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 is 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, how many times does 5040 go into 172,800? Let me see, 5040 *30 is 151,200. Subtract that: 172,800 -151,200 =21,600. 5040 *4 is 20,160. So 30+4=34, with 1,440 remaining. 5040 *0.2857 is about 1440, because 5040 *0.25 is 1260, and 5040*0.0347 is about 175. So around 34.2857.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. 5040 * 234 = 5040*(200+34) = 1,008,000 + (5040*34). Let's calculate 5040*34. 5000*34=170,000, and 40*34=1,360. So total 171,360. So 5040 *234=1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360. The remaining is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 =1,440. Now, 5040 * 0.2857 is about 1,440 because 5040*(1/7) is about 720, so 1/3 is 1680, but perhaps I should compute 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So p is 234 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least approximately $234.29. But since the price has to be a whole dollar amount and they can't sell at a fraction, the next whole number is $235. But looking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, none of the options are exactly 234.29, but the closest higher option is C)240. But wait, let me check if 230 is enough. Let me compute the profit with p=230.\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck the math.\n\nWait, 12*(420p -46200) >=626400.\n\nSo 420p -46200 >=626400 /12.\n\nWhat's 626400 divided by 12? Let me calculate that. 626400 /12: 12*50,000=600,000. 26,400 /12 is 2,200. So total is 50,000 +2,200 =52,200. So 420p -46200 >=52,200.\n\nSo 420p >=52,200 +46,200 =98,400.\n\nSo p >=98,400 /420. Let me compute that. 98,400 divided by 420. Hmm, 420*200=84,000. So 98,400-84,000=14,400. 420*34=14,280. So 200+34=234. 14,400-14,280=120. 420*0.2857=120. So 234.2857. So p must be at least $234.2857, so $235.\n\nBut the options don't have 235. The closest higher is 240, but let me check if 230 is enough. Let's see.\n\nIf p=230, then 420*230=96,600. Subtract production cost 46,200: profit per month is 96,600-46,200=50,400. Yearly profit is 50,400 *12=604,800. But desired is 626,400. So 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nNext option is 240. Let's compute. 420*240=100,800. Minus 46,200 is 54,600 per month. 54,600 *12=655,200. That's more than 626,400. So the minimum p is 240.\n\nWait, but wait, let me see if 234.2857 is the exact point. So the options are 230, 240, etc. So 230 is too low, 240 is the next possible. Therefore, the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the monthly production cost and revenue. The company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit, so the monthly production cost is:\n\n\\[\n420 \\times 110 = 46,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe revenue per month is the selling price per unit (\\(p\\)) multiplied by the number of units sold:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue per month} = 420p.\n\\]\n\nThe profit per month is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit per month} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Production Cost} = 420p - 46,200.\n\\]\n\nFor the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, the monthly profit must satisfy:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times (420p - 46,200) \\geq 626,400.\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n5040p - 554,400 \\geq 626,400.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5040p \\geq 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\\]\n\n\\[\np \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} \\approx 234.29.\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price must be a whole dollar amount, the minimum price is $235.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that a company should set to guarantee a certain yearly profit. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, which I think is 12 months, that would be 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so adding them together gives 5040 units per year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost each month is 420 units times $110 each. Let me compute that. 420 * 110. Hmm, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So adding those gives 46,200 per month. Then, for the year, that's 46,200 multiplied by 12. Let's see, 46,200 * 12. Breaking it down: 40,000 *12 is 480,000, 6,200*12 is 74,400. Adding those gives 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the revenue needs to be enough to cover the costs and give the desired profit. Let's denote the selling price per component as 'p'. Then, the total revenue for the year would be 5040 units * p.\n\nSo, the equation for profit would be: Revenue - Costs >= Desired Profit. Plugging in the numbers:\n\n(5040 * p) - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nI need to solve for p. Let's rearrange the equation. \n\n5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400.\n\nAdding those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let me do that. 600k + 500k is 1.1 million, 26,400 + 54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, solving for p: p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me try dividing.\n\nFirst, I can simplify the division. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by 10: 5040 becomes 504, 1,180,800 becomes 118,080.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor it differently. Alternatively, let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this division. Let's see, 5040 is 504 * 10, so 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is the same as (1,180,800 / 10) / 504 = 118,080 / 504.\n\nNow, let me compute 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by a common factor. Let me see, 504 is 7*72, or 8*63, or 12*42. Let me see what 504 and 118080 have in common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform the division step by step. Let me try.\n\n504 * 200 is 100,800. 504 * 230 is 504*(200+30) = 100,800 + 15,120 = 115,920. Hmm, 115,920 is less than 118,080.\n\nThe difference is 118,080 - 115,920 = 2,160.\n\nSo, 504 * 230 is 115,920. Now, how much more do I need to add to 230 to get the remaining 2,160?\n\nEach 1 in the multiplier adds 504. So, 2,160 / 504 = ?\n\n504*4=2016, which is 4*504=2016. 2016 is less than 2160. The difference is 2160-2016=144. So, 4 gives 2016, leaving 144. 504 goes into 144 about 0.2857 times. So, 4.2857? Wait, but maybe I should think of it as fractions.\n\nWait, 2,160 \u00f7 504. Let me see: 504 * 4 = 2016. So, 2016 is 4 *504. So 2,160 is 4 *504 + 144. Then, 144 is 504 * (144/504) = (144 \u00f7 504) = 12/42 = 2/7 \u2248 0.2857. So, total is 4 + 0.2857 = 4.2857. So, 230 + 4.2857 is about 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait: Wait, 504 *234.2857 is 504 *230 +504*4.2857.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 118080 \u00f7 504. Let me try another approach.\n\n504 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\nLet me compute 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800.\n\n504 \u00d734 = ?\n\n504 \u00d7 30 = 15,120.\n\n504 \u00d74 = 2,016.\n\nSo, 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136.\n\nAdding to 100,800: 100,800 +17,136 = 117,936.\n\nBut our numerator is 118,080. So 118,080 - 117,936 = 144.\n\nSo, 504 \u00d7234 = 117,936. Now, 144 is what's left. So, 144 /504 = 12/42 = 2/7, which is approximately 0.2857. So, the division is 234 + 144/504 = 234.2857.\n\nSo, 118080 /504 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, so p must be at least 234.2857. But since the price is in dollars and probably in whole numbers, they'll need to set it at the next whole number, which is 235. But looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280. So none is 235. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial calculations. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the total units per year are 420 *12 = 5040. Correct.\n\nTotal cost per year is 420 *110 *12 = 420 * 1320.\n\nWait, wait, no: 420 units per month, each at $110. So per month cost is 420 *110 = 46,200. So per year, 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So revenue must be 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue is 5040 * p >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 directly.\n\nLet me see: 5040 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\n5040 *200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040*34 = let's compute 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nAdding to 1,008,000: 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360.\n\nBut 1,179,360 is less than 1,180,800. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo, 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360.\n\nNow, 1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857. So p must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher number is 230, but 230 is lower than 234.29, so that's not enough. Wait, but the options don't have 234. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo, 234.29 is higher than 230. So, 230 won't be enough. The next option is C)240. Let's see, if p is 240, what is the profit?\n\nCompute revenue: 5040 *240. Let's calculate that. 5040 *200=1,008,000, 5040*40=201,600. Total is 1,209,600.\n\nProfit = 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So 240 would work.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the minimum price that guarantees the profit. So perhaps 230 is not enough. Let me compute for 230.\n\nRevenue at 230: 5040 *230 = ?\n\nCompute 5040*200=1,008,000, 5040*30=151,200. Sum is 1,159,200.\n\nProfit is 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 gives a lower profit, not enough. So the next option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I can try 234.29. But since the options don't have that, the next possible option is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated earlier steps. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says that the company sells all components by the end of each month. So perhaps the profit is calculated on a monthly basis, but no, the question asks for yearly profit. So the way I approached it is correct.\n\nSo, the minimum p is approximately $234.29. So among the options, the next higher is 240.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: perhaps I should not have considered the year as 12 months, but perhaps the company operates for 12 months, so 12 times the monthly production. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the total cost calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nEach month, they make 420 units, each costing $110. So per month, 420 * 110 = 46,200. So per year, 46,200 *12= 554,400. Correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Thus, the minimum price is about $234.29, which isn't an option, so the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with 234.29. Let me compute 5040 *234.29. Let me see, 5040*234 = 1,179,360, and 5040 *0.29= approx 5040*0.3=1512, but 0.29 is 1512 - (5040 *0.01)=1512-50.4=1461.6. So 1,179,360 + 1,461.6= 1,180,821.6. Which is just over the required 1,180,800. So yes, 234.29 would work, but the options don't have that. So the next possible is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So p is 234.2857. So, approximately 234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have 234. So the next higher is 240. So the minimum selling price that meets the requirement is 240, which is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that a company should set to guarantee a certain yearly profit. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, which I think is 12 months, that would be 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so adding them together gives 5040 units per year.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost each month is 420 units times $110 each. Let me compute that. 420 * 110. Hmm, 400*110 is 44,000, and 20*110 is 2,200. So adding those gives 46,200 per month. Then, for the year, that's 46,200 multiplied by 12. Let's see, 46,200 * 12. Breaking it down: 40,000 *12 is 480,000, 6,200*12 is 74,400. Adding those gives 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs. So, the revenue needs to be enough to cover the costs and give the desired profit. Let's denote the selling price per component as 'p'. Then, the total revenue for the year would be 5040 units * p.\n\nSo, the equation for profit would be: Revenue - Costs >= Desired Profit. Plugging in the numbers:\n\n(5040 * p) - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nI need to solve for p. Let's rearrange the equation. \n\n5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400.\n\nAdding those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let me do that. 600k + 500k is 1.1 million, 26,400 + 54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So,\n\n5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, solving for p: p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me calculate that. Hmm, 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Let me try dividing.\n\nFirst, I can simplify the division. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by 10: 5040 becomes 504, 1,180,800 becomes 118,080.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor it differently. Alternatively, let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this division. Let's see, 5040 is 504 * 10, so 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is the same as (1,180,800 / 10) / 504 = 118,080 / 504.\n\nNow, let me compute 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can simplify this by dividing numerator and denominator by a common factor. Let me see, 504 is 7*72, or 8*63, or 12*42. Let me see what 504 and 118080 have in common. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can perform the division step by step. Let me try.\n\n504 * 200 is 100,800. 504 * 230 is 504*(200+30) = 100,800 + 15,120 = 115,920. Hmm, 115,920 is less than 118,080.\n\nThe difference is 118,080 - 115,920 = 2,160.\n\nSo, 504 * 230 is 115,920. Now, how much more do I need to add to 230 to get the remaining 2,160?\n\nEach 1 in the multiplier adds 504. So, 2,160 / 504 = ?\n\n504*4=2016, which is 4*504=2016. 2016 is less than 2160. The difference is 2160-2016=144. So, 4 gives 2016, leaving 144. 504 goes into 144 about 0.2857 times. So, 4.2857? Wait, but maybe I should think of it as fractions.\n\nWait, 2,160 \u00f7 504. Let me see: 504 * 4 = 2016. So, 2016 is 4 *504. So 2,160 is 4 *504 + 144. Then, 144 is 504 * (144/504) = (144 \u00f7 504) = 12/42 = 2/7 \u2248 0.2857. So, total is 4 + 0.2857 = 4.2857. So, 230 + 4.2857 is about 234.2857.\n\nWait, but wait: Wait, 504 *234.2857 is 504 *230 +504*4.2857.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 118080 \u00f7 504. Let me try another approach.\n\n504 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\nLet me compute 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800.\n\n504 \u00d734 = ?\n\n504 \u00d7 30 = 15,120.\n\n504 \u00d74 = 2,016.\n\nSo, 15,120 + 2,016 = 17,136.\n\nAdding to 100,800: 100,800 +17,136 = 117,936.\n\nBut our numerator is 118,080. So 118,080 - 117,936 = 144.\n\nSo, 504 \u00d7234 = 117,936. Now, 144 is what's left. So, 144 /504 = 12/42 = 2/7, which is approximately 0.2857. So, the division is 234 + 144/504 = 234.2857.\n\nSo, 118080 /504 = 234.2857.\n\nWait, so p must be at least 234.2857. But since the price is in dollars and probably in whole numbers, they'll need to set it at the next whole number, which is 235. But looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280. So none is 235. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial calculations. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the total units per year are 420 *12 = 5040. Correct.\n\nTotal cost per year is 420 *110 *12 = 420 * 1320.\n\nWait, wait, no: 420 units per month, each at $110. So per month cost is 420 *110 = 46,200. So per year, 46,200 *12 = 554,400. Correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So revenue must be 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800. Correct.\n\nSo revenue is 5040 * p >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 directly.\n\nLet me see: 5040 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\n5040 *200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040*34 = let's compute 5040*30=151,200 and 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nAdding to 1,008,000: 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360.\n\nBut 1,179,360 is less than 1,180,800. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nSo, 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360.\n\nNow, 1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857.\n\nSo, 234 + 0.2857 = 234.2857. So p must be at least approximately $234.29.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest higher number is 230, but 230 is lower than 234.29, so that's not enough. Wait, but the options don't have 234. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo, 234.29 is higher than 230. So, 230 won't be enough. The next option is C)240. Let's see, if p is 240, what is the profit?\n\nCompute revenue: 5040 *240. Let's calculate that. 5040 *200=1,008,000, 5040*40=201,600. Total is 1,209,600.\n\nProfit = 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So 240 would work.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the minimum price that guarantees the profit. So perhaps 230 is not enough. Let me compute for 230.\n\nRevenue at 230: 5040 *230 = ?\n\nCompute 5040*200=1,008,000, 5040*30=151,200. Sum is 1,159,200.\n\nProfit is 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 gives a lower profit, not enough. So the next option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I can try 234.29. But since the options don't have that, the next possible option is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated earlier steps. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says that the company sells all components by the end of each month. So perhaps the profit is calculated on a monthly basis, but no, the question asks for yearly profit. So the way I approached it is correct.\n\nSo, the minimum p is approximately $234.29. So among the options, the next higher is 240.\n\nWait, but wait another thought: perhaps I should not have considered the year as 12 months, but perhaps the company operates for 12 months, so 12 times the monthly production. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the total cost calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nEach month, they make 420 units, each costing $110. So per month, 420 * 110 = 46,200. So per year, 46,200 *12= 554,400. Correct.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Thus, the minimum price is about $234.29, which isn't an option, so the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with 234.29. Let me compute 5040 *234.29. Let me see, 5040*234 = 1,179,360, and 5040 *0.29= approx 5040*0.3=1512, but 0.29 is 1512 - (5040 *0.01)=1512-50.4=1461.6. So 1,179,360 + 1,461.6= 1,180,821.6. Which is just over the required 1,180,800. So yes, 234.29 would work, but the options don't have that. So the next possible is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040 more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 234 = 1,179,360. So 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857. So p is 234.2857. So, approximately 234.29.\n\nBut the options don't have 234. So the next higher is 240. So the minimum selling price that meets the requirement is 240, which is option C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue required.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Total Units Produced per Year**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component each month. The production cost per component is $110. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nHmm, profit is revenue minus costs. So I need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total production cost to get the profit. Then set that to be at least $626,400 and solve for the price.\n\nWait, let me break it down. First, let's think about the numbers involved.\n\nThey produce 420 units each month. So in a year, that's 12 months multiplied by 420. Let me compute that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so 4800+240=5040 units per year. Got it.\n\nThe production cost per unit is $110. So the total cost per year would be 5040 * 110. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 110 is 550,000, and 40 * 110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400 dollars. Okay, so the company spends $554,400 each year on production.\n\nThe revenue comes from selling all these units. Let's say the selling price per unit is 'p' dollars. So the total revenue is 5040 * p.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so profit = 5040p - 554,400. We need this profit to be at least $626,400. So, set up the inequality:\n\n5040p - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nNow, I need to solve for p.\n\nAdding 554,400 to both sides:\n\n5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400.\n\nWhat's 626,400 + 554,400? Let's calculate:\n\n626,400 + 554,400. 626k +554k is 1,180,800. Wait, 626,400 + 554,400. Let me do it step by step. 600k +500k=1.1M, 26,400 +54,400=80,800. So total is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to find p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nFirst, maybe simplify the division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 goes into 118,080 how many times?\n\nWait, 504 * 200 is 100,800. So 200 times is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080, we have 17,280 left.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504*30=15,120, and 504*4=2,016. 15,120 +2,016=17,136.\n\nSo 34 would give 17,136. So 200+34=234. But wait, 17,136 + 504=17,640, which is more than 17,280. So maybe 34 is the correct next step.\n\nWait, no, 504*34=17,136. So 17,280 -17,136=144. So that's 34 times, with 144 remaining.\n\nWait, but 144 is exactly 504*(144/504) = 144/504 = 0.2857... So approximately 0.2857 more. So 34.2857.\n\nSo p >= 234.2857...\n\nSo approximately $234.29. But since the options are all whole numbers, and we need the minimum price to guarantee the profit, we'd need to round up to the next whole dollar. Because if you set p at 234, then the profit might not be enough. But 234.2857 is approximately 234.29, so 234.29. So the next whole number is 235. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280.\n\nHmm, wait a second, none of the options are 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial numbers. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the company produces 420 units per month, so 420 * 12 is 5040 per year. Correct.\n\nProduction cost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 *110= 554,400. Correct.\n\nRevenue is 5040 * p. Profit is revenue minus cost, so 5040p -554,400. That must be >= 626,400.\n\nSo, 5040p >= 626,400 +554,400=1,180,800.\n\np >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute this division differently. Let me try.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 200 is 100,800. 118,080 -100,800=17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 17,136. So 17,280-17,136=144.\n\n144 is 504*(144/504)= (144 \u00f7 504) = 0.2857.\n\nSo 200 +34=234, plus 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least 234.2857. So the minimum integer p is 235. But the options don't have 235. Wait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, none of these. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the initial equation. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the total units or cost.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute the required profit per unit, then add that to the cost per unit to get the selling price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute per month and then annualize.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the required monthly profit and then multiply by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe company makes a profit each month, which is (price - cost) * units sold.\n\nSo per month, the profit is (p -110) *420.\n\nThe total yearly profit is 12*(p-110)*420.\n\nWe need this to be >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*(p-110)*420 >=626,400.\n\nCompute the left side: 12 *420=5040.\n\nSo 5040*(p-110)>=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\np-110 >=626,400/5040.\n\nCompute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nHmm, 5040 goes into 626400 how many times?\n\nLet me compute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\n5040 * 100=504,000.\n\n626,400-504,000=122,400.\n\n5040 *24= 120,960. Because 5040*20=100,800; 5040*4=20,160. So 100,800+20,160=120,960.\n\nSo 100+24=124. 122,400-120,960=1,440.\n\n5040 goes into 1,440 0.2857 times (since 1,440/5040= 0.2857).\n\nSo total is 124.2857.\n\nSo p-110 >=124.2857.\n\nSo p >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before. So p must be at least approximately $234.29. So the minimum price would be $235, but since the options don't have 235, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated as revenue minus cost, which is correct. So perhaps I'm correct in the approach.\n\nBut the options don't include 235. Let's see the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the next possible higher option is C)240. But let me check what the profit would be at 230.\n\nIf p is 230, then:\n\nTotal revenue per year: 5040 *230.\n\nCompute that: 5000*230=1,150,000; 40*230=9,200. So total is 1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost: 554,400.\n\nProfit: 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800.\n\nBut 604,800 is less than the required 626,400. So 230 is not enough.\n\nWhat about 240?\n\n5040 *240= 1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So 240 would give a profit of 655,200, which is sufficient.\n\nBut is there a lower option that could work? The next option below 240 is 230, which we saw gives 604,800, which is less than required. So 230 is too low, 240 is sufficient.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.2857, but since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240. So the correct answer would be C)240.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me re-express the problem again. Maybe I should calculate per unit, not per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the per-unit profit needed. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the required total profit per year: $626,400.\n\nTotal units per year:5040.\n\nSo per unit, the profit needed is 626,400 /5040 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10:62,640 \u00f7504.\n\n504 *124 = 504*120=60,480; 504*4=2,016. So 60,480+2,016=62,496.\n\n62,640-62,496=144.\n\nSo 124 + (144/504) = 124 + 0.2857 = 124.2857.\n\nSo per unit, the profit must be at least 124.2857.\n\nSince profit per unit is (p - cost per unit), which is (p -110).\n\nSo p-110 >=124.2857.\n\np >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result again.\n\nSo the minimum p is approximately 234.29, but since the options don't have that, we have to choose the next higher option, which is 240 (option C).\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit...\". So perhaps I should consider that the price must be such that when multiplied by 5040, gives a revenue that minus 554,400 is at least 626,400.\n\nBut perhaps I should look at the options and see which is the smallest p that when multiplied by 5040 and subtracted by 554,400 is >=626,400.\n\nSo let me compute for each option:\n\nOption B)230:\n\nRevenue:5040 *230=1,159,200.\n\nProfit:1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. Which is less than 626,400.\n\nOption C)240:\n\nRevenue:5040*240=1,209,600.\n\nProfit:1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo the minimum p is 240, as 230 doesn't cut it.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.\n\nThe company produces 420 units of a computer component each month. The production cost per component is $110. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the yearly profit is at least $626,400.\n\nHmm, profit is revenue minus costs. So I need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total production cost to get the profit. Then set that to be at least $626,400 and solve for the price.\n\nWait, let me break it down. First, let's think about the numbers involved.\n\nThey produce 420 units each month. So in a year, that's 12 months multiplied by 420. Let me compute that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so 4800+240=5040 units per year. Got it.\n\nThe production cost per unit is $110. So the total cost per year would be 5040 * 110. Let me calculate that. 5000 * 110 is 550,000, and 40 * 110 is 4,400. So total is 550,000 + 4,400 = 554,400 dollars. Okay, so the company spends $554,400 each year on production.\n\nThe revenue comes from selling all these units. Let's say the selling price per unit is 'p' dollars. So the total revenue is 5040 * p.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so profit = 5040p - 554,400. We need this profit to be at least $626,400. So, set up the inequality:\n\n5040p - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nNow, I need to solve for p.\n\nAdding 554,400 to both sides:\n\n5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400.\n\nWhat's 626,400 + 554,400? Let's calculate:\n\n626,400 + 554,400. 626k +554k is 1,180,800. Wait, 626,400 + 554,400. Let me do it step by step. 600k +500k=1.1M, 26,400 +54,400=80,800. So total is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5040 to find p.\n\np >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that. Hmm, 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nFirst, maybe simplify the division. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 goes into 118,080 how many times?\n\nWait, 504 * 200 is 100,800. So 200 times is 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080, we have 17,280 left.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 17,136. Because 504*30=15,120, and 504*4=2,016. 15,120 +2,016=17,136.\n\nSo 34 would give 17,136. So 200+34=234. But wait, 17,136 + 504=17,640, which is more than 17,280. So maybe 34 is the correct next step.\n\nWait, no, 504*34=17,136. So 17,280 -17,136=144. So that's 34 times, with 144 remaining.\n\nWait, but 144 is exactly 504*(144/504) = 144/504 = 0.2857... So approximately 0.2857 more. So 34.2857.\n\nSo p >= 234.2857...\n\nSo approximately $234.29. But since the options are all whole numbers, and we need the minimum price to guarantee the profit, we'd need to round up to the next whole dollar. Because if you set p at 234, then the profit might not be enough. But 234.2857 is approximately 234.29, so 234.29. So the next whole number is 235. But wait, looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280.\n\nHmm, wait a second, none of the options are 235. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the initial numbers. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the company produces 420 units per month, so 420 * 12 is 5040 per year. Correct.\n\nProduction cost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 *110= 554,400. Correct.\n\nRevenue is 5040 * p. Profit is revenue minus cost, so 5040p -554,400. That must be >= 626,400.\n\nSo, 5040p >= 626,400 +554,400=1,180,800.\n\np >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute this division differently. Let me try.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, 504 * 200 is 100,800. 118,080 -100,800=17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 17,136. So 17,280-17,136=144.\n\n144 is 504*(144/504)= (144 \u00f7 504) = 0.2857.\n\nSo 200 +34=234, plus 0.2857, so 234.2857.\n\nSo p must be at least 234.2857. So the minimum integer p is 235. But the options don't have 235. Wait, the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nHmm, none of these. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the initial equation. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the total units or cost.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should compute the required profit per unit, then add that to the cost per unit to get the selling price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute per month and then annualize.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the required monthly profit and then multiply by 12. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe company makes a profit each month, which is (price - cost) * units sold.\n\nSo per month, the profit is (p -110) *420.\n\nThe total yearly profit is 12*(p-110)*420.\n\nWe need this to be >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*(p-110)*420 >=626,400.\n\nCompute the left side: 12 *420=5040.\n\nSo 5040*(p-110)>=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\np-110 >=626,400/5040.\n\nCompute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nHmm, 5040 goes into 626400 how many times?\n\nLet me compute 626,400 \u00f75040.\n\n5040 * 100=504,000.\n\n626,400-504,000=122,400.\n\n5040 *24= 120,960. Because 5040*20=100,800; 5040*4=20,160. So 100,800+20,160=120,960.\n\nSo 100+24=124. 122,400-120,960=1,440.\n\n5040 goes into 1,440 0.2857 times (since 1,440/5040= 0.2857).\n\nSo total is 124.2857.\n\nSo p-110 >=124.2857.\n\nSo p >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result as before. So p must be at least approximately $234.29. So the minimum price would be $235, but since the options don't have 235, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the profit is calculated as revenue minus cost, which is correct. So perhaps I'm correct in the approach.\n\nBut the options don't include 235. Let's see the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the next possible higher option is C)240. But let me check what the profit would be at 230.\n\nIf p is 230, then:\n\nTotal revenue per year: 5040 *230.\n\nCompute that: 5000*230=1,150,000; 40*230=9,200. So total is 1,159,200.\n\nTotal cost: 554,400.\n\nProfit: 1,159,200 -554,400=604,800.\n\nBut 604,800 is less than the required 626,400. So 230 is not enough.\n\nWhat about 240?\n\n5040 *240= 1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400=655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So 240 would give a profit of 655,200, which is sufficient.\n\nBut is there a lower option that could work? The next option below 240 is 230, which we saw gives 604,800, which is less than required. So 230 is too low, 240 is sufficient.\n\nSo the minimum price is 234.2857, but since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240. So the correct answer would be C)240.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me re-express the problem again. Maybe I should calculate per unit, not per year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the per-unit profit needed. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the required total profit per year: $626,400.\n\nTotal units per year:5040.\n\nSo per unit, the profit needed is 626,400 /5040 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n626,400 \u00f75040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10:62,640 \u00f7504.\n\n504 *124 = 504*120=60,480; 504*4=2,016. So 60,480+2,016=62,496.\n\n62,640-62,496=144.\n\nSo 124 + (144/504) = 124 + 0.2857 = 124.2857.\n\nSo per unit, the profit must be at least 124.2857.\n\nSince profit per unit is (p - cost per unit), which is (p -110).\n\nSo p-110 >=124.2857.\n\np >=110 +124.2857=234.2857.\n\nSame result again.\n\nSo the minimum p is approximately 234.29, but since the options don't have that, we have to choose the next higher option, which is 240 (option C).\n\nWait, but wait another thing. The problem says \"minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit...\". So perhaps I should consider that the price must be such that when multiplied by 5040, gives a revenue that minus 554,400 is at least 626,400.\n\nBut perhaps I should look at the options and see which is the smallest p that when multiplied by 5040 and subtracted by 554,400 is >=626,400.\n\nSo let me compute for each option:\n\nOption B)230:\n\nRevenue:5040 *230=1,159,200.\n\nProfit:1,159,200 -554,400=604,800. Which is less than 626,400.\n\nOption C)240:\n\nRevenue:5040*240=1,209,600.\n\nProfit:1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is more than 626,400.\n\nSo the minimum p is 240, as 230 doesn't cut it.\n\nSo the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue.\n\n1. **Total Units Produced per Year**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year:  \n   \\[\n   420 \\, \\text{units/month} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 5040 \\, \\text{units/year}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Production Cost per Year**:  \n   The production cost per unit is $110, so the total cost for 5040 units is:  \n   \\[\n   5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Revenue and Profit**:  \n   Let the selling price per unit be \\( p \\). The total revenue is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times p.\n   \\]  \n   The profit is defined as revenue minus total production cost:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 5040p - 554,400.\n   \\]  \n   To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we set up the inequality:  \n   \\[\n   5040p - 554,400 \\geq 626,400.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( p \\)**:  \n   Rearranging the inequality:  \n   \\[\n   5040p \\geq 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n   \\]  \n   Dividing both sides by 5040:  \n   \\[\n   p \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} = 234.2857.\n   \\]  \n   Since the selling price must be a whole number, the minimum price is $235.\n\n5. **Checking the Options**:  \n   The given options are:  \n   A) 226, B) 230, C) 240, D) 260, E) 280.  \n   None of these options include $235. To verify, we calculate the profit for each option:  \n\n   - **Option B ($230)**:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200.\n     \\]  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{(less than $626,400)}.\n     \\]  \n\n   - **Option C ($240)**:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600.\n     \\]  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit} = 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{(more than $626,400)}.\n     \\]  \n\n   Since $230 is insufficient and $240 guarantees the required profit, the minimum selling price is **$240**.\n\nANSWER: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component that will ensure the company makes a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the company produces 420 units every month. So, over a year, that's 12 months multiplied by 420 units. Let me calculate that: 12 * 420 equals... Hmm, 12 times 400 is 4800, and 12 times 20 is 240, so 4800 + 240 = 5040 units per year. Got that.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So, the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced times the cost per unit. That's 5040 units * $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. Adding them together gives 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So, the required revenue would be the desired profit plus the production costs. Let me add those two: $626,400 + $554,400 equals $1,180,800. So the company needs to make $1,180,800 in revenue for the year.\n\nRevenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. Since they sell all components each month, the total revenue for the year is 5040 units * selling price per unit. Let me denote the selling price as 'p'. So, 5040 * p >= 1,180,800.\n\nTo find the minimum 'p', I can rearrange this inequality: p >= 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me compute that division.\n\nDividing 1,180,800 by 5040. Hmm, perhaps simplifying the numbers. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nWait, 504 is the denominator. Let me see how many times 504 fits into 118080.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor this. Let's compute 5040 * 234. Wait, perhaps another approach: 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234: 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. 5040 * 34 = let's see: 5040 *30=151,200; 5040*4=20,160. So 151,200 +20,160=171,360. Adding to 1,008,000 gives 1,179,360. Hmm, which is less than 1,180,800. The difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440.\n\nNow, 5040 * x = 1,440. So x is 1,440 /5040. Let me compute that: 1,440 \u00f7 5040. Well, 5040 is 7 * 720, 1440 is 2 *720. So 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. So 234 + 0.2857 is approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because 234.2857 is about $234.29 per unit. But looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, etc. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me do that more carefully.\n\nCompute 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nNow, 504 * 200 = 100,800. Subtracting from 118,080: 118,080 -100,800 = 17,280.\n\nNow, 504 * 34 is 504*30=15,120; 504*4=2,016 \u2192 15,120+2,016=17,136. So 34 more gives 17,136. The remaining is 17,280 -17,136 = 144.\n\nSo 200 +34 = 234, with a remainder of 144. Now, 144 divided by 504 is 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo the total is 234.2857. So approximately $234.29 per unit.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 234. The closest higher option is 230, which is lower, so that can't be. Hmm. Wait, no. 234 is higher than 230. So if the required price is ~234.29, the minimum price that guarantees the profit is the smallest value in the options that's higher than or equal to 234.29.\n\nLooking at the options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\n230 is below 234, so not enough. So the next option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait: 234.29 is the minimum. So the selling price has to be at least 234.29. The options are 230, which is less, so it's insufficient. So the next available option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math because I'm getting 234.28, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234.2857: 5040 *234 = let's compute 5040*200=1,008,000; 5040*34=171,360. Total is 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360. Then 5040 *0.2857 is approximately 5040 * (2/7) = 1440. So 1,179,360 +1,440=1,180,800. Exactly the needed revenue. So 234.2857 is the exact price.\n\nBut since you can't sell at a fraction of a dollar (assuming the price is in dollars and whole numbers), the price must be at least $235. However, the options don't include 235. So the next higher option is 240.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if 230 is sufficient. Let me see: 5040 *230 = ?\n\n5040 * 200 = 1,008,000; 5040 *30=151,200. So 1,008,000 +151,200=1,159,200.\n\nSubtracting the production cost: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. That's less than the desired 626,400. So 230 isn't enough.\n\nWhat about 240? Let's compute 5040 *240 = 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040 *40=201,600. Total is 1,209,600.\n\nProfit is 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So 240 is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, is there a lower option than 240 that is still higher than 234.28? The options are 226, 230, 240. 230 is too low, so the next is 240. So the minimum selling price is 240, which is option C.\n",

So, the total production cost for the year would be the number of units produced times the cost per unit. That's 5040 units * $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. Adding them together gives 554,400.

Let me think step by step.\n\nSo, each month, they produce 420 units. Each costs $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 * 110. Let me calculate that: 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So together, that's 46,200 dollars per month. \n\nNow, since there are 12 months in a year, the yearly production cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me compute that. 46,200 times 12. Let's break it down: 40,000 *12 is 480,000, and 6,200*12 is 74,400. Adding those together gives 480,000 +74,400= 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company's revenue comes from selling all 420 units each month. The selling price per unit is what we're trying to find. Let's denote that price as P. So each month, their revenue is 420 * P. \n\nThe profit for each month would be revenue minus production cost. So monthly profit is (420P) - 46,200. Then, the yearly profit would be 12 times that, because each month they make the same amount. \n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total yearly revenue and subtract the total yearly production cost. Let me think. The total revenue per year is 420 units/month * 12 months * P. Because each month they sell 420 units at price P. So 420*12 is 5040 units per year. So revenue is 5040 * P.\n\nYearly profit is revenue minus production cost. So profit = (5040 P) - (554,400). And this profit needs to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n5040 P - 554,400 >= 626,400\n\nNow, solving for P:\n\nAdd 554,400 to both sides:\n\n5040 P >= 626,400 + 554,400\n\n626,400 + 554,400 is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040 P >= 1,180,800\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\nP >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplifying the division. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see. 504 * 200 is 100,800. 504 * 234 is 504*(200+34)=100800 + 504*34.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's do 5040 * 234 = 5040 * 200 + 5040*34.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nAnother way: 5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7 504 = 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nLet me do 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 118,080 \u00f78 =14,760; 504 \u00f78=63.\n\nSo now, 14,760 \u00f763.\n\nHmm, 63 * 234 is 14,742 (since 63*200=12,600; 63*34=2142; 12,600+2142=14,742). \n\nWait, 14,760 minus 14,742 is 18. So 14,760 = 63*234 +18.\n\nSo 14,760 /63= 234 + 18/63 = 234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo P must be at least approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nBut the options are given as integers. So P has to be at least 235? Wait, but the options don't have 235. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, the calculation gave me about 234.29, which is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price is 235, but since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240 (option C). \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, another approach: 5040 P >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo P = 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nCompute 5040 * 234 = 5040 * 200=1,008,000; 5040*34=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360= 1,179,360.\n\nBut 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440. So 5040 * 234 =1,179,360. Then 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440. \n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857... So P=234.2857, which is about 234.29.\n\nSo the minimum price is $234.29 per unit. But since the price must be a whole dollar amount, and the options are given as integers, the next higher integer is 235. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the total revenue and costs. Let me recheck.\n\nThe company sells all 420 units each month, so per year, they sell 420*12=5040 units. Each unit is sold at price P, so revenue is 5040 * P.\n\nTotal cost is production cost, which is 420 units/month * $110/unit *12 months. So 420*110=46,200 per month. 46,200 *12= 554,400 per year.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost: 5040P -554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040P >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo P >= 1,180,800 /5040 = let me compute that again.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*34= 171,360. Total 1,179,360. \n\n1,180,800 - 1,179,360 =1,440.\n\nSo 1,440/5040= 1440 /5040 = 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo P=234.2857. So $234.29 per unit. \n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So the minimum price that's higher than 234.29 is 235. But the options don't have 235. So the next option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check if 234.29 is rounded up to 235, but since 234.29 is approximately 234.3, but in real terms, you can't sell at a fraction. So the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest option is 240. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-calculate 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234.2857=5040*(234 + 2/7)=5040*234 + 5040*(2/7). 5040*(2/7) = 5040/7 *2 = 720 *2=1440. So 5040*234=1,179,360 plus 1440 is 1,180,800. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the price has to be at least $234.2857. So the minimum integer price is $235. But since that's not an option, the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the options again: the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the next possible is 240. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me compute 5040 *230 and see what the profit would be.\n\nIf P=230:\n\nRevenue =5040 *230= Let's compute 5000*230=1,150,000; 40*230=9,200. So total 1,159,200.\n\nProfit = 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. But the required profit is 626,400. So 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 won't do.\n\nSo next, P=235 would give revenue 5040 *235= Let's compute 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*35=176,400. So 1,008,000 +176,400=1,184,400.\n\nProfit=1,184,400 -554,400= 630,000. Which is above 626,400. So P=235 would give a profit of 630,000, which is enough. But the options don't have 235, so the next possible is 240.\n\nLet's check P=240. Revenue is 5040 *240=5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*40=201,600. So total 1,209,600.\n\nProfit=1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is well above 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut since the question is the minimum price, perhaps 234.29 is the exact point. But since the options don't have that, the next possible is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nEach month, the company makes 420 units. Let me compute the monthly profit.\n\nMonthly profit = (Selling price per unit * 420) - (Cost per unit *420) = 420*(P - 110).\n\nYearly profit is 12*420*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*420*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nCompute 12*420=5040. So 5040*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040: (P-110) >=626400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62640 /504.\n\nHmm, 504*124= 504*(120+4)=504*120=60,480; 504*4=2,016. So 60,480+2,016=62,496. \n\nWait, 504*124=62,496. But 62,640 is 62,496 +144.\n\nSo 144/504= 0.2857. So 124.2857.\n\nSo P-110 >=124.2857.\n\nSo P >=110 +124.2857= 234.2857, same as before.\n\nSo yes, same result. So minimum P is approximately $234.29.\n\nSo the options are all higher, but the closest higher option is 240, which is option C. So the answer is C)240.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about a company producing computer components. The company makes 420 units every month, each costing $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of the month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the price per unit such that when they subtract the production costs from the revenue, the total profit for the year is at least $626,400. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total production and costs per month, then per year. Let me think step by step.\n\nSo, each month, they produce 420 units. Each costs $110. So the monthly production cost is 420 * 110. Let me calculate that: 420 * 100 is 42,000, and 420 * 10 is 4,200. So together, that's 46,200 dollars per month. \n\nNow, since there are 12 months in a year, the yearly production cost would be 46,200 * 12. Let me compute that. 46,200 times 12. Let's break it down: 40,000 *12 is 480,000, and 6,200*12 is 74,400. Adding those together gives 480,000 +74,400= 554,400. So the total production cost for the year is $554,400.\n\nThe company's revenue comes from selling all 420 units each month. The selling price per unit is what we're trying to find. Let's denote that price as P. So each month, their revenue is 420 * P. \n\nThe profit for each month would be revenue minus production cost. So monthly profit is (420P) - 46,200. Then, the yearly profit would be 12 times that, because each month they make the same amount. \n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total yearly revenue and subtract the total yearly production cost. Let me think. The total revenue per year is 420 units/month * 12 months * P. Because each month they sell 420 units at price P. So 420*12 is 5040 units per year. So revenue is 5040 * P.\n\nYearly profit is revenue minus production cost. So profit = (5040 P) - (554,400). And this profit needs to be at least $626,400.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n5040 P - 554,400 >= 626,400\n\nNow, solving for P:\n\nAdd 554,400 to both sides:\n\n5040 P >= 626,400 + 554,400\n\n626,400 + 554,400 is 1,180,800.\n\nSo 5040 P >= 1,180,800\n\nDivide both sides by 5040:\n\nP >= 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplifying the division. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's see. 504 * 200 is 100,800. 504 * 234 is 504*(200+34)=100800 + 504*34.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let's do 5040 * 234 = 5040 * 200 + 5040*34.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nAnother way: 5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040 = (1,180,800 \u00f7 10) \u00f7 504 = 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nLet me do 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 118,080 \u00f78 =14,760; 504 \u00f78=63.\n\nSo now, 14,760 \u00f763.\n\nHmm, 63 * 234 is 14,742 (since 63*200=12,600; 63*34=2142; 12,600+2142=14,742). \n\nWait, 14,760 minus 14,742 is 18. So 14,760 = 63*234 +18.\n\nSo 14,760 /63= 234 + 18/63 = 234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo P must be at least approximately 234.2857 dollars.\n\nBut the options are given as integers. So P has to be at least 235? Wait, but the options don't have 235. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, the calculation gave me about 234.29, which is between 230 and 240. So the minimum price is 235, but since the options don't have that, the next higher option is 240 (option C). \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, another approach: 5040 P >= 1,180,800.\n\nSo P = 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nCompute 5040 * 234 = 5040 * 200=1,008,000; 5040*34=171,360. So 1,008,000 +171,360= 1,179,360.\n\nBut 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440. So 5040 * 234 =1,179,360. Then 1,180,800 is 1,179,360 +1,440. \n\nSo 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857... So P=234.2857, which is about 234.29.\n\nSo the minimum price is $234.29 per unit. But since the price must be a whole dollar amount, and the options are given as integers, the next higher integer is 235. But looking at the options, the closest higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the total revenue and costs. Let me recheck.\n\nThe company sells all 420 units each month, so per year, they sell 420*12=5040 units. Each unit is sold at price P, so revenue is 5040 * P.\n\nTotal cost is production cost, which is 420 units/month * $110/unit *12 months. So 420*110=46,200 per month. 46,200 *12= 554,400 per year.\n\nProfit is revenue minus cost: 5040P -554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo 5040P >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo P >= 1,180,800 /5040 = let me compute that again.\n\n1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234: 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*34= 171,360. Total 1,179,360. \n\n1,180,800 - 1,179,360 =1,440.\n\nSo 1,440/5040= 1440 /5040 = 144/504 = 12/42 = 2/7 \u22480.2857.\n\nSo P=234.2857. So $234.29 per unit. \n\nBut the options are in whole numbers. So the minimum price that's higher than 234.29 is 235. But the options don't have 235. So the next option is C)240.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I should check if 234.29 is rounded up to 235, but since 234.29 is approximately 234.3, but in real terms, you can't sell at a fraction. So the minimum price is $235, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest option is 240. So option C is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-calculate 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me compute 5040 * 234.2857=5040*(234 + 2/7)=5040*234 + 5040*(2/7). 5040*(2/7) = 5040/7 *2 = 720 *2=1440. So 5040*234=1,179,360 plus 1440 is 1,180,800. So yes, correct.\n\nSo the price has to be at least $234.2857. So the minimum integer price is $235. But since that's not an option, the next higher option is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check the options again: the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nSo the next possible is 240. So the minimum price is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me compute 5040 *230 and see what the profit would be.\n\nIf P=230:\n\nRevenue =5040 *230= Let's compute 5000*230=1,150,000; 40*230=9,200. So total 1,159,200.\n\nProfit = 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. But the required profit is 626,400. So 604,800 is less than 626,400. So 230 won't do.\n\nSo next, P=235 would give revenue 5040 *235= Let's compute 5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*35=176,400. So 1,008,000 +176,400=1,184,400.\n\nProfit=1,184,400 -554,400= 630,000. Which is above 626,400. So P=235 would give a profit of 630,000, which is enough. But the options don't have 235, so the next possible is 240.\n\nLet's check P=240. Revenue is 5040 *240=5040 *200=1,008,000; 5040*40=201,600. So total 1,209,600.\n\nProfit=1,209,600 -554,400=655,200. Which is well above 626,400. So 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut since the question is the minimum price, perhaps 234.29 is the exact point. But since the options don't have that, the next possible is 240.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nEach month, the company makes 420 units. Let me compute the monthly profit.\n\nMonthly profit = (Selling price per unit * 420) - (Cost per unit *420) = 420*(P - 110).\n\nYearly profit is 12*420*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nSo 12*420*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nCompute 12*420=5040. So 5040*(P-110) >=626,400.\n\nDivide both sides by 5040: (P-110) >=626400/5040.\n\nCompute 626400 /5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62640 /504.\n\nHmm, 504*124= 504*(120+4)=504*120=60,480; 504*4=2,016. So 60,480+2,016=62,496. \n\nWait, 504*124=62,496. But 62,640 is 62,496 +144.\n\nSo 144/504= 0.2857. So 124.2857.\n\nSo P-110 >=124.2857.\n\nSo P >=110 +124.2857= 234.2857, same as before.\n\nSo yes, same result. So minimum P is approximately $234.29.\n\nSo the options are all higher, but the closest higher option is 240, which is option C. So the answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total production cost and revenue for the year.\n\n1. **Monthly Production Cost**:  \n   The company produces 420 units per month at a cost of $110 per unit.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Monthly Production Cost} = 420 \\times 110 = 46,200 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]  \n   Over a year (12 months):  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly Production Cost} = 46,200 \\times 12 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Yearly Revenue**:  \n   The company sells all 420 units each month at a selling price \\( P \\). Over a year, the total number of units sold is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Units Sold per Year} = 420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{units}.\n   \\]  \n   The yearly revenue is then:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly Revenue} = 5040 \\times P.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Yearly Profit**:  \n   Profit is defined as revenue minus production costs. The profit must be at least $626,400:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Yearly Profit} = \\text{Yearly Revenue} - \\text{Yearly Production Cost}.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\[\n   5040P - 554,400 \\geq 626,400.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( P \\)**:  \n   Rearrange the inequality:  \n   \\[\n   5040P \\geq 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800.\n   \\]  \n   Divide through by 5040:  \n   \\[\n   P \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040}.\n   \\]  \n   Simplify the division:  \n   \\[\n   P \\geq 234.2857.\n   \\]  \n   Since the selling price must be a whole dollar amount, the minimum price is $235. However, the options provided are integers, and the closest higher option is $240.\n\n5. **Verification**:  \n   - If \\( P = 230 \\):  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Yearly Revenue} = 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200.\n     \\]  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Yearly Profit} = 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\, \\text{(less than $626,400)}.\n     \\]  \n   - If \\( P = 240 \\):  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Yearly Revenue} = 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600.\n     \\]  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Yearly Profit} = 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{(greater than $626,400)}.\n     \\]  \n\nThus, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the required yearly profit is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component for a company to guarantee a certain yearly profit. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nAlright, the company produces 420 units every month. So, for a year, that's 12 months, right? So, 420 times 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Hmm, 420 * 10 is 4200, and 420*2 is 840, so 4200 + 840 = 5040. So, they produce 5040 units each year.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So, the total production cost per year would be the number of units multiplied by the cost per unit. That's 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So, the total cost per year is $554,400.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs. So, the revenue they need must cover both the costs and the desired profit. Let me denote the selling price per component as 'p'. The revenue is the number of units sold times the price, which is 5040 * p.\n\nSo, profit = revenue - cost. They want profit >= $626,400. So, 5040*p - 554,400 >= 626,400.\n\nLet me rearrange this inequality to solve for p. Adding 554,400 to both sides gives 5040p >= 626,400 + 554,400. Let's add those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. 626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400. Then add 54,400 more: 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. So, 5040p >= 1,180,800.\n\nNow, to find p, I'll divide both sides by 5040. So, p >= 1,180,800 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. Let me see: 5040 goes into 1,180,800 how many times? Hmm, perhaps I can simplify this fraction.\n\nFirst, maybe both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10. That gives 118,080 / 504.\n\nWait, 504 times 234 is? Let me think. 504 * 200 is 100,800. 504 * 34 is 17,136. So, 100,800 + 17,136 = 117,936. Hmm, that's less than 118,080. The difference is 118,080 - 117,936 = 144. So, 504 * 234 = 117,936. Then, 144 / 504 = 0.2857... So, adding that to 234 gives approximately 234.2857.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. 5040 * 234 = ?\n\nWait, 5040 * 200 = 1,008,000. 5040 * 34 = let's see: 5040 * 30 is 151,200; 5040 *4 is 20,160. So 151,200 +20,160 = 171,360. So, 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360. Hmm, but our target is 1,180,800. So, 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440. So, 5040 * x = 1,440. So, x = 1,440 / 5040. Let's compute that: 1440 \u00f7 5040. Both divided by 1440: 1 / (5040/1440) = 1/(3.5) = 2/7 \u22480.2857. So, the total is 234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nWait, so p must be at least approximately 234.29. But the options are in whole dollars. So, the price has to be higher than that. Looking at the options, the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, 234.29 is between 230 and 240. So, the minimum p would have to be 235 to make sure the profit is met. But none of the options are 235. The options are 230, 240, etc. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation when I added 626,400 and 554,400. Let me add them again. 626,400 +554,400. Let's break it down: 600,000 + 500,000 = 1,100,000. 26,400 +54,400 = 80,800. So, total is 1,180,800. So that part is correct.\n\nSo, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me see: 5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f710) \u00f7504 = 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, let's see, 504 * 234 = 117,936. As I did before. Then, 118,080 - 117,936 = 144. So, 144 \u00f7504 = 0.2857. So, 234.2857.\n\nWait, so p must be at least approximately $234.29. But looking at the options, the next higher option is C)240. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the company sells all the components each month. So, the monthly revenue is (price per unit) * 420. The monthly cost is 420 * 110 = 46,200. The profit per month is revenue minus cost, which is (p*420) -46,200. The yearly profit is 12 times that, so 12*(420p -46,200) >= 626,400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it that way instead. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, compute the required monthly profit to reach at least $626,400 yearly. So, 626,400 /12 = 52,200 per month.\n\nSo, each month, the profit must be >=52,200.\n\nProfit per month is (420p) - (420 *110) >=52,200.\n\nSo, 420p -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nAdding 46,200 to both sides: 420p >=52,200 +46,200 = 98,400.\n\nSo, p >= 98,400 /420.\n\nLet me compute that. 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 * 234 is 98,280. Because 420*200=84,000, 420*34=14,280. 84,000+14,280=98,280. So, 98,400 -98,280 =120. 120 /420 = 0.2857. So, p >= 234.2857. Again, approximately 234.29.\n\nSo, the minimum price is about $234.29. But the options don't have this. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the yearly profit. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the company sells all the components by the end of each month. So, they produce 420 per month, so 12*420=5040 per year. The cost is 5040 * 110 =554,400 per year. The revenue is 5040 * p per year. So, profit is 5040p -554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo, 5040p >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo, p >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\n5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f710) \u00f7504 = 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nNow, 504 * 234 is 117,936. So, 504*234 = 117,936. 118,080 is 144 more. So, 144 \u00f7504 = 0.2857. So, total is 234.2857.\n\nSo, p must be at least $234.29. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is 234.30, but the options don't include that. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options, the next higher option after 230 is 240. So, 230 is too low because 230 would give p=230, which is less than 234.29. So, the next possible option is 240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check what the profit would be if p=230, just to be sure.\n\nIf p is 230, then revenue per year is 5040 *230 = ?\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 *30=151,200.\n\nSo, total revenue is 1,008,000 +151,200 = 1,159,200.\n\nSubtract the cost of 554,400: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800.\n\nBut the desired profit is 626,400. So, 604,800 is less than 626,400. So, 230 is too low.\n\nNext option is 240. Let's compute that.\n\n5040 *240 = ?\n\n5040 *200 =1,008,000.\n\n5040 *40=201,600.\n\nTotal: 1,008,000 +201,600 =1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So, 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a price between 234.29 and 240 which is an option, but the options don't have that. So, the minimal price among the options is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps I miscalculated the required p. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n5040 * 234 = ?\n\nWell, 5000 *234 =1,170,000. 40*234=9,360. So total is 1,170,000 +9,360=1,179,360.\n\n1,180,800 minus 1,179,360 is 1,440. So, 1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857. So, p=234.2857.\n\nSo, any price above this will do. So, 235 is the minimum if fractions are allowed, but since the options don't have 235, the next higher option is 240.\n\nSo, the answer must be C)240.\n",

Hmm, 420 * 10 is 4200, and 420*2 is 840, so 4200 + 840 = 5040. So, they produce 5040 units each year.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So, the total production cost per year would be the number of units multiplied by the cost per unit. That's 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 * 10 is 50,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So, the total cost per year is $554,400.\n\nThe company wants a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs.

Let's add those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. 626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400. Then add 54,400 more: 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800.

So that part is correct.\n\nSo, 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me see: 5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f710) \u00f7504 = 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nHmm, let's see, 504 * 234 = 117,936. As I did before. Then, 118,080 - 117,936 = 144. So, 144 \u00f7504 = 0.2857. So, 234.2857.\n\nWait, so p must be at least approximately $234.29. But looking at the options, the next higher option is C)240. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the company sells all the components each month. So, the monthly revenue is (price per unit) * 420. The monthly cost is 420 * 110 = 46,200. The profit per month is revenue minus cost, which is (p*420) -46,200. The yearly profit is 12 times that, so 12*(420p -46,200) >= 626,400.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it that way instead. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, compute the required monthly profit to reach at least $626,400 yearly. So, 626,400 /12 = 52,200 per month.\n\nSo, each month, the profit must be >=52,200.\n\nProfit per month is (420p) - (420 *110) >=52,200.\n\nSo, 420p -46,200 >=52,200.\n\nAdding 46,200 to both sides: 420p >=52,200 +46,200 = 98,400.\n\nSo, p >= 98,400 /420.\n\nLet me compute that. 98,400 \u00f7420.\n\nWell, 420 * 234 is 98,280. Because 420*200=84,000, 420*34=14,280. 84,000+14,280=98,280. So, 98,400 -98,280 =120. 120 /420 = 0.2857. So, p >= 234.2857. Again, approximately 234.29.\n\nSo, the minimum price is about $234.29. But the options don't have this. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the yearly profit. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says the company sells all the components by the end of each month. So, they produce 420 per month, so 12*420=5040 per year. The cost is 5040 * 110 =554,400 per year. The revenue is 5040 * p per year. So, profit is 5040p -554,400 >=626,400.\n\nSo, 5040p >= 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800.\n\nSo, p >= 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nWait, let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040.\n\n5040 is 504 *10, so 1,180,800 \u00f75040 = (1,180,800 \u00f710) \u00f7504 = 118,080 \u00f7504.\n\nNow, 504 * 234 is 117,936. So, 504*234 = 117,936. 118,080 is 144 more. So, 144 \u00f7504 = 0.2857. So, total is 234.2857.\n\nSo, p must be at least $234.29. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is 234.30, but the options don't include that. Hmm.\n\nLooking back at the options, the next higher option after 230 is 240. So, 230 is too low because 230 would give p=230, which is less than 234.29. So, the next possible option is 240, which is higher than 234.29, so that would satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check what the profit would be if p=230, just to be sure.\n\nIf p is 230, then revenue per year is 5040 *230 = ?\n\n5040 *200=1,008,000.\n\n5040 *30=151,200.\n\nSo, total revenue is 1,008,000 +151,200 = 1,159,200.\n\nSubtract the cost of 554,400: 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800.\n\nBut the desired profit is 626,400. So, 604,800 is less than 626,400. So, 230 is too low.\n\nNext option is 240. Let's compute that.\n\n5040 *240 = ?\n\n5040 *200 =1,008,000.\n\n5040 *40=201,600.\n\nTotal: 1,008,000 +201,600 =1,209,600.\n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200.\n\nWhich is more than 626,400. So, 240 is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a price between 234.29 and 240 which is an option, but the options don't have that. So, the minimal price among the options is 240, which is option C.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps I miscalculated the required p. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n5040 * 234 = ?\n\nWell, 5000 *234 =1,170,000. 40*234=9,360. So total is 1,170,000 +9,360=1,179,360.\n\n1,180,800 minus 1,179,360 is 1,440. So, 1,440 \u00f75040 = 0.2857. So, p=234.2857.\n\nSo, any price above this will do. So, 235 is the minimum if fractions are allowed, but since the options don't have 235, the next higher option is 240.\n\nSo, the answer must be C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total number of components produced annually. The company produces 420 components per month, so over 12 months, the total production is:\n\n\\[\n420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\, \\text{components}.\n\\]\n\nThe production cost per component is $110, so the total annual production cost is:\n\n\\[\n5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe company's annual revenue is the selling price per component (\\(p\\)) multiplied by the total number of components sold:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 5040 \\times p.\n\\]\n\nThe profit is calculated as revenue minus production costs, and the company requires a profit of at least $626,400. Thus, the inequality for profit is:\n\n\\[\n5040p - 554,400 \\geq 626,400.\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\n5040p \\geq 626,400 + 554,400,\n\\]\n\\[\n5040p \\geq 1,180,800,\n\\]\n\\[\np \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040}.\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\np \\geq 234.2857.\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price must be a whole number, the minimum price per component is approximately $235. However, the options provided are $226, $230, $240, $260, and $280. Among these, the smallest value greater than $234.2857 is $240.\n\nTo verify, if \\(p = 240\\), the annual revenue is:\n\n\\[\n5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\, \\text{dollars}.\n\\]\n\nThe annual profit is:\n\n\\[\n1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\, \\text{dollars},\n\\]\n\nwhich exceeds the required profit of $626,400. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $240.\n\nAnswer: C",
