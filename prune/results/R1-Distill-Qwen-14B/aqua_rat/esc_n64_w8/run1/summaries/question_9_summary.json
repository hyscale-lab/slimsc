      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe question says that there are 200 students in a school. At least 45% attended the prom night, and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using some principles like inclusion-exclusion. Let me think. We have two groups: those who went to the prom and those who debated. We need to find the maximum number of students who didn't go to either, which would mean minimizing the number of students who went to at least one of the two events.\n\nWait, right. To maximize the number of students who neither attended prom nor debated, we need the smallest possible number of students who attended at least one of the events. Because the total is 200, so the more people who didn't attend either, the fewer attended at least one.\n\nSo, the number of students who attended prom is at least 45% of 200. Let me calculate that. 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90. So, at least 90 students went to prom.\n\nSimilarly, the number who debated is at least 35% of 200. 35% is 0.35 * 200 = 70. So at least 70 students debated.\n\nNow, if we add the minimum attendees, 90 + 70 = 160. But wait, that's the sum of two sets. But some students might have been in both. So, the maximum possible overlap would reduce the total number of unique students who attended at least one event.\n\nWait, but to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event, we want as much overlap as possible between the two groups. Because if a student attended both, they're counted in both the prom and debate numbers, but only once in the total attendees.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap would be the minimum of the two individual minimums. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The maximum number of students who could have gone to both would be the smaller of the two groups. Because you can't have more overlap than the size of the smaller group.\n\nWait, so if 90 students went to prom and 70 to debate, the maximum overlap is 70. Because all 70 debaters could also have been at the prom. So in that case, the total number of unique students who attended either event would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. So that's the minimum number of students who attended at least one event.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. If 70 students are in both, then the number who went to prom is 90, which includes the 70 from both. Similarly, the 70 debaters are all included in the 90. So the total unique is 90. That makes sense.\n\nSo the total number of students who attended at least one event is at least 90. Wait, but wait. If the 70 in the debate are entirely within the 90 prom attendees, then yes, the total is 90.\n\nBut wait, is that possible? Because the minimum number of prom attendees is 90, and the minimum for debate is 70. So if all 70 debaters were also prom attendees, then the total unique would be 90, which is the sum minus the overlap.\n\nSo, the minimum number of students who attended either event is 90. Therefore, the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate would be 200 minus 90, which is 110.\n\nWait, but that's one of the options, E)110. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Because maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Because 200 students in total. If 90 attended at least one event, then 200 - 90 = 110 didn't attend either. But wait, is this correct? Because the problem says \"at least 45% attended prom\" and \"at least 35% debated\". So the minimum numbers are 90 and 70. But if all 70 are in the 90, then the total is 90. So that gives 110 as the maximum for neither.\n\nBut looking at the options, E is 110. So that's the answer? But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the maximum number who neither attended prom nor debated is equal to the total minus the minimum number who attended at least one. So if the minimum number who attended at least one is 90, then 200 - 90 = 110.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about the constraints again. The problem says at least 45% attended prom, so 90 is the minimum number. Similarly, at least 70 debated. So the minimal number of attendees is 90, but wait, how can that be? Because 90 is the minimum for prom, but the debate could have more.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing it. Let me model it using sets. Let A be the set of prom attendees, and B be the set of debaters. We know that |A| \u2265 90 and |B| \u226570. We need to find the maximum possible |neither|, which is 200 - |A \u222a B|.\n\nTo maximize |neither|, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|. The minimal |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. But to minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize |A \u2229 B|, the overlap.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible overlap? The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlap than the size of the smaller set.\n\nSo in this case, |A| is at least 90, and |B| is at least 70. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is 70, because |B| is 70. Because if all 70 debaters were also prom attendees, then |A \u2229 B|=70. So then |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|.\n\nBut |A| is at least 90, but could be larger. Wait, but to minimize |A \u222a B|, we should take the minimal possible |A| and |B|, right? Because if |A| is larger, then |A \u222a B| would be larger. So to get the minimal |A \u222a B|, we take |A|=90, |B|=70, and |A \u2229 B|=70.\n\nSo then |A \u222a B|=90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo the minimal |A \u222a B| is 90. So the maximum |neither| is 200-90=110.\n\nSo the answer would be E)110. But wait, looking at the options, E is 110. But I'm a bit confused because 110 seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended prom nor debated? That would occur when the number of students who attended at least one event is as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest possible number attending at least one event is when the two groups are as overlapping as possible. So the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since |B|=70). So if all 70 debaters were among the 90 prom attendees, then the total unique attendees are 90. So 200 -90 =110. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is E)110.\n",

Let me calculate that. 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So, at least 90 students went to the prom. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So, at least 70 students debated.\n\nWait, the question is about finding the maximum number who neither attended the prom nor debated. To maximize this number, I guess I need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. Because the more students are in either event, the fewer are left outside.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of students in at least one event? Oh, right, using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is:\n\nNumber in A or B = Number in A + Number in B - Number in both A and B.\n\nBut to find the minimal number in A or B, I need to maximize the overlap between A and B. Because when the overlap is as big as possible, adding A and B doesn't increase the total as much, thus minimizing the number in either event.\n\nSo, the maximum possible overlap would be when as many as possible of the debating students also went to the prom. What's the maximum possible overlap? Well, the smaller group is the debating group, which is 70. So, all 70 could have been among the 90 who attended the prom.\n\nSo, the minimal number of students in either prom or debate is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Because if all 70 are included in the 90, then the total is 90. So, the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. That leaves 200 - 90 = 110 students who didn't attend either. But wait, the options don't have 110 as a possible maximum. Wait, looking back, option E is 110. But wait, that's the number of students who did neither. But the question is about the maximum number, so that would imply 110 is possible. But let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. So, the minimal number attending either event is when the overlap is maximum. So, the maximum overlap is the size of the smaller set, which is 70. So, the number attending either is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. So, 90 students attended at least one event. So, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 = 110. But wait, that's one of the options, option E. But wait, is this the maximum possible?\n\nWait, no, because if the overlap is less than 70, then the number attending either would be higher. Wait, no, wait. To minimize the number attending either, you want as much overlap as possible. So, the maximum possible overlap is when all the debating participants are in the prom attendees. So, the minimal number attending either is 90. So, 200 -90 = 110 is the maximum number who could have neither.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 110 as the first option. Let me look again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. Oh, E is 110. So that's the maximum number possible. But wait, wait a second, the problem says 'at least 45% attended the prom' and 'at least 35% debated'. So, the numbers are minimums. So, the actual number attending prom could be more than 90, and the number debating more than 70. But for maximum neither, we need the minimal number attending either, which occurs when the number attending prom is exactly 90 and debating exactly 70, and all 70 are within the 90.\n\nSo, in that case, 90 +70 -70=90, so 200-90=110.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the number of prom attendees is higher than 90, say 100, and the number of debaters is 70, but all 70 are in the 100, then the number attending either is 100, so neither is 100. Which is less than 110. So, the maximum is when the numbers are exactly at the minimum required.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110. But wait, that's option E.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Wait, 200 students. At least 45% (90) went to prom. At least 35% (70) debated. So, the minimal number who went to prom is 90, and minimal who debated is 70. To find the maximum number who did neither, we need the minimal number who went to either.\n\nSo, the minimal number in either is when the overlap is maximum. So, the maximum possible overlap is 70, since you can't have more overlapping than the smaller group.\n\nSo, minimal in either is 90 +70 -70 =90. So, 200 -90 =110.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number who neither is 110, which is option E. So, the answer should be E) 110.\n",

What's the maximum possible overlap? Well, the smaller group is the debating group, which is 70. So, all 70 could have been among the 90 who attended the prom.\n\nSo, the minimal number of students in either prom or debate is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Because if all 70 are included in the 90, then the total is 90. So, the number of students who attended at least one event is 90. That leaves 200 - 90 = 110 students who didn't attend either. But wait, the options don't have 110 as a possible maximum. Wait, looking back, option E is 110. But wait, that's the number of students who did neither. But the question is about the maximum number, so that would imply 110 is possible. But let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. So, the minimal number attending either event is when the overlap is maximum. So, the maximum overlap is the size of the smaller set, which is 70. So, the number attending either is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. So, 90 students attended at least one event. So, the number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 = 110. But wait, that's one of the options, option E. But wait, is this the maximum possible?\n\nWait, no, because if the overlap is less than 70, then the number attending either would be higher. Wait, no, wait. To minimize the number attending either, you want as much overlap as possible. So, the maximum possible overlap is when all the debating participants are in the prom attendees. So, the minimal number attending either is 90. So, 200 -90 = 110 is the maximum number who could have neither.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 110 as the first option. Let me look again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. Oh, E is 110. So that's the maximum number possible. But wait, wait a second, the problem says 'at least 45% attended the prom' and 'at least 35% debated'. So, the numbers are minimums. So, the actual number attending prom could be more than 90, and the number debating more than 70. But for maximum neither, we need the minimal number attending either, which occurs when the number attending prom is exactly 90 and debating exactly 70, and all 70 are within the 90.\n\nSo, in that case, 90 +70 -70=90, so 200-90=110.\n\nBut wait, another thought: if the number of prom attendees is higher than 90, say 100, and the number of debaters is 70, but all 70 are in the 100, then the number attending either is 100, so neither is 100. Which is less than 110. So, the maximum is when the numbers are exactly at the minimum required.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110. But wait, that's option E.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. Wait, 200 students. At least 45% (90) went to prom. At least 35% (70) debated. So, the minimal number who went to prom is 90, and minimal who debated is 70. To find the maximum number who did neither, we need the minimal number who went to either.\n\nSo, the minimal number in either is when the overlap is maximum. So, the maximum possible overlap is 70, since you can't have more overlapping than the smaller group.\n\nSo, minimal in either is 90 +70 -70 =90. So, 200 -90 =110.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number who neither is 110, which is option E. So, the answer should be E) 110.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we start by analyzing the given data. There are 200 students in total. At least 45% attended the prom, which corresponds to \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\) students. Similarly, at least 35% participated in the debating session, corresponding to \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\) students. \n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who attended at least one event is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number in prom or debate} = \\text{Number in prom} + \\text{Number in debate} - \\text{Number in both}.\n\\]\n\nTo minimize the number of students in at least one event, we maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum possible overlap is the size of the smaller group, which is 70 (the number of students who debated). Thus, all 70 students who debated could also have attended the prom. Substituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number in prom or debate} = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\\]\n\nThis means that at most 90 students attended at least one of the events. Therefore, the number of students who neither attended the prom nor debated is:\n\n\\[\n200 - 90 = 110.\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is **110**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Then, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 35% of 200 is 70 students. So, 70 or more attended the debate.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. So, that's the number of students outside both events. Let's denote that as N.\n\nWait, I remember something about sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The maximum number of students who didn't attend either would be when the number of students who attended either event is as small as possible.

The problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\", meaning 90 or more.

Let's calculate that. 45% is 0.45, so 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 students attended the prom.\n\nSimilarly, 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.

So I think this means we're looking for the largest possible number of students outside both events.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize the number of students who did at least one of the two events (prom or debate). Because if fewer students went to prom or debate, then more couldn't have gone to either.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that at least 45% went to prom and at least 35% debated. So these are minimums. That means the number of students who went to prom could be higher than 90, same for debate. But to find the maximum number who did neither, we should consider the minimal numbers for those who attended each event, right? Because if more attended, that would leave fewer outside.\n\nWait, no. Wait, to maximize the neither group, we need the number of students in either prom or debate (or both) to be as small as possible.

So the minimum number of students in either prom or debate is 90.\n\nWait, but wait. Because |A| is at least 90, |B| at least 70. So the maximum possible overlap is 70.

If the overlap is as large as possible, the union is as small as possible, which allows for the maximum number of students who did neither.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model it with the maximum possible number not attending either, which is 200 minus the minimum number attending at least one.\n\nSo, the minimal number attending at least one is 90, so 200-90=110. So that's the maximum number who could have neither.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)110.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we analyze the given data:\n\n- Total number of students: **200**.\n- At least **45%** attended the prom night: \\( 0.45 \\times 200 = 90 \\) students.\n- At least **35%** participated in the debating session: \\( 0.35 \\times 200 = 70 \\) students.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who did neither, we minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( |A| \\geq 90 \\) (prom attendees) and \\( |B| \\geq 70 \\) (debate attendees). The overlap \\( |A \\cap B| \\) is maximized when as many students as possible attended both events.

Substituting:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90\n\\]\n\nThus, the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is **90**. The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate is:\n\n\\[\n200 - 90 = 110\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer: E**",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe question says: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n\nHmm. So we're trying to find the maximum number of students who didn't go to the prom and didn't participate in the debate. I remember from set theory that to find the number of students not in either set, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But wait, the question is about maximum, so maybe I need to consider the minimum overlaps between the two groups.\n\nLet me break it down. There are 200 students in total. At least 45% attended prom, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So 90 students went to prom. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debating session. 0.35 * 200 is 70 students. So 70 students were in the debate.\n\nNow, the problem is about the maximum number who neither attended prom nor the debate. That means we want as many students as possible not to be in either group. To maximize the number of students who did neither, we need to minimize the number of students who did either. But wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem states that at least 45% and at least 35% participated in each activity. So the number of students in each activity is the minimum possible. So the actual number of students who went to prom could be more than 90, same for the debate. But since we're looking for the maximum number who did neither, we want to find the scenario where as few students as possible are in either group.\n\nWait, no, I think I got that backwards. Because if we have as many as possible in both, then fewer would be in only one, but how does that affect the total?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the maximum possible number of students who did neither by considering the minimum number in each activity. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So the number of students in either A or B is equal to the sum of those in A and those in B minus those in both.\n\nBut since we want the maximum number of students who did neither, that's the total minus the union. So, maximum neither = 200 - |A \u222a B|.\n\nTo maximize neither, we need to minimize |A \u222a B|. So how small can |A \u222a B| be?\n\nBecause |A| is at least 90, and |B| is at least 70. The smallest possible |A \u222a B| occurs when the overlap between A and B is as large as possible. Because the larger the intersection, the smaller the union.\n\nWait, that's right. So to minimize the union, maximize the intersection. So the maximum possible overlap is when all of B is within A, but in this case, since B is 70 and A is 90, that's possible. So if all 70 in B are also in A, then the union would be just 90, since A is 90. But wait, that's not the case because A is 90, which includes all of B (70) plus 20 more.\n\nWait, no, wait. If all 70 in B are also in A, then |A \u222a B| is 90, because A is 90. So the union is 90. Then, the number who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, that can't be right because 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"at least\" 45% and 35%. So the number attending prom is >=90, and the number in debate >=70.\n\nWait, so if the number of prom attendees is 90, and the number of debaters is 70, and all debaters are among the prom attendees, then the union is 90. So the number of students who did neither is 200-90=110. But that's only possible if the number of debaters is exactly 70, and all are within the 90 prom attendees.\n\nBut wait, can the number of debaters be more than 70? Because it's at least 70. So if the number of debaters is higher, say 80, then the maximum overlap would be 90 (since A is 90). So the union would be 90 + (80 - 90) = 80. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think.\n\nWait, if A is 90, and B is 80, what's the maximum possible overlap? It can't exceed the size of A or B. So maximum overlap is the minimum of A and B. So if A is 90, B is 80, maximum overlap is 80. So union is 90 + 80 - 80 = 90. So the union remains 90. So even if B is bigger, the union can't go below 90. So the maximum number who did neither is 110.\n\nWait, but what if B is exactly 70, and all are in A? Then union is 90. If B is 70, and 70 are in A, and the rest of A (20) are not in B, then the union is 90. So the number who did neither is 110.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that at least 35% took part in debate. So 70 is the minimum. If more than 70 took part, say 80, then the maximum possible overlap would be 80, but A is 90, so the union would be 90 +80 -80 =90. So union is 90 regardless of B's size as long as B's size is <=90.\n\nWait, but if B is larger than 90, say 100, then the maximum overlap is 90 (size of A). So union is 90 +100 -90 =100. So in that case, union is 100, so neither would be 200 -100=100. But since B is at least 70, but can be as high as 200, but wait, that's not correct because the maximum number of students in B is 200, but in reality, the number in B can't exceed 200.\n\nWait, but in the scenario where the number of students in B is 200, then all students are in B, so the union is 200, and neither is zero. But that's the minimal neither. But we're looking for maximum neither, so that scenario is not useful.\n\nSo, to get maximum neither, we need the minimal union, which happens when the overlap is as large as possible.\n\nSo the minimal union is |A| + |B| - (minimum possible union). Wait, no, the minimal union is when |A \u222a B| is as small as possible. So the minimal possible union is max(|A|, |B|). Because if all of B is inside A, then the union is just |A|. So if |A| >= |B|, then the minimal union is |A|.\n\nIn our case, |A| is 90 (at least 90), |B| is 70 (at least 70). So the minimal possible union is 90, when all 70 of B are in A.\n\nSo the maximum number of students who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, wait. The problem says \"at least 45% attended prom night.\" So the number of prom attendees is >=90. Similarly, the number of debaters is >=70. So, if the number of prom attendees is more than 90, say 100, and the number of debaters is 70, but all 70 are within the 100, then the union is 100, and neither would be 100. But that's less than 110.\n\nWait, but if the number of prom attendees is exactly 90, and the number of debaters is exactly 70, and all debaters are in prom attendees, then the union is 90, and neither is 110. So that's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but what if the number of prom attendees is 90 and the number of debaters is 70, but not all debaters are in prom. Then the union would be larger, which would reduce the number of students who did neither. So to maximize the neither, we need the minimal union, which is when B is entirely within A.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who did neither is 110, which is option E. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 110.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The question says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\". So the number attending prom could be more than 90, and the number in debate could be more than 70. But to maximize the neither, we need to have as few students as possible in either event. So the minimal union occurs when the two sets overlap as much as possible.\n\nSo if we have the minimal possible union, which is 90 (since A is 90 and B is 70, and B can fit entirely into A), then the number of neither is 200-90=110. So the maximum possible is 110, so the answer is E.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option E is 110. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think of another approach. Let me use the formula for maximum neither.\n\nThe maximum number who did neither is equal to the total minus the sum of the minimums plus the maximum possible overlap. Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, the maximum number who did neither is given by N - (A + B - overlap). To maximize this, we need to maximize the overlap.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who did neither is N - A - B + overlap. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula for the union is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So the union is as small as possible when |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|. Because you can't have more overlap than the size of the smaller set.\n\nIn our case, |A| is at least 90, |B| is at least 70. So the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is 70, because |B| is 70. So, when |A| is 90 and |B| is 70, the maximum overlap is 70.\n\nSo, the minimal union is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo, the minimal possible union is 90, so maximum neither is 200 -90=110.\n\nSo yes, the answer is E)110.\n",

The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, I remember this is a problem about sets and percentages. I think it's related to the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me think. So, the goal is to find the maximum number of students who are in neither event, which means we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nWait, but how do we do that? I think we need to consider the minimum number of students attending each event. Because if more students attend, fewer can be left out. So, to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we should assume the minimum number attended each event, but making sure that the overlap between the two is as large as possible. Because if the two events have a lot of students in common, then the total number attending at least one is smaller than if they were completely separate.\n\nLet me break it down. First, calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 attended prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70 students. So, at least 70 took part in the debate.\n\nNow, to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need the minimum number who attended at least one of the events.

So, the minimum number attending at least one event would be when |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible, because that would subtract the most from the sum of |A| and |B|.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible overlap? Well, the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| can't be more than the smaller of |A| and |B|. Here, |A| is 90, |B| is 70. So, the maximum possible overlap is 70. That would mean all 70 debate participants also went to the prom. So, the total number attending either event would be 90 + 70 -70 = 90. So, 90 students attended at least one event.\n\nBut wait, that's the minimum number of students who attended at least one. Because if the overlap is maximum, the union is as small as possible. So, the total number attending at least one is 90.\n\nSo, the number of students who neither attended prom nor debate would be total students minus those who attended at least one. So 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, that's one of the options, option E. But that seems high. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, wait. If 90 attended prom, and 70 attended debate, and the maximum overlap is 70, then the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. So 90 students attended either or both. So, 200-90=110. That's E.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the maximum number of students who neither attended. So, the maximum number would be when the union is as small as possible. So, yes, when the overlap is maximum. So, that would be 110. But looking at the options, E is 110. So why isn't that the answer?\n\nWait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake. Because the problem states \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So, the minimums are 90 and 70. But if more than that attended, then the union could be larger. But we're looking for the maximum number who didn't attend either, which would occur when the union is as small as possible.\n\nWait, so the minimal possible union is when the overlap is as big as possible. So, that's when all the debate participants are included in the prom attendees. So, 90 +70 -70=90. So, 90 students went to at least one event. So, 200-90=110 students didn't attend either.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let's say the prom had exactly 90 attendees, and the debate had exactly 70, but all 70 were from the 90. Then, the union is 90. So, 110 students are left. But if the prom had more than 90, say 100, and the debate had 70, but only 70 were overlapping, then the union would be 100 +70-70=100. So, 200-100=100, which is less than 110. So, in that case, the number of students who didn't attend either would be 100, which is less than 110. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, the union must be as small as possible, which is 90.\n\nSo, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended prom nor debate is 110. But wait, looking at the options, E is 110. So why is the option C)90 and D)99 in the list? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the percentages. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nTotal students: 200.\n\nAt least 45% attended prom: 45% of 200 is 90, so 90 is the minimum number attending prom. At least 35% attended debate: 35% of 200 is 70, so 70 is the minimum number attending debate.\n\nThe maximum possible overlap is 70, because the debate group can't exceed the size of the prom group if we're maximizing the overlap. So, the minimum number in the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. So, 200-90=110.\n\nBut wait, 110 is option E. So, the answer should be E.\n\nBut wait, let me see the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA)27\nB)81\nC)90\nD)99\nE)110\n\nSo, E is 110. So, why is this the case? Because when the overlap is maximum, the union is minimized, so the number of students who didn't attend either is maximized.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait a minute. Let me think again. The problem says \"at least\" 45% attended the prom, and \"at least\" 35% the debate. So, the number of prom attendees is at least 90, and debate attendees at least 70.\n\nTo find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nThe minimal number attending at least one is when the two groups overlap as much as possible.\n\nSo, the minimal possible |A \u222a B| is |A| + |B| - |Total|, but that's not correct. Wait, no. The minimal |A \u222a B| occurs when |A \u2229 B| is as large as possible. So, the maximum possible |A \u2229 B| is the minimum of |A| and |B|.\n\nHere, |A| is 90, |B| is 70. So, maximum |A \u2229 B| is 70. So, the minimal |A \u222a B| is 90 +70 -70 =90.\n\nSo, 200 -90=110. So, the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is 110. So, E is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but why is 90 one of the options? Oh, because 90 is the number of students who attended prom. So, perhaps someone might think that if 90 attended prom, 70 debate, and 90 is the maximum possible union, but that's not correct. Because the union is 90, not 90 plus 70.\n\nHmm, I think I'm confident now. The answer should be E)110.\n",

The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nHmm, I remember this is a problem about sets and percentages. I think it's related to the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me think. So, the goal is to find the maximum number of students who are in neither event, which means we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events.\n\nWait, but how do we do that? I think we need to consider the minimum number of students attending each event. Because if more students attend, fewer can be left out. So, to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we should assume the minimum number attended each event, but making sure that the overlap between the two is as large as possible. Because if the two events have a lot of students in common, then the total number attending at least one is smaller than if they were completely separate.\n\nLet me break it down. First, calculate the minimum number of students who attended the prom. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, at least 90 attended prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70 students.

So, I think I can approach this using set theory or maybe some principles of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall what I know. \n\nFirst, let's break down the given information. The total number of students is 200. \n\nAt least 45% attended the prom. 45% of 200 is 90 students. So, the number of students who went to the prom is at least 90. Similarly, at least 35% took part in the debate. 35% of 200 is 70, so at least 70 students were in the debate.\n\nWe're looking for the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate. That would be the complement of the union of the two sets (prom attendees and debate participants). So, the formula I remember is:\n\nNumber neither = Total - (Number in Prom + Number in Debate - Number in both Prom and Debate)\n\nBut since we're trying to maximize the number neither, we need to minimize the number in the union of Prom and Debate. To minimize the union, we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups\u2014so as many students as possible are in both Prom and Debate.\n\nWait, right. Because if more students are in both, then fewer are in either, leaving more who are in neither. So, to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we want the overlap between Prom and Debate to be as large as possible.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible overlap? The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the smaller of the two individual group sizes. Since Prom has at least 90 and Debate has at least 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since 70 is the smaller number). But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because Prom has at least 90, but could have more. Similarly, Debate has at least 70. But for maximum overlap, we can assume that all Debate participants are also Prom attendees. That way, the overlap is exactly the number of Debate participants, which is 70. So, the total number in either Prom or Debate would be Prom (90) + Debate (70) - overlap (70) = 90. So, the union is 90.\n\nBut wait, that might not be possible because if Prom has more than 90, the overlap could be larger. Hmm, but since we're trying to find the minimal possible union (to maximize neither), perhaps we should take the minimal possible numbers for Prom and Debate, but maximum overlap.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The problem says \"at least 45%\" and \"at least 35%\", which means Prom could be 90 or more, and Debate could be 70 or more.\n\nTo maximize the number of students who neither attended prom nor debate, we want as few students as possible to have attended either event. So, we need the minimal possible number in the union of Prom and Debate.\n\nThe minimal possible union occurs when the overlap is as large as possible. So, the maximum possible overlap is the minimum of the two individual numbers. So, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since 70 is less than 90). So, the union would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. If Prom has 90 and Debate has 70, the maximum overlap is 70, so the union is 90. So the number of students who attended either is 90. So, the number who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110. But looking at the options, E is 110. But wait, wait a second.\n\nWait, no, wait. Because maybe Prom can have more than 90, but to minimize the union, we should take the minimal possible Prom and Debate numbers. Because if Prom is larger, the union might be larger too. So, to get the minimal possible union, we should take the minimal Prom and minimal Debate numbers, and maximum overlap.\n\nSo, Prom is 90, Debate is 70. Max overlap is 70. So union is 90.\n\nThus, the number of students who didn't attend either is 200 -90=110. But 110 is one of the options, option E.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the minimal number in the union is Prom + Debate - total. To minimize the union, we can't have the union less than the maximum of Prom and Debate. Because, for example, if Prom is 90 and Debate is 70, the union can't be less than 90, because Prom alone is 90. So the minimal possible union is 90.\n\nSo, 200 -90=110.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Another way: the minimal number of students in the union is the maximum of the two individual numbers, because the other set could be entirely within the first. So, if Prom is 90, and all 70 Debate participants are also in Prom, the union is 90. So the union is 90, so 200 -90=110.\n\nSo, that would be the maximum number of students who neither attended prom nor debate. So the answer would be 110, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Are there any constraints that I'm missing? Like, can the number of students in both events be more than 70? No, because the number in Debate is at least 70. So, if all 70 are in Prom, that's the maximum overlap. So, that's allowed.\n\nWait, but if the number in both is more than 70, that would require the number in Debate to be more than 70, but the problem states that at least 35% (70) took part. So, if more than 70 were in both, then the total in Debate would have to be more than 70. But the problem says at least 70, so that's allowed.\n\nWait, but in that case, the maximum possible overlap would be when the number in both is as large as possible. So, what's the maximum possible number in both?\n\nThe maximum possible number in both is the minimum of Prom and Debate. Since Prom is at least 90, and Debate is at least 70, the maximum overlap is 70 (if Prom is exactly 90 and Debate exactly 70). Because if Prom is larger than 90, say 100, then the overlap could be up to 70, but that would still make the union 90+70 -70=90. Alternatively, if Prom is 90, and Debate is 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70.\n\nWait, but another approach: the maximum possible number of students in both is the minimum of the two individual numbers. So, the maximum overlap is 70. Therefore, the minimal possible union is 90. So, the maximum number of students who neither is 200-90=110.\n\nSo, the answer should be E)110.\n\nBut wait, let's check the options. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the maximum number who could have neither. So, 110 is the maximum possible. So, option E is correct.\n\nBut wait, another thought. What if Prom is more than 90? Let's say Prom is 100. Then, if all 70 in Debate are also in Prom, the union is 100. So, 200-100=100. That's less than 110, so that's worse for us because we want the maximum number of neither. So, to maximize neither, we need the union to be as small as possible. So, to get the smallest possible union, Prom and Debate should have as much overlap as possible, but their own sizes should be as small as possible.\n\nSo, the minimal Prom is 90, minimal Debate is 70, maximum overlap is 70. So, union is 90. So, 200-90=110.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the maximum number of students who could have neither is 110. So, the answer is E.\n",
